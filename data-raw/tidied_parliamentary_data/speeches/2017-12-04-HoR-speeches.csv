Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (10:03):  Today I present the 18th report of the Petitions Committee for the 45th Parliament, together with 58 petitions and 13 ministerial responses to petitions previously presented.


This report includes 18 petitions requesting action on climate change and 12 requesting reform for online gambling. These are two well-coordinated and passionate national campaigns seeking the ear of local members on matters of concern to them. The committee is impressed with the level of coordination and community engagement that these campaigns have achieved. As a result of this hard work, these petitions continue to engage members and the communities they represent.


There are 28 other petitions in this report on a diverse range of matters. A total of 19,444 people have signed these petitions. That's a fantastic level of engagement with the parliament that we are seeing come from our local communities.


In keeping with the high engagement in our petitions process, I will take the opportunity to report on a single e-petition that has closed for signatures in this past week, with 48,985 signatures. This is by far the largest e-petition to date, and it's a clear indication that our e-petitions system is working as intended.


Nonetheless, the committee is still looking at ways to improve the system. We are wrapping up our inquiry into the e-petitions system this week by talking to a group of primary school students, by video link, who have recently been engaged in petitioning the House. The committee looks forward to receiving a fresh perspective from these students, and we are excited about their interest in the petitioning process.


I will continue to provide updates to the House on the work of the Petitions Committee and the inquiry into e-petitions.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (10:05):  by leave—I move:


That this House require all Members to provide statements in relation to citizenship in the following terms:



Members
'
 statements in relation to citizenship



(1) By not later than 9 am, 5 December 2017 (and otherwise within 21 days of making and subscribing an oath or affirmation as a Member of the House of Representatives) each Member shall provide to the Registrar of Members' Interests a statement containing the following:


(a) a declaration by the Member that, at the time the Member nominated for election to the House of Representatives in this 45th Parliament, he or she was an Australian citizen;


(b) a declaration that the Member is not a citizen of any country other than Australia;


(c) a declaration stating:


   (i) the place and date of the Member's birth;


   (ii) the citizenship that the Member held at the time of birth; and


   (iii) if he or she did not obtain Australian citizenship at birth, the date he or she was naturalised as an Australian citizen;


(d) so far as the Member is aware the place and date of birth of the Member's parents, grandparents and spouse (if applicable);


(e) whether the Member has ever been a citizen of another country and, if so, which country or countries;


(f) what steps the Member has taken to assure him or herself that the Member has not acquired citizenship of another country by descent, marriage or other means;


(g) if the Member has answered the question in (e) in the affirmative, details and evidence of the date and manner in which the Member's citizenship of that other country was renounced (if it was renounced) and/or the date and manner in which it came to an end in accordance with the laws of that other country;


(h) if the Member's citizenship of that other country had not come to an end at the date of his or her nomination for the House of Representatives, details and evidence of any steps the Member has taken to renounce the citizenship of that other country prior to the date of nomination; and


   (i) if the Member has declared that he or she was at the time of nomination or is now a citizen of a country other than Australia, on what basis the Member contends that he or she is, nonetheless, not disqualified under section 44(i) of the Constitution.


(2) if at any time the Member becomes aware that information provided in the statement is no longer accurate he or she shall update the statement as soon as practicable but by no later than 21 days of being so aware;



Committee of Privileges and Members
'
 Interests



(3) Statements shall be made in accordance with this resolution and in a form determined by the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. The Registrar shall, in accordance with procedures determined by the committee, maintain a Citizenship Register comprising statements provided under this resolution. Other than as specifically provided for in this resolution, the committee has the same powers and functions in relation to the citizenship register as it does in relation to the Register of Members' Interests.



Citizenship Register published on website



(4) The Registrar shall, upon the expiry of the time for providing statements under this resolution, and at other times determined by the committee, publish the register and any alterations or additions to the register on the Parliament's website.



False statements or omissions regarded as contempt



(5) Any Member who:


(a) knowingly fails to provide the statement required by this resolution to the Registrar of Members' Interests by the due date; or


(b) knowingly fails to correct an inaccuracy in his or her statement within the required timeframe; or


(c) knowingly provides false or misleading information to the Registrar of Members' Interests;


shall be guilty of a serious contempt of the House of Representatives and shall be dealt with by the House accordingly; a question of whether any Member has committed such a serious contempt shall first be referred to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests for inquiry and report.



Referrals to the Court of Disputed Returns



(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders or any other resolution, referral of a Member to the Court of Disputed Returns may be moved without notice by a Minister or the Manager of Opposition Business.


I won't delay the House at great length debating the citizenship register. It's been well and truly debated in the public domain, and today is not the day for debates about the referral of members of the House to the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. But I will explain the elements of the motion to the House. The first clause of the motion establishes a register of citizenship, asks members to make statements in relation to their citizenship and requires them to do so once the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests has finalised the terms of a form which I understand has been written and circulated. The Privileges Committee will make a decision about that directly after this debate, and then the form will be circulated to all members to be returned to the clerks by 9 am tomorrow morning, so 9 am Tuesday, 5 December.


We have been working through the terms of this register and this motion with the opposition and with the crossbenches, and we settled on nine o'clock on Tuesday morning because we made, I think, the fair assumption that most members by now will have checked out their citizenship and any steps they might have taken to renounce citizenship of another country, and we want to give the Speaker and the clerks ample time to be able to get that information up onto the internet to enable people who are interested to examine the evidence as presented by members and then to give us ample time in the House of Representatives this week to refer any members to the High Court if that is in fact necessary. In the case of at least three members, the government believes it will be necessary, but that's not a debate we have to make today.


So members will be asked to make a declaration concerning their citizenship. They'll be asked to provide evidence of their parents', grandparents' and spouses', if applicable, citizenship. If it's found in any of those cases that there is a reason why they may be a dual citizen of another country, what steps did they take to renounce that citizenship and when was it so renounced?


The second aspect of the motion places it under the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests, which, of course, is where the Register of Interests is held by the House, and gives the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interest the power over this particular aspect of the standing orders. The next aspect shows when the citizenship register will be published on the website. We haven't put a hard time on the publication on the website, out of courtesy, really, to the clerks and to the Speaker's office, where we felt that potentially it would be difficult to meet a particular deadline, but I think we're all fully understanding and cognisant of the need to get that information out into the public domain as quickly as possible. I'm sure there'll be no delays in trying to do that, but we didn't put a hard time for that to happen.


Element 5 is that, of course, false statements or deliberate omissions will be regarded as a contempt of the parliament and the necessary sanctions would be applied after a reference to the Privileges Committee of anyone who does give false information in the register and that the referrals to the Court of Disputed Returns would not only be able to be made by a minister but also by the Manager of Opposition Business in the House. Clearly, that is a departure from the current standing orders, but the view has been taken that, of course, a majority is required to refer any member to the Court of Disputed Returns in any event. We have been working with the opposition on the register of citizenship because I think it's in all of our interests to ensure that everybody sitting in the House is legitimately elected, and, of course, the government has taken its steps. We had a by-election in New England which we spectacularly won on the weekend. We had a spectacular win on Saturday, a record-breaking win—the biggest win for a government in a by-election, by the way, since 1911.



A government member:  The swing was bigger than the Labor vote.




Mr PYNE:
  The swing was bigger than the Labor vote, as the Deputy Leader of the House points out. And we will have a by-election in Bennelong, as you referred to this morning, Mr Speaker. We have done the right thing on this side of the House, but I think it's in everyone's interests to be sure that everyone sitting in the parliament is legitimately sitting here, and that's why we move this motion. I look forward to the support of the opposition and the crossbenches.

"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (10:10):  I mentioned publicly over the weekend that I was planning to move a number of amendments to this motion when it was moved. I hate to disappoint, but the amendments I was going to move are now already part of the motion, so Labor will simply be supporting the motion that's before us. The change to having the deadline moved to 9 am Tuesday is of critical importance. It guarantees that there is time for the register to be up and for it to be public, and it is early enough for members to engage in proper scrutiny of whatever the register brings forward. I urge all members on both sides, once the form is made available, to get the information in as quickly as possible and not to use the deadline as the start time, for the very simple reason that that would take a lot of pressure off the clerks and off the Speaker's office in the work that they have to do. And it guarantees that we will get closer to a 24-hour turnaround for the information to be able to become public, which is in everybody's interests.


I also note that the concept which there's been much discussion about over the last 24 hours, about whether only a minister would be able to move a motion of referral, has now been rectified, and it now can also be moved by the Manager of Opposition Business—a job held by me. I say to the crossbench: if there are referrals of any kind that they would seek, I am certainly very happy to have those conversations if the crossbench wish something like that to take place.


I thank the government for the way this has worked its way through. There have been times in the public debate when it probably hasn't been ideal. I was bemused, after the Leader of the Opposition had called for this and the government then came forward and said they'd do it, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs said Labor had finally relented to the government's position. It is true: we were dragged to agreeing with our own position, and we thank the government for those glorious comments which were made. But the opposition, given that we have now got to a sensible position, will be supporting this motion.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that the motion moved by the Leader of the House be agreed to.


Question agreed to.

Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt) (10:13):  I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Mr Speaker, as I'm sure you are well aware, I've been a long-time advocate for changes in this area and initially I found the journey to be very lonely, but it was something that I was absolutely determined to do. In 2004, when the parliament changed the definition of 'marriage' to exclude LGBTI Australians, I stood in the Liberal party room and questioned the decision. I didn't understand why we needed to do this. Hadn't LGBTI Australians been through enough? Why did we have to kick them on the way out the door? To me, it didn't make any sense. Denying any Australian equal status and the same level of dignity is in my mind completely un-Australian.


For me it was really quite simple. I don't understand how one section of our community should be treated any differently to any other. Life is tough enough and sometimes very hard, and if you're lucky enough to find someone to join you in the good and the bad, well, in my mind it's fantastic. I strongly believe that couples seeking wedlock are strengthening the institution of marriage. 


There has been a lot of commentary about the length of my advocacy and some very flattering remarks. In the media, I was labelled a 'fiercely heterosexual Far North Queensland crocodile-and bull-catching Liberal'.


However, the 12 or 13 years I have been raising this issue and seeking to remove legal and financial discrimination within the gay and transgender community, and also advocating for the right to marry for same-sex couples, has been relatively short compared to those Australians who have had to endure these inequalities for their entire life.


In 2007, I worked tirelessly to remove the financial and legal discrimination that gay and lesbian Australians faced.


In 2010, I came back from retirement because I felt that I had unfinished business. I hope that some of that business can be dealt with this week, because a clear majority of Australians back this because they believe in a fair go. They are sick of politicians playing games with real people and real lives.


In endorsing this legislation, I would like to dedicate my advocacy to a number of very special people who have come forward, shared their life stories with me and helped to reinforce my commitment to why these changes are so necessary.


The first person I'd like to dedicate this to is Alana—and Alana: you know who you are. When my interest in dealing with discrimination in the same-sex community was first reported in the mid-2000s, there were a number of news articles that focused on the motives behind my advocacy. One, by Glenn Milne, ran: 'MP Warren Entsch tells why he supports gay rights. ""How my mate became a woman.""' While I didn't actually participate in that interview, he clearly made assumptions and had an interesting description of me, and made reference to the friendship that I'd made many years before when I was living in western Queensland. Imagine my surprise when I received an email. I'd like to quote comments from that email:


I was humbled to hear your/our story in today's Sunday Mail.


Later in the email Alana states:


For the sake of those families that differ in composition to the Prime Minister's ideal I hope you are successful in your campaign. As you and I know, there is absolutely no family in the country that can assume it will be immune to having a child/grandchild/relative that is gay or transgender. There was certainly never a straighter family/community than the one I was born into. Hopefully, these families would then want that person to have the same rights in their relationships that other Australian's take for granted. In closing—


she said—


I will just give you an update on my life since we last saw each other. I went back to school and university, graduating from medicine at The University of Melbourne and am now working as a doctor in Victoria.


A great success. I have to say, Alana, it was very inspirational and moving for me, and many times when I felt pretty lonely on this journey in this place I would often pull out your email and read it, and that reinforced my commitment to what I was doing. I say thank you to Alana.


I'd like to also acknowledge two others, possibly the oldest gay couple in Australia, according to media reports—John Challis and Arthur Cheeseman. John was another of those who reached out to me in the early days to share his story with me. John and Arthur have been together for more than 50 years in a totally committed relationship. They reinforced the question in my mind—why shouldn't two people who have shared a life together in a strong and committed relationship have the right to choose how they express their commitment to each other? I want to thank John and Arthur for sharing their story and inspiring me, and I dedicate my advocacy to you both. I understand that wedding plans are on the way, possibly in January. John, you actually look like you're going to be married before your 90th birthday! My heartfelt congratulations to you both.


Finally, I dedicate my advocacy to another very special person, Kate Doak. Kate came to me as a journalist trying to understand my advocacy in this arena and over an extended period of time in my office she eventually shared with me her own personal story, a story that I had the privilege of being the first person to hear. Subsequently, both myself and my staff—in particular, Heather Beck in my office—have been there for Kate. I thank you, Kate, for your inspiration and again I dedicate my advocacy to you.


I'd also like to mention Rodney Croome and David Scammell. When the media articles first appeared about my advocacy, I received many responses from family and friends of the gay community saying they wanted to come out and support me as well. But Rodney Croome and David Scammell travelled to Canberra, sat down with me, and, for the first time in my life, provided me with an insight into the inequalities and discrimination that gay people faced. I thank them for the opportunity, because without their contribution I may never have been aware of the issues and I may not have started on this journey.


I'm not going to go into the technicalities of the bill, other than to say there has been a huge amount of effort put into it. The bill, which the Senate passed, is a robust bill. A whole range of religious protections are already in place. As Senator Dean Smith said when he was tabling it: this bill reflects the most fundamental liberal and conservative values which our party stands for: 'liberal' because it delivers freedoms for couples to marry and 'conservative' because it strengthens the social fabric and the vital institution of marriage. This bill is about marriage and only about marriage. Nothing in this bill takes away existing rights or freedoms; it doesn't create different classes of marriage. What it does is give same-sex couples the same legal rights as other couples.


We have made sure that we have removed any element of discrimination in this bill while ensuring that religious freedoms are protected. LGBTI couples will be free to marry the person that they love in a civil marriage; the freedom of ministers of religion and religious marriage celebrants to only perform religious marriages in accordance with their religious beliefs remains unchanged. There may be amendments proposed on free speech, discrimination law, education, charity law, tax law. These are all worthy causes and important debates, but they don't need to form part of this bill today. Australians are sick of excuses and they're sick of delays. The majority of Australians voted yes on same-sex couples being able to marry in front of friends and family who love them in this country that they call home. They did not vote for a new form of discrimination. Amendments about unrelated issues, amendments that seek to delay same-sex marriage for the 61.6 per cent of Australians who made their preferences clear or amendments that seek to unwind or remove any legal rights or discrimination protections will be opposed. Australians did not vote for fairness and equality only to see other legal protections peeled away in this bill.


I announced my intention to introduce a bill back in 2015, but, unfortunately, that didn't occur because of decisions that were made to commit the coalition to a plebiscite. I didn't agree with the plebiscite and I was disappointed that I didn't have the opportunity to introduce my bill to the floor of the parliament. However, rather than focusing on the process, I did everything I could to focus on an outcome. That plebiscite was taken to the 2016 election. It was during this period that there were a number of very special individuals who entered the parliament, providing an opportunity for us to work as a collective determined to get a vote on marriage equality in the 45th Parliament. I would like to acknowledge my good friend and colleague here beside me Trent Zimmerman. The last time I wore this rainbow tie was at Trent's maiden speech. He's the member for North Sydney. In front of me here I've got Tim Wilson, the member for Goldstein. And of course fellow Queenslander Trevor Evans, the member for Brisbane, is also here—all kindred spirits in this advocacy. Together we committed ourselves to making sure same-sex marriage was on the agenda and that we'd have the opportunity to vote for it in this place.


Special mention to my friend Senator Dean Smith, who was a member of the Senate Select Committee on the Exposure Draft of the Marriage Amendment (Same-Sex Marriage Bill). He did outstanding work in incorporating the findings of the consenting report from the committee into the bill that we are now debating, which has already passed the Senate. I have to say I was not happy with the postal survey, and I expressed that view, but I have to congratulate Peter Dutton for this initiative. When he approached me, I suggested to him that it would never work, and I honestly didn't think it would.


However, there's always—always!—a benefit in hindsight. It probably was the best thing that we did in so much as the participation rate was extraordinary: almost 80 per cent of registered Australian voters, and the fact we got a vote of almost 62 per cent shows that an absolute majority of Australians have come along with us on this journey. It certainly provides us with the opportunity to celebrate inclusion and diversity, and is one of the biggest political mandates in the history of our nation.


While there were great celebrations in Australia, when the result came through I was in New York. Let me assure you that this result wasn't just celebrated in Australia: it was celebrated around the world. I remember driving home after a function in lower Manhattan not long after the results were announced and seeing the Empire State Building lit up in rainbow colours to acknowledge this historic event.


I'd like to acknowledge the team from the Equality Campaign who've been invaluable in their assistance. I value their support and their friendship. They are Alex Greenwich, Tom Snow, Anna Brown, Janine Middleton, Tiernan Brady, Clint McGilvray, Lee Carnie, Corey Irlam and, last but not least, Claire Dawson. There were so many others, too numerous to mention, who made the 'yes' campaign such a success: I thank them for that.


In this place we all come here to make a difference, and we do in so many ways through our electorate work and in assisting national policy. However, it is rare that we have the opportunity to make a change such as we have achieved through this legislation and the profound, positive impact it will have on so many lives, not only those within the same-sex community but also on their family and their friends. We have a responsibility to the Australian people this week: we must do what we believe is right. Who is it to say that another person should be denied equal rights or that their love is in some way lesser because of who they love? This bill will take from no-one; it simply makes our nation a kinder and a fairer place.


Delaying equality for every Australian, whether they be from Bundaberg or Fremantle, simply is not good enough. At the end of day, life is too short: we must vote on this and get on with it. I know that there are many weddings planned in the near future, once this legislation is carried through. I wish all of those brides and all of those grooms the very, very best in their marriage in the future.


Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately.




The SPEAKER:  Is the motion seconded?

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech
"Evans, Trevor, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr EVANS
 (Brisbane) (10:27): It is with pride and joy that I second the motion. I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. On 15 November 2017, just past 10 am local time, celebration erupted on the streets of Brisbane as the Australian Statistician announced that the vast majority of Australians had said yes to allowing same-sex couples to marry. At a large gathering in Queen's Park in the CBD, and in cafes and workplaces across Brisbane, people clapped and cheered. They hugged complete strangers, and people cried with a mixture of relief and joy. My partner, Roger, and I shared in that emotion. The 'yes' vote in Brisbane was almost 80 per cent. It was 79.5 per cent, meaning that Brisbane recorded the highest support of any government seat across the country except for the Prime Minister's seat of Wentworth.


When the Statistician was giving his speech that day he also announced in passing that the ABS later that day would be releasing Australia's labour force statistics. Now, it is thought provoking to imagine a nation tuning in and erupting with the same level of celebration at the release of our employment statistics. They were pretty good job figures after all! But that comparison does reveal the importance of the postal survey results and the significance of marriage equality to so many Australians. It underlines the responsibility that this parliament now has in front of it to respect the clear will of the Australian people by passing this bill this week in a business-like fashion.


That comparison between the postal survey and other statistical releases reveals another serious point: that in the hustle and bustle of life there's possibly too few occasions when Australia stops and pays attention to the operations, the decisions and the news of government. When a national moment like this occurs, there are lessons to be learned for those of us who ponder things like the operation of our democracy, policy-making processes and concepts of good governance.


Why did it take so long for this reform to be achieved when public opinion had shown that the majority of Australians have supported marriage equality for almost a decade?


What precedent did the postal survey set for our parliamentary democracy? And what has the postal survey taught us about how Australians can engage with each other and our parliament?


I wouldn't be the first to observe that reform has been difficult for Australia in this decade. About a year ago, I was on my feet here speaking of my sadness and disappointment that yet another Australian parliament looked set to fail to achieve marriage equality. Despite these years of national debate, this government's plebiscite bill was actually the first time in history there was a government-endorsed bill sitting on that table in front of me. We were the first government ever elected with a mandate containing a path to achieving marriage equality, and we had our Prime Minister—the first in Australia to be consistently in favour of it. And yet, despite all those firsts, that bill was headed for defeat by the usual blockade in the Senate. And those who voted against it had no plan for what would happen next. Essentially, they were content to run the risk that this reform would stall for a long time—possibly, for many years. And of course that was after some of them had done nothing to achieve marriage equality when they had their chance in government. Now, history, not I, will be the judge of that.


As for me, I'm proud to stand up here today and say that I've played a small role in ending the stalemate on same-sex marriage. It was a path that contained some risks, and, for their strength and their courage on this topic, I want to pay tribute to some of my colleagues: to Senator Dean Smith; to the member for Goldstein, Tim Wilson; to the member for North Sydney, Trent Zimmerman; the member for La Trobe, Jason Wood; and to the irrepressible and legendary member for Leichhardt, fellow Queenslander Warren Entsch.


Those members I just named and I didn't come to this place to focus on same-sex marriage. I came here with a background in small business, with experience in economics and industry, to focus on many of the other important challenges and opportunities that lie ahead of us today. But sometimes one could have been forgiven for thinking otherwise. I can't count the number of times that news stories introduced me as 'the gay MP' before even referring to my seat or my party or my achievements or other attributes.


It's true that this topic does have a deeply personal aspect and I feel very, very strongly about it. But this isn't about me, and it's not about any of us in this parliament. This is about a million other people out there around Australia. For them, we have just created a national watershed moment. Every person out there who might have been questioning themselves or their value, or feeling isolated, lonely and vulnerable, knows now, without any doubt, that the majority of Australians support them and they want them to be equal. Equally, any person out there who might be inclined in the future to say something hurtful or offensive or derogatory to someone in the gay community also now knows that a majority of Australians do not support those views. That's what this means. Australia has just said yes to the inherent worth of every human being who shares our wide brown land. So every Australian who completed their postal survey, and all of us voting here, should know that their vote has contributed and is contributing to a national watershed moment. In this moment, our votes probably do more to beat stigma, homophobia and vulnerability in our society than any rally or any debate we could possibly have contributed to. That's the power of a vote.


I want to specifically thank all Australians—and, in particular, the people of Brisbane—for their strong support of this process. I couldn't be more humbled by or grateful for the support of Brisbane.


It's important to note—and it's a point I want to make very strongly—that the postal survey result was so comprehensive because Liberals and Nationals around the country voted yes. I've always maintained confidence that Australians would be responsible about exercising their freedom. And that faith in Australians was rewarded. I believe it's one of the salient lessons about our democracy to draw from this process. The vast majority of Australians wanted to have their say, clearly, yet it was a subject that only directly impacted a minority, and the majority of Australians wished to express their support for them. Almost all Australians did express their support. They engaged in debates and they discussed the topic of marriage in their workplaces and in their homes freely and constructively. And it was only a very small and atypical minority who didn't appreciate that their freedom of speech came with responsibilities and who crossed some lines with their individual conduct.


Our free speech doesn't force you to listen to other people or force other people to listen to you or agree with you. Freedom of speech isn't a shield from criticism and it's not a shield from other views. Reasonable people can disagree. And in this debate the power of liberal democracy and the disinfecting nature of transparency have proved once again their enduring strength.


Also, very importantly, democracy doesn't mean that we always get what we want. It means that we respect the result. I profess to holding mixed views about the process of the postal survey, yet I must admit that it surprised me along the way, and credit must be given to the ABS and to the Acting Special Minister of State, Mathias Cormann, for their management of the process. Many fears were not realised, and the result was beyond question. And I do look forward to a future opportunity to outline my thoughts on how a plebiscite or a postal process might sit alongside our parliamentary democratic traditions. I note Menzies's eloquent words on his views on parliamentary democracy in some of his less-well-read speeches that he gave in the 'forgotten people' series. In particular I think it's important for all of us to reflect on how such a mechanism might be used sparingly and in exceptional circumstances only into the future.


I want to make the point that thousands of young people around Australia enrolled to vote for the first time because of this postal survey. This was their first brush with democracy, and for some of them it might have been a confronting lesson. Yet I hope some younger people who haven't witnessed much of the alternative approaches to democracy around the world have had cause to pause and reflect about what this episode can teach us. It may have been a frustrating process for the time and the context that we find ourselves in, yet it was a process that unquestionably landed with the right outcome. I want to make a point for those young people who are growing up in a world where self-gratification is instant and we have iPhones, social media and credit cards to buy the latest fashion trends. Democracy is slow. Reform is sometimes frustrating. Democracy is a messy process. And yet, if you involve yourself in the process of democracy, as you have in this process, our democracy will be a stronger one.


This is a good bill, and I was pleased to contribute to its drafting alongside some of my colleagues and its principal architect, Senator Dean Smith. My signature has been on this bill since it was circulated to colleagues back in early August. This is a bill that started with an exposure draft prepared by our Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, last year. It faithfully implements the findings of a Senate review and the unanimous findings by senators right across the political spectrum following the consultation they performed with the input and the agreement of a long list of religious and community organisations across Australia. This is a bill that finds a good balance between the need to protect important religious freedoms and still implement the clear will of the Australian people to change the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples to marry.


This bill contains specific protections for religious organisations. It contains protections for individual ministers of religion even if they're acting outside the tenets of their organised religion. It contains protections for civil celebrants; for chaplains; and for businesses, organisations and other bodies if they're set up predominantly for a religious purpose. I accept that not all religious organisations agree with this bill and neither do all the gay advocacy groups, but this bill does have the blessing of many of the religious organisations and gay advocacy groups that are capable of reaching agreement on this matter. This bill has that support because it does not open any new forms of discrimination and, equally, it does not remove any religious freedoms or protections.


In conclusion, it's with pride, joy and love that I second this motion. It's a good bill. It strikes a good balance. And it enjoys wide support across our community. Now that the Brisbane community and the broader Australian community have voiced their strong support for same-sex marriage, it's time for us in this parliament to do our bit this week in a businesslike fashion.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that this bill be now read a second time. Manager of Opposition Business, is leave granted to continue the debate?

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (10:40):  Mr Speaker, leave is granted. Looking at the speakers list, we have in the order of 15 hours of debate ahead of us. There is an offer from the opposition to agree to additional sitting times—if at any point it is the wish of the House—in particular for tomorrow night, so we can finish the second reading debate speeches and vote on the second reading on Wednesday morning. And, secondly, the opposition is also willing to offer for speeches to be shortened to 10 minutes, rather than 15, to make sure we can get this legislation through this week. So that's put there as an offer. I've got a suspension of standing orders motion; it would be silly to move it now. Hopefully, we can reach accommodation within the chamber to make sure that we do get this done.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (10:41):  Today we have a straightforward task, and it is a great privilege. With this legislation, with our voices and our votes, we will make marriage equality a reality in Australia. This is a chance for our parliament to demonstrate that we are worthy of the people we serve. It's a chance to honour the courage of LBGTIQ Australians, to recognise their rights and to celebrate their love. It's a chance to atone for the inaction and failures of the past. After years of discrimination, disappointment and delay, it's a chance to write into law a truth that we know in our hearts: marriage is defined by love and loyalty, not gender.


And whilst this final legal change depends on the overdue vote of our parliament, today is not actually about the parliamentarians. For me, today is about the teenager in the country town who stood in front of his footy club and asked his teammates to support him for the person that he's always been. Today is about an office worker in the city who challenged her colleagues to put aside their old thoughtless prejudices and respect her right to equality. Today is about tens of thousands of loving same-sex couples who prove every day that they're wonderful parents and they're raising great kids. Today belongs to all the LBGTIQ Australians who have borne the burden of the long battle for equality—some of whom could deservedly be described as proud warriors who remember when their very existence was considered to be a criminal offence but always knew it was the law that needed to change, not their love.


The labour movement was born believing there can be no progress without struggle. The labour movement believes that equality is both natural and fundamental. But we understand that equality is never inevitable. To Australians for Marriage Equality, to all of the advocacy groups and campaigners, to the union movement and to the corporate leaders, to everyday Australians who live in the suburbs and in the country towns who knocked on doors, made phone calls, had conversations, rallied support, raised awareness and played their part in driving this overdue change, we say thank you. In particular, I want to acknowledge young Australians. Young Australians sometimes don't get the credit they deserve in our public discourse. Hundreds of thousands of young people corrected their enrolment addresses or enrolled. They spoke to their parents and their grandparents. When we vote for this bill, and when it is successful, we should recognise that young Australians have shown Australia the sort of nation we want to see in the mirror—a generous, inclusive and tolerant Australia. For that, our young Australians are demonstrating that they very much deserve to have the best future possible because they are gifting it to all of us.


In particular, though, I salute LGBTIQ Australians for all that you have done and for all that you have endured. Despite the strong polls and the confident predictions, I know that, on the eve of this survey result and in the morning when they woke up, many were consumed by anxiety—and it wasn't just the prospect of a 'no' vote and it wasn't the unpleasantness of features of the campaign; it was something deeper. I cannot imagine what it is like to submit your relationships and your identity to an opinion poll of strangers across the country. For many of my friends, they all of a sudden had to question how welcome they were in their own society. It was a reminder and a reawakening of old fears: the dread of coming out and being shunned by friends and family who just didn't get it, and the fear of being rejected, targeted and humiliated because of something as basic and natural and human as who you are and who you love. Even at the wonderful celebrations that Chloe and I attended in Lygon Street on the night of the 'yes' result, I spoke to so many couples whose joy was matched by relief. You saw the weight come off their shoulders. Unfortunately, the bitter truth of hard experience has taught the LGBTIQ community to sometimes have to expect the worst.


What a glorious day it was when the people of Australia did not let their friends and their families and their neighbours down. And now, the parliament will not let you down. I think this is an uplifting moment in our nation, but we need to be mindful to match our joy with our humility—the humility to acknowledge that, for too long on marriage equality, Australia has trailed the world and, for too long, this parliament has trailed the people of Australia; and the humility to seek forgiveness from LGBTIQ Australians. The forgiveness I speak of is for the long delay and for the injustices and the indignities, both great and small; forgiveness for subjecting you and your relationships to public judgement; and forgiveness for the hurt and harm that you and your families have suffered. We seek your forgiveness. We salute your courage. We thank you for including us in your historic moment.


Let me be clear, for me in voting for marriage equality, the campaigners for marriage equality have not just delivered equality for them; they have actually made the Australian identity better. The gift of this legislation is not just in allowing people to get married. The gift of this legislation is that it says that Australia can be a better place, a more inclusive place. To all those LGBTIQ Australians who found themselves in subsequent days examining the result, seeing it as some kind of reflection on them in percentage terms, let me declare this: you are not 61 per cent anything. You are 100 per cent equal, you are 100 per cent loved and you are 100 per cent right to live your life the way you want, and we are lucky to count each and every one of you as our fellow Australians.


This legislation will bear Senator Smith's signature, and that is a worthy tribute to his patience and hard work down the years. To his Liberal and conservative colleagues who stood up to be counted, you know who you are and you know the value of what you did and have accomplished. There are, of course, many members of all parties who fought long and hard for this change. From our side, I acknowledge the member for Sydney, Senator Louise Pratt, the member for Grayndler and the member for Whitlam, whose marriage equality legislation I was proud to be one of 42 in the House of Representatives to vote for in 2012. And I look forward to that number being far higher on this occasion.


I want to acknowledge all my colleagues who have offered me counsel on this question as leader. I'm proud of the decisions that we've made together. I'm proud we went to the last election promising a free vote within 100 days. I'm proud that we opposed the principle of a plebiscite, the idea of a lawmaking process for LGBTI Australians separate to all other Australians. And I'm proud of how energetically and effectively our party and our movement campaigned for the 'yes' case.


But in particular today I want to pay special tribute to Senator Penny Wong. Penny, yours has often been a lonely road and a hard road. It's the merging of the personal and political in ways that some of us who vote here will never have to contemplate. But I do know this: in 2011, your advocacy, along with others', changed our platform. And, whilst you're too modest to say it yourself, in years to come Sophie will be able to tell your children about the time that their mum helped change Australia.


Many more will make valuable contributions to this debate. I did want to address briefly religious freedom. The Labor Party believes in religious freedom. We understand it is central to our democracy and our society. It is a most important issue and one that we must all treat with respect. Australia is a remarkable country full of decent and generous people of good conscience drawn from all faiths and none. And the greatness of our nation is that every person is free to be proud of what they believe. We recognise that, for Australians of faith, religion is a base to build upon in public life even if it is also a destination for contemplation, solace and sustenance in private life. In our society, under our laws, whether we be Christians, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists or atheists, we're all Australians and we're all equal—first, last and always equal under the law.


Respect for sincerely held views of people of faith and respect for the rights of religious institutions to practice according to their own tenets is proper. And it is right and proper for the parliament to take the time to consider what protections are required as a separate question to this legislation. We look forward to the recommendations put forward by Philip Ruddock's panel and we will consider them carefully in the new year.


And it is also important to note that nothing in this legislation limits the right of any person to lawfully worship, practice or observe, or teach according to their religion. This bill is about extending equality, not reducing liberty, because enhancing the rights of one group of people does not diminish the freedoms of another. Fairness is not a finite resource. Equality has never been a zero-sum game.


The whole history of Australia tells us the truth of this. Every time this nation expanded the definition of the fair go, we have all gained from its deeper meaning. Every time we have enlarged the circle of Australian fairness, we've all gained new allies in our national success and the telling of the Australian story. Every time we have faced the failures of our past, it has helped us build a better future. It is why marriage equality is not the trading away of our traditions; it is about living up to them. It is not about breaking with our values; it's building upon them. This law is not the end of the ancient institution of marriage; it is a new beginning for a more equal world.


I hope and imagine that, in a generation to come, Australians will look back to these days and this debate and most will wonder: what was the fuss all about? My children will attend the weddings of their friends and not give a moment's thought to whether they are gay or straight, whether it's in a church or a park. All that will matter is: does the couple love each other and want to spend the rest of their lives together? All that will matter is that they are people like us: our friends, our neighbours, our family members, our loved ones, our fellow Australians. This moment of this debate this week belongs to all those who have waited. This moment belongs to all those who have fought. It belongs to all those who did not live to see their dream realised. It belongs to all those who have felt that the inequality in the law has meant that they are unequal in our eyes. We have come too late to this moment, but we are here at last.


Today is an outstanding day. When we vote on this bill, it will be an outstanding moment. It will be, I predict, an uplifting moment. So it is with joy, with humility, with privilege, with love for our brothers and sisters and with hope in our future that I commend this bill to the House.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (10:56):  It is with great pleasure and a real sense of history that I rise to speak today. In 1999, when speaking in support of the superannuation entitlements bill of the member for Grayndler, I described that law as a law which:


… does not provide for special rights for gay and lesbian couples. It provides universal rights, equal rights, for those people.


And so is the case today. The bill before us is about universal rights, about human rights and about an inclusive and a fair Australia. During the 2004 debate, when the Howard government rushed through laws amending the Marriage Act, I said:


Some time in the not too distant future, people will look back on this desperate attempt at wedge politics and treat it with the contempt it deserves. Some time in the not too distant future, there will be formal recognition of same-sex couples, and the sky will not fall in, and we will not be destroyed … and life will continue. The main difference will be fewer violent or abusive attacks on gay men and lesbians, and fewer teenagers suiciding, because they will not be taught to feel shame about their sexuality as many are now.


How privileged I am, how proud I am, to be able to stand today and speak in support of this bill. My regret is that it has taken so many years to get here.


I wish that debate on a bill like this could have happened without an unnecessary, divisive and expensive postal survey. But Australians proved themselves better, braver and more decent than their government, and worlds away from the hate and the fear that was being pushed by some elements of the 'no' campaign. I wish that the Prime Minister had assisted in bringing this bill to the parliament without putting Australia through the expense and division of this survey. It required his leadership and the courage of his convictions, but these were sadly missing. Instead of the debate happening here, as it should've, it was pushed into, shoved into, lounge rooms across Australia, where children were asking their parents for support, for basic acknowledgement, and some parents were saying no. I don't know if any of us can imagine, really, what a hard thing it is to hear that from your own parents—that they wouldn't be voting to recognise you and your relationship. That could've been avoided if the debate had happened in here, as it is now.


I wish this parliament had done its job and legislated earlier. I'm proud of the fact that I was one of those 42 who voted in favour of the Jones bill in 2012. And I'm sorry it has taken until 2017 for this law to be in this place with the likelihood that it will pass this week. I'm sorry for all the pain that the LGBTIQ community has faced in having themselves and their relationships debated in this way in recent months—in having their relationships put on trial. But love won in the end, and the opponents of marriage equality could not defeat it.


The democratic tradition runs deep in our country. Even though many disagreed, as I did, with this postal survey, the democratic impulses of our people were strong, and about 80 per cent of voters turned out. And they overwhelmingly voted yes.


My electorate of Sydney shared the highest yes response in the country, with 83.7 per cent of my electorate voting yes. It's not surprising: in many ways, my electorate is the cultural heart of LGBTIQ Australia. It has a long history of activism and political engagement that emerged around Oxford Street, Darlinghurst and Kings Cross. While there are LGBTIQ Australians in every community, in every city, in every suburb and in every town right across Australia, so many have chosen to make their home in my electorate. It is a tolerant, safe, welcoming and diverse community and I'm proud to say that I've got two very special constituents here with me today, Izzy Perko and Collin Lyon, who exemplify for me this sort of activism and relationship. Izzy and Collin have been together for decades and just want to be treated like everybody else in my community—allowed to marry legally and share their commitment with their friends and family.


Earlier this year, after a detailed inquiry, a Senate committee agreed on draft marriage equality legislation. This legislation was backed by Labor, the Liberals, the Nationals, the Nick Xenophon Team and the Greens. This is the consensus bill that is before us today. It's very simple. Firstly, it allows same-sex couples to marry. Secondly, it protects religious freedom by allowing clergy and a new category of religious celebrants to choose who they will and will not marry. It isn't complicated and I'm disappointed that some are seeking to make it complicated. There is talk by the Prime Minister and others of substantive amendments to this bill on the grounds of protecting religious freedoms. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, Labor is absolutely committed to religious freedoms. We are absolutely supportive of Australians having the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of their religious practice or observance in this country.


But I would say to those people who are concerned that there is no attack on freedom of religion in this bill. Indeed, the bill strengthens religious protections; it does not weaken them. Of course, we have no difficulty with further discussion about religious protections—indeed, about protection of human rights right across the spectrum of human rights, including religious freedom—but that is best done next year, noting that the government's newly established panel, led by the Hon. Philip Ruddock, is yet to report. I'd also say that, just as there are those who are concerned that religious protections don't go far enough in this bill, there are others who are concerned that they go too far. This shows that this bill hits the right balance. There are some concerned that there shouldn't be a new category of religious celebrants, for example. So there is a time to discuss these issues of religious freedom, but we shouldn't complicate the bill that's before us today, which has already achieved a cross-party consensus.


There are so many people whose work needs to be acknowledged in the long fight for this next step in equality for LGBTIQ Australians. Of course, most of the big steps forward have occurred over the years under Labor governments, from Bill Hayden leading the charge on decriminalisation of homosexuality to Don Dunstan being the first Premier to legalise homosexuality 42 years ago; from Neville Wran banning discrimination on the grounds of sexuality to Kevin Rudd's government legislating to remove discrimination against same-sex couples from 85 federal laws in areas as diverse as tax, veterans affairs, social security and health.


I want to acknowledge the member for Maribyrnong and our Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who has pursued this issue as a priority and committed Labor to legislating for marriage equality within the first 100 days of a Shorten Labor government. I thank all of my colleagues who've been long-time advocates for LGBTI Australians and for marriage equality: my friend Senator Penny Wong, of course; my friend Senator Louise Pratt; the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Isaacs; the shadow minister for equality, the member for Griffith; the member for Grayndler, my neighbour in inner-city Sydney and a long-time ally of the LGBTIQ community in this place; my state colleague Penny Sharpe MLC; and of course those opposite. We've worked so cooperatively in recent times. Senator Dean Smith, I know that this has taken a personal toll on you, and I'm proud to be able to congratulate you today for your leadership. For those opposite who have spoken today and will speak later in this debate, I know that it is a brave thing to do to stand up in the face of not overwhelming support from your own side. It's gutsy, and it's appreciated.


I want to acknowledge Rainbow Labor. Rainbow Labor is a group of ordinary members of the Labor Party who have put their faith and their trust in Labor and have said that they know it will be Labor who can deliver on their aspirations. They have campaigned so hard for this win, and they have been part of changing history. I also want to acknowledge the many other campaigners who've devoted years of their lives to the pursuit of equality: all of those involved with the AME campaign—Anna Brown, Tom Snow, Brooke Horne, Alex Greenwich, Janine Middleton, Tim Gartrell, Paddy Batchelor and many, many more; the community groups who have been fighting for this equality for years, including the Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby, Twenty10, ACON, Wear it Purple, Community Action Against Homophobia, Inner City Legal Centre, Rainbow Families and so many, many others; and the union movement, who, once again in our nation's history, swung behind the fight for equality. I can tell you it makes such a difference having the human resources of those unions backing a campaign like this—people out on the streets early in the morning and late at night, phoning, door knocking, standing at train stations and convincing their colleagues, their friends and their family members to vote yes. Individuals like Magda Szubanski, Kerryn Phelps and Jackie Stricker-Phelps, Rodney Croome, Father Frank Brennan—so many have stood up and joined their voices to the chorus of calls for equality. Every person, every individual, who has had a difficult conversation with a friend or a family member or a complete strange at a train station in the morning, at a bus stop or during a door knock—this really would not have happened without this massive mobilisation of ordinary Australians committed to equality.


I know that many people over the course of this debate have actually changed their minds. They started out thinking that this wasn't an important issue or that marriage equality would somehow change our society in a bad way. Over the years, they've listened to their friends or family members or colleagues, and they've changed their minds. It takes a lot of bravery to change your mind. It takes intellectual openness and emotional openness to change your mind. It's a really big thing to do, and I particularly thank those people today.


There are so many people for whom this change means so much. I know the reason they stood up to speak out was not just for their own personal benefit but to help make the sort of country they want to live in. People like Eddie Blewett and his mums, Neroli Dickson and Claire Blewett, from Tathra on the New South Wales South Coast. Eddie is only 14 years old, but he is one of the bravest kids you could ever meet. It takes real guts for families like his, rainbow families, to have made this case and in the public eye. I think of the young Indigenous woman in Armidale who quietly took me aside when I was there last year to let me know the struggle she faces every day and to urge me not to give up. I say to her today, 'I didn't, and I'll never give up.' I think about the teenage boy I met in Bathurst this year who told me how hard it was to come out in the country town if your friends and family aren't supportive. I think about the teenagers I met at headspace in Sunshine, Melbourne, who told me how many young people were suffering because they were being made to feel second rate by their government. This change would not have been possible without the trailblazers in the community. This is a victory for my friends in Elizabeth Bay John Challis, 89, and Arthur Cheeseman, 85, who have fought for 50 years to have their relationship recognised and who will marry in January. Arthur said recently of seeing marriage equality become a reality:


It gives us a new dignity, a new status, a new place in society. We are the same as everyone else.


This is a victory for the 78ers who marched down Oxford Street into a wall of police brutality in the pursuit of equality. It is their struggle that this parliament honours today by passing this legislation.


I want to send a very special message to those people for whom this has been a decades-long struggle, people who lost relationships, lost connection with family and lost their jobs because they took a stand all those years ago. Important issues like this capture the public's imagination because they go to something fundamental within us: the kind of society that we want for each other and for our kids—fairer, kinder, less judgemental and more accepting, a society in which we live and let live and in which we recognise that love makes a marriage and love makes a family.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (11:11):  Today is a historic day. It is a day that this parliament is given a choice to end centuries of marginalisation of some Australians and make them full citizens for the first time. It is a day when we can choose to reaffirm the voluntary bond of marriage for the 21st century and encourage the commitment it provides to take individuals to form families as the foundation for community and nationhood. It is the day in this place when my party properly returns to its traditions and allows a free vote on a matter of conscience.


I will be supporting the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, and I do so wholly acknowledging that the bill is not my first preference. My preference is, has been and always will be a bill that could only be delivered when those opposed recognised that public sentiment shifted against them over a decade ago and when those who advocated change respected that some people's views would never change, and both were accommodated in law. The former Prime Minister John Howard reminded me of my words from May 2014:


The primacy of the human right to freedom of worship should not be simply dismissed in pursuit of advancing the civil right to non-discrimination.


I still agree with that statement. It is one of the critical reasons the postal survey was not my first preference. Some took a 'stop change at all costs' approach, and the full costs now come with it. That was their choice, not that of those seeking change and not mine. My conscience is clear. The bill is a compromise on the political situation before us. My hope is that my party will reflect on this debate and learn from it. In an effort by some to prevent this parliament from confronting this issue, they have been prepared to discard numerous principles: parliamentary supremacy, representative democracy, our party's tradition of a free vote, fiscal prudence and free speech. I take great pride in being able to say that at every single occasion I stood up to defend our institutions, traditions and freedoms ahead of the politics of the day.


My focus has been and always will be on how we take our country forward together. Some of us are Liberals, real Liberals, living Menzies's address to his 1965 federal council that we are 'not the party of the past, not the conservative party dying hard on the last barricade', but one with 'a lively mind and a forward-looking heart'. We believe in conserving our culture and our institutions by shaping the future and bringing them forward to give life to one of our most important institutions and its relevance in the 21st century.


I take all people's freedoms seriously—very seriously. A free society does not seek to homogenise belief or conscience but instead affirms individuality and diversity and fosters tolerance and mutual respect. The choice that has always faced our country is whether we are a social democracy or a liberal democracy. Social democracies empower government and legislate permissible conduct. In a liberal democracy, we remove barriers to freedom, just as the bill before us today is doing. We are expanding the freedom to marry. The unlimited freedom of conscience is the freedom to hold and form opinions, religious or otherwise, and that is not inhibited by this bill. Freedom of speech is the freedom to express and communicate ideas and your conscience, and that is not inhibited by this bill. As all members know, I will always stand up against laws that make it unlawful to offend, when they arise. Religious freedom is the freedom to manifest your conscience. A person's faith does not end at the church door any more than sexual orientation ends at the bedroom door. They inform the fullness of a life, our character and our choices. Free speech and religious freedom have always been tempered by law to respect the rights and freedoms of others. They are not an unlimited licence. If you care about everyone's freedom, not just your own, the objective should be to enlarge the space for these freedoms—I always will and do.


The bill before us today is the answer to a simple question: should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry? This bill honours those who fought harder before us for less and those today who've had to fight for their equal place at this nation's table. It represents the opportunities of generations to come—to mature in adolescence without unnecessary doubt, like Edward Crossland, who grew up in the Goldstein electorate, who wrote to me saying, 'The recent debate has really made me question my validity as a person.' Edward, question no longer. Hayley, Katie and Ada, from Sandringham, wrote, 'I know you will understand when I say it has been hard, but it was particularly heartening to know that an overwhelming majority of our neighbours support us.' Yes, they do, Hayley, Katie and Ada. Dale Hardy and Steve Humphreys were going to get married in March at the UK consulate in Melbourne, but now they can be married in the nation they love—congratulations. It also affects families. I was reminded of this when I popped into netball in Hampton last Saturday when Kris Pierce told me lovingly of her uncle Kevin and his partner of 44 years, John, and how much she was looking forward to the ending of the silence of their relationship—the silence will end.


There's no point pretending that this isn't deeply personal. It is a journey that I started when I was 12 years old; it was referenced in my first speech. Like so many others at 18, I confronted the choice before me about whether I should live my life honestly or not at all. I still remember my thoughts at that crucial moment: if you give in, they win. That moment followed years of self-inspired haunting doubt that was externally reinforced by the legacy of social, cultural and legal stigmatisation. I suspect many people find understanding these journeys difficult. It's so paralysing because you can't seek help from others. The people you should be able to turn to are the ones you fear speaking to the most because the cost of rejection is so high. As the Attorney-General remarked in the other place, it can sometimes overcome. This bill rams a stake into the heart of that stigma and its legacy. If I could go back and tell that scared 18-year-old kid he'd be speaking here—surrounded by Trevor Evans and Trent Zimmerman, and also representing the party of his values with his partner, Ryan, in the gallery—on this bill, he wouldn't have believed me.


Ryan, I still remember the day all those years ago when we rose before the sun to watch a new day on One Tree Hill on Hamilton Island and I gave you the ring on our left hand and said, 'I don't know what this ring represents or means, but will you take it as a sign of my commitment?' Thankfully, the answer was yes. I also remember the bittersweetness of the days that followed. Anyone who has been engaged will know that moment in life: the joy amplified by the mutual celebration of others. Our friends were happy for us and with us. Always with an eye to the future, the member for Kooyong and his wife, Amie, sent flowers. But, when we told others, many simply didn't know how to react. Many SMSs were not responded to. In conversation, some people politely changed the topic or fell silent entirely. For a while, Ryan kept pushing for an engagement party. The truth was, I kept delaying it, perhaps wrongly, because the strong message I took from so many people's silence was that no-one would come. On informing one person of our news, they responded, 'Why bother?' At the time I fell silent, and I've never had an answer to that question, but the Australian people have now answered it for me. Our society doesn't have a tradition that communicates the seriousness and commitment of a relationship, except for marriage. It is a commitment between two people and held together by the love and expectation of families, friends and community. It is the foundation of our nation. And as my dear friend Paul Ritchie wrote in his book Faith, Love & Australia:The Conservative Case for Same-Sex Marriage:


Marriage strengthens society, mutual responsibility strengthens the social fabric and interdependence is the core of every community, the law should support and affirm the most important of human relationships - the person we choose to share our life with.


And he's right. My uncle recently asked whether, without a bride, my parents would still have to chip in for the wedding. Look on the bright side, Mum and Dad; you get to start a new tradition.


To the people of Australia: this debate was always about the type of country we want to be, and you own this moment. To the second love of my life, the people of Goldstein: when you charged me with your trust, you knew we would solve this debate together. You delivered the highest per capita participation rate in the nation and delivered a 76.3 per cent 'yes' response. Thank you for your tolerance, because now we can move on, together. To Tiernan Brady, Anna Brown, Janine Middleton, Tom Snow, Clint McGilvray and the many others who have worked tirelessly: thank you so much. To those in it for the long haul, particularly the staffers who worked for the government through this difficult process, such as Ben Bartlett and Luke Barnes as well as many others; to the Liberals and Nationals For Yes team, led nationally by Andrew Bragg, fronted by my dear friends Christine Forster and Virginia Edwards, and organised in the great state of Victoria by Rory Grant and David Kitchen: thank you so much.


To the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull: you found a pathway through the obstruction of those on both sides of this debate—and it was on both sides of this debate. This is a marker in your legacy, and that of the Attorney-General, the immigration minister and the finance minister: thank you. To my trusted confidante Alex Greenwich, who I'm very happy to see in the gallery today: Alex, we fought through and together on this debate when the public and so many of our contemporaries were against us, so no-one deserves more credit for this outcome than you—no-one.


I suspect the term was originally developed as a means to demonise, but the members for Brisbane, North Sydney and Leichhardt, who I'm very proud to have surround me today, as well as Senator Smith, can reclaim the title of 'rainbow rebel' as an exclusive moniker of courage and conviction. A heavy burden fell to us, and you have all lived lives of consequence, particularly you, Warren. Trev, Trent, Deano and I fought with our hearts because this debate chose us; you chose this debate because justice rests in your heart.


With the indulgence of the Speaker, the person I have to thank most is my partner, Ryan. You've had to tolerate more than most because you had to put up with me.



Government members interjecting—




Mr TIM WILSON:
  Trust me! This debate has been the soundtrack to our relationship. We both know this issue isn't the reason we got involved in politics—give us tax reform any day—but in my first speech I defined our bond by the rings that sit on both of our left hands, and that they are the answer to the question we cannot ask. So there's only one thing left to do: Ryan Patrick Bolger, will you marry me?




A response having been received from the gallery—





Mr TIM WILSON:
  We'll chuck that in the memoirs and Hansard.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Rob Mitchell
):  I should note for the Hansard that that was a yes, a resounding yes. Congratulations; well done mate.




Mr TIM WILSON:
  Thank you, Speaker.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (11:24):  I start with congratulations to the member for Goldstein. 


Last week this House did not sit but I came to Canberra to support our senators in the historic work they were doing to pass the bill that is now before us. And pass it they did, with a thumping majority of 43 in favour to 12 against. I've now been a member of this parliament for 10 years. Last Wednesday, when the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 passed the other place, it was one of the most momentous days I can remember in a decade of parliamentary work. In the third reading debate on this bill last Wednesday, Labor's leader in the Senate—a courageous and tireless advocate for marriage equality—declared:


Every day it is a great privilege to stand in this place, but there are some days which are of great moment, which change our country for the better. This is such a day.


This week, in this place, it is my sincere hope and intention that we will reaffirm the momentous decision taken by our Senate colleagues last week and pass this bill, unamended, to make marriage equality a reality. 


It is easy to understand why so many Australians have found federal politics so difficult to engage with over recent years. The hyperpartisanship that has infected our national debate in so many areas is dispiriting for many Australians who do not want to see partisan scrapping but want to see the national parliament as a venue for  a genuine contest of ideas, a place in which the elected members look at what needs to be done and then work out how to best bring that change about, a place in which we engage in debate with sincerity, authenticity and passion to determine how best to—as Senator Wong said—change our country for the better. 


There's no doubt in my mind, or in my heart, that this bill will make our country better. It does this by ending a significant form of discrimination against a great many Australians and transforming what has been a source of ongoing pain into a source of joy for all those LGBTIQ Australians who want to express their love through the institution of marriage. Fundamentally, this bill is about expanding freedom in our nation by granting to all Australians the freedom to marry the person they love. 


I have no doubt that this government's marriage law survey was conceived as a delaying tactic by those opposed to marriage equality. But, as wasteful, divisive and destructive as that survey was, it has shown, indisputably, that the large majority of Australians, in every state and in every territory, support marriage equality. Our job now as members of this parliament is to deliver on the clearly expressed wish of the people. 


So many bills introduced into this place are cooked up in secret and then dumped without warning into the parliament. In some egregious cases the government uses its numbers to rush through those bills without meaningful debate, without the people directly impacted by those laws or the wider Australian public having a chance to even read them. An example that leaps to mind for me are the changes to native title law, which were rammed through this House by the government against Labor opposition in February this year. Fortunately, the government does not control the Senate, so the opposition and the crossbench senators are often able to demand public consultation on laws that this government would rather pass without scrutiny. 


This bill, which was introduced in the Senate on Wednesday, 15 November—but which was made public months earlier—is not such a bill; in fact it is the opposite. What this bill does is embody in law the unanimous recommendations of a Senate multiparty committee report on the appropriate form of legislation for marriage equality. That committee comprised members from the government, from Labor, from the Greens and from the crossbench. It consulted extensively with the Australian community over a number of months. And, then, the members of that committee worked hard to hammer out a unanimous, consensus position. Cross-party agreement on a contentious manner is a rare event in our politics, but that committee achieved it, and this bill honours that unanimous position. We should not fracture that rare consensus now. This bill is not perfect, but consensus is built through compromise. The point is that the compromises made in this bill are acceptable compromises. There are some who argued passionately against any kind of exemptions from our antidiscrimination laws. Those advocates argued, among other things, that to allow religious bodies and individuals to continue to discriminate against LGBTIQ Australians wanting to marry, despite the passage of laws for marriage equality, undermines the very principles of nondiscrimination that this bill is founded on. But they compromised. It was painful for many, but the majority of those advocates came to accept that a competing value, that of freedom of religion, would also have to be accommodated in giving effect to marriage equality.


On the other side, too, compromises were made. Many religious groups and individuals who subscribe to religious doctrines which hold that LGBTIQ people cannot marry came to accept that their religious faith was not affected by the fact that other people might have a different view of marriage. They did, however, insist that, given the deep spiritual significance of marriage ceremony, ministers and religious celebrants should not be obliged to solemnise marriages for LGBTIQ Australians if to do so was contrary to their religious beliefs. Protection for ministers of religion is provided for in explicit and extensive terms by this bill and will become law if this bill is passed. I will read the relevant part, section 47(3), because, from some of the commentary we have heard about this bill, you might think that it contained no protection for freedom of religion at all.


A minister of religion may refuse to solemnise a marriage despite anything in this Part, if any of the following applies:


   (a)   the refusal conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the religion of the minister's religious body or religious organisation;


   (b)   the refusal is necessary to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents to that religion;


   (c)   the minister's religious beliefs do not allow the minister to solemnise the marriage.


And then there's an additional subsection (4):


This section does not limit the grounds on which a minister of religion may refuse to solemnise a marriage.


The bill also provides comparable protections for the religious freedoms of an entirely new category of marriage celebrant—a religious marriage celebrant. This new category is created by the bill to cover marriage celebrants who are not ministers of a recognised religion but who nevertheless claim a religious objection to solemnising same-sex weddings. Again, to allow celebrants, who are empowered to solemnise marriages by the civil law of Australia, to be able to discriminate against LGBTIQ Australians, despite the passage of civil laws allowing for marriage equality, involved a major compromise on the part of many advocates of marriage equality. This is what section 47A of the bill states:


(1)   A religious marriage celebrant may refuse to solemnise a marriage despite anything in this Part, if the celebrant's religious beliefs do not allow the celebrant to solemnise the marriage.


And I'll go on to mention section 47B, which provides further protection for religious bodies in these terms:


(1)   A body established for religious purposes may refuse to make a facility available, or to provide goods or services, for the purposes of the solemnisation of a marriage, or for purposes reasonably incidental to the solemnisation of a marriage, if the refusal:


   (a)   conforms to the doctrines, tenets of beliefs of the religion of the body; or


   (b)   is necessary to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion.


I've read out all these provisions because I want to make clear the extent to which this bill protects the freedom of those with religious views opposed to same-sex marriage. It protects them to enable them to continue to live their lives in accordance with those views. Labor supports religious freedom and Labor respects the fact that there are a range of views on the question of marriage equality and on how religious freedoms should be protected. This bill provides appropriate protections for freedom of religion in relation to marriage while also implementing the clearly expressed will of the Australian people to make marriage equality law. There is no need for further amendments.


The issue of how best to balance competing human rights is a perennial one and I, and my Labor colleagues, welcome debate on how best to protect religious freedoms in our nation while, at the same time, protecting other human rights such as the right to freedom from discrimination. But the debate on this bill is not the right time or place to engage in such a wide and far-ranging debate. Debates about how better to protect human rights, including freedom of religion, are vitally important for healthy democratic nations such as ours. It's precisely because of the importance of these debates that they should not be rushed but be open, considered debates that involve the entire Australian community.


In recognition of the complex nature of new legislative measures to protect religious freedoms, the Prime Minister has established an expert panel tasked with conducting a broader view of protections for religious freedom. The panel will be chaired by Philip Ruddock, a former Attorney-General, and includes Australian Human Rights Commission president Rosalind Croucher, former Federal Court judge Annabelle Bennett and Jesuit priest and human rights lawyer Frank Brennan. If people and organisations want to engage in a wider discussion about the protection of freedom of religion in our nation, that discussion should occur under the auspices of the Philip Ruddock panel.


In closing, I want to return to the historic significance of the bill now before us and to thank some of the many people who have been instrumental in fighting to make marriage equality a reality in our nation, a reality we are now on the cusp of delivering. The changes to our nation that will be made by this bill have been hard fought for over many years. A number of members of this parliament from all parties have worked tirelessly to bring us to this historic moment. Senator Penny Wong, Senator Louise Pratt, Senator Dean Smith and Senator Janet Rice have all played a vital role. In this House there are too many to name, but the leadership of the member for Maribyrnong, the Leader of the Opposition, and of the member for Sydney, the deputy leader, in the fight for marriage equality has been outstanding. And they have been enthusiastically supported by many members of our caucus, including, in particular, the member for Whitlam and the member for Griffith. Across the aisle I want to acknowledge the courageous stance of the member for Leichardt, the member for North Sydney, the member for Brisbane and the member for Goldstein, who have had to swim very hard indeed against the current in their own party.


But, of course, the greatest thanks must go to the many members of the Australian LGBTIQ community who, for years, have campaigned for this momentous change to our laws. I want to thank everyone in rainbow Labor. There are so many people I could name and thank for their involvement in this campaign, but a few of those I've worked closely with and whose contribution has been extraordinary, are Anna Brown and Lee Carnie from the Human Rights Law Centre, Rodney Croome, Corey Irlam, Tom Snow, Tim Gartrell recently, and Alex Greenwich throughout.


This is a great moment for our country. At long last, after too long a delay, we have a bill to achieve marriage equality before the House of Representatives—a bill which has already passed the Senate. It will be a greater moment when, as I sincerely hope, this bill passes this House and marriage equality is finally a reality. It will be a moment which makes Australia a better place.

"Zimmerman, Trent, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr ZIMMERMAN
 (North Sydney) (11:38):  Neville Wills celebrated his 98th birthday a few weeks ago. He's lived in his apartment in Greenwich, in my electorate, overlooking our glittering harbour for much of his life. During the course of those 98 years, Neville has borne witness to many of the events that have shaped our nation. He's lived through the terms of 23 prime ministers and the reign of four monarchs. The Great Depression, a world war and the Cold War, the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the advent of the computer age and the growth of Sydney to become one of the world's great multicultural cities have all been part of his life story. And, as someone who happened to be born gay, he has been part of the incredible transformation in the way in which our society has regarded homosexuality.


For two-thirds of Neville's life, simply being gay was effectively a crime in New South Wales. As a young man, it would have been beyond his wildest imagination to dream of an Australia in which his sexuality was accepted without shame or ostracisation, where his rights were protected and not prosecuted, an Australia that's parliament included openly gay members, including his own representative, and an Australia in which he could choose to marry the person he loves. Yet all of these things will be achieved in his lifetime.


Thirty-nine years ago—in fact, on an anniversary celebrated just yesterday—Neville met the person who was to become his lifelong partner. He and Ian Fenwicke have shared their lives together since that day. They have loved, honoured, comforted and protected each other and will do so as long as they both shall live. Yet, for those 39 years, they have not been able to proclaim and share their commitment in love in the same way as every other Australian. Our laws have treated them differently. This week, in this parliament and with the overwhelming support of our fellow Australians, we have the opportunity to change that. And, early next year, once we have done so, Neville and Ian will marry.


I reflect on their story because it encapsulates the reasons marriage equality is at long last being debated in this House and why I have been a co-signatory to the bill before it. Their hopes and aspirations reflect the importance of marriage in our society for so many people yet denied to some simply because of their sexuality. This legislation and the outcome of the postal survey which preceded it are an important part of our nation's journey towards acceptance and respect for those of us who are gay, lesbian, transgender or intersex. The significance of both cannot be understated, not just for members of the LBGTI community and their families and friends but for those millions of Australians who hold, as our birth right, the nation of a fair go, where our laws treat all Australians equally and fairly. These are principles that are not revolutionary. They are part and parcel of our liberal democracy and the promise that extends to all its citizens—the right to live their lives according to their own hopes, values, talents and ambitions. They are at the core of the belief structure which makes me a Liberal. Marriage equality is simply a logical extension of those ideals.


Despite our own progress, in so many parts of the world gay and lesbian people remain persecuted. We have seen, for example, gay men publicly flogged in the name of sharia law in one of our nearest neighbours. In the troubled Middle East, the mad men of ISIS have taken pleasure in executing homosexuals, often in the most barbaric of ways. In Chechnya, members of the gay and lesbian community have been systematically rounded up and arrested, tortured and often killed by their own government. In so many countries, being gay is still considered a crime. We as a nation, therefore, should be proud of our liberal democracy, our commitment to individual rights and all we have achieved. So, for me, marriage equality should be regarded not, as some have asserted, as a threat to the values of Western civilisation but as rather their triumph.


For much of human history, marriage has been a stabilising and important bedrock for relationships and for families. While not every Australian in a relationship will choose to marry, for many it remains a powerful affirmation of love, commitment and shared responsibility. It is an act of devotion sanctioned by the law and proclaimed through wedding ceremonies witnessed by families and friends. For many years, support for marriage as an institution took something of a battering. Yet, today, we have a part of our community knocking on the door and seeking to be admitted.


For me, as a Liberal, today's debate is about ensuring our law treats each other equally. For those who come to this debate from the conservative tradition, I want to say that marriage equality should be seen as a victory for this ancient institution. Who would have thought we would see the day when the Socialist Alliance and Lee Rhiannon would be marching on the streets for marriage? It will grow stronger and more popular as more have the opportunity to join its ranks. I know there are some who have typified this debate as fundamentally altering an institution which has been immutable since ancient times. This has certainly been the tenor of the correspondence of some of those who have emailed and written to me arguing against marriage equality. Yet the reality is that, like all strong and continuing institutions, marriage has changed and adapted over the centuries. It is simply wrong to say that marriage is the same today as it was 50 years, 100 years or even longer ago.


My friend Paul Ritchie chartered some of those changes in his outstanding book, Faith, Love and Australia: The Conservative Case for Same-Sex Marriage. In its long history, the concept that marriage is about two people who come together through love is a relatively new one. Paul Ritchie quoted in his book the significant 18th century jurist, Lord Blackstone, who said of marriage, 'By marriage, husband and wife are one person in law', and that person is the husband. That does not sound like a concept of marriage which would resonate in Australia today, thankfully. And for so long, interfaith and interracial marriages were regarded as taboo, often with the enforcement of the law, as Aboriginal Australians experienced in parts of our own nation as late as the mid-20th century.


No institution survives and flourishes without change, but the irony of this debate is that gay and lesbian Australians don't actually want to change marriage; they simply want to be allowed to join it. They want to marry to partake in the same benefits and happiness that other Australians enjoy and which the advocates of marriage so rightly extol.


During the course of the last 18 months, I've received some beautiful letters and emails from couples longing to marry and I want to quote one of those today, which to me summarises why gay and lesbian Australians have been fighting so hard for this week to come. The email came from a Western Australian who I do not personally know. He wrote:


We have been together for seven years. I am truly blessed to have him in my life. We are more in love today than ever before.


He is a saint in my eyes—he completes me and he makes me a better person. He is my rock, my best friend, my wisest counsel and my confidant.


So thank you for fighting for us to be recognised as being as good as anyone else, and thank you for fighting to affirm that our love—our great great love affair—is as valuable and worthy of being cherished and affirmed like anyone else's.


It is this love, this commitment and this union of minds that so many parents, brothers and sisters, friends, relatives and work colleagues see in the lives of gay people they know which led them to vote yes for marriage equality in such overwhelming numbers. This bill will deliver the marriage equality Australians voted for when they gave the parliament not just a mandate greater than any government has received in our nation's history, but, in effect, a direction to get it done. It has its genesis in the unanimous cross-party findings of the Senate select committee, and the bill was released by Senator Smith, the members for Leichhardt, Goldstone and Brisbane and I in August.


Importantly, the bill protects those religious freedoms we hold dear and which properly relate to the functions of the Marriage Act. This has been a key consideration for us, and in this bill we protect the rights of religious organisations and their ministers. We ensure that religious bodies may refuse to make facilities available or to provide goods and services for marriages that do not conform with their own religious beliefs and we offer similar protections to existing celebrants who choose to register as religious marriage celebrants. These will sit alongside existing Commonwealth laws which make clear that our schools can hire and teach according to their own religious values and that no person can be discriminated against in the workplace because of their religious beliefs.


Not one clause or one word of this bill will change the existing rights of any Australian in relation to their religious freedoms. And nowhere does this bill seek to restrict the right of any Australian or organisation to hold beliefs or present the case for a traditional marriage. This bill restricts itself to issues relating to marriage, not an unreasonable proposition for a bill that actually seeks to amend the Marriage Act.


But I know that many have argued the need for a broader discussion about religious freedoms in Australia and this is a call that I support. I welcome the Prime Minister's decision to bring together an expert panel led by our esteemed former Attorney-General Philip Ruddock to consider and report on these issues. Its deliberations will allow us to determine whether broader reforms are needed. The Marriage Act is not the legislation for achieving that goal, it's not the place for a partial bill of rights, it's not the place for the Commonwealth to assert new legislative powers over the states in relation to our schools and it's certainly not the place to respond to Australia's vote for a greater equality by winding back existing antidiscrimination laws. We have a good bill, now endorsed by the Senate, and I hope that this chamber will lend it its support.


In the coming week, we will bring to a close an issue which has been discussed in the Australian community for over a decade. We would not be able to do so without the leadership provided by many in this parliament, on both sides of the House, and in the broader community. In this chamber I want to acknowledge particularly the member for Leichardt, whose tenacity and leadership have just been extraordinary. Who would have thought a crocodile farmer from Far North Queensland would become a gay icon, although he does occasionally look like a member of the Village People!


I also recognise the members for Goldstein and Brisbane. As new members in this place, the last 12 months have, on occasion, taken their toll and tested our mettle. I don't think we have been found wanting in standing by our convictions.


To my friend in the Senate, Dean Smith, your determination and very senatorial attention to detail and process have brought us here today. We've known each other for 25 years, and it's fair to say that, when we first knew each other, there wasn't much love, because of the divide in the Young Liberals, but I'm glad that is no longer the case. I thank the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet for providing a pathway where none seemed possible. I thank the thousands of Liberal Party members and supporters who joined together under the banner of Libs and Nats for Yes, led so ably by Andrew Bragg and Luke Barnes and supported so eloquently by many others. I particularly acknowledge Christine Forster in this regard for her powerful advocacy, and I'm so pleased that she and Virginia will no longer require the British consulate for their own wedding early next year.


Outside this place I record my appreciation for the work of the Equality Campaign and people like Alex Greenwich; Tom Snow; Anna Brown; the mum from Mosman, Janine Middleton; and of course the face and voice of the 'yes' campaign, Tiernan Brady. How could anyone say no to that Irish lilt? I also acknowledge my own community in North Sydney, 72 per cent of whom voted yes. Almost every conversation I had with members of the community, both those voting yes and those voting no, was conducted respectfully and genuinely. I cannot describe how much it meant, during some of the darkest moments, when complete strangers would approach me and simply say, 'Good on you for standing up for what you believe.' Most importantly of all I thank Carlos, the man I love, for being the best example I could have as to why we all aspire to find the person who will unconditionally love us and be at our side.


Finally, I recognise the role of young Australians. The outcome of the postal survey was, more than anything else, a victory for the new generation of Australians who have grown up beside gay and lesbian friends or family members, who know their dreams and ordeals are no different to their own and who wondered why marriage equality should even be an issue at all. They enrolled to vote like never before, they formed the core of the campaign teams that fanned out across the nation, and they convinced so many of their parents and grandparents that it was time for change. At shopping centres and at train stations I saw their excitement and enthusiasm at the thought that they could make history and change Australia for the better. I say to them: 'You have done just that.'


Those young Australians, along with yes voters of all ages, have helped ensure that every loving relationship is valued and treated equally. They have sent the message that our community embraces each of its citizens, no matter what their sexuality. Too many Australians have lived a life of denial and too many of us have experienced that great debilitating shadow that comes from the fear of discovery or rejection. Many still do today, but Australians, through their vote, have helped bring about change. They have said every Australian should be able to be simply who they are. For that, I thank them. I commend the bill to the House.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (11:53):  I'm delighted to be here finally debating a marriage equality bill that has a chance of passing the Australian parliament. I'm even more delighted to be doing so in a week when we hope that we will be voting on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. I'm particularly delighted, because I have spent so much time working with the LBGTI community, both publicly and within the Labor Party, for marriage equality to be made a reality. The commitment that Labor has to marriage equality was demonstrated very well by the fact that Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, took to the 2016 federal election a commitment to legislate for marriage equality in the first 100 days of a Shorten Labor government in the event that we were elected. It's a shame that we as a parliament have taken so long to get to a point where we're even allowed to have a vote on marriage equality. Were it not for the work of Labor over many years, including the work of the member for Whitlam, Senator Louise Pratt, Senator Penny Wong and the members for Sydney and Maribyrnong, it's absolutely the case that we wouldn't be in a position to pass a marriage equality bill through this parliament. It is because of the work of Labor over many years that we now have a situation where it can be passed through the parliament.


In the midst our delight, gratitude and relief for the imminent passage of marriage equality, I think it is important to recognise that there's also distress. Harm has been caused not just by the fact that there has been so much delay in relation to marriage equality and not just by the fact that we have had a situation where we weren't even allowed to have a vote in the House of Representatives until now. It is the fifth year of this Liberal government. That is how long it has taken for us to even be allowed to vote on a bill to have a free vote on marriage equality. But it's not just about that delay; new and creative processes for delay were created—like the plebiscite, which was defeated, and then the postal survey, which couldn't be defeated because it was a creature of administrative government. It's not just those things; it's the hurt that was felt during that postal survey. I don't want to gloss over it. I've had enough of hearing from people about the hurt that they felt when their kids came home from school and talked about what had been said to them about whether their family was normal.


I heard from the Victorian AIDS Council about middle aged men who were feeling like they were being judged. I went to the candlelight vigil for World AIDS Day on Friday night in Brisbane. As I looked around me at the men in their 60s and 70s, and women, from the LGBTI community, it was impossible not to think about how the shame and stigma of the 1980s was being brought up for them again in this situation where we had a national opinion poll about their relationships, their families, their identities. In speaking on this bill, predominantly I want to celebrate it. But I can't brush past that, and nor should anyone else.


Every member of this House would have received information from the mental health group ReachOut, who said that they'd had a 40 per cent spike in demand for their mental health services from LGBTI people through the survey process. And they were particularly concerned about that because LGBTI people who use their service were shown by research to be 40 per cent more likely to be at risk of suicide. These are not minor issues. They're issues that should be acknowledged. I think it is important to say to my LGBTI friends who are in the gallery, or listening somewhere else, that I acknowledge the price that you have been asked to pay to have the same right to marry as everyone else. It's been a high price. But, as I said, I predominantly want to celebrate the fact that we look like we're on the cusp of achieving marriage equality in this country.


So many people have talked about the personal stories they've heard—whether it's from close friends, family members or complete strangers. As I said, I was at the World AIDS Day vigil on Friday night, and I ran into my friend Phil Carswell. I won't say his age because that would not be polite. He is now planning a wedding—between bouts of dialysis. I had a party on the weekend. Some friends of mine, John and John, came along—again, I won't say their ages but they're very distinguished gentlemen. And I thought: how long they have had to wait just for this acceptance of their relationship, this acknowledgement that their relationship is not any more or less equal than anyone else's.


We've heard the personal stories from our friends, from our families and from complete strangers. Those people deserve to know that this parliament will rectify the discrimination that is presently entrenched against them in our marriage laws. I want to congratulate everyone in this parliament who is doing that. To those who do not support this change in our marriage laws: I of course respect your right to disagree but I don't accept as legitimate those who sought to create fear in relation to marriage equality, those who sought to make us fear this change. If you are afraid of what the consequences might be—as much of my incoming correspondence from people who voted 'no' in this survey would suggest—I hope you will take heart not from me as a Labor Party member but from the compelling conservative case that has been made for marriage equality by many people. For example, it has been made in Cameron's Britain but also by my friend Senator Smith, who is a deeply conservative, genuine Liberal in the Senate. He has made a strong, conservative and compelling case for marriage equality. I think my politics could not be more different to Senator Smith's. I hope that those who voted no in good faith will take heart from the conservative case that has been made in respect of marriage equality.


I also want to acknowledge that this is not the bill that I would have wanted had I been able to wave a magic wand and change the law myself. I know it's got concessions in it, and they are significant concessions. I know that this bill creates a new class of religious marriage celebrant and that the bill grandfathers existing civil celebrants so that they can move into that class within a short period so that they can continue to discriminate if they wish to do so. I acknowledge that that is the creation of a new right to discriminate. That is an additional carve-out from our anti-discrimination legislation, above and beyond the existing carve-outs that already exist in anti-discrimination law.


I acknowledge also that this bill creates rights for others based on religious belief. Of course I acknowledge that it is hurtful that we will have a form of service provider who's entitled to discriminate against you because you're in a same-sex couple. I know it's a significant concession, and I hope that those who feel hurt by the concession will agree with us that this is an acceptable compromise—not the bill that we necessarily would have wanted but an acceptable compromise in the circumstances.


This bill will allow two people to marry. That's what it'll do. It won't detract from anyone's rights; it will increase people's rights. It will make us a more equal society. It will seek to remove discrimination to a large extent. It's something that should be celebrated. It's a bill that I think Senator Smith can, rightly, be very proud of. I acknowledge his colleagues who have worked so hard for it: the member for Goldstein—and congratulations on your engagement—the member for Brisbane; the member for North Sydney; the former member for Brisbane, Teresa Gambaro; and, of course, my very good friend the member for Leichhardt, who has done an excellent job, and it's a wonderful thing to see you back here today in the chamber.



Mr Snowdon interjecting—




Ms BUTLER:
  It is—it's wonderful.


I also want to acknowledge the strong leadership that's been shown over many years on the Labor side of this House by the Leader of the Opposition; the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, who has borne a much more personal and heavy burden than anyone else with her leadership role; and the Shadow Attorney-General, who has undertaken a great deal of detailed technical work in respect of this bill and previous bills. Like many other speakers, I want to thank Rainbow Labor, including my friend Sean Leader from Queensland, who worked for so long to change our platform. I remember, just over six years ago, our national conference, where Sean, despite having some terrible things going at home with family members' health, still made it all the way to the conference, went to Sydney and argued for us to change our platform. It's because of the work of people like him, hundreds of rank and file members of the Labor Party, and the leadership of members of parliament that the platform was duly changed.


I want to thank my colleagues on the parliamentary 'yes committee'—there's a committee for you: Senator Louise Pratt, the member for Bruce and Senator Sam Dastyari. I also want to thank Penny Sharpe MLC, who did so much work coordinating volunteers to go and observe the postal survey process—an important part—but also for her leadership over many years in relation to marriage equality. I want to thank just.equal. I see that Rodney Croome is here. I'm not sure whether Ivan Hinton-Teoh has made it, but they have been excellent advocates. Shelley Argent from PFLAG is here—someone who has worked so hard over decades for marriage equality. I want to thank Sally Rugg from GetUp!, who is here—she has made it in. Sally has worked incredibly hard over a very long period of time. I also acknowledge A4E and AME, and all the people who have already been acknowledged who are in gallery. I feel like I could recite Tiernan Brady's stump speech to you, I've heard it that many times—but I couldn't do the accent!


But also I thank Shirleene Robinson, who is not here, and my local Queenslanders from AME and A4E; Pete Black; Nita Green, who ran such a hard and strong campaign; and, of course, Brisbane Pride and Deeje Hancock; and all of the local LGBTI campaigners and their families and friends, who just made thousands and thousands of telephone calls and who doorknocked, went to public events and held public events. I had amazing groups in my electorate, like the Bulimba marriage equality group who would be out on the roundabout with amazing colourful signs. It was really something special. I also want to thank Rainbow Families, and all parents who sought to protect their kids from being hurt when the nation was asked to pass judgement on their lives. I want to thank mental health organisations like drummond street, Qlife and Switchboard—excellent LGBTI-led organisations of the community that helped people through the difficult process—and, of course, mainstream organisations like Orygen, ReachOut and headspace. I thank The LGBTI Legal Service in Queensland, which bore a lot of the brunt of receiving information about some of the worst aspects of the public campaigning against a marriage equality 'yes' vote. And I particularly want to thank—and it's important that I do so—the assistant national secretary of the Australian Labor Party, Paul Erickson, and his team in our national secretariat.


Of course it was a very broad campaign, and people from across different parties were brought together to work together. I acknowledge the work of Andrew Bragg and Luke Barnes and Liberals and Nationals for Yes.


But when you want a massive grassroots campaign, you want the ALP national secretariat and the labour movement of this country behind you. And between Paul Erickson and his team and the work of all of those labour movement campaigners, they really mobilised a lot of people to make phone calls and knock on doors and produce materials; they really got a lot of grassroots campaigning done. If it had not been for all of those people, I think that we would not necessarily have seen the result that we did see.


So thank you to everyone: to everyone who has campaigned, and I mean not just in the survey but for years; to everyone who has worked; to everyone who has taken really annoying phone calls from me, demanding answers at short notice—Anna Brown is smiling at me! And thank you to everyone who has stood up and fought for a fairer nation, a nation with less discrimination and with greater access to human rights, and to everyone who has not necessarily been part of an organised campaign or up the front but who has stood up for marriage equality on every possible occasion. Thank you very much. You've done your nation proud. And there will be many, many weddings that you'll be attending in the near future, so I hope you've got a lot of money for gifts organised! Thanks very much. I commend the bill.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (12:08):  It's time for us to get on with it. The Australian people have said yes to marriage equality, yes to fairness, yes to commitment, yes to love. The time has now come to make that equality a reality.


This is momentous social reform, and the road to this day has been long and arduous. It is littered with injustice dealt out to men and women who dared to confess their love. Not so long ago, homosexuality was a crime in this country. Slowly—too slowly—parliaments and the people have changed their attitudes to gay men and women and extended basic rights. Homosexuality was decriminalised. Gay Australians were allowed to serve in the military. It was 47 years ago that Lucy's father, Attorney-General Tom Hughes, created a scandal which saw his preselection challenged in Berowra when he argued that homosexual acts should no longer be crimes. How times have changed.


Throughout my time in public life, whether in government or in opposition, I have sought to ensure that same-sex couples are not discriminated against and that their entitlements, be they in respect of medical benefits, taxation, superannuation or employment, are no different to those accorded to heterosexual couples. I remember in 2007 persuading John Howard's cabinet, on the eve of the election, that we should give partners in same-sex relationships rights to Commonwealth and Defence superannuation—the same rights as those in heterosexual relationships. I remember the Department of Finance had a few reservations, but they were purely financial. Then, in 2008, the HREOC reforms effectively eliminated all legal discrimination, at least at the federal level, but the issue of marriage remained.


The message today to every gay person in this nation is clear: we love you and we respect you. Your relationship is recognised by the Commonwealth as being as legitimate and honourable as anyone else's. You belong. I'm the first Prime Minister of Australia to be unequivocally and consistently in support of legalising same-sex marriage. It will be forever to the credit of the coalition that this momentous social change occurred with the overwhelming mandate of the Australian people under a coalition government.


I am very firmly of the view that families are the foundation of our society, and we would be a stronger society if more people were married—and by that I mean formally, legally married—and fewer were divorced. If consulted by friends about marital dramas, I always encourage the singles to marry, the married to stick together, the neglectful and wayward to renew their loving commitment and the wronged to forgive. I have to say that I'm utterly unpersuaded by the proposition that my marriage to Lucy or indeed any marriage is undermined by two gay men or women setting up house down the road, whether it is called a marriage or not.


Let's be honest with each other: the threat to traditional marriage is not from gay people; it is from a lack of loving commitment, whether it is found in the form of neglect, indifference, cruelty or adultery—to name just a few manifestations of that loveless desert in which too many marriages come to grief. If the threat to marriage today is lack of commitment, then surely other couples making and maintaining that commitment set a good example rather than a bad one. Are not gay people who seek the right to marry, to formalise their commitment to each other, holding up a mirror to heterosexuals who—regrettably, in my view at least—are marrying less frequently and divorcing more often? Commitment, loyalty, responsibility.


John Howard was most definitely not thinking of gay couples when he said in 1995 that 'a stable, functioning family provides the best welfare support system yet devised'. But the point is well made. Co-dependency is a good thing. If we believe two gay people are better off together than living alone comforted only by their respective cats, then why should we deprive that relationship of equal recognition? And, for those who see this as an ideological issue, recall British Prime Minister David Cameron, as he spoke for marriage equality six years ago:


And to anyone who has reservations, I say: Yes, it's about equality, but it's also about something else: commitment. Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other. So I don't support gay marriage despite being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I'm a Conservative.


As I said at the start of the marriage survey, this is an issue of fundamental fairness. A society which promotes freedom and equality under the law should accord gay men and women the right to marry. We now recognise same-sex couples in every other aspect of the law—financial, medical, adoption—but we have not yet given them the right to call their relationship a marriage. This distinction will end with the passage of this bill. And, of course, it ends with the emphatic endorsement of an enormous majority of Australians.


The postal survey was one of the most remarkable political events in my lifetime, and I believe in the lifetime of many Australians. It was a voluntary postal vote for an allegedly apathetic nation, where anyone under 40 apparently did not know what a letterbox was, let alone where it could be found. And of course it had no prospects in the High Court either. Well, we won seven-nil there, Mr Speaker. My prediction rate for High Court cases is down to fifty-fifty, so I don't want to lower the average any more, but we did very well there. All of those assumptions were shot to ribbons. The survey was brilliantly designed, managed and executed, and great credit is due to the ABS, to the AEC and of course to Senator Cormann, who was the Acting Special Minister of State. But, above all, the credit is due to the Australian people, 80 per cent of whom cast a vote. That was remarkable. Nobody predicted that or expected that. In a general election, where we actually fine you if you don't vote, the participation rate is only a little bit above 90 per cent. This was a remarkable turnout and it proved what we always said: that Australians wanted to have their say.


The survey had many opponents, most notably on the other side of this chamber. In fact, this moment would have come far sooner if the opposition had supported our original plebiscite proposal in this parliament. It was an exercise both in good planning and execution, and also in legal ingenuity, to find a way to deliver on our election promise to give everyone their say and do so without legislation, which of course the Senate had denied us.


So we delivered on our promise. We promised the Australian people their say. We said, 'If you say yes, then we will have a free vote in the parliament,' and that is precisely what we are delivering. It is, I must say, a matter of great regret that the Labor Party is denying its members a free vote on the amendments, both in the Senate and in this House.


The best thing about the result has been the tremendous affirmation of same-sex couples—indeed all gay Australians—in the result. In voting yes, Australians have thrown their arms around fellow Australians who are gay and said clearly, 'We accept you. We accept your relationship.' I hope that in that positive affirmation, the most positive you could have in a democracy, same-sex couples take comfort in the acceptance and the love of their fellow Australians.


There were many who voted against change, but I know that they will accept and respect the democratic outcome of the process. They voted no for many different reasons. Some believe homosexuality itself is sinful. Others simply wanted to keep the legal definition of marriage as it has been for thousands of years. I respect the vote of every Australian, both 'yes' and 'no'—we made sure they could be heard—and I recognise the fundamental importance of ensuring that freedom of religion and speech are protected. The bill has been designed, as Senator Smith said in the Senate when he moved it, to ensure religious freedom is protected. I do not believe that the bill threatens our cherished religious freedoms—there is nothing in the bill, for example, which prevents anyone from maintaining or adhering to the teaching of their church on marriage or morality—but we must not fail to recognise that there is sincere, heartfelt anxiety about the bill's impact on religious freedom. That is why I will support several amendments to the bill which will provide that additional reassurance in respect of these fundamental rights and freedoms.


This is a historic moment of inclusion, of recognition, of respect. It has been talked about for many years. Previous governments have failed to take it on. The Labor Party did nothing about it for six years in power. But now with this strong message from the Australian people, which my government enabled, the way is clear. We are united in our diversity. Our values of mutual respect have made Australia the most harmonious and the most successful multicultural society on the planet. Australians have shown by the enormous turnout that they're deeply engaged with this issue. They voted overwhelmingly for a country built on equality, where the law does not discriminate against you on the basis of your sexual orientation any more than on the basis of your race, religion or gender.


Today is a day of which every Australian should be proud, proud that we can conduct and did conduct—despite all the naysayers—a very civil debate and proud that, given the opportunity to vote, far from being apathetic as the naysayers predicted, we participated in such enormous numbers. This is a day to be especially proud that all of our friends, our colleagues, our neighbours, our brothers and our sisters can marry the people they love. For those who voted no and remain disappointed with the result, it is a day to be proud that your voices were heard and that you have a government that ensured your voices were heard, as you wanted. They were counted and, ultimately, as you acknowledged, the majority was decisive. The postal survey gave the ultimate democratic seal to this historic change.


I commend all the men and women who fought for decades to bring this reform about—so many of them, indeed, in my electorate of Wentworth. This is a cause I understand and have been close to for many years. It is a long list, but surely in this place at the head of the line of advocates stands perhaps the most unlikely but in many ways the most patiently persistent: the member for Leichhardt, Warren Entsch. Most of all, I say to same-sex couples in Australia: you are equal, you are respected, you are loved. I commend the bill to the House.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (12:20):  I also wish to make a contribution on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. When same-sex marriage was last debated in this place, in 2012, as the result of a private member's bill, I opposed the measure in support of retaining the traditional definition of marriage. From the outset, I should declare that I am a Catholic. I grew up in a religious household, which probably accounts for some measure of my social conservativism. I also felt it was better for children to grow up with a mother and father. However, as a longstanding member of parliament, I'm only too familiar with the levels of domestic violence, child abuse and neglect that are occurring in some of our nuclear families. I've certainly refined my views in this regard and now believe that children simply need unconditional love, care and support from parents, and to live in a safe environment.


Having said that, I consider the situation before the House today markedly different to when we last debated same-sex marriage in 2012. Given the efforts to establish a national consensus and now having the result of the nationwide survey, the question of same-sex marriage has effectively been taken out of the hands of parliamentarians. Therefore, as I see it, our obligation is to bring about the legislative measures necessary to give effect to the expressed will of the Australian people.


The simple fact is that the Australian people overwhelmingly decided in favour of marriage equality. Prior to the national survey I publicly stated that, despite my personal views in favour of the retention of the traditional definition of marriage, should the nationwide survey on same-sex marriage result in a 'yes' vote I would not frustrate or delay the passage of the legislation to give effect to the nation's decision. The same-sex marriage survey was commissioned as a national exercise to produce a national result. Now, while I voted no—as, I hasten to add, did the majority of my electorate—I believe it would be hypocritical and disingenuous to have participated in that democratic process and then not accept the outcome.


For me, the debate is no longer about whether the definition of marriage should be amended to allow same-sex marriage but rather the manner now in which we should move forward. We must ensure that the issue of same-sex marriage is dealt with effectively, whilst making provisions for appropriate safeguards. In saying that, I find the title of this bill a little misleading—particularly its reference to religious freedom. From my reading, that's certainly not the purpose or the actual design of the amendment to the federal Marriage Act. It is appropriate that we have a respectful discussion, first to identify the religious freedoms that may be impacted by the introduction of same-sex marriage and then to determine the level of protection required in the context of Australia's legal framework.


Echoing some common ground in this regard, Anna Brown, the Director of Legal Advocacy of the Human Rights Law Centre, and more recently spokeswoman for the Equality Campaign, indicated that she believed religious freedom should be protected in law. A similar view was also expressed by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, who, in their concluding observations on Australia, expressed concern about the lack of direct protection against discrimination on the basis of religion at a federal level.


I appreciate the fears held by various religious institutions that enacting same-sex marriage could impact on religious freedoms, particularly in respect of the teaching of doctrine and the functioning of various faith based organisations, including schools and aged care and those responsible for the provision of welfare. While the issue of same-sex marriage has placed a particular focus on religious liberty, we should be clear that this legislation before us is but one area of federal law that could impinge on religious freedom. Nevertheless, I regard these as legitimate concerns and matters that need to be addressed in order that our laws do not unintentionally act to violate one's genuinely held beliefs.


Unlike the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada, which have already recognised same-sex marriage, we do not have a bill of rights, which in those countries accords a measure of protection to the rights of freedom of belief, freedom of conscience and freedom of religion. Now, I'm certainly not advocating for a bill of rights, but I do consider it far from ideal that religious freedom in this country is solely protected by exemptions and exceptions in various state and federal antidiscrimination laws.


I note that freedom of religion is specifically provided for in article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The covenant is an international legal instrument to which Australia is a signatory and effectively defines many of those rights and privileges that reflect our democratic values. However, to date, we have not attempted to introduce the tenets of article 18 into Australia's domestic law. I do think this is an area that warrants some further consideration.


Nevertheless, it's important that any legislative protection for religious freedom only places limitations that are reasonable, necessary and proportionate. I'm convinced it would not be prudent to attempt to address the complex matters of religious freedom solely in the context of this bill, other than addressing those matters directly relating to the actual performance of marriage ceremonies. This bill should not be a legislative attempt to cover the field or an opportunity to use religious freedom as a means to frustrate the passage of this legislation. Father Frank Brennan, the CEO of Catholic Social Services and a prominent human rights lawyer, alluded to this when he said:


The Marriage Act amendments need to include adequate protection for freedom of religion in the conduct of marriage ceremonies. Other issues of religious freedom should be dealt with by the tweaking of existing legislation …


However, he did go on to say that we may need to specifically address issues of religious freedom in federal legislation and possibly reflect the protections that currently exist in both Victorian and ACT legislation.


I believe we will need to address the shortfalls in Australia's legal architecture to provide specific protection for religious freedom. However, this is a complex area requiring detailed consideration, and therefore I'm pleased with the establishment of the expert panel led by Philip Ruddock to examine the human right to religious freedom and to do that exercise independent of the marriage amendment bill. I would expect that those with a genuine interest in religious freedom, and not simply as a means to frustrate the passage of legislation, will engage with the expert panel during their deliberation. I note that the expert panel are required to report back on 31 March next year. Therefore, I think the responsible course is to await their recommendations before attempting to legislatively address the issue of religious freedom.


If we are to respect the will of the Australian people, I believe it is important that we separate the complex questions of religious freedom from the issue of marriage equality. Fiona McLeod, the President of the Law Council of Australia, emphasised this point when she said:


Australians were not asked to vote on the complex intersection between religious freedom and anti-discrimination protection, so it is appropriate that any major changes are not bundled with amendments to the … Bill.


Nevertheless, I remain committed to working positively with the Ambrose Centre for Religious Liberty and those who hold a genuine interest in protecting religious freedom in this country. However, for the reasons that I have outlined, I support the passage of this bill, confident that it reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of Australians.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (12:30):  The debate regarding same-sex marriage in Australia has been settled. Australians were rightly given an opportunity by this government to have their say. They have spoken, and it's time to get on with it. As one of the principal proponents of the original plebiscite, I wanted to ensure that, whatever the outcome was, the country would reconcile itself to it. I was among the 39 per cent who voted for the traditional view of marriage to be maintained. As a nation, we must now move forward in grace and in love, as my Christian faith teaches us. I will respect the democratic outcome of this Australian marriage survey, both nationally and in my own electorate, by not standing in the way of this bill. However, with the closure of one debate, a new debate does commence. This debate is not that new. It's not about opposing same-sex marriage at all or delaying the passage of this bill. It is about simply protecting religious freedoms in this country.


There are almost five million Australians who voted no in this survey who are now coming to terms with the fact that they are in the minority. That did not used to be the case in this country for most, if not all, of their lives. They have concerns that their broader views and beliefs are also now in the minority and therefore under threat. They are seeking assurances from this House and this parliament at this time—whether one agrees or disagrees and whether rightly or wrongly—that the things they hold dear are not under threat because of this change.


On the night of the first referendum to establish our Federation, in June 1898, Alfred Deakin prayed:


Thy blessing has rested upon us here yesterday and we pray that it may be the means of creating and fostering throughout all Australia a Christlike citizenship.


In an earlier speech campaigning for the Federation in Bendigo, quoting a local poet, he defined the true goal of Federation as being for us to 'arise united, penitent, and be one people, mighty, serving God'. Our Constitution went on to proclaim:


… the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania, humbling relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth … with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal …


And, at section 116, our Constitution deliberately afforded the protection that 'the Commonwealth shall not make any law for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion'.


This is the religious inheritance of our Federation—our Constitution, from more than a century ago. If we ever act in dissonance with these founding principles, I believe it will be to our nation's great peril. This is not to say that Australia is a nation with an established state religion. Thankfully, it is not. We are, thankfully, free of such a restriction on our liberty. Such freedom should not be used, though, as a weapon against the importance of faith, belief and religion in our society or as a justification to drive faith and religion from our public square. At the same time, protection of religious freedoms cannot be used as a cloak for religious extremism that undermines our very freedoms.


We may be a secular state but we are not a godless people to whom faith, belief and religion are not important. Quite the contrary: it is deeply central to the lives of millions of Australians. In my own church, we refer to Australia as 'the great south land of the Holy Spirit'. Whether you raise your hands, bow to your knees, face the Holy City, light incense, light a candle or light the menorah, faith matters in this country—and we cannot allow its grace and peace to be diminished, muffled or again driven from the public square. Separation of church and state does not mean the inoculation of the influence of faith on the state. The state shouldn't run the church and the church shouldn't run the state. In fact, the separation of church and state was set up to protect the church from the state—not the other way around—to protect religious freedoms.


As I argued in my maiden speech in this place 10 years ago, secularism, secular humanism, is no more our established state religion than any other. It is one of the many free views held by Australians. It holds no special place of authority in our Commonwealth or in this place. For millions of Australians, faith is the unshakeable cornerstone of their lives. It informs their identity and provides a genuine sense of wellbeing. It is the reason why people can look beyond their own circumstances and see a greater purpose. For countless Australians, faith is life.


In my maiden speech I spoke of the two influences on my life—my faith and my family—and how my faith in Jesus Christ was inherently personal, not political. As Christians we do not lay claim to perfection or moral precedence; in fact it is the opposite: conscious of our own frailties and vanities, of our human condition, Christians should be more conscious of the same in those around us. That is why faith encourages social responsibility, the bedrock of faith in action. I quoted Abraham Lincoln in that speech, stating that our task is not to claim whether God is on our side, but to pray earnestly that we are on his. I pointed to my two heroes of faith, William Wilberforce and Desmond Tutu, the latter of whom supports same-sex marriage, men of courage and conviction who fought valiantly against the prevalent evils that had become a stain on society and who delivered immeasurable social gains: freedom from slavery, the unravelling of apartheid and the coming together of a deeply divided nation. Countless lives were saved or improved, because two men were compelled to act by their faith. As a guide and an empowerment, faith can change nations and the course of history.


In the formative stages of the Free Mandela campaign, Bishop Tutu told the BBC that Mandela would be Prime Minister within five to 10 years. The reporter mocked this pronouncement as hopelessly optimistic. His response highlighted the anchor on which his faith was based:


Brother, the Christian faith is hopelessly optimistic because it's based on the faith of a guy who died on a Friday and everybody said it was utterly and completely hopeless–ignominious defeat. And Sunday He rose.


The fragrance of faith has washed over our society for centuries and helped to shape and mould it for the better. Our own nation was founded, built, and undeniably shaped by Christian values, morals and traditions that helped to unite a fledgling country—a nation blessed by and formed on Christian conviction. These issues of faith are gifted to us not only by our Federation fathers but also by the many generations of Australians who have come to us since, including those from non-Christian faiths and experiences, who share the deep-seated conviction and positive influence of faith in their lives.


A few years ago I had the honour of visiting Lebanon for the ordination of our Maronite bishop in Australia, Antoine Tarabay. There, in the striking Maronite patriarchate above the bay of Jounieh, this generous and kind-hearted Sydney bishop committed himself to the sacrifice of ministry as the leader of his Australian flock. It was a deeply moving experience, in surreal surroundings, that resonated within me the importance of a life lived in the pursuit of God and the service of others. But it was the tour later, with my dear friend, Joseph Assaf, of the Holy Valley and the ancient villages in the north of the country, such as Hardine, Bsharri, Ehden, Hasroun, Kousba and concluding in Tannourine, the bishop's home village, where we had the final service to commemorate his ordination—a very special time—that truly reinforced to me once again the potency, persistence and importance of faith in society and our individual lives. These villages had been ravaged for centuries by one bitter war after the next, a constant cycle of upheaval, violence and heartache, but there was one thing that could never be stripped away through the millennia of struggles, one thing that sustained these stoic communities. It wasn't the governments that came and went with the wind and it wasn't the leaders that so promised peace; it was their faith, a faith that routinely stared adversity in the face and prevailed, a faith that held families together. When everything else was a struggle, their faith stood strong.


Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese Maronite Australians brought that faith with them to Australia from as early as the 1860s, but so too did many Greek Orthodox migrants, Coptic Christians from Egypt still being persecuted to this day in their home country because of their faith, Syrian Christians from both Orthodox and Catholic faiths, Armenians, and many Chinese, Korean and Filipino Australians of Catholic, Baptist, Anglican, Presbyterian and Pentecostal faiths. Some brought their faith with them; some found their faith here in Australia. When most of the migrants came to Australia, it was not the government they turned to to assist them to adjust to their new life in Australia. It was their local church; it was their local parish priest; it was their imam; it was whoever in their faith community to whom they turned to support them and their family—it was their religious community.


If you want to understand the strong opposition in Western Sydney and elsewhere to changing the Marriage Act, you must understand the central nature of faith and community to the lives of these and so many other Australians. Nine out of ten of the electorates that voted no are indeed represented by members opposite. They comprise the vibrant faith communities I've just spoken of. I urge all members in this place, but particularly those opposite, to be freed up, to be released from any possible constraint that would enable them to stand with their constituents now in supporting amendments that deliver the protections of religious freedoms that are not currently present in this bill. To pretend this bill is whole and satisfies their concerns is to confirm a lack of understanding and empathy for those who hold them. These Australians are looking for acknowledgement and understanding from this parliament and their representatives. They are seeking assurance that changes being made to our marriage laws will not undermine the stability and freedom of their faith and religious expression, what they teach their children, what their children are taught in our schools, and the values they share and foster with their families and community and within and without the walls of their churches. This is a reasonable request that should be supported by members.


I commend the Prime Minister for initiating the Ruddock review into protecting religious freedoms. Few people understand these communities, and their concerns and the issues and the risks, as well as our former Attorney, the former Father of the House. But that process is not, nor was it designed to be, a substitute for sensible action now in passing amendments to this bill. To fail to make improvements to this bill now would demonstrate a failure to appreciate not only the underpinnings of our very liberal democracy and federation but the nature of modern multicultural Australia.


I commend my colleagues both in the Senate and in this House for standing firm on their convictions and beliefs, and I stand with them—both representing their faith and those in their communities that share those beliefs and values. I will be joining many of my colleagues in supporting amendments to be moved by the members for Deakin, Mitchell, Canning and Mallee, and I'll be joining them in moving amendments also to ensure that no organisation can have their public funding or charitable status threatened as a result of holding views that are consistent with the traditional definition of marriage between a man and a woman. The test of faith is the fruit that it produces. That is what Jesus taught in his parable of the fig tree. The fruit of faith based organisations has been extraordinary in this country: Mission Australia, Wesley Mission, Caritas, Angliss, Anglicare, BaptistCare, our religious schools, and the many Christian organisations involved in providing pastoral support under that excellent program. Their funding through grants and other programs and support through our tax system through deductible gift status must continue to be about what they achieve, not what they consider to be the definition of marriage, and nor should they be discriminated against for holding those views. We need to ensure these protections are put in place in this bill. It is now time to pass a truly inclusive bill, one that recognises the views of 100 per cent of Australians, not just 61 per cent. I urge the House to not miss that opportunity.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (12:43):  It gives me great pleasure to be participating in this debate on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 and to once more, as I will, vote for marriage equality in this country, as I did in September 2012, when this matter last came to be voted on in this chamber. I, along with 41 colleagues, supported a similar bill then and I assuredly will be voting for this bill today. I indicated well before the marriage survey was undertaken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that I would be voting that way in this chamber, should we be given the opportunity. I have not changed my view and I will be voting for this legislation.


I want to make a few comments and I'll just, in short, express my disappointment at some of the ways in which the Prime Minister characterised this debate, as if it were somehow or another a creature of the government. It is not a creature of the government. It is a creature of the parliament. I think the Prime Minister and the way he expressed himself about this being a force from the coalition, effectively, was very ungracious. I don't think it properly accounted for the way in which this parliament is seeking to deal with this legislation.


I want to commend my mate sitting over there—gruff old bugger that he is, the member for Leichhardt—for steadfastly advocating for this position for many years against the forces within his own party. And it's not because of the party; it's because of him and others like him in his party and people across the parliament with similar views that we have this legislation. This is a cross-parliamentary piece of legislation. It does not reside with the government. So I say to the Prime Minister: think again about the way you're portraying this debate. It is not fair, it is not reasonable and it's unacceptable.


And I would say to those who have, as the member for Cook has just done, spoken to us about people of faith and how, in his description of people of faith, they need to be supported by seeking amendments to this legislation to ensure religious freedom: there are many people of faith in this parliament who oppose that view. I am one of them. I'm a Catholic. I was raised a Catholic. I still go to church—not as regularly as I perhaps should but often. And I accept the proposition that it's okay to have different views. I note the words that have been in the public domain by Frank Brennan, referred to earlier by the member for Fowler. It is possible to see this as an issue of equality, not faith. It is a matter of equality, not faith. It's a matter of recognising the rights of every single person to share the same rights as every other person regardless of whether they are straight or a member of the LGBTIQ community.


This has been a tortuous discussion which has taken many years to arrive at this point. And I was actually encouraged yesterday. I shouldn't do it as often as I do, really, but I was flicking through my emails yesterday and I noticed an email from the Anglican bishop for Wangaratta, in Victoria, the Right Reverend A John Parkes AM, who authored a letter co-signed by six other Anglican bishops from across Australia in which they pointed out why it was important for us to support this legislation. If you'll bear with me, I want to read just two paragraphs of this letter. It was addressed to the Prime Minister. 'Given the magnitude of this task in the wake of the marriage proposal survey result, we commend the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 to the parliament for the following reasons. First, it has been available for many months, providing opportunity for scrutiny by all those concerned. Second, it responds directly to a detailed cross-party Senate report from February 2017. We observe that the Senate committee received extensive submissions from all stakeholders. Third, the bill has strong cross-party support. This is vitally important after a testing public debate. Fourth, the bill was passed by the Senate with an overwhelming majority.'


The next paragraph reads: 'The bill also confirms substantive benefits. It preserves the fabric of our antidiscrimination laws, which have been developed over half a century. These give expression to democratic values of equality and fairness. It also accords fulsome recognition of the religious rights and freedoms that underpin a democratic, plural and multicultural society.' Hear, hear! That is why, when it comes to proposing the motions to amend this legislation, I can't put it any better than those Anglican bishops. And that is why, when it comes to voting on amendments to this legislation, I'll be opposing those amendments and I encourage others with a similar view to do likewise. As those bishops have reminded us, this bill is about equality and fairness.


Another element of this is the survey. I'm on the record as being opposed to the survey from the get-go. I still think it was a very flawed process and I'll explain why in a moment. But the Prime Minister said, 'If we'd gone down the government's route of a proposed plebiscite, we would have had this all done and dusted.' Well, if the government had the guts to bring the legislation to the parliament straight after the last election and if we had done our job as we are paid to do, it would well and truly have been done and dusted without any plebiscite or public survey. We are paid to be here representing the people of this country, debating legislation every day. We don't send other pieces of legislation out as public surveys to find out what people think. We take it upon ourselves to accept the responsibility of having those debates in this parliament, expressing a view and then voting one way or the other—and that's what we should have done here.


Nevertheless, the survey was undertaken and, by all accounts, a large number of people participated—but, I have to say, not in my electorate. I made the point prior to this survey being carried out that there would be great difficulty in my electorate. Lingiari is 1.34 million square kilometres and covers all of the Northern Territory except Darwin and most of Palmerston. It includes a large number of Aboriginal communities. Not one of those communities in the bush has household mail delivery. Not one. Most have a mail collection centre. If they're lucky, they might actually get their mail at some point. That assumes, once they get it, that they can read it and understand what's in it. But, of course, we know that a very large number of Aboriginal people in my electorate have English as a second or third language and have a great deal of difficulty reading documents of the type that we would expect them to read in this sort of survey. It's no surprise that the participation rate in Lingiari was only 50.1 per cent.


We've heard a lot across the parliament about young Australians participating in this survey. In my own electorate, the participation rate of 20- to 24-year-olds was only 39.3 per cent. What does that tell you? Does it tell you that they were engaged? Of course not. Does it tell you that they understood what was happening? Of course not. Did they even know what was happening? Probably not. So I don't think this is a fair assessment of the views of my community. Those views might have contradicted my own, but that is not the point here. This survey was supposed to elicit responses from all Australians. We've heard about the high levels of the response rate nationally. But, when I pointed out these concerns well before the survey took place, I was just pooh-poohed—'No, that's not going to happen.' Well, we know what happened. We know that in some places there are allegations of people not understanding what the ballot papers were for and not understanding the nature of the debate. In some local communities, I understand from reports, surveys were burned due to a lack of understanding about what was being asked. We also know of one significant report—and I believe this happened—of one family member going to the postal receipt centre and, in front of the postal workers, filling out large numbers of forms for their family members without authorisation. I made those points at the time and I won't say much more about them, but this was not something which was useful to the people of my communities. Of course, there were a number of videos sent out by the bureau in 13 different languages in my electorate—well, there are about 100 different languages spoken in my electorate, so 13 videos are not going to help much. I am very concerned that this was a $122 million price that we needn't have paid in the first place, but, having done it, we've now got what I think is a very good result, considering that so many people have voted yes. I'm pleased that they have done so, and I know it accords with the majority view across this parliament.


I want to thank those many members of my communities who have engaged themselves in this debate. In particular, I thank one of my own staff for the work she did and what she and her partner had to put up with. There were very negative aspects to some of this campaigning. There was graffiti saying, 'Gay is not okay,' written on large signs along the Stuart Highway not far from my electorate office. This message hits rainbow families—the loving rainbow families who have young children—and vulnerable LGBTIQ people in our community hard. My electorate officer Kirsty Hunt and her partner of 18 years, Amber Sayers, needed to explain to their six-year-old daughter on the way to school that, in fact, it's okay to be gay. That was unnecessary. I also understand the absolute commitment and love that so many gay couples around this country have for one another that will now be recognised in law, as a result of this. It will allow them to do what every other Australian has got the right to do, should they choose to do it, and that's get married. By the way, I'm not married, but I've been in the same relationship for nearly 34 years and we've got four wonderful children. I've got the right to marry, but we've chosen not to. I want every Australian to have the right that I've got, and that is, if they so choose, to marry.


I extend my thanks to the 'yes' campaigners in Lingiari and in the small communities across the Territory, particularly Andrew Addie and Maya Newell in Alice Springs, Pat Honan in the Top End, the gay pride committee and the organisers of the inaugural Darwin gay pride march. I also want to thank two people who I know will see great virtue in, and celebrate, the day we pass this legislation: two Nhulunbuy women, Carley Scott and her partner, Pep Phelan. I've spoken to Carley, and I know how wonderfully important this is to her, as it is to so many people I know and people I have known over generations. They are wonderful people who have gay partners, who are members of the LGBTIQ community and who want to participate and have a loving relationship and be recognised in the law. They should be allowed to do so. This bill will do it. I commend it to the House.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah) (12:58):  I should begin by acknowledging the tireless efforts of the member for Leichhardt to bring about the change that we debate today. I should also note the passion and the commitment of the members for Brisbane, Goldstein and North Sydney and, indeed, of Senator Smith in the other place. I admire the commitment that they have brought to this long campaign and I accept that what they have fought for for so long should now come about.


Yet almost five million Australians voted no in the recent plebiscite and their voices should be heard in this chamber, and their views should also be respected. They are not bigots. They are simply people who are respectful of traditions handed down from time immemorial and slow to change them. It's no secret that I haven't been a supporter of same-sex marriage. I won't be opposing this bill, though, because I respect the verdict of the Australian people as expressed in the postal plebiscite.


When it comes to same-sex marriage, some countries have introduced it via the courts, some via the parliament, and others, Ireland and now Australia, by vote of the people—and that is the best way because it resolves this matter beyond doubt or quibble. To have a plebiscite was in fact an Abbott government decision. We opened the door to change but ensured that change would not lightly be made. I'm pleased that the plebiscite has been continued by the Turnbull government, and I'm also pleased that eventually all sides of this parliament participated fully in it.


There were strong views expressed in the course of the campaign. Some of those strong views were mine. I'm proud of my fellow 'no' campaigners because they gave marriage the good defence that it deserved, but I do congratulate the 'yes' campaign on their victory. There was a lot said beforehand about how divisive this debate would be, but, from where I stood, there was little rancour, no hysteria and no abuse. Certainly there was none from the 'no' campaign.


The overwhelming support for same-sex marriage that the plebiscite showed is a sign of the warm acceptance that Australians have for gay people. There may indeed be a few homophobic individuals lurking amongst us, but no-one should ever again claim that Australia is a bigoted or intolerant country. As the plebiscite abundantly demonstrated, we are as easygoing as any country on Earth, and, whatever your race, your creed, your gender or your sexuality, to be an Australian is well and truly to have won the lottery of life. And, if indeed same-sex marriage does turn out to mean that there are more stable and more lasting relationships in this country, gay as well as straight, then it will have strengthened our social fabric and become something that, once established, a conservative won't just accept but will actually support. So gay people, their parents, their siblings, their children, their wider families and their friends should savour this success, and again I congratulate the 'yes' campaign for its victory.


Now, I would like this to be a unifying moment for our country, and the best way to make this a unifying moment for our country would be to acknowledge the continuing concerns that many decent Australians have about freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of religion and parental rights. The best way to make this a unifying moment for our country would be to ensure that the antigay prejudice of the past is not replaced by a new politically correct bigotry. We certainly don't want new forms of division to replace old ones. And we did see, on the fringes of this recent campaign, some worrying signs of a new intolerance. There was the attempted prosecution of the Archbishop of Hobart for a booklet on the traditional Christian teaching. There was the sacking of a Canberra teenager for supporting marriage on her Facebook page, and there was the persecution of Coopers Brewery merely for hosting a Bible Society debate on the nature of marriage.


More thought should have been given prior to the plebiscite to protecting rights, and that's why I'll be moving the amendment that's been circulated, not to stop this bill but to assert the principle that people should never be discriminated against because of their conscientious views about the nature of marriage. That's why there should be further amendments in the committee stage to protect freedom of conscience, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and parental rights, and I'm pleased that the Prime Minister has indicated that he will support moves to better protect these rights. I hope these amendments will be supported, because surely these are rights and freedoms that all of us in this place believe in. And it should happen now, in the course of passing the same-sex marriage bill, because there should be no gaps in the protections of our fundamental freedoms. And I believe that the passage of the bill, as amended, will enable our country to go forward together, united in decency and in respect for the rights of all.


Now I certainly don't pretend to be an overnight convert supporting same-sex marriage, but I am pledged to respect and to facilitate the verdict of the Australian people. Same-sex marriage should now be recognised. It will now be recognised. There should be a clear distinction between marriage as understood by the church and marriage as recognised by the state. On that basis, I am looking forward to attending the marriage of my sister, Christine, to her partner, Virginia, sometime early in the new year. I move:


That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that it is vital that individuals and entities are not disadvantaged nor suffer any adverse effects as a result of conscientiously holding a particular view of the nature of marriage"".

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (13:06):  I'm proud to stand in support of the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 moved by the member for Leichhardt in this parliament today.


In June 1990, my courageous friend Paul O'Grady, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, came out as a gay man. He was most certainly not the first gay man elected to the New South Wales parliament, but it took until 1990 for someone to have the confidence to declare their sexuality openly. When I discussed this move with Paul, he said very clearly, 'I am who I am.' It was an act of courage that made it much easier for other people in the same circumstance as Paul to openly declare their sexuality. In 1993, three years later, he and his partner, Murray, were attacked and harassed on William Street. Paul O'Grady, a member of the Legislative Council, dialled triple 0. He tried to convince the person on the other end of the phone that he was being threatened by a gang of youths in what was known colloquially as 'poofter bashing', which occurred then and still occurs today. He was hung up on, a member of the Legislative Council.


When we talk about discrimination and the fear in society created by intolerance and hatred, it is important today to recognise the courage of those gay men and lesbian women over decades in which debate was far different to what it is today. People like Paul, I think, couldn't have imagined us having a debate in the parliament with such broad support for marriage equality across the political spectrum. So today I begin by paying tribute to people like Paul; to people like Craig Johnston, a Sydney city councillor; to people like Lex Watson, the academic; to people like Julie McCrossin; to all those people who marched in 1978 in the first Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. They marched not in a parade that was being cheered and shown on national television; they marched in a parade towards a confrontation with police, who locked them up, who assaulted them and who abused them.


Part of the reason that today is so important is that today, in supporting this legislation, we are saying that we are a tolerant nation, that we are a respectful nation and that we are a nation that is stronger because of our diversity. I think it is unfortunate that we will be one of the last advanced industrialised nations to recognise marriage equality when this legislation is passed. Nonetheless, catching up with the rest of the world is a good thing. I pay tribute to all those who did the hard yards—the really hard yards—to get us to this place. 


In 1996, in my first speech in this chamber, I mentioned removing discrimination on the basis of sexuality. In my first term of parliament, after consultation with the gay and lesbian community, I moved the Superannuation (Entitlements of same sex couples) Bill in this chamber. It says something about where the debate was then compared with now that we couldn't even get a debate on that issue; that legislation wasn't even supported by every member of my own party. But what it did was lay some groundwork for a debate within my party about the need to tackle discrimination. And, of course, eventually, under the first term of the Rudd Labor government, we removed some 84 pieces of discrimination that were in legislation. This was discrimination not just in areas like superannuation, but in social security, immigration and health care. 


When I was first elected, there were very real circumstances of partners of loved ones being denied access to their partners when they were in hospital. There were issues whereby couples who shared houses were thrown out of the house that they had lived in with their partner because of non-acceptance by the family of that partner. The scourge, of course, of HIV-AIDS was still having a massive impact—including, of course, taking the life of Paul O'Grady, who showed his courage once again in openly declaring that he was HIV-positive and therefore being able to lead a campaign for the care that was required. Of course, Neal Blewett, as health minister in the Labor government, led the world in responding to the HIV-AIDS epidemic, literally resulting in thousands of lives being saved. 


So, today, this is unfinished business on that march towards equality, in the march towards respect for each other. It is a reminder that society does move forward, although not always in a straight line. Opponents of progress do fight for the status quo. Reactionaries do seek to turn back the gains of the past. But here in this parliament progress is moving forward. Human rights are moving forward. Parliament is not leading in this case, of course; we're following. We are following the voluntary postal ballot that was held. 


I am very proud to support this legislation, and I won't be supporting amendments to this legislation. This has been through the process of a Senate committee. This itself is a compromise to this legislation. It's one that will not have an impact on religious freedom. I'm a strong supporter of religious liberty. People would be aware that, unlike many of my colleagues, at ALP national conferences I have strongly argued, even when I've been in a minority, for these issues to be dealt with as a conscience vote. I firmly believe that that's the case. I've consistently argued that on the ALP national executive regardless of what people who I normally agree with have to say on those matters and I will continue to do so.


But the fact is that people's religious freedom will not be impacted by this legislation just as marriage won't be undermined by this legislation. Indeed, the institution of marriage will be strengthened by this legislation by more people being able to participate in it. During the postal ballot campaign, with people I had respectful discussions with, I indicated that I would support the Dean Smith bill, that it was the model that was there. Those who insisted on having a postal ballot should, I believe, accept the result. We asked Australians for their views, and they gave us their answer. As a result of this legislation, not much will change. All that will happen is that one group of Australians who currently don't have the same rights that I had to marry my life partner, my wife, and other people have to marry their partner of the opposite sex will have the same right to celebrate their lifelong commitment to their partner in front of their family and friends. Weddings are joyful occasions when people come together to witness the affirmation of love, and won't it be a good thing when more people can participate in it?


The issue of religious liberty is one that I take seriously, and I look forward to the deliberations of the committee that has been established under Philip Ruddock and will be reporting next year. I certainly have always been respectful of people who disagree with my position on marriage equality. That is why I've argued for a conscience vote to be the way that this issue and other issues such as this are determined. I don't believe that people should ever be in a circumstance of having to choose between their allegiance to their political party and to their spirituality and their faith. I strongly believe that that's the case. But this legislation will not have any such consequences. Indeed, once this legislation is carried, people will wonder what the fuss was all about, because it won't undermine anyone's existing relationships; it will just strengthen the relationships of people who choose to have their relationships solemnised in a marriage who are in same-sex relationships.


I do want to say this about some of this debate though. Some have sought to speak about how every child in the world needs a mother and a father. We've got a bit of a debate at the moment about citizenship in this parliament as well. People would be aware that I was raised by a single mother and in circumstances whereby, every time I hear that, what I hear is intolerance. What I hear is that somehow some families are better than others. What is truthful is that what matters in a family is love and care. I was in a two-person family and I got from my mother all the love in the world that I—that anyone—could have asked for. People in same-sex relationships with children of same-sex relationships are parents who have gone out of their way to have children and to care for them and love them, and what matters in a family is love. It's as simple as that. No family structure is better than any other, and I really believe that one of the important things about the legislation before us today is that that will be formalised by the parliament.


In conclusion, can I say that this legislation is a good moment in this parliament. Some of the best moments since I've been here, whether I've been on the majority or minority side, have been conscience votes. I think we should have more of them, not less, frankly, whereby parliamentarians can make their contribution. I want to say that it's particularly good to be with people like the member for Sydney, the member for Melbourne Ports and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Penny Wong, in particular, who has shown such courage over a long period of time, in internal and external debates, to get us to the position we're in today. The member for Leichhardt has also shown great courage in advancing this issue within his party, and I pay tribute to him and others who have been prepared to really push this issue and ensure this reform happens. 


It is, however, of course, the Australian people who have led the parliament on this issue. I've been convinced for some time that a majority of Australians had shifted their view to favour marriage equality some time ago. I hear many Australians say: 'I didn't used to support marriage equality. I do now.' I don't know of anyone who has said it to me the other way around—who has changed their mind from 'yes' to 'no'. Australians want us to live and let live. They've decided that as individuals we have no right to cast judgements on love as it is felt by others. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)

"Wood, Jason, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr WOOD
 (La Trobe) (13:21):  Back in 2004 when I was first elected to parliament, I was strongly opposed to same-sex marriage. I did not agree with it, would not support it, and never believed that it would occur in Australia. My views were very much based on my religious views that marriage is simply between a man and a woman. Over the years, right up to 2015, I continued to hold that strong view, and I brushed aside the abusive emails, the phone calls and even the protests outside my office and stood very proudly in firm opposition. I even ignored the views of my former police colleagues that I had to move on with the times, and they regarded me as a dinosaur. This is very interesting, because when I was first a police officer, there were offences for loitering for the purpose of homosexuality, and all police members I knew were firmly opposed to same-sex marriage. 


There were three events which occurred which changed my view. The first was a chance meeting with Chris Tanti, the former CEO of headspace, a foundation that is dedicated to improving the mental health and wellbeing of young Australians. We met in the foyer of parliament, where we were having a discussion about the sad loss of lives in La Trobe due to youth suicide. As part of the conversation, Chris pointed out to me that far more young homosexual males take their own lives than any other demographic group. When I asked why, he told me it was about acceptance. If they felt that they were not accepted, this often led to depression, drugs and finally the loss of life, as they believed they could no longer go on. Very sad indeed. 


The second was a brief conversation over the phone with a long-term friend, Claire Rimmer, who lives with her partner, Anna. When I casually mentioned that I had another wedding to go to, Claire quietly said—and this was on the phone—'I would love to get married.' She did not ask me to change the law, she did not try to pursue the matter, but just left it at that. However, I was a bit shocked, so I asked her why. Claire simply said, 'I love Anna and want to marry her.' They will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of their relationship in April next year and fervently hope to marry on that date. That was the end of the conversation, but it started to make me think, 'Why shouldn't same-sex couples be allowed to marry?' However, I kept on going back to my original thought that marriage is between a man and a woman. 


Finally, when I was out and about in my electorate of La Trobe, I found I was meeting not just same-sex couples but also their families. Sometimes parents of people in same-sex relationships would come into the office and meet with me, telling me about their son or daughter without their knowledge. They would bring photos of their child and their child's same-sex partner. For the first time I started to see that my views of same-sex marriage were causing great sadness to others—not only people in same-sex relationships but also their parents, who, like parents everywhere, want their children to be happy and have fulfilling lives. I then realised it was time for me to seriously rethink this issue, which I did. Following that, I decided I would now support same-sex marriage.


After I announced my change of position in my electorate, I caught up with good friends Jayson McNaughton, a local dentist, and his partner, Stephen Walden, who have been in a relationship for seven years and whom I've known for six. They've always respected our friendship and, again, have never pressured me to change my views on same-sex marriage, despite their belief that they and other same-sex couples experience discrimination because they cannot marry. They would like one day soon to be able to declare their love to the world through marriage. So, when they heard I had revised my view, they were both incredibly happy and excited.


In 2015, I made another decision, which was to ask my electorate for their views on the issue. I decided to run a survey and that, whatever the outcome, I would honour my role as a representative of parliament and follow the wishes of my electorate. As I had changed my own view, I must admit I was hoping for a 'yes' outcome, and the result was that, out of 5,168 constituents who voted, 3,011 voted yes, 2,036 voted no and there were 121 'undecided' responses. So a significant majority of La Trobe residents who responded were in favour of same-sex marriage. The survey brought forth some surprises because it demonstrated how many people from the community supported same-sex marriage—members of the local CFA and football clubs, and a variety of businesspeople. I was even quietly told by some churchgoers and teachers at religiously based schools that the time had come for change.


This sentiment in my electorate was reinforced with the recent national postal vote, with 67.5 per cent of La Trobe's voters signalling that they are in favour of same-sex marriage, which, of course, is noticeably greater than the overall national statistic of 61.6 per cent. I would like to congratulate Minister Peter Dutton, as the postal vote was his idea. I also congratulate and thank Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull for his support in the postal vote. I also congratulate and thank Warren Entsch. When he first raised this in the party room, back in the Howard days, everyone would just look at him and think, 'What are you on about, Warren?' But he is dedicated to making his vision a reality. This national figure of 61.6 per cent support for same-sex marriage brings Australia into close alignment with a number of other nations, such as Canada, which showed support of 70 per cent; France, at 67 per cent; Ireland, with its plebiscite at 64 per cent; the Netherlands, at 64 per cent; New Zealand at 57 per cent; and the UK at 66 per cent.


However, it should also be remembered that not everyone supports same-sex marriage, and in La Trobe 32.5 per cent voted no. The views of those 32.5 per cent are views of the minority now, but they still deserve to have their voices and concerns listened to when it comes to religious freedoms. So here I must point out that I do care about religious freedoms and I do not believe that a celebrant or priest should be forced by law to perform a same-sex marriage if they are against that because of their religious belief. I also respect the right of religiously based schools to select staff with the same values and beliefs as those being taught at their school, and I support the protection of parents. In addition to schools and parents, charities must not be discriminated against because of their firmly-held beliefs. I also believe that the issues not addressed in the same-sex marriage bill must be addressed by the panel chaired by Philip Ruddock that will review protections for religious freedoms.


But ultimately I would like to keep away from all the moral and religious arguments around the issue of same-sex marriage and continue to concentrate on this issue from the point of view of people's health. This takes me to the issue of suicide. Can I say: this was not the main reason for changing my decision to support same-sex marriage, but it was the start of my journey for change as gay people told me about the great stress they were under as they believed they were not accepted in society and that the biggest stumbling block was their inability to marry.

Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (13:30):  I am a proud Queensland Labor member and, after the state election last Saturday, I stand here proud of my Queensland Labor colleagues. The Queensland Premier always said this was going to be a tough election, but Queenslanders knew that Labor was the only party they could trust. It was only Labor that Queenslanders could trust not to sell our assets. It was only Labor that Queenslanders could trust to deliver on local jobs. It was only Labor that Queenslanders could trust to invest in health, TAFE, education, roads, energy and infrastructure.


The Herbert community knew that only Labor would fund the first stage of water security and deliver $215 million for the pipeline duplication. Our community knew that only Labor would deliver the Oasis, a defence hub, and jobs for our veterans, ex-serving personnel and their families. The Herbert community in Queensland remembers the former Newman government Treasurer Tim Nicholls and what he did to Queensland. We remember the 398 cuts Tim Nicholls made to Townsville Hospital and Health Service frontline services. We remember the 197 local TAFE workers sacked under Tim Nicholls.


The Palaszczuk Labor government reinstated frontline health service workers. Labor has a plan for TAFE and jobs—the 'Queensland first' policy for local jobs—and, importantly, our infrastructure spend of $1.6 billion. That will happen under the Palaszczuk Labor government. I congratulate the Premier. She is not only the first woman to win government from opposition, but the first to be re-elected as Premier for a second time. (Time expired)

Can the Prime Minister confirm that since the House last sat, five weeks ago, he has cancelled parliament; ruled out a banking royal commission, then announced a banking royal commission; halted the NBN rollout for two million households; had cabinet ministers calling for investigations into each other over cabinet leaks; and been accused by his own backbenchers of a failure of leadership? When will the Prime Minister admit he's lost control of his government and he's lost all authority as Prime Minister?

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:17):  A lot of things have gone on in the last five weeks and several of them have been overlooked by the Leader of the Opposition, including the result in New England. I have to say, Mr Speaker, the Labor Party put in a strong showing, comfortably ahead of the informal vote. It just got into double figures. Barnaby Joyce's swing was larger than the Labor Party's primary vote! It only happened on Saturday, but I'm not surprised the Leader of the Opposition has blotted it out of his memory.


One of the things that have occurred over the last five weeks that the Leader of the Opposition should not blot out of his memory is what advice he gave to Sam Dastyari before he met with Mr Huang. The Leader of the Opposition should not easily forget Mr Huang, because he visited him at his house last year. So he has a very good familiarity with the gentleman. The Leader of the Opposition remembers very well the function that he attended on 17 June with Senator Dastyari, with Mr Huang. And then, shortly after that, Senator Dastyari had a press conference with Mr Huang in the media briefing room at the Commonwealth parliamentary office in Sydney. There are two lecterns, two podiums, there. Each of them has the Australian coat of arms. Dastyari stood at one; Mr Huang stood at the other.



The SPEAKER:  I just remind the Prime Minister to refer to members by their correct title.




Mr TURNBULL:
  Senator Dastyari stood at one; Mr Huang stood at the other. It was there that Senator Dastyari said these words, apparently written for him by someone else:


The South China Sea is China's own affair. On this issue Australia should remain neutral and respect China's decision.


This came after Mr Huang had paid off some debts for Senator Dastyari. It reads like the talking points from the Global Times in Beijing. That's what it was: Senator Dastyari contradicting Australian government policy and Labor Party policy on the South China Sea. Well, he got sacked for that. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition, as he trolls through the last five weeks, could remember what advice he gave Senator Dastyari that prompted him to tell Mr Huang how to avoid surveillance by ASIO.

Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (14:34):  My question is to the Prime Minister. On 17 November at the handing down of the report into the Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory, Minister Scullion stated that the government would develop a response not only for the Northern Territory but every jurisdiction in Australia. Considering that young Indigenous people are 27 times more likely to be in prison than non-Indigenous young people and that we are hearing allegations of abuse similar to those at Don Dale across Australia, urgent action is needed. Will you reaffirm the government's commitment to national leadership on youth justice and detail when the government will action the findings of the royal commission? I acknowledge Amnesty International are here today and they are eager, as I am, for your reply.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:34):  I thank the honourable member for her question. The government, as you know, acted swiftly to establish the royal commission in July 2016, following reports of the mistreatment of children at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre. I want to thank Commissioners Margaret White and Mick Gooda for their dedication to this difficult but also very important task. I also want to acknowledge, on behalf of the government, the individuals, expert witnesses and government and non-government representatives who came forward to give evidence to the royal commission.


My government will now consider the recommendations made in the report and work with the Northern Territory government—in respect of whose activities most of the recommendations apply—key stakeholders and communities to inform the development of our response. Most of the recommendations, as I noted, are matters for the Northern Territory government. I'm sure the honourable member is familiar with them. The Australian government will now also carefully consider the findings that are directed to the Commonwealth. We've already committed to ratifying the optional protocol to the Convention Against Torture, which will ensure that oversight of places of detention, including youth detention, is strengthened in the Northern Territory, and, of course, everywhere else.


When children are safe, the whole community benefits as well. This is our greatest obligation: to look after our children. We understand that. All children deserve to be treated with dignity and respect and all children deserve to be safe. That's the responsibility of the whole community and, importantly, families and government agencies.


I want to make an observation to the honourable member's benefit about funding. I quote from the royal commission:


A consistent theme heard by the Commission was that there is insufficient funding in the Northern Territory to address the issues it is grappling with. However, having reviewed financial data available to the Commission, the Commission considers that the underlying problem is not the level of overall funding but that Commonwealth and Northern Territory Government investment is not rigorously tracked, monitored or evaluated to ensure that it is appropriately distributed and directed. Value for the money expended cannot be demonstrated.


The major investment in Aboriginal affairs over many years has delivered mixed success, often with dismally poor returns. The combination of under-performing programs, poor coordination across governments and a lack of engagement with Aboriginal people in the design and delivery of services is producing continually poor results. The approach must be changed.


We absolutely recognise the force of that observation. As you know, in 2017-18 the Northern Territory government will receive $4.2 billion from the Commonwealth. We are determined to ensure that every dollar that we spend on Indigenous affairs and Indigenous welfare delivers the right outcomes that we need. I want to thank the honourable member for her question. It's a very important report and we're working to deliver a very comprehensive response.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (15:42):  I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 


""the resolution of the Senate be agreed to"".


This is a very straightforward and sensible motion that has been moved by the Senate and agreed to by the Senate. It is not a motion that has been agreed by only one party; otherwise it would not have got through the Senate. This is a motion that has enjoyed widespread support across the political spectrum within the Senate because it deals with the desperate situation that is currently unfolding at Manus. It deals with what can only be described as an emergency, a humanitarian emergency, where several hundred people have been put in situations where the basic conditions of life for them are now under threat.


There were, as people would know, several hundred refugees in the camp at Manus when it was deemed to be closed on an arbitrary deadline by the government. When it was closed, the men who were there said, 'We're not prepared to be moved, because we are concerned about our safety in the place that we are going to.' And it wasn't by any means an ill-founded concern. They had this concern on the basis of what had happened to them in the months and/or years leading up to this. There have been reports of assaults. We know that people have even gone further than that, at great risk to their life and sometimes fatally. And we know that they were concerned about moving to another place where the facilities were not ready. They said that they were not going to move. When they said they were not going to move, they were met with the fiercest of responses, sanctioned by this government. I'll come back to this point, because the government wants to have it both ways. On the one hand, the government says that they're not our problem, Australia's problem, and that what happens to them is purely a matter for PNG. On the other hand, of course, we've got the government standing in the way of a potential resolution.


In any event, what happened to those people after they made the decision to say, 'We are concerned about our safety and we are not prepared to move'? What we know is that, after that, forces went in and the basic conditions of life for these men—access to water, for example—were cut off. They had jury-rigged water tanks to catch the water that was falling to make sure that they could collect it and it was then converted to a drinkable form. They had done that themselves. What happened? We have reports that water was tampered with. The barrels that they were using were tampered with in a way that meant that they couldn't even collect water any more. Electricity was turned off on them, and they were denied other basics of life, including medicine. We had many reports of people who were unable to get the medicine that they needed.


We were getting these reports in real time and, as far as possible, the Australian and international media was reporting on what had happened there. But of course, because of restricted access, including increasingly restricted access over the time that they were there, the Australian public was forced to rely, in many instances, on the firsthand reports. Not only did we have the firsthand reports; we had the United Nations staff who have been on site. The United Nations staff, when they were on site, said, 'Yes, the men's concerns have some validity; it is right that they have concerns about their health and wellbeing.'


Crucially, the United Nations also backed up, as did many other observers, that these men have a very well-founded concern about where they're meant to be moved to, because these places are simply not ready. We're not talking, as the minister has said publicly, about paving around a patio; we're talking about whether or not these new places that the minister wants to move them to are fit and safe places to live. The report suggests they're not, and the men certainly have a well-founded fear of that.


So we have this terrible, terrible situation where several hundred wretched souls are now struggling to meet the basic conditions of life, and their lives are at risk. There are many different views about how we got here. The Greens' position on that has been made crystal clear—the Greens' position about the camps, the history of these camps, how we've got here and the supervision that has led them to this point. But the reason that this resolution passed the Senate is that, whatever part of the political spectrum you sit on, people are now coming to the view that the way these men are being treated is just not right and that we need a better way of dealing with them. We need to deal with them. Whatever one wants to do about broader immigration policy, about which there are going to be fierce debates in this place and elsewhere, we need to do something about these men. I personally would prefer that they be brought here, and I know many other people in this country would prefer that. I suspect I probably wouldn't win a vote in this chamber to say they should be brought here.


But fortunately, for at least a proportion of those men, we now don't have to resolve that. The government's in a position where, if it's serious about looking after these people, it can in a sense have its cake and eat it too. We, the Greens, will continue to oppose the government's policies, but let's say the government wants to keep its policies. We now have an option on the table from New Zealand. New Zealand has said that it will resettle 150 of those refugees, and it would begin work to expedite processing those refugees if and when the offer is accepted. That offer and that proposal to resettle them in many ways has parallels with what the government has done with respect to the United States. I, and many other members of parliament, might have very strong disagreements about how the government is conducting itself, but if the government is prepared to negotiate a deal that will see some of the men move to the United States then why on earth can't there be a similar arrangement that allows these men to go to New Zealand? Why isn't the government exploring it?


So I simply ask: what have you got, Minister, against them going to New Zealand? We're not saying, in this motion, to bring them here. The Senate's not saying that. I would disagree with the arguments, but I could understand the arguments that would flow. The government would talk about how we've got to maintain our borders, the people smugglers' business model and the like. I disagree with that argument, but I presume that's what the government would say if the question was to bring them here. But the question is not that. The question is whether we will facilitate the offer that New Zealand has made.


In that context there can be no good reason for not doing so. If the government is prepared to send people from Manus to the US, the government should also be prepared to send people from Manus to New Zealand. We know it's a bona fide offer that has been put on the table.


This motion is a motion stripped of rhetoric, and that's why it has passed the Senate. It is a motion that is stripped of messages of condemnation and so on and it's a motion that steps outside the high-level debate that we will have about what is the best immigration policy for this country and asks very simply: why can't these men go to New Zealand? I know the minister makes the point publicly when he appears on television and says, 'We're not going to be bullied or blackmailed into bringing people here.' I disagree with that point vehemently, but I reiterate that that is not what we are talking about right now. We are talking about whether or not people will be allowed to go to New Zealand and whether the government will facilitate it.


If the government says, 'This is really PNG's problem; it's not ours,' then the government should make it clear to all concerned that it is not standing in the way and that, if PNG and New Zealand want to reach an arrangement, it doesn't mind. But, if the government steps in and says, 'No; actually, we're going to stop this from happening,' then how in good conscience can that be done?


The government loves to parade the figure of how many people have previously died at sea. That figure is a contested one. What cannot be ignored is that there are now several hundred sitting in Manus and the New Zealand government has offered to take some of them. The fate of those souls is in this parliament's hands, and this House should concur with what the Senate has asked. (Time expired)

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (15:52):  I rise to support the amendment to the motion and I applaud the member for Melbourne. This motion passed the Senate with the support of crossbenchers, the Greens and the Labor Party. On 5 November this year the New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, reaffirmed New Zealand's generous offer to resettle 150 eligible refugees from across both Manus and Nauru. It's an offer that Labor believes the Turnbull government should accept, and they should, as per the motion put in the Senate, begin to negotiate on terms similar to the US refugee resettlement agreement, to ensure people smugglers do not exploit vulnerable people and people can get off Manus and Nauru.


These places were set up as regional transit processing facilities. Unfortunately, under the government they've become places of indefinite detention because of their failure to negotiate third-country resettlement options. They have negotiated one in relation to the US, and now we have an offer on the table from New Zealand. Labor's asylum policy is different from the Greens' and from the government's. It's clear we don't want the people smugglers back in business, and therefore Labor's position differs with the Greens' in terms of resettlement options concerning Australia.


We do believe in strong borders, offshore processing, regional resettlement and turn-backs when safe to do so. It's clear the government has been in office for more than four years but not in power on this issue. The government has failed to negotiate other third-country resettlement options. Labor strongly supports the US refugee resettlement agreement, which would see up to 1,250 refugees approved and sanctioned by the UNHCR from Manus and Nauru resettled in the United States.


At the time of the US agreement being announced, Paris Aristotle, known to many people in this place, an eminent person, the Chair of the Minister's Council on Asylum Seekers and Detention, told The Australian newspaper about the need for other third-country resettlement options, saying:


That is appropriate and necessary because not everyone ultimately will be picked by the US. There will be a number of cases that will not be successful …


The New Zealand Prime Minister said at the time, reaffirming New Zealand's offer:


… we want to assist as much as we are able in expediting resolution on this issue …


The motion from the Senate is about expediting third-country resettlement for eligible refugees on Manus and Nauru—something the government has failed to prioritise.


In February 2013, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard brokered a deal with then conservative New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to resettle 150 refugees annually who had arrived irregularly in Australia by boat. So the New Zealand offer being made by the New Zealand government currently is not new. At the time, New Zealand said they would work closely with Australia as part of a regional approach to irregular migration, with the arrangement to be within New Zealand's Refugee Quota Program. This original plan was for New Zealand to resettle 150 refugees annually, commencing in 2014, with allocations formalised in the New Zealand program for both the 2014-15 and 2015-16 financial year intakes.


The former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, the member for Warringah, then scrapped the plans once he was elected in 2013—a wrong decision, in our view. If the agreement with New Zealand had been allowed to proceed by the then Abbott government and continued by the Turnbull government, upwards of 600 eligible refugees would have been resettled in New Zealand as of this year. It's clear that Labor was supporting the New Zealand resettlement arrangement for a long time back in the days of Julia Gillard and has continued to under opposition leader Bill Shorten. We're offering the government support for a New Zealand resettlement offer to get these people off Manus Island and Nauru and resettled as quickly as possible. We urge the government to begin negotiating conditions similar to the US refugee resettlement arrangement.


The irony of all of this is that the government won't release the US refugee resettlement agreement. Labor's been calling on the government to do this. If the government can negotiate a US refugee resettlement arrangement without any pull factors in terms of people smugglers, surely—surely—it's within their wit and wisdom to negotiate similar terms and conditions with our friends across the Tasman. Even the Prime Minister's own backbench have called on him to accept the offer, with former Liberal immigration minister Kevin Andrews, the member for Menzies, saying:


We should give consideration to what New Zealand is offering …The reality is that we have an intractable problem at the present time.


Yes, the United States are going to take some of these people, but there's still a large number there. The current immigration minister has already agreed to terms and conditions with the United States government that he believes will prevent people smugglers using that particular agreement as part of a way of exploiting vulnerable people. We've long called on the government to release the terms and conditions of the US refugee resettlement arrangement, but, despite their refusal to release the full details, we know that the US refugee resettlement agreement is a one-off. It's up to 1,250, and there are more eligible refugees.


We thank for their cooperation the Nauruan government and the PNG government. We also thank the UNHCR for the work they're doing. But the offer is only available for those refugees on Manus and Nauru, and the government should have lifted the bar for those people from Manus and Nauru here in Australia. Conditions which would be essential, in our view, would be to ensure that there are no pull factors, and the government should negotiate that.


Last Monday, 27 November, the New Zealand Prime Minister made clear her stance on people smugglers:


We have sent a clear message to people smugglers, and that is that the full force of the law should come down on anyone who exploits people who are vulnerable by taking money, risking their lives by taking to the ocean … The argument that people smugglers will then use that as an excuse to continue to smuggle … you could … make that argument for the United States as much as you could New Zealand.


In this the New Zealand Prime Minister affirms what the member for Melbourne is saying and what I'm saying here today: those same arguments don't hold water, and the government has a false argument here.


It should be noted that, following the announcement of the US refugee resettlement agreement, the government took steps to increase Australia's border security, describing it as the largest peacetime border security mission, to ensure people smugglers wouldn't exploit vulnerable people. We applaud what the government did in that regard. If an asylum seeker gets on a boat, they should be turned around and resettled elsewhere. They're not being resettled here under a Labor government. The government has pursued, negotiated and accepted appropriate conditions on the US refugee resettlement agreement. Similar conditions can be negotiated. The government can no longer sit on its hands waiting for the US agreement to transpire, when only 54 people have gone. There could be some more to come shortly, according to the minister, but only 54 people have gone. People seem to be waiting indefinitely there.


This is a government woefully incompetent at the management of offshore processing arrangements. We know that the Manus Regional Processing Centre was ordered to close, in accordance with a decision of the Supreme Court of PNG, in April 2016. A full-year later, in April 2017, the Prime Ministers of both Australia and Papua New Guinea confirmed the RPC would close on 31 October this year. By that closure date the government hadn't made everything ready, and failed to be upfront about access to essential services and alternative accommodation for asylum seekers and refugees. The lack of assurance led to the stand-off we've seen on our TV screens and in the media. Now that all the men have moved from the old RPC to alternative accommodation, this government has a moral obligation to ensure refugees have access to essential services in the alternative accommodation—food, water, security, health and welfare services—but we also have a moral obligation, as set out recently by the PNG Supreme Court. It's time we moved forward, it's time we accepted the New Zealand offer, it's time the government released the US refugee resettlement agreement, it's time the government, in its fifth year in office, became the government in power in terms of offshore processing and regional resettlement, did their job and stopped blaming Labor for their failures.

Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (16:02):  I support the amendment from the member for Melbourne. The treatment of asylum seekers is an important issue in my electorate and is a matter of strong views. I understand the problem, I understand the need to break the business model, I understand the need to not send the wrong message to the community and I understand the importance of protecting our borders—that's really clear—but I also get the call from my electorate for compassion, for kindness and for Australians to be their best selves, and I believe these are not mutually exclusive. A meeting took place on Thursday night in the town of Beechworth in my electorate, where a gathering of 48 people signed a petition and asked me to bring a message to parliament:


This petition of certain citizens of Australia from the Victorian municipality of Indigo and adjacent municipalities and communities draws the attention of the House to:


a) The plight of people who have sought asylum in Australia but have been prevented by present Commonwealth law from enjoying its refuge;


b) Our abiding concern that the Commonwealth, in its administration of such law and its consequent arrangements with the governments of Papua New Guinea and the Republic of Nauru, continues to cause these people grave distress, indignity and discomfort; and


c) The aspiration of many Australians in rural communities that the Commonwealth should relieve these people of such anguish.


The petition goes on, and I will make sure that the minister gets a copy, but that is my heartfelt plea to the parliament today. This offer from New Zealand, our neighbouring country, shows us they have a heart, they have feelings and they're willing to help us. The call from my constituents is, 'Please, listen to that offer of neighbourly help that they've given us.' The offer from New Zealand, to take 150 people when we have a much bigger problem, is clearly not the answer.


I totally get that the government is working with America and that the aim is to close Nauru and Manus—and we want that done as quickly as possible. In the interim, I ask the minister here, with the passion of the people in my electorate and those here today, particularly members of Rural Australians for Refugees: can we find compassion, kindness and a way of working with these asylum seekers that does not punish them? I'm grateful to New Zealand for this offer and to the Senate for considering the motion. I will be supporting it when it comes up for voting.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (16:05):  I've just come out of the election campaign in Queensland. If ever I've seen a red-hot issue which will turn the face of politics in Australia upside down, it is the issue of the boat people. Far be it from me to give praise to the Liberal Party—once a year I do it and it's at Christmas time—but they have done a good job here. There were thousands of boat people coming in; now there's not. They have to get the credit for it. The people on the other side get the condemnation for it. The position of the Australian people is quite clear. They don't want them here.


You can cry and howl and say, 'I'm so sorry for these people.' Well, I feel a little bit sorry for the Jewish people in Australia who are now sending their kids to school under armed guards. I asked one man, a rabbi, 'Have you ever been attacked personally?' He said, 'Yes, I was beaten up by three them.' He said, 'My family home'—they are a very prominent Jewish family in Sydney—'was firebombed.' I said, 'Well, I don't believe that,' and he said, 'I'd expect you to say that,' and held up a picture on his phone. There was a picture of them going to church—I think they call it synagogue—on Saturday or Sunday or whenever they go. This bloke of Middle Eastern appearance—I myself could claim to be of Middle Eastern or Aboriginal appearance—runs up and grabs him by the shirt and starts screaming out: 'You will pay homage to Allah. You will go down on your knees and you will get out of this country now.' Then he started face-butting this poor person who was just going to church on Saturday or Sunday or whenever it was. The man I was speaking to said, 'You can ring up the police and ask about that incident.'


So here are a family that send their kids to school under armed guard and have had their house firebombed. Their synagogue allocates $15,000 per year to clean the graffiti off the walls of the synagogue. Who was responsible for Australian people of Jewish descent being persecuted in this country? Who brought the persecutors in? I don't notice too many Sikhs coming into the country. Heaven only knows they have a claim to being refugees, with 84,000 murdered in one year. I don't notice them coming in. I don't notice Christians coming in. I don't notice the Jews coming in. So it seems quite okay for the people over here to bring in the persecutors but not to worry at all about the persecuted people in the Middle East. There's not a single person in this place, in all honesty, who could say that Christians are not being persecuted in the Middle East. 


Now we have 2,000 dying at sea—well, with the policies that I ascribe to, those 2,000 people wouldn't have died. So let it be upon your conscience. The realities and practicalities of this situation are that, if they attempt to get here, many of them will die. To say they're refugees is quite fascinating to me because, if you get a globe out, you will see that the Middle East is on that side—at nine o'clock, if you like—and, on the other side of the globe, at three o'clock, is Australia. If you're a refugee, you flee across the border. There are 20 million refugees in Europe, all of them in nations surrounding either Russia or Germany. They were genuine refugees. There were 12 million refugees in Europe 20 years after the war; they were still there. But they didn't get in a boat and go right around to the other side of the world. That's not a refugee—that's not a person 'fleeing from'; that is a person 'going to'.


And you say, 'Why do they want to come here?' Well, I'm not going to put any conspiracy theories or nefarious interpretations upon why they want to come here. I just simply want to say that they are involved in fighting and upheavals over there. I think that, if I was a freedom fighter here in my country, if it was invaded, and if I then became a refugee, I wouldn't stop freedom fighting—no, not me! I'd continue freedom fighting from the country in which I lived. And if that country tried to stop me from freedom fighting, I suspect I wouldn't be too happy with the country stopping me from freedom fighting. I think there's over 200 supposedly-Australian people fighting in the Middle East at the present moment—not for this country but for some other country.


Why do they want to come here? Well, there are 72,000 reasons for that, aren't there? If you're a husband and wife with three kids then welfare, health and all the other things put together are worth about $72,000. These people are coming from countries with an average income of under $5,000. So I think it would be a very good idea to come here, and I'm not putting any nefarious or conspiracy-theory interpretations upon that.


There are two countries—and I just haven't written down one, but the big one is Saudi Arabia—that will not take Middle Eastern refugees. One is Saudi Arabia, and the other is another Middle Eastern country. Arguably the biggest country in the Middle East is Saudi Arabia—or one of the three biggest, anyway—and it won't take any refugees at all. I mean, it knows what's going on over there, and it says no. If you say no, and you force people to understand that, 'No, you will never enter the waters of Australia if you attempt to get here; we'll just keep turning you back,' then people will know not to come, and those like the 2,000 who died at sea will simply not die.


I love my fellow crossbench brother, but I think it's a little bit disingenuous when he says, 'We just want them to go to New Zealand,' because the minute they get to New Zealand, of course, they have access to Australia. So really what we're saying is, 'You can now come to Australia.'


It was with deep regret that people like me in this place did not support the ALP proposal, which was the Malaysian solution. Looking back on it—and mea culpa, mea culpa—I think I should have backed it, and I didn't look at the proposal on its merits. But that was a very acceptable proposal. They were going to a Muslim country, where, presumably, they would have been a lot more happy and content than they would have been in a fairly hostile atmosphere in Australia, as people from a different cultural milieu completely. And these people—whether you agree with their religion or not—are very, very religious people, and I don't know whether we could describe ourselves as very religious people. So the government, for once, can be totally proud of their record—that they stopped people from coming to this country and stopped 2,000 deaths at sea. And this is my final statement on the matter.


In the pub they said, 'It's all right going on in Sydney, but eventually it'll come up here.' I said, 'Listen, drongo, it's already here!' They said, 'What do you mean?' I said, 'There were three people in my electorate murdered, with a bloke shouting out, ""Allahu akbar!"" while he was murdering them with a knife. They were backpackers, working outside Dalby, and happened to be in the Kennedy electorate.' And he used a rather vulgar expression, as my mother would describe it, and I won't repeat that expression, but he was quite astounded, as were the other blokes in the pub, that it was right here in North Queensland. I don't think it's confined to down south.


There's a terrorist incident every three months now. To whom do we attribute those deaths—the murder of those three innocents outside of Dalby? Who was responsible for that? Well, if you're in this place and you make decisions, then you are responsible for those decisions. I want to see a very close parliament in the next election. So I would urge the people on the Labor side: do not continue to pursue these politics, because you might be up against the boneless bunch over here, but they might just get a bit smart with the terror of an election around the corner! It is not a matter of politics, though I would argue that it should be; it is a matter of protecting the integrity of our nation. That is not occurring, and will not occur, when proposals like this are agreed to.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (16:15):  I want to say on behalf of the government that we oppose this motion, and so should the Labor Party. The Labor Party should already have learnt its lessons in relation to this area of public policy. It presided over the most significant failure in public policy in recent years, and the result of that failure of public policy was felt both in human costs and in financial costs. We know that 50,000 people arrived on 800 boats and that 1,200 people drowned at sea and that the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd failings, supported by the Greens in government, have already cost the Australian taxpayers in excess of $12 billion.


We have a lot of work to do to clean up Labor's mess. I didn't put people on Manus Island; my job is to get them off it. I intend to get them off as quickly as possible, but I need to do it in a way where we don't see new boat arrivals commencing. All of the intelligence available to me from across the region indicates that we have 14,000 people in Indonesia ready to hop on boats now. We have credible information out of other markets that says people smugglers are putting this proposition to vulnerable men, women and children to pay money: 'Ultimately, you'll stay in Manus for a couple years and then come to Australia.' The latest, of course, is, 'You can go to New Zealand, become a New Zealand citizen and then come to Australia shortly thereafter.' We are not going to allow that to happen.


The Greens can wax all they want. They can move their position around. They can offer sanctimonious advice to the government. They can offer false hope to people in Manus. But they are not going to change the will of this government to see people smugglers put out of business. The success that we've achieved in relation to this area of public policy has resulted in the largest number of offshore entrants into our country since 1983: over 20,000 people arrived under the humanitarian refugee program last year alone. Going to the member for Kennedy's proposition about those being persecuted in the Middle East at the moment, we've been able to help some 12,000 people under the Syrian and Iraqi intake, including women from the Yazidi community—one of the most persecuted minorities in the world—and we should be very proud of the success we've had in settling those people in our country. But that would not be possible if the boats were still turning up, if a thousand people per week were still being pulled off boats on Christmas Island, as was the case under the Labor government.


I was astounded by the contribution from the member for Blair during the course of this debate. It showed to me that he either doesn't have a grasp of the basics of the issue that we're dealing with or has not taken the time to properly consider what it is that we have contemplated and what it would be for him to contemplate if he were to be successful at the next election. Let me be very clear: if we send people to New Zealand today, then, based on the intelligence that I have received, including out of Manus Island in recent weeks, the boats would restart. There is no question in my mind. We have people in Manus at the moment who were on a pathway to the United States and who have said, in light of the announcement by the New Zealand government, that they are now reconsidering their option to go to the United States because they'd prefer to go to New Zealand. That is a terrible situation and one that the government is not going to allow to continue in the minds of those on Manus Island.


We have 1,250 places that are available for people to go from Nauru and Manus to the United States. The first 54 have gone. The United States has made announcements in recent days, both negative and positive hand-downs on Nauru and Manus, and we will see a further uplift of people go in the not-too-distant future. There is no push back from the United States at all, and we thank them very much for the support that they have provided to us in helping to clean up Labor's mess. As I said, I did not put people on Manus Island. I've not had a death at sea, and it's been more than 1,200 days since we've had a successful people smuggling venture; however, we are seeing efforts in this regard by the people smugglers.


We haven't ruled out the option of sending people to New Zealand at some point, but we would have to, firstly, reassure ourselves that people weren't going to use New Zealand as a backdoor entry to come into Australia. It's a fact that, of the 31 boats we've stopped and turned back in recent times, four were on their way to New Zealand. So New Zealand is marketed as a destination as well, because they have a generous welfare system, health system, education system and housing system like we do in Australia. So we haven't ruled it out, and suggestions by the Greens and others that we haven't properly contemplated that option are a complete nonsense. Frankly, that they would put it forward for their own political gain at the expense of those people on Manus Island says more about the Greens than it does about anybody else in this debate.


But the Greens are here today having this debate because they were supported by the Labor Party in the Senate and here on the floor today. In fact, the very words of the member for Blair in this debate were that he congratulated the member for Melbourne. The disaster that the Labor Party and the Greens presided over during the Rudd-Gillard years would be replicated by a Shorten government if they were to be elected at the next election. It's clear that many on the frontbench of the Labor Party, and on the backbench, would revert to the old policy—that is, they would allow people come to Australia from the regional processing centres.


We've seen Kristina Keneally out in Bennelong in recent weeks. We've seen her public utterances as far back as 2011 that people should come to Australia, which is a green light for people smugglers. If people believe that Kristina Keneally is not representative of the majority view, I think, within the Labor Party caucus—and certainly in left wing of the Labor Party—then they're kidding themselves. The fact is that Labor would bring people from regional processing centres to Australia. The fact is that they have already declared that they would reintroduce permanent protection visas. Part of our success has been the introduction of temporary protection visas. It is abundantly clear to all of us who deal with these matters each day that Labor in government would again not have the mettle to deal with turning back boats where it's safe to do so. There is no question in my mind whatsoever that Labor would return to the failed policies that saw 1,200 people drown at sea.


We have been compassionate in the numbers of refugees that we've brought to our country. We have been strong and determined in saying that we are not going to allow those deaths at sea to recommence. And yet Labor stands here today, complicit with the Greens, reminding all Australians that it has learnt nothing. To those Australians in Bennelong who I know are concerned about this issue at the moment, please be assured that Labor has learnt nothing from the past failures. The Labor Party under Bill Shorten has learnt nothing from the Rudd-Gillard years. The fact is that human lives were lost and they would be lost at sea again.


We have considered every option on the table. There is no easy option in this regard. There's no easy option that I have before me that can just allow people to come here or allow them all to go to New Zealand, and the matter will be resolved and we'll never hear from the people smugglers again. As the United Nations points out, there are 65 million people in the world today who are displaced. On top of the disaster that we've seen in the Mediterranean, we would see those pathways open up again between Jakarta and Christmas Island, and I am not going to allow it to happen.


We need to work with people to provide settlement support. We provide settlement packages, paid for by the Australian taxpayer, for people to go back to their countries if they've been found not to be refugees. We've provided support to the Papua New Guinean government—and I praise the work of the PNG government and thank them for their partnership, and also the government of Nauru. We have provided support to open three new centres. The East Lorengau centre has been open for something like three years. It can accommodate 440 people. There are 305 refugees there in there at the moment, and Labor and the Greens try to tell us that the centre is not open—that it's not finished and not completed. It's a complete and utter nonsense.


For the Labor Party, the Greens and the advocates to hold out false hope to those people on Manus, that the policy of the government will change and that some day they'll come to Australia, is a disgrace. They have for years offered false hope to people who have doubled down on their efforts to stay there, in situ, and not to remove themselves from the RPC, and say that the conditions are squalid and that they won't move, because they thought that would provide leverage and an outcome in coming to Australia. It is not going to happen. We will provide support to those people to move to the United States or to move to third countries or to move back to their country of origin if they've been determined not to be refugees. But we are not going to allow the Labor Party, in concert with the Greens again, to dismantle those policies which meant—and I'm very proud of this fact—that we got every child out of detention and closed 17 detention centres. If another boat turns up tomorrow under this government, or if the Labor Party is successful at the next election, those people are going into detention Regardless of whether they are women, children or men, they will go into detention on Nauru. That's the reality of the circumstance we face.


The people smugglers have not gone out of business. They are there and they treat people with the same disdain that they do any other commodity. They see money in moving people; they couldn't care whether they go to the bottom of the ocean or whether they end up in Australia, New Zealand, Manus Island or anywhere else. We are not going to allow those people to get back in control of the situation.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",IND,2017-12-04,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (16:25):  I agree with the majority view in the Senate, and I support the member for Melbourne's motion that would see those of us in this place agree with the message from the Senate. It is self-evident that the situation on Manus Island is dire. There has now been an abundance of media reports and an abundance of reports from firsthand witnesses who have seen the conditions on Manus Island. They have seen the way in which hundreds of men, many of whom who have already been found to be refugees, are living in squalid conditions. I simply do not accept the words from the minister when he says that all is well there, because the fact is there are just too many reports from people who are saying the situation is dire and hundreds of men are living in squalid conditions, many in fear of their lives. That we would allow this to continue is inhuman. That we would refuse a generous offer from the government of New Zealand to voluntarily resettle at least some of those men, that we would refuse that offer, is inhuman.


It's time for the government to swallow its pride. I simply do not accept that the resettlement of 150 men in New Zealand needs to be a fast-track pathway to this country. It need not be that way. The fact is the government needs to swallow its pride and act in accordance with the majority view of the Senate and, near on, the majority view in this place—perhaps the majority view in this place if there was to be a conscience vote on this issue. The fact is that we, as a country, need to have a legal and ethical response to people who are fleeing for their lives. Let's not forget that most people who come to this country claiming to be fleeing for their lives are found to have been fleeing for their lives. What's so hard about this country starting to act like the law-abiding, rich, fortunate and ethical country that we would like to think we are? What's so hard for us about acting ethically and legally? Why can't we start honouring the commitments we've made in any number of international agreements—agreements like the refugee convention and agreements like the Rome Statute? When we signed up to these international agreements we did so because we thought they mattered. But they don't seem to matter now because we have a government which is more inclined to pander to the xenophobia and to the racism in this community in a race to the bottom of the barrel.


While I'm very heartened and pleased that the opposition, the Labor Party, is supportive of the motion by the member for Melbourne, I also call on the opposition to lift your game too. The fact is there should be no place for mandatory detention. There should be no place for offshore processing. There should be no place for any sort of temporary visa. There should be no place for the tow back of boats to countries like Indonesia. What there should be is an intelligent, legal and ethical response so that when people come to our shore by any means—by air or by boat—and they claim to be fleeing for their lives, we should give them protection. We should hear their claim, and we should give them permanent refuge if their claim is found to be accurate. That's what we should be doing.


If there are people in this community who don't like that legal and ethical response, it's our job in this place to start acting like leaders and to explain to the broad Australian community why we need to act in accordance with international law and why we need to act like a fortunate, rich and lucky country, one with morals and scruples, because it's not good enough to pander to those people who would disagree with that in the community. It's time to be leaders.


You know what? When I'm out in my community in the Denison electorate, sometimes someone will come up to me and say the most awful things about asylum seekers—call them all of sorts of things—hardly the worst of which is 'illegals', and says, 'They're all terrorists. They should all be sent back home.' I say to these people almost every time: 'Hang on, do you agree that if anyone from anywhere in the world is genuinely fleeing for their life, we should grab hold of them, protect them and look after them?' Without fail, they say: 'Of course we should!' And then I turn the conversation around a bit more and say: 'But that's what we're doing; that's all we're doing. When people come to this country, by any means, and claim to be fleeing for their life, we should give them protection and hear their claim.' If their claim is accurate—and it most often is—we should then give them permanent refuge. We shouldn't send them off to Nauru, Manus Island or anywhere else. Nauru and Manus Island have become our modern day prison hulks—like the hulks that were used in the Thames for convicts. This is a blot on our country's name and our reputation—and will be forever.


But we can start to turn it around. It is a decent and generous offer by the government of New Zealand to resettle some of these men. Why can't the government act like human beings? Swallow your pride and say yes. It is not good enough, Minister, to hide behind that old government line: 'We've got very secret information which we can't share you. You've just got to trust us.' That's what happened in 2003, when we went to war. The government then said: 'We've got very secret information. We can't share it with you. You've just got to trust us.'


When it comes to asylum seeker policy, there is no trust left. The community does not trust the government. And I'm sorry, opposition, but, despite your good efforts today, when it comes to your broad policy, the community doesn't like that either. The fact is that most people in the community want Australia to start acting like a decent, law-abiding country. They want us to give protection to people who claim to be fleeing for their life. The broad community wants us to hear their claim. Sure, if their claim is fraudulent, then send them back. I will say that again: if their claim is fraudulent, then send them back.


The fact is that most people who come to this country claiming to be fleeing for their life—or who try to get to this country claiming to be fleeing for their life—are found to be genuine refugees. Most of the people on Manus Island at the moment, rotting up there somewhere north of New Guinea, have been found to be genuine refugees. And the best plan the government can come up with is to release them into the local community or to rely on the promises of Donald Trump! Does anyone really think the United States is going to accept over a thousand asylum seekers from this country? Does anyone really think we can trust Donald Trump on this? Of course we can't. He just said what had to be said to get through a difficult moment. There is no way the United States is going to take those people. But here we have on the table a repeated invitation from the government of New Zealand to take some of them. The government should swallow its pride and accept that offer.


I make the point again that politicians in this country need to stop pandering to the racism and xenophobia that lurks in the darkest corners of our community. Stop pandering to that for votes. It's only a handful of votes. As we saw in the Queensland election, there weren't that many votes when Pauline Hanson went hard for them. There weren't that many votes. I say to the government and to the opposition: leave those votes alone and stop pandering to them. Start leading the community. Explain to the community the circumstances in source countries. Explain to the community the circumstances in countries of first asylum. Explain to the community the forces at work, the difficulties in transit countries. Explain to the community why we need to start honouring international agreements like the refugee convention, why we need to start honouring international agreements like the Rome statute and why we need to give protection to these unfortunate souls.


And we could start with the hundreds of men on Manus Island. If you won't accept New Zealand's offer to resettle some of them, then bring them here now. Most of them have been found to be asylum seekers. It is not good enough to have them rotting up there in half-finished facilities, many in fear of their life. It's not good enough to justify it by saying, as the government does, 'But we've got a secret! And you're just going to have to trust us that this is the best course of action,' because it ain't the best course of action. Remember, it is a crime against humanity to detain people indefinitely without trial. It is a crime against humanity to detain people in inhuman conditions. It is a crime against humanity to forcibly transfer someone to a third country. We in this government are guilty of those crimes against humanity. How about you start turning it around—through you, Deputy Speaker, to the minister—turn it around and accept New Zealand's generous offer? (Time expired)

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (16:35):  I rise to support this resolution from the Senate. I do so and say to the government that this is an opportunity for it to rise to the occasion. There are many things that this resolution is not about. This resolution does not stop offshore processing. This resolution does not assist people smugglers. This resolution is consistent with getting an outcome. At the end of the day, the government is responsible for outcomes, not just rhetoric. The PNG court determined in April 2016 what the closing date of the Manus facility would be. In April 2017, the government came to an agreement with the government of Papua New Guinea that it would close. Yet the UNHCR has indicated that the alternative facilities simply weren't all ready at the time of closure.


What you also have is men who have been in detention for 4½ years with still no security as to what the future is for them. People who commit crimes, serious crimes, are often not detained for that period of time. A majority of these people have been found to be refugees—that is, they have been found under our international obligations to be deserving of Australia's care. It has been found that we have a responsibility to these people. We simply cannot have the approach of the minister, which is to say: 'This is nothing to do with me. This is something to do with the government of Papua New Guinea, nothing to do with Australia.' The fact is that you can be tough on people smugglers without being weak on humanity. We on this side of the House take that approach. What we won't do is just wash our hands of the responsibilities that Australia clearly has.


The minister says that he won't consider the resettlement option in New Zealand now. But he leaves it open for the future. He indicates that's correct. If not now, when? What is to be gained, apart from politics, in leaving these people in further uncertainty when the New Zealand government—under both the conservatives, under the leadership of John Key, and now under the leadership of Jacinda Ardern—has offered to assist these individuals but also, frankly, to assist Australia. If the minister says we have no responsibility, if he doesn't think that this is impacting on Australia's standing in the world, then he is wrong, I say to him, with respect. He might disagree with that assessment—people can look at objective facts and come to different conclusions—but it is a fact, regardless of whether it is right or wrong, that this is impacting on Australia's standing in the world. 


It is also a fact that John Howard, a person he admires, led a government where John Howard, in spite of the rhetoric, said that the people who were on the Tampa would never settle in Australia and never settle in New Zealand—that they'd be sent home. The fact is that many of those people are today settled here in Australia as Australian citizens and many of those people settled in New Zealand. Very clearly it would be possible for these people to come to an arrangement, which New Zealand has indicated would be possible, whereby they commit—they've said they would want to if they were settled in New Zealand—to stay there because they would feel welcome there because of the actions of the New Zealand government and the New Zealand opposition.


A good friend of mine, Father Dave Smith of Holy Trinity Church in Dulwich Hill, visited Manus Island a few weeks ago. It is interesting to look at the interviews that Father Dave, as he's known, had with the people there. This is someone who travelled there out of his view of what a Christian should do. I have disagreements with him on some issues politically, it must be said, but there is no question whatsoever of his genuineness. There are so many Australians who are looking for a genuine outcome when it comes to this situation. The fact is that a genuine outcome is settlement in third countries.


If the government can say it's okay for people to settle in the United States and that that wouldn't provide a pull factor but somehow New Zealand is not okay then that is an extraordinary proposition. If the minister doesn't think that it's possible to deal with the issue of the relationship of New Zealand visas into Australia then I think he's wrong there. Quite clearly, with a little bit of leadership rather than ongoing rhetoric—and I disagree very strongly with some of the characterisations that have been made personally against the minister. I don't think that adds to the debate at all. I'm not seeking to do that here at all. What I am seeking to do is to say that these people, who have been in detention at what was intended to be a processing centre to then settle people in third countries, not in Australia, have now been there for 4½ years, and that is just too long. That is having an impact on their mental health as well as their physical health. It would for anyone.


When I was at my good old Catholic school, one of the values that I was taught was about putting yourself in other people's positions. I say to the minister: put yourself in the position of those people. The minister needs, frankly, to act with a little bit more maturity rather than the sort of knee-jerk 'Let's hold these people almost as political hostages.' That is unacceptable.


The fact is that these people need a solution. That is why we are prepared to support this resolution. We are trying to help the minister find a way out of his predicament, frankly, because, at the moment, the way isn't just to stay in a circumstance whereby he says, 'Oh well, this is all about Labor.' This is about the minister. He has a responsibility. This resolution provides a way forward.

The SPEAKER:  Members on my right! I'll hear the point of order, but it's a procedural motion that doesn't require a seconder.




Mr Burke:
  There are two things, Mr Speaker. First of all, I will respond to the comment that was just made. While it is a procedural motion, if it goes ahead, I know it doesn't require a seconder but it is open to debate.

Mr Albanese:
  You've stuffed up, Christopher!



The SPEAKER:  Members are not going to be voting in the next division if they keep interrupting while I'm trying to hear the Manager of Opposition Business.




Mr Burke:
  Mr Speaker, I put it to you that the standing order requires that you can only have the vote again if there was confusion, and there was no confusion; if there has been an error concerning the numbers, and there has been no error concerning the numbers of who was here; or if it has been miscarried through misadventure caused by a member being accidentally absent or some similar incident. The fact that a member is doing a television interview is not covered by misadventure.



The SPEAKER:  I don't concur. That's why this standing order is here. I really don't concur. You can speak to the motion.

The SPEAKER
 (17:07):  Before we recommit the vote, I do want to address the matter of the Manager of Opposition Business's point of order, which I did dismiss. The difficulty that I have as Speaker, of course, is that the standing order provides for missing a vote through 'misadventure', which in my interpretation is pretty much everything other than deliberately not voting. That's why that word is there. The other difficulty I have is that, with members not being here, to require an explanation from them means that we couldn't proceed to the final vote. We would have just been suspended, not doing anything.


But I do think that the Manager of Opposition Business raises a reasonable point. The Senate certainly have a different approach. We can learn from them—not on everything, I hasten to say! But I do think the approach I took was reasonable, inasmuch as the Leader of the House speaks for government members; the Manager of Opposition Business speaks for members of the official opposition. But I have reflected on his point, and I do think that, now that members who missed the vote are here, they should explain to the House that they missed the vote through one of the reasons in the standing orders, notably misadventure. Unless anyone crossed sides, there are two.

We do need to go back to the amendment, deal with that, and then deal with any final proposition, whether the bill is amended or not.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (15:42):  I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 


""the resolution of the Senate be agreed to"".


This is a very straightforward and sensible motion that has been moved by the Senate and agreed to by the Senate. It is not a motion that has been agreed by only one party; otherwise it would not have got through the Senate. This is a motion that has enjoyed widespread support across the political spectrum within the Senate because it deals with the desperate situation that is currently unfolding at Manus. It deals with what can only be described as an emergency, a humanitarian emergency, where several hundred people have been put in situations where the basic conditions of life for them are now under threat.


There were, as people would know, several hundred refugees in the camp at Manus when it was deemed to be closed on an arbitrary deadline by the government. When it was closed, the men who were there said, 'We're not prepared to be moved, because we are concerned about our safety in the place that we are going to.' And it wasn't by any means an ill-founded concern. They had this concern on the basis of what had happened to them in the months and/or years leading up to this. There have been reports of assaults. We know that people have even gone further than that, at great risk to their life and sometimes fatally. And we know that they were concerned about moving to another place where the facilities were not ready. They said that they were not going to move. When they said they were not going to move, they were met with the fiercest of responses, sanctioned by this government. I'll come back to this point, because the government wants to have it both ways. On the one hand, the government says that they're not our problem, Australia's problem, and that what happens to them is purely a matter for PNG. On the other hand, of course, we've got the government standing in the way of a potential resolution.


In any event, what happened to those people after they made the decision to say, 'We are concerned about our safety and we are not prepared to move'? What we know is that, after that, forces went in and the basic conditions of life for these men—access to water, for example—were cut off. They had jury-rigged water tanks to catch the water that was falling to make sure that they could collect it and it was then converted to a drinkable form. They had done that themselves. What happened? We have reports that water was tampered with. The barrels that they were using were tampered with in a way that meant that they couldn't even collect water any more. Electricity was turned off on them, and they were denied other basics of life, including medicine. We had many reports of people who were unable to get the medicine that they needed.


We were getting these reports in real time and, as far as possible, the Australian and international media was reporting on what had happened there. But of course, because of restricted access, including increasingly restricted access over the time that they were there, the Australian public was forced to rely, in many instances, on the firsthand reports. Not only did we have the firsthand reports; we had the United Nations staff who have been on site. The United Nations staff, when they were on site, said, 'Yes, the men's concerns have some validity; it is right that they have concerns about their health and wellbeing.'


Crucially, the United Nations also backed up, as did many other observers, that these men have a very well-founded concern about where they're meant to be moved to, because these places are simply not ready. We're not talking, as the minister has said publicly, about paving around a patio; we're talking about whether or not these new places that the minister wants to move them to are fit and safe places to live. The report suggests they're not, and the men certainly have a well-founded fear of that.


So we have this terrible, terrible situation where several hundred wretched souls are now struggling to meet the basic conditions of life, and their lives are at risk. There are many different views about how we got here. The Greens' position on that has been made crystal clear—the Greens' position about the camps, the history of these camps, how we've got here and the supervision that has led them to this point. But the reason that this resolution passed the Senate is that, whatever part of the political spectrum you sit on, people are now coming to the view that the way these men are being treated is just not right and that we need a better way of dealing with them. We need to deal with them. Whatever one wants to do about broader immigration policy, about which there are going to be fierce debates in this place and elsewhere, we need to do something about these men. I personally would prefer that they be brought here, and I know many other people in this country would prefer that. I suspect I probably wouldn't win a vote in this chamber to say they should be brought here.


But fortunately, for at least a proportion of those men, we now don't have to resolve that. The government's in a position where, if it's serious about looking after these people, it can in a sense have its cake and eat it too. We, the Greens, will continue to oppose the government's policies, but let's say the government wants to keep its policies. We now have an option on the table from New Zealand. New Zealand has said that it will resettle 150 of those refugees, and it would begin work to expedite processing those refugees if and when the offer is accepted. That offer and that proposal to resettle them in many ways has parallels with what the government has done with respect to the United States. I, and many other members of parliament, might have very strong disagreements about how the government is conducting itself, but if the government is prepared to negotiate a deal that will see some of the men move to the United States then why on earth can't there be a similar arrangement that allows these men to go to New Zealand? Why isn't the government exploring it?


So I simply ask: what have you got, Minister, against them going to New Zealand? We're not saying, in this motion, to bring them here. The Senate's not saying that. I would disagree with the arguments, but I could understand the arguments that would flow. The government would talk about how we've got to maintain our borders, the people smugglers' business model and the like. I disagree with that argument, but I presume that's what the government would say if the question was to bring them here. But the question is not that. The question is whether we will facilitate the offer that New Zealand has made.


In that context there can be no good reason for not doing so. If the government is prepared to send people from Manus to the US, the government should also be prepared to send people from Manus to New Zealand. We know it's a bona fide offer that has been put on the table.


This motion is a motion stripped of rhetoric, and that's why it has passed the Senate. It is a motion that is stripped of messages of condemnation and so on and it's a motion that steps outside the high-level debate that we will have about what is the best immigration policy for this country and asks very simply: why can't these men go to New Zealand? I know the minister makes the point publicly when he appears on television and says, 'We're not going to be bullied or blackmailed into bringing people here.' I disagree with that point vehemently, but I reiterate that that is not what we are talking about right now. We are talking about whether or not people will be allowed to go to New Zealand and whether the government will facilitate it.


If the government says, 'This is really PNG's problem; it's not ours,' then the government should make it clear to all concerned that it is not standing in the way and that, if PNG and New Zealand want to reach an arrangement, it doesn't mind. But, if the government steps in and says, 'No; actually, we're going to stop this from happening,' then how in good conscience can that be done?


The government loves to parade the figure of how many people have previously died at sea. That figure is a contested one. What cannot be ignored is that there are now several hundred sitting in Manus and the New Zealand government has offered to take some of them. The fate of those souls is in this parliament's hands, and this House should concur with what the Senate has asked. (Time expired)



The SPEAKER:  Is the motion seconded?

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (15:52):  I rise to support the amendment to the motion and I applaud the member for Melbourne. This motion passed the Senate with the support of crossbenchers, the Greens and the Labor Party. On 5 November this year the New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, reaffirmed New Zealand's generous offer to resettle 150 eligible refugees from across both Manus and Nauru. It's an offer that Labor believes the Turnbull government should accept, and they should, as per the motion put in the Senate, begin to negotiate on terms similar to the US refugee resettlement agreement, to ensure people smugglers do not exploit vulnerable people and people can get off Manus and Nauru.


These places were set up as regional transit processing facilities. Unfortunately, under the government they've become places of indefinite detention because of their failure to negotiate third-country resettlement options. They have negotiated one in relation to the US, and now we have an offer on the table from New Zealand. Labor's asylum policy is different from the Greens' and from the government's. It's clear we don't want the people smugglers back in business, and therefore Labor's position differs with the Greens' in terms of resettlement options concerning Australia.


We do believe in strong borders, offshore processing, regional resettlement and turn-backs when safe to do so. It's clear the government has been in office for more than four years but not in power on this issue. The government has failed to negotiate other third-country resettlement options. Labor strongly supports the US refugee resettlement agreement, which would see up to 1,250 refugees approved and sanctioned by the UNHCR from Manus and Nauru resettled in the United States.


At the time of the US agreement being announced, Paris Aristotle, known to many people in this place, an eminent person, the Chair of the Minister's Council on Asylum Seekers and Detention, told The Australian newspaper about the need for other third-country resettlement options, saying:


That is appropriate and necessary because not everyone ultimately will be picked by the US. There will be a number of cases that will not be successful …


The New Zealand Prime Minister said at the time, reaffirming New Zealand's offer:


… we want to assist as much as we are able in expediting resolution on this issue …


The motion from the Senate is about expediting third-country resettlement for eligible refugees on Manus and Nauru—something the government has failed to prioritise.


In February 2013, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard brokered a deal with then conservative New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to resettle 150 refugees annually who had arrived irregularly in Australia by boat. So the New Zealand offer being made by the New Zealand government currently is not new. At the time, New Zealand said they would work closely with Australia as part of a regional approach to irregular migration, with the arrangement to be within New Zealand's Refugee Quota Program. This original plan was for New Zealand to resettle 150 refugees annually, commencing in 2014, with allocations formalised in the New Zealand program for both the 2014-15 and 2015-16 financial year intakes.


The former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, the member for Warringah, then scrapped the plans once he was elected in 2013—a wrong decision, in our view. If the agreement with New Zealand had been allowed to proceed by the then Abbott government and continued by the Turnbull government, upwards of 600 eligible refugees would have been resettled in New Zealand as of this year. It's clear that Labor was supporting the New Zealand resettlement arrangement for a long time back in the days of Julia Gillard and has continued to under opposition leader Bill Shorten. We're offering the government support for a New Zealand resettlement offer to get these people off Manus Island and Nauru and resettled as quickly as possible. We urge the government to begin negotiating conditions similar to the US refugee resettlement arrangement.


The irony of all of this is that the government won't release the US refugee resettlement agreement. Labor's been calling on the government to do this. If the government can negotiate a US refugee resettlement arrangement without any pull factors in terms of people smugglers, surely—surely—it's within their wit and wisdom to negotiate similar terms and conditions with our friends across the Tasman. Even the Prime Minister's own backbench have called on him to accept the offer, with former Liberal immigration minister Kevin Andrews, the member for Menzies, saying:


We should give consideration to what New Zealand is offering …The reality is that we have an intractable problem at the present time.


Yes, the United States are going to take some of these people, but there's still a large number there. The current immigration minister has already agreed to terms and conditions with the United States government that he believes will prevent people smugglers using that particular agreement as part of a way of exploiting vulnerable people. We've long called on the government to release the terms and conditions of the US refugee resettlement arrangement, but, despite their refusal to release the full details, we know that the US refugee resettlement agreement is a one-off. It's up to 1,250, and there are more eligible refugees.


We thank for their cooperation the Nauruan government and the PNG government. We also thank the UNHCR for the work they're doing. But the offer is only available for those refugees on Manus and Nauru, and the government should have lifted the bar for those people from Manus and Nauru here in Australia. Conditions which would be essential, in our view, would be to ensure that there are no pull factors, and the government should negotiate that.


Last Monday, 27 November, the New Zealand Prime Minister made clear her stance on people smugglers:


We have sent a clear message to people smugglers, and that is that the full force of the law should come down on anyone who exploits people who are vulnerable by taking money, risking their lives by taking to the ocean … The argument that people smugglers will then use that as an excuse to continue to smuggle … you could … make that argument for the United States as much as you could New Zealand.


In this the New Zealand Prime Minister affirms what the member for Melbourne is saying and what I'm saying here today: those same arguments don't hold water, and the government has a false argument here.


It should be noted that, following the announcement of the US refugee resettlement agreement, the government took steps to increase Australia's border security, describing it as the largest peacetime border security mission, to ensure people smugglers wouldn't exploit vulnerable people. We applaud what the government did in that regard. If an asylum seeker gets on a boat, they should be turned around and resettled elsewhere. They're not being resettled here under a Labor government. The government has pursued, negotiated and accepted appropriate conditions on the US refugee resettlement agreement. Similar conditions can be negotiated. The government can no longer sit on its hands waiting for the US agreement to transpire, when only 54 people have gone. There could be some more to come shortly, according to the minister, but only 54 people have gone. People seem to be waiting indefinitely there.


This is a government woefully incompetent at the management of offshore processing arrangements. We know that the Manus Regional Processing Centre was ordered to close, in accordance with a decision of the Supreme Court of PNG, in April 2016. A full-year later, in April 2017, the Prime Ministers of both Australia and Papua New Guinea confirmed the RPC would close on 31 October this year. By that closure date the government hadn't made everything ready, and failed to be upfront about access to essential services and alternative accommodation for asylum seekers and refugees. The lack of assurance led to the stand-off we've seen on our TV screens and in the media. Now that all the men have moved from the old RPC to alternative accommodation, this government has a moral obligation to ensure refugees have access to essential services in the alternative accommodation—food, water, security, health and welfare services—but we also have a moral obligation, as set out recently by the PNG Supreme Court. It's time we moved forward, it's time we accepted the New Zealand offer, it's time the government released the US refugee resettlement agreement, it's time the government, in its fifth year in office, became the government in power in terms of offshore processing and regional resettlement, did their job and stopped blaming Labor for their failures.

Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (16:02):  I support the amendment from the member for Melbourne. The treatment of asylum seekers is an important issue in my electorate and is a matter of strong views. I understand the problem, I understand the need to break the business model, I understand the need to not send the wrong message to the community and I understand the importance of protecting our borders—that's really clear—but I also get the call from my electorate for compassion, for kindness and for Australians to be their best selves, and I believe these are not mutually exclusive. A meeting took place on Thursday night in the town of Beechworth in my electorate, where a gathering of 48 people signed a petition and asked me to bring a message to parliament:


This petition of certain citizens of Australia from the Victorian municipality of Indigo and adjacent municipalities and communities draws the attention of the House to:


a) The plight of people who have sought asylum in Australia but have been prevented by present Commonwealth law from enjoying its refuge;


b) Our abiding concern that the Commonwealth, in its administration of such law and its consequent arrangements with the governments of Papua New Guinea and the Republic of Nauru, continues to cause these people grave distress, indignity and discomfort; and


c) The aspiration of many Australians in rural communities that the Commonwealth should relieve these people of such anguish.


The petition goes on, and I will make sure that the minister gets a copy, but that is my heartfelt plea to the parliament today. This offer from New Zealand, our neighbouring country, shows us they have a heart, they have feelings and they're willing to help us. The call from my constituents is, 'Please, listen to that offer of neighbourly help that they've given us.' The offer from New Zealand, to take 150 people when we have a much bigger problem, is clearly not the answer.


I totally get that the government is working with America and that the aim is to close Nauru and Manus—and we want that done as quickly as possible. In the interim, I ask the minister here, with the passion of the people in my electorate and those here today, particularly members of Rural Australians for Refugees: can we find compassion, kindness and a way of working with these asylum seekers that does not punish them? I'm grateful to New Zealand for this offer and to the Senate for considering the motion. I will be supporting it when it comes up for voting.

If ever I've seen a red-hot issue which will turn the face of politics in Australia upside down, it is the issue of the boat people. Far be it from me to give praise to the Liberal Party—once a year I do it and it's at Christmas time—but they have done a good job here. There were thousands of boat people coming in; now there's not. They have to get the credit for it. The people on the other side get the condemnation for it. The position of the Australian people is quite clear. They don't want them here.


You can cry and howl and say, 'I'm so sorry for these people.' Well, I feel a little bit sorry for the Jewish people in Australia who are now sending their kids to school under armed guards. I asked one man, a rabbi, 'Have you ever been attacked personally?' He said, 'Yes, I was beaten up by three them.' He said, 'My family home'—they are a very prominent Jewish family in Sydney—'was firebombed.' I said, 'Well, I don't believe that,' and he said, 'I'd expect you to say that,' and held up a picture on his phone. There was a picture of them going to church—I think they call it synagogue—on Saturday or Sunday or whenever they go. This bloke of Middle Eastern appearance—I myself could claim to be of Middle Eastern or Aboriginal appearance—runs up and grabs him by the shirt and starts screaming out: 'You will pay homage to Allah. You will go down on your knees and you will get out of this country now.' Then he started face-butting this poor person who was just going to church on Saturday or Sunday or whenever it was. The man I was speaking to said, 'You can ring up the police and ask about that incident.'


So here are a family that send their kids to school under armed guard and have had their house firebombed. Their synagogue allocates $15,000 per year to clean the graffiti off the walls of the synagogue. Who was responsible for Australian people of Jewish descent being persecuted in this country? Who brought the persecutors in? I don't notice too many Sikhs coming into the country. Heaven only knows they have a claim to being refugees, with 84,000 murdered in one year. I don't notice them coming in. I don't notice Christians coming in. I don't notice the Jews coming in. So it seems quite okay for the people over here to bring in the persecutors but not to worry at all about the persecuted people in the Middle East. There's not a single person in this place, in all honesty, who could say that Christians are not being persecuted in the Middle East. 


Now we have 2,000 dying at sea—well, with the policies that I ascribe to, those 2,000 people wouldn't have died. So let it be upon your conscience. The realities and practicalities of this situation are that, if they attempt to get here, many of them will die. To say they're refugees is quite fascinating to me because, if you get a globe out, you will see that the Middle East is on that side—at nine o'clock, if you like—and, on the other side of the globe, at three o'clock, is Australia. If you're a refugee, you flee across the border. There are 20 million refugees in Europe, all of them in nations surrounding either Russia or Germany. They were genuine refugees. There were 12 million refugees in Europe 20 years after the war; they were still there. But they didn't get in a boat and go right around to the other side of the world. That's not a refugee—that's not a person 'fleeing from'; that is a person 'going to'.


And you say, 'Why do they want to come here?' Well, I'm not going to put any conspiracy theories or nefarious interpretations upon why they want to come here. I just simply want to say that they are involved in fighting and upheavals over there. I think that, if I was a freedom fighter here in my country, if it was invaded, and if I then became a refugee, I wouldn't stop freedom fighting—no, not me! I'd continue freedom fighting from the country in which I lived. And if that country tried to stop me from freedom fighting, I suspect I wouldn't be too happy with the country stopping me from freedom fighting. I think there's over 200 supposedly-Australian people fighting in the Middle East at the present moment—not for this country but for some other country.


Why do they want to come here? Well, there are 72,000 reasons for that, aren't there? If you're a husband and wife with three kids then welfare, health and all the other things put together are worth about $72,000. These people are coming from countries with an average income of under $5,000. So I think it would be a very good idea to come here, and I'm not putting any nefarious or conspiracy-theory interpretations upon that.


There are two countries—and I just haven't written down one, but the big one is Saudi Arabia—that will not take Middle Eastern refugees. One is Saudi Arabia, and the other is another Middle Eastern country. Arguably the biggest country in the Middle East is Saudi Arabia—or one of the three biggest, anyway—and it won't take any refugees at all. I mean, it knows what's going on over there, and it says no. If you say no, and you force people to understand that, 'No, you will never enter the waters of Australia if you attempt to get here; we'll just keep turning you back,' then people will know not to come, and those like the 2,000 who died at sea will simply not die.


I love my fellow crossbench brother, but I think it's a little bit disingenuous when he says, 'We just want them to go to New Zealand,' because the minute they get to New Zealand, of course, they have access to Australia. So really what we're saying is, 'You can now come to Australia.'


It was with deep regret that people like me in this place did not support the ALP proposal, which was the Malaysian solution. Looking back on it—and mea culpa, mea culpa—I think I should have backed it, and I didn't look at the proposal on its merits. But that was a very acceptable proposal. They were going to a Muslim country, where, presumably, they would have been a lot more happy and content than they would have been in a fairly hostile atmosphere in Australia, as people from a different cultural milieu completely. And these people—whether you agree with their religion or not—are very, very religious people, and I don't know whether we could describe ourselves as very religious people. So the government, for once, can be totally proud of their record—that they stopped people from coming to this country and stopped 2,000 deaths at sea. And this is my final statement on the matter.


In the pub they said, 'It's all right going on in Sydney, but eventually it'll come up here.' I said, 'Listen, drongo, it's already here!' They said, 'What do you mean?' I said, 'There were three people in my electorate murdered, with a bloke shouting out, ""Allahu akbar!"" while he was murdering them with a knife. They were backpackers, working outside Dalby, and happened to be in the Kennedy electorate.' And he used a rather vulgar expression, as my mother would describe it, and I won't repeat that expression, but he was quite astounded, as were the other blokes in the pub, that it was right here in North Queensland. I don't think it's confined to down south.


There's a terrorist incident every three months now. To whom do we attribute those deaths—the murder of those three innocents outside of Dalby? Who was responsible for that? Well, if you're in this place and you make decisions, then you are responsible for those decisions. I want to see a very close parliament in the next election. So I would urge the people on the Labor side: do not continue to pursue these politics, because you might be up against the boneless bunch over here, but they might just get a bit smart with the terror of an election around the corner! It is not a matter of politics, though I would argue that it should be; it is a matter of protecting the integrity of our nation. That is not occurring, and will not occur, when proposals like this are agreed to.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (16:15):  I want to say on behalf of the government that we oppose this motion, and so should the Labor Party. The Labor Party should already have learnt its lessons in relation to this area of public policy. It presided over the most significant failure in public policy in recent years, and the result of that failure of public policy was felt both in human costs and in financial costs. We know that 50,000 people arrived on 800 boats and that 1,200 people drowned at sea and that the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd failings, supported by the Greens in government, have already cost the Australian taxpayers in excess of $12 billion.


We have a lot of work to do to clean up Labor's mess. I didn't put people on Manus Island; my job is to get them off it. I intend to get them off as quickly as possible, but I need to do it in a way where we don't see new boat arrivals commencing. All of the intelligence available to me from across the region indicates that we have 14,000 people in Indonesia ready to hop on boats now. We have credible information out of other markets that says people smugglers are putting this proposition to vulnerable men, women and children to pay money: 'Ultimately, you'll stay in Manus for a couple years and then come to Australia.' The latest, of course, is, 'You can go to New Zealand, become a New Zealand citizen and then come to Australia shortly thereafter.' We are not going to allow that to happen.


The Greens can wax all they want. They can move their position around. They can offer sanctimonious advice to the government. They can offer false hope to people in Manus. But they are not going to change the will of this government to see people smugglers put out of business. The success that we've achieved in relation to this area of public policy has resulted in the largest number of offshore entrants into our country since 1983: over 20,000 people arrived under the humanitarian refugee program last year alone. Going to the member for Kennedy's proposition about those being persecuted in the Middle East at the moment, we've been able to help some 12,000 people under the Syrian and Iraqi intake, including women from the Yazidi community—one of the most persecuted minorities in the world—and we should be very proud of the success we've had in settling those people in our country. But that would not be possible if the boats were still turning up, if a thousand people per week were still being pulled off boats on Christmas Island, as was the case under the Labor government.


I was astounded by the contribution from the member for Blair during the course of this debate. It showed to me that he either doesn't have a grasp of the basics of the issue that we're dealing with or has not taken the time to properly consider what it is that we have contemplated and what it would be for him to contemplate if he were to be successful at the next election. Let me be very clear: if we send people to New Zealand today, then, based on the intelligence that I have received, including out of Manus Island in recent weeks, the boats would restart. There is no question in my mind. We have people in Manus at the moment who were on a pathway to the United States and who have said, in light of the announcement by the New Zealand government, that they are now reconsidering their option to go to the United States because they'd prefer to go to New Zealand. That is a terrible situation and one that the government is not going to allow to continue in the minds of those on Manus Island.


We have 1,250 places that are available for people to go from Nauru and Manus to the United States. The first 54 have gone. The United States has made announcements in recent days, both negative and positive hand-downs on Nauru and Manus, and we will see a further uplift of people go in the not-too-distant future. There is no push back from the United States at all, and we thank them very much for the support that they have provided to us in helping to clean up Labor's mess. As I said, I did not put people on Manus Island. I've not had a death at sea, and it's been more than 1,200 days since we've had a successful people smuggling venture; however, we are seeing efforts in this regard by the people smugglers.


We haven't ruled out the option of sending people to New Zealand at some point, but we would have to, firstly, reassure ourselves that people weren't going to use New Zealand as a backdoor entry to come into Australia. It's a fact that, of the 31 boats we've stopped and turned back in recent times, four were on their way to New Zealand. So New Zealand is marketed as a destination as well, because they have a generous welfare system, health system, education system and housing system like we do in Australia. So we haven't ruled it out, and suggestions by the Greens and others that we haven't properly contemplated that option are a complete nonsense. Frankly, that they would put it forward for their own political gain at the expense of those people on Manus Island says more about the Greens than it does about anybody else in this debate.


But the Greens are here today having this debate because they were supported by the Labor Party in the Senate and here on the floor today. In fact, the very words of the member for Blair in this debate were that he congratulated the member for Melbourne. The disaster that the Labor Party and the Greens presided over during the Rudd-Gillard years would be replicated by a Shorten government if they were to be elected at the next election. It's clear that many on the frontbench of the Labor Party, and on the backbench, would revert to the old policy—that is, they would allow people come to Australia from the regional processing centres.


We've seen Kristina Keneally out in Bennelong in recent weeks. We've seen her public utterances as far back as 2011 that people should come to Australia, which is a green light for people smugglers. If people believe that Kristina Keneally is not representative of the majority view, I think, within the Labor Party caucus—and certainly in left wing of the Labor Party—then they're kidding themselves. The fact is that Labor would bring people from regional processing centres to Australia. The fact is that they have already declared that they would reintroduce permanent protection visas. Part of our success has been the introduction of temporary protection visas. It is abundantly clear to all of us who deal with these matters each day that Labor in government would again not have the mettle to deal with turning back boats where it's safe to do so. There is no question in my mind whatsoever that Labor would return to the failed policies that saw 1,200 people drown at sea.


We have been compassionate in the numbers of refugees that we've brought to our country. We have been strong and determined in saying that we are not going to allow those deaths at sea to recommence. And yet Labor stands here today, complicit with the Greens, reminding all Australians that it has learnt nothing. To those Australians in Bennelong who I know are concerned about this issue at the moment, please be assured that Labor has learnt nothing from the past failures. The Labor Party under Bill Shorten has learnt nothing from the Rudd-Gillard years. The fact is that human lives were lost and they would be lost at sea again.


We have considered every option on the table. There is no easy option in this regard. There's no easy option that I have before me that can just allow people to come here or allow them all to go to New Zealand, and the matter will be resolved and we'll never hear from the people smugglers again. As the United Nations points out, there are 65 million people in the world today who are displaced. On top of the disaster that we've seen in the Mediterranean, we would see those pathways open up again between Jakarta and Christmas Island, and I am not going to allow it to happen.


We need to work with people to provide settlement support. We provide settlement packages, paid for by the Australian taxpayer, for people to go back to their countries if they've been found not to be refugees. We've provided support to the Papua New Guinean government—and I praise the work of the PNG government and thank them for their partnership, and also the government of Nauru. We have provided support to open three new centres. The East Lorengau centre has been open for something like three years. It can accommodate 440 people. There are 305 refugees there in there at the moment, and Labor and the Greens try to tell us that the centre is not open—that it's not finished and not completed. It's a complete and utter nonsense.


For the Labor Party, the Greens and the advocates to hold out false hope to those people on Manus, that the policy of the government will change and that some day they'll come to Australia, is a disgrace. They have for years offered false hope to people who have doubled down on their efforts to stay there, in situ, and not to remove themselves from the RPC, and say that the conditions are squalid and that they won't move, because they thought that would provide leverage and an outcome in coming to Australia. It is not going to happen. We will provide support to those people to move to the United States or to move to third countries or to move back to their country of origin if they've been determined not to be refugees. But we are not going to allow the Labor Party, in concert with the Greens again, to dismantle those policies which meant—and I'm very proud of this fact—that we got every child out of detention and closed 17 detention centres. If another boat turns up tomorrow under this government, or if the Labor Party is successful at the next election, those people are going into detention Regardless of whether they are women, children or men, they will go into detention on Nauru. That's the reality of the circumstance we face.


The people smugglers have not gone out of business. They are there and they treat people with the same disdain that they do any other commodity. They see money in moving people; they couldn't care whether they go to the bottom of the ocean or whether they end up in Australia, New Zealand, Manus Island or anywhere else. We are not going to allow those people to get back in control of the situation.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",IND,2017-12-04,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (16:25):  I agree with the majority view in the Senate, and I support the member for Melbourne's motion that would see those of us in this place agree with the message from the Senate. It is self-evident that the situation on Manus Island is dire. There has now been an abundance of media reports and an abundance of reports from firsthand witnesses who have seen the conditions on Manus Island. They have seen the way in which hundreds of men, many of whom who have already been found to be refugees, are living in squalid conditions. I simply do not accept the words from the minister when he says that all is well there, because the fact is there are just too many reports from people who are saying the situation is dire and hundreds of men are living in squalid conditions, many in fear of their lives. That we would allow this to continue is inhuman. That we would refuse a generous offer from the government of New Zealand to voluntarily resettle at least some of those men, that we would refuse that offer, is inhuman.


It's time for the government to swallow its pride. I simply do not accept that the resettlement of 150 men in New Zealand needs to be a fast-track pathway to this country. It need not be that way. The fact is the government needs to swallow its pride and act in accordance with the majority view of the Senate and, near on, the majority view in this place—perhaps the majority view in this place if there was to be a conscience vote on this issue. The fact is that we, as a country, need to have a legal and ethical response to people who are fleeing for their lives. Let's not forget that most people who come to this country claiming to be fleeing for their lives are found to have been fleeing for their lives. What's so hard about this country starting to act like the law-abiding, rich, fortunate and ethical country that we would like to think we are? What's so hard for us about acting ethically and legally? Why can't we start honouring the commitments we've made in any number of international agreements—agreements like the refugee convention and agreements like the Rome Statute? When we signed up to these international agreements we did so because we thought they mattered. But they don't seem to matter now because we have a government which is more inclined to pander to the xenophobia and to the racism in this community in a race to the bottom of the barrel.


While I'm very heartened and pleased that the opposition, the Labor Party, is supportive of the motion by the member for Melbourne, I also call on the opposition to lift your game too. The fact is there should be no place for mandatory detention. There should be no place for offshore processing. There should be no place for any sort of temporary visa. There should be no place for the tow back of boats to countries like Indonesia. What there should be is an intelligent, legal and ethical response so that when people come to our shore by any means—by air or by boat—and they claim to be fleeing for their lives, we should give them protection. We should hear their claim, and we should give them permanent refuge if their claim is found to be accurate. That's what we should be doing.


If there are people in this community who don't like that legal and ethical response, it's our job in this place to start acting like leaders and to explain to the broad Australian community why we need to act in accordance with international law and why we need to act like a fortunate, rich and lucky country, one with morals and scruples, because it's not good enough to pander to those people who would disagree with that in the community. It's time to be leaders.


You know what? When I'm out in my community in the Denison electorate, sometimes someone will come up to me and say the most awful things about asylum seekers—call them all of sorts of things—hardly the worst of which is 'illegals', and says, 'They're all terrorists. They should all be sent back home.' I say to these people almost every time: 'Hang on, do you agree that if anyone from anywhere in the world is genuinely fleeing for their life, we should grab hold of them, protect them and look after them?' Without fail, they say: 'Of course we should!' And then I turn the conversation around a bit more and say: 'But that's what we're doing; that's all we're doing. When people come to this country, by any means, and claim to be fleeing for their life, we should give them protection and hear their claim.' If their claim is accurate—and it most often is—we should then give them permanent refuge. We shouldn't send them off to Nauru, Manus Island or anywhere else. Nauru and Manus Island have become our modern day prison hulks—like the hulks that were used in the Thames for convicts. This is a blot on our country's name and our reputation—and will be forever.


But we can start to turn it around. It is a decent and generous offer by the government of New Zealand to resettle some of these men. Why can't the government act like human beings? Swallow your pride and say yes. It is not good enough, Minister, to hide behind that old government line: 'We've got very secret information which we can't share you. You've just got to trust us.' That's what happened in 2003, when we went to war. The government then said: 'We've got very secret information. We can't share it with you. You've just got to trust us.'


When it comes to asylum seeker policy, there is no trust left. The community does not trust the government. And I'm sorry, opposition, but, despite your good efforts today, when it comes to your broad policy, the community doesn't like that either. The fact is that most people in the community want Australia to start acting like a decent, law-abiding country. They want us to give protection to people who claim to be fleeing for their life. The broad community wants us to hear their claim. Sure, if their claim is fraudulent, then send them back. I will say that again: if their claim is fraudulent, then send them back.


The fact is that most people who come to this country claiming to be fleeing for their life—or who try to get to this country claiming to be fleeing for their life—are found to be genuine refugees. Most of the people on Manus Island at the moment, rotting up there somewhere north of New Guinea, have been found to be genuine refugees. And the best plan the government can come up with is to release them into the local community or to rely on the promises of Donald Trump! Does anyone really think the United States is going to accept over a thousand asylum seekers from this country? Does anyone really think we can trust Donald Trump on this? Of course we can't. He just said what had to be said to get through a difficult moment. There is no way the United States is going to take those people. But here we have on the table a repeated invitation from the government of New Zealand to take some of them. The government should swallow its pride and accept that offer.


I make the point again that politicians in this country need to stop pandering to the racism and xenophobia that lurks in the darkest corners of our community. Stop pandering to that for votes. It's only a handful of votes. As we saw in the Queensland election, there weren't that many votes when Pauline Hanson went hard for them. There weren't that many votes. I say to the government and to the opposition: leave those votes alone and stop pandering to them. Start leading the community. Explain to the community the circumstances in source countries. Explain to the community the circumstances in countries of first asylum. Explain to the community the forces at work, the difficulties in transit countries. Explain to the community why we need to start honouring international agreements like the refugee convention, why we need to start honouring international agreements like the Rome statute and why we need to give protection to these unfortunate souls.


And we could start with the hundreds of men on Manus Island. If you won't accept New Zealand's offer to resettle some of them, then bring them here now. Most of them have been found to be asylum seekers. It is not good enough to have them rotting up there in half-finished facilities, many in fear of their life. It's not good enough to justify it by saying, as the government does, 'But we've got a secret! And you're just going to have to trust us that this is the best course of action,' because it ain't the best course of action. Remember, it is a crime against humanity to detain people indefinitely without trial. It is a crime against humanity to detain people in inhuman conditions. It is a crime against humanity to forcibly transfer someone to a third country. We in this government are guilty of those crimes against humanity. How about you start turning it around—through you, Deputy Speaker, to the minister—turn it around and accept New Zealand's generous offer? (Time expired)

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (16:35):  I rise to support this resolution from the Senate. I do so and say to the government that this is an opportunity for it to rise to the occasion. There are many things that this resolution is not about. This resolution does not stop offshore processing. This resolution does not assist people smugglers. This resolution is consistent with getting an outcome. At the end of the day, the government is responsible for outcomes, not just rhetoric. The PNG court determined in April 2016 what the closing date of the Manus facility would be. In April 2017, the government came to an agreement with the government of Papua New Guinea that it would close. Yet the UNHCR has indicated that the alternative facilities simply weren't all ready at the time of closure.


What you also have is men who have been in detention for 4½ years with still no security as to what the future is for them. People who commit crimes, serious crimes, are often not detained for that period of time. A majority of these people have been found to be refugees—that is, they have been found under our international obligations to be deserving of Australia's care. It has been found that we have a responsibility to these people. We simply cannot have the approach of the minister, which is to say: 'This is nothing to do with me. This is something to do with the government of Papua New Guinea, nothing to do with Australia.' The fact is that you can be tough on people smugglers without being weak on humanity. We on this side of the House take that approach. What we won't do is just wash our hands of the responsibilities that Australia clearly has.


The minister says that he won't consider the resettlement option in New Zealand now. But he leaves it open for the future. He indicates that's correct. If not now, when? What is to be gained, apart from politics, in leaving these people in further uncertainty when the New Zealand government—under both the conservatives, under the leadership of John Key, and now under the leadership of Jacinda Ardern—has offered to assist these individuals but also, frankly, to assist Australia. If the minister says we have no responsibility, if he doesn't think that this is impacting on Australia's standing in the world, then he is wrong, I say to him, with respect. He might disagree with that assessment—people can look at objective facts and come to different conclusions—but it is a fact, regardless of whether it is right or wrong, that this is impacting on Australia's standing in the world. 


It is also a fact that John Howard, a person he admires, led a government where John Howard, in spite of the rhetoric, said that the people who were on the Tampa would never settle in Australia and never settle in New Zealand—that they'd be sent home. The fact is that many of those people are today settled here in Australia as Australian citizens and many of those people settled in New Zealand. Very clearly it would be possible for these people to come to an arrangement, which New Zealand has indicated would be possible, whereby they commit—they've said they would want to if they were settled in New Zealand—to stay there because they would feel welcome there because of the actions of the New Zealand government and the New Zealand opposition.


A good friend of mine, Father Dave Smith of Holy Trinity Church in Dulwich Hill, visited Manus Island a few weeks ago. It is interesting to look at the interviews that Father Dave, as he's known, had with the people there. This is someone who travelled there out of his view of what a Christian should do. I have disagreements with him on some issues politically, it must be said, but there is no question whatsoever of his genuineness. There are so many Australians who are looking for a genuine outcome when it comes to this situation. The fact is that a genuine outcome is settlement in third countries.


If the government can say it's okay for people to settle in the United States and that that wouldn't provide a pull factor but somehow New Zealand is not okay then that is an extraordinary proposition. If the minister doesn't think that it's possible to deal with the issue of the relationship of New Zealand visas into Australia then I think he's wrong there. Quite clearly, with a little bit of leadership rather than ongoing rhetoric—and I disagree very strongly with some of the characterisations that have been made personally against the minister. I don't think that adds to the debate at all. I'm not seeking to do that here at all. What I am seeking to do is to say that these people, who have been in detention at what was intended to be a processing centre to then settle people in third countries, not in Australia, have now been there for 4½ years, and that is just too long. That is having an impact on their mental health as well as their physical health. It would for anyone.


When I was at my good old Catholic school, one of the values that I was taught was about putting yourself in other people's positions. I say to the minister: put yourself in the position of those people. The minister needs, frankly, to act with a little bit more maturity rather than the sort of knee-jerk 'Let's hold these people almost as political hostages.' That is unacceptable.


The fact is that these people need a solution. That is why we are prepared to support this resolution. We are trying to help the minister find a way out of his predicament, frankly, because, at the moment, the way isn't just to stay in a circumstance whereby he says, 'Oh well, this is all about Labor.' This is about the minister. He has a responsibility. This resolution provides a way forward.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that the motion be agreed to. To this the honourable member for Melbourne has moved an amendment, so the immediate question is that the amendment moved by the member for Melbourne be agreed to.

  Secondly, this standing order is only able to be used in the following circumstances. If—



The SPEAKER:  Yes, I've got the standing order in front of me.




Mr Burke:

The SPEAKER:  Yes.




Mr Burke:

Mr Pyne:

Mr Albanese:
  You've stuffed up, Christopher!



The SPEAKER:  Members are not going to be voting in the next division if they keep interrupting while I'm trying to hear the Manager of Opposition Business.




Mr Burke:
  Mr Speaker, I put it to you that the standing order requires that you can only have the vote again if there was confusion, and there was no confusion; if there has been an error concerning the numbers, and there has been no error concerning the numbers of who was here; or if it has been miscarried through misadventure caused by a member being accidentally absent or some similar incident. The fact that a member is doing a television interview is not covered by misadventure.



The SPEAKER:  I don't concur. That's why this standing order is here. I really don't concur. You can speak to the motion.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (16:57):  In that case, I will speak to the motion. The government have already lost the numbers on the floor of the House. That's exactly what's just happened. Now they want to run off on some sort of excuse with the chaos that's here in this building and the chaos in this room, all brought on because they can't turn up to work. That's why this has happened. It's not like it's a surprise that divisions were going to be important this week. It's not like this has crept up on them without them knowing, and yet two members of parliament couldn't be bothered coming here for work. There's no misadventure. There's no reason that the government have, other than that they are incompetent—

The SPEAKER
 (17:07):  Before we recommit the vote, I do want to address the matter of the Manager of Opposition Business's point of order, which I did dismiss. The difficulty that I have as Speaker, of course, is that the standing order provides for missing a vote through 'misadventure', which in my interpretation is pretty much everything other than deliberately not voting. That's why that word is there. The other difficulty I have is that, with members not being here, to require an explanation from them means that we couldn't proceed to the final vote. We would have just been suspended, not doing anything.


But I do think that the Manager of Opposition Business raises a reasonable point. The Senate certainly have a different approach. We can learn from them—not on everything, I hasten to say! But I do think the approach I took was reasonable, inasmuch as the Leader of the House speaks for government members; the Manager of Opposition Business speaks for members of the official opposition. But I have reflected on his point, and I do think that, now that members who missed the vote are here, they should explain to the House that they missed the vote through one of the reasons in the standing orders, notably misadventure. Unless anyone crossed sides, there are two.

An honourable member interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  We're back to the amendment. You're entitled to be a bit confused. That's fair enough. We're now back to the member for Melbourne's amendment. Everyone clear with that? The immediate question is that the member for Melbourne's amendment be agreed to.




A division having been called and the bells being/having been rung—




The SPEAKER:  Can I have people's attention. We're just going to stop the division. The Leader of the House had moved that the motion be put. That was carried. We do need to go back to the amendment, deal with that, and then deal with any final proposition, whether the bill is amended or not. But first, on this unusual procedure, we do need to actually put the question that the House do now divide again. So I'll put that question—that is, that the House divide again.

Mr Albanese:
  Leave her alone!



The SPEAKER:  The member for Grayndler has been warned in question time as well!




Mr BURKE:
  At the moment, we are in a situation that we have not been in at any other point this term. At the moment we are in the situation where we have a hung parliament. And when there is a hung parliament, the presumption should always err on the side of at least making sure we have the debate. The presumption in a hung parliament should always be—should always be!—that we err on the side of allowing people to have their say and to have their vote.


It's some years since we've had a hung parliament in this place. The last time we did, there were many occasions when we were in government when we brought forward motions that we did not agree with. We brought forward a motion moved by the member for Melbourne, for example—the Fair Work Amendment (Tackling Job Insecurity) Bill 2012. We supported the procedurals for it and then we voted against the bill. But we did so on the basis that when we have a hung parliament the only way to make it work is that we err on the side of at least allowing the debate to go ahead, even if we're then going to oppose the motion itself.


In the same way, in government we brought on for debate a bill called the Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill. It's a fair bet that when the member for Warringah moved the Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill, when we were in government, we didn't think that bill was worth supporting. But we did believe that there was a strong enough view within the parliament that it was worth debating. That's what I'm asking for at this point of each member of the House.


I am not asking for anyone to declare their position on penalty rates at the next vote. What I am asking the House to do in the next vote is to determine, given the level of angst that is there in the community—and also, with respect to fellow members of parliament, given the level of angst that is here in this parliament—that we should not be saying in the context of a hung parliament, 'We won't even allow the debate to happen.' That's the question now.


If it is not a hung parliament, very regularly governments will push through and they'll just decide, 'Well, we're not going to allow this debate to happen or that debate to happen.' They'll move that the member be no longer heard, they'll shut things down and gag debates. The members of the crossbench have consistently—and they're actually the only ones of any side who have been consistent on this—voted in favour of debate and against debate being gagged. Be in no doubt that the motion from the Leader of the House is about gagging the penalty rates debate. That's what it's about. And that's the question that I am seeking to amend with this amendment. We should be dealing with this today. And today we should also be making clear—



A government member interjecting—




Mr BURKE:
  I will respond briefly to the interjection—'What about marriage equality?' Firstly, I have already offered additional hours. Secondly, this issue was meant to be dealt with last week. There was an entire week that disappeared. So, please, members opposite, don't pretend and use marriage equality as though that's an alternative to having a debate on penalty rates. I can guarantee to the House that, if this is voted for, we will deal with the penalty rates issue quickly and we will get back onto the marriage equality debate, which everybody wants to get back onto. But I simply ask every member of the House to observe the fact that, right now, we have the opportunity for cooperation. In a hung parliament, that is rare. We should take that opportunity. I ask members of the crossbench, each and every one of them, to vote, as we just did on an issue about asylum seekers, to say, 'When the parliament is a hung parliament, we will, at the very least, unite to make sure issues are debated.' Once we've been through the procedural issues the vote will fall where it will fall based on the individual views of members of parliament. But a hung parliament cannot function unless we work on the basis that the presumption will be that debate will take place. I move this amendment for one reason and one reason only: for debate to take place that otherwise this government will gag and not allow.



The SPEAKER:  Is the amendment seconded?

Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (17:41):  I second the amendment. We do not need a long debate but we should have a debate on penalty rates. The other place has debated and resolved the position insofar as this issue is concerned. What they have determined, by way of moving an amendment to the government bill, is that they want to see the penalty rates decision stopped so that the cuts that would take place in future for 700,000 retail and hospitality workers would actually be stopped as a result. Why would that not be a worthy debate for this place now? Why would we not debate an issue given that we have wage growth at the lowest level in a generation? We have people struggling to make ends meet in this country. We have three Sundays before Christmas, and these workers will be getting cuts compared to what they would have got from 1 July this year.


For that reason, it is reasonable for members of this place to do what the Senate did today. The Senate determined this morning that the penalty rates decision should be ceased. I think it's incumbent upon members here who represent retail workers and hospitality workers in their electorates to have this debate. The Manager of Opposition Business has made very clear that this does not have to be a long debate. Nonetheless, we should have a debate because this is an important issue. We say to government members and the crossbench: allow this debate to occur. Voting for this amendment moved by the Manager of Opposition Business will mean we can have that debate. We can have a quick debate and then we can decide on the merits of the substantive motion that's before the House. For that reason, I second this amendment and I call upon members of this place to support us.

On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Report 175: OECD tax measures BEPS; International Solar Alliance-agreement; Air services-three agreements. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

Mr Burke:
  Leave is granted for a statement that promises to be short.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the Manager of Opposition Business.




Mr ROBERT:
  I have been waiting three hours! Time well spent, though, in the House, can I just say. Today I rise to make a short statement concerning the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties Report 175. It was tabled out of session on Friday, 24 November this year. Report 175 contains the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' review of five treaties' actions—the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting, the framework agreement on the establishment of the International Solar Alliance and three air services agreements. 


The multinational convention on tax evasion is an OECD G20 initiative designed to curb base erosion and profit shifting, referred to as BEPS. The strategies are used by international entities to minimise their tax obligations by shifting profits between jurisdictions and exploiting gaps and mismatches in the tax rules. Current bilateral double taxation agreements provide the international legal framework to prevent these practices. Australia is party to 44 such agreements and this new convention will modify these individual bilateral treaties with parties that have also ratified the multilateral treaty. However, Australia has the flexibility to apply various choices and/or reservations to limit the extent of the adoption of the multilateral tax treaty provisions. The multilateral treaty will only modify a bilateral treaty to the extent both parties' choices and reservations agree. If they do not, then the provisions in the bilateral treaty will remain.


The bilateral treaty is timely. It addresses a significant and complicated problem in an environment where multinational entities exist in multiple jurisdictions and are flexible enough to make the most profitable use of taxation differences between those jurisdictions. The committee supports this important step in ensuring every entity meets its tax obligation and recommends that binding treaty action be taken.


The International Solar Alliance is being established to deepen cooperation on solar research and development. The ISA is open to those solar resource-rich states situated in the tropics and is intended to facilitate the diffusion of solar technologies amongst those countries. It addresses key common challenges to the scaling up of solar energy. The committee notes the aspirational nature of the agreement, and we acknowledge it opens up opportunities for Australia to promote its expertise and experience in this broadening field. We recommend that binding treaty action be taken.


Finally, the three air services agreements are with the Mauritius, Israel and Hungary, and are based on a model agreement Australia has with a range of countries. These agreements are necessary to facilitate air transport services between countries, and cover access, administration, safety and security. Once again, we raised ongoing concerns that airlines operating within Australia comply with the standards of International Civil Aviation Organisation. We reiterated that, in future, the national interest analysis should indicate whether relevant notifications of this organisation by the other parties have been considered. In addition, we would wish to see responsible departments consult the Commonwealth Civil Aviation Safety Authority on any safety issues that might be relevant to individual agreements. The committee recommends that binding action be taken for all three air services agreements.


The report also contains the committee's review of four minor treaty actions. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House.

Mr WOOD
 (La Trobe) (18:17):  As I was just saying before the interruption, in 2013 a briefing paper released by the National LGBTI Health Alliance revealed that same-sex-attracted Australians have a rate of suicide attempts up to 14 times as high as that of their heterosexual peers, and discrimination and exclusion are the key causal factors for their mental health and suicide attempts. Medical studies demonstrate overwhelmingly that being married is a good way to live longer. Research shows that having a spouse gives individuals something to live for, compared to their single counterparts.


Looking globally, there are now more than 20 countries that have legalised same-sex marriage, including countries as diverse as Argentina, Norway, South Africa, France, Colombia and Ireland. Support in these countries for same-sex marriage is in certain instances overwhelming. For example, Denmark reported 87 per cent support for same-sex marriage. There was also compelling evidence that support for legal same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world.


Back home, in May this year football players from every AFL team signed a petition in support of marriage equality, and this petition is part of an overwhelming equality campaign which hopes to continue the push for same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, the AFL Players' Association has been a signatory to marriage equality for the past two years.


I believe anyone who is still unclear about the need for a change in legislation should ask the next generation how they feel about this important subject. Nowadays, when I do school visits around my electorate and get the Q&A questions as part of my session, I am faced with a new phenomenon. Primary school children used to ask me about my dog or the make of my car I drive. Now both primary and secondary students ask me, totally unprompted questions by adults: what is my position on same-sex marriage or marriage equality? When I ask the students, with permission of the teachers, what their view is, their response is that they are overwhelmingly in favour irrespective of their age or the kind of school they are attending, which really surprised me. It is clear to me that the majority of my electorate is well and truly ready to embrace change on this important topic, and it is my responsibility to represent their majority views in the forthcoming vote.


So today, in conclusion, I stand to say that, as my electorate has now voted 'yes' on two occasions, La Trobe overall supports a change with the times. Love is love and, therefore, I support this bill. Let there be same-sex marriages in the Dandenong Ranges, and it will be great for business. Thank you.

Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (18:20):  I acknowledge that many Australians have lost faith in our political system in recent years. I understand that; I really do. This 45th Parliament has been plagued with inaction, indecision, infighting and instability. This catastrophic mess has turned many away from the major parties and many more from the establishment as a whole. So I say to these people: I hear you and I empathise with you. I understand you feel angry, silenced or maybe disillusioned—maybe all three—but I urge you to look at today and recognise the importance of our political system and the great changes that a parliament can make in an individual's life.


We live in a great country filled with great people, and it's exactly that which we can all too easily lose site of. Our country is only great because it is made up of great individuals, of course. Whether you are someone living on a very high income in an electorate like Wentworth or you are somebody just getting by like in my electorate of Longman, it is you as an individual that makes our country great. It's not your pay packet, it's not the colour of your skin and it's certainly not your sexuality. It is the role of your elected representatives to stand up on your behalf and to treat everyone as equals—and, of course, to create change to make it easier for you to get by, easier to live your life, easier to be happy.


These may be small changes, of course, that might help a single individual, just like how recently my office helped a man who was living on the streets to find some housing. He now lives on Bribie Island. He's getting by. In actual fact, he's more than getting by. We bumped into each other at Woolworths just last week. He has a home. He has a TV. He has a bed. He's actually got a physical address where he can say to people, 'Come and visit me.' All of these things mean that he has hope back in his life. He's happier than that sad and frustrated man that walked into my office a little bit earlier in the year. These small changes are important, and we can't deny this. Everyone should feel valued, and we must not overlook the importance of helping single individuals.


But it really is sweeping changes that make life better for many individuals, and we must truly recognise these as great. There are great changes such as the introduction of Medicare, of course, by the Hawke government in 1994, which allowed anyone and everyone, regardless of privilege or disadvantage, to have access to quality and affordable health care. In 2008 Kevin Rudd officially apologised to our nation's first people for the horrific mistreatment that they have endured. As recent inaction by this government has highlighted, we still have a long way to go and a lot to do in this space, but the gesture of the Rudd government was a huge deal to many marginalised individuals, and now today I can stand here to encourage the passing of another great change, another hugely significant gesture that will be a huge deal to many more marginalised individuals.


This is the responsibility of a government. It is our responsibility to change lives for the better and to forge the way, of course, for great things to happen, to take a stand and to lead the way. A government should not be dragged kicking and screaming to deliver something which could have been done a long time ago, delaying and obstructing the passage of what is right. A government should not waste over $100 million of taxpayers' money to cower from its responsibility, and a government should not open the doors for the hate and vitriol against members of our community, like members of the LGBTIQ community who have had to suffer insults and slander that was directed towards them, like those who had to hear a hateful comment when they were walking down the street and those who had to read abhorrent material in newspapers, online, public places or in a flyer in their letterbox. LGBTIQ people are strong people. They are strong people of great character and of great resolve. They are strong people that this really did take its toll on.


What this vote unleashed was not fair. It was not fair that these people had to vote on their own rights, to vote for something that so many Australians already have. It was not fair they were told by so many hate-filled individuals along the way that they were inferior. To the LGBTIQ individuals across Australia, I tell you that you are not inferior, and I stand here today and I tell you: you are great and you are incredible. You are incredible for so many reasons and your sexuality is just one of those many reasons, but it is not the defining reason, of course. It is just an intrinsic part of who you are as an individual. It is just another singular part of your collective whole, like your personality, your smile or the experiences which have shaped you. No matter what anyone tells you or whatever you've heard across the reprehensible campaign, you are incredible. You are incredible, and you deserve just as much as every other Australian, and you deserve equality.


Over the course of this parliament, I have spoken many times about four incredible men that I love more than anything else in this world, my four sons: Chris, Kyle, Jack and George. As any proud mum would, I have spoken of how wonderful it is to see these four boys grow into the four amazing men that they are today. Just last month, my youngest graduated from high school and so I am very proud of George, but it means I am no longer a school mum—there's a bit of relief in that. I am no longer responsible for the way these four men choose to live their life. I trust each one of them to live their live with love and compassion, to follow their dreams, to do what's right—and I know they will.


But now, as a member of parliament, I have taken a new responsibility. I may no longer be responsible for the way my children choose to live their lives, but I bear the responsibility for helping change the laws that give each one of my sons a choice, an equal choice. As I have said before in this chamber, one of my sons is a member of the LGBTIQ community, and because of this—and for no other reason—he's been discriminated against by the laws of this country. Each of his brothers have grown up with the right to marry the person they happened to fall in love with, the person they want to share their life with, but he has been denied this right. I stand here today for him. I stand here today for every other Australian like him, for every other Australian who has been denied something to which everyone else is entitled to, to right this wrong, to support the progress of this bill in the name of equality. With the passage of this bill, we finally end any form of official discrimination by the Commonwealth against gay and lesbian people. We will finally recognise that the gender of the participants in a marriage does not diminish, does not change or increase the importance of that relationship, and that the state should not preclude people from participating in one of the civic norms because of people they love.


For many people, their wedding day is the happiest day of their life. So how cruel is it for a government to deny someone this happiness solely based upon their sexuality? I, of course, 100 per cent support the passage of legislation that removes discrimination. However, I once again need to say that while this bill is to be celebrated, the manner of its conception leaves a lot to be desired. We didn't need an expensive survey to get here. What we needed was a government that had a bit of courage, courage equal to that displayed by generations and generations of gay and lesbian activists, activists who have changed our society for the better, who should watch with pride as this bill passes through this place. I think one of the reasons we saw such widespread community support for this change is because of the courage that was shown by gay and lesbian Australians.


The change in attitudes that has taken place just within my lifetime is immense. These changes started with the brave few who were prepared to come out at risk of prosecution and certain persecution up until the decriminalisation in the seventies, eighties and nineties. In my state of Queensland, you can actually pinpoint the start of changes and attitudes to the election of the Goss government in 1989. It is easy to think that a change was just of its time, an inevitability that came with modern society, but unfortunately that is not the case. You see, the National Party at the time campaigned strongly against decriminalisation. In 1989, Nationals election ads featured then Premier Russell Cooper warning Queenslanders: 'Labor even plans to make homosexuality legal.' They reassured us with: 'That's a floodgate that the Nationals will never open.' Of course Premier Cooper lost. Wayne Goss was elected, and the floodgates of progressive change really opened up. But, even after decriminalisation, the Nationals in Queensland attempted to ensure Queensland was seen as a bigoted, red-necked laughing stock. Former Nationals minister Yvonne Chapman, the mayor of Pine Rivers, removed all the toilet doors in the shire of Pine Rivers upon hearing there were a group of gays visiting Brisbane for a conference. Can you believe this?


Many things have changed since then. Look where we are today. This is in part hugely because of the bravery of those who apprehensively uttered the words to their mums, 'Mum, I'm gay.' Of course, changes legislated by this bill will come too late for many of those brave activists. But, as we should remember, in any great social change we merely stand on the shoulders of giants—giants who founded a parade in Sydney, who marched in demonstrations in the face of police brutality in Brisbane, who conducted a kiss-in in front of the offices of Mayor Yvonne Chapman at Strathpine, and who came to Labor Party conferences and moved motions that at the time weren't at all popular. These were the giants who built a consensus for change. The giants in this debate were not just activists but every gay and lesbian Australian who stood up to be counted, whose relationships we celebrate not just today but at marriage ceremonies for evermore.


I'd also like to acknowledge the people who object to this bill. I understand how you feel. I empathise with you; I really do. My office has received correspondence from a number of people who do not support enshrining same-sex marriage in legislation. Some of the correspondence has been filled with vile, hateful atrocities that do nothing but spread hate, anger and hostility. But most of it has been respectful opposition. I don't think less of any of these people; I don't think of them as bigots. I don't agree with the opinions that they shared with me, but I respect their right to have that view. I welcome any of my constituents passing their views on to me, whether in support or in opposition. It is an important part of the democratic process. Whether it is for religious reasons or a conservative line of thought, you are entitled to be resistant to change. But please let me tell you that the passing of this bill will not encroach on you or on any of your freedoms. This is sensible legislation that has protections in place.


While we stand on the opposite sides of the respective chambers, I also commend Senator Smith and thank him for crafting it. Despite the deceptive and misleading rhetoric of many 'no' campaigners, Senator Smith has proposed legislation that allows two people of the same gender to be married under Australian law. This legislation does no more than this. In no part does it say what clothes people have to wear. It has no impact on children. There will be no changes to educational programs. It won't affect any religious ceremonies. The only people who will be directly impacted by this legislation are the consenting adults who wish to share their love for one another.


This is not a slippery slope. It is a cumbersome mountain. We have lived in the shadow for far too long. It has been a long journey, a demanding climb, but we are close to the summit. We have lived in the shadow for so long now, but finally—finally—there is light. I am so proud to stand here today, to pledge my passionate support for the passage of this bill. This is a monumental change for our country. It is a monumental change for many individuals but, further than that, it is a monumental change for its couples, for the LGBTIQ couples who love each other and wish to share their love. To all of you, when this bill passes through this parliament, the 45th Parliament of Australia, should you decide that you wish to act upon your newfound right to get married, I wish you all the best. I wish you a life of love and happiness. You are all incredible individuals and, together, you will make for incredible married couples, I'm sure. I will end with this: there is nothing wrong with being gay; there is a lot right about what will pass into law with the passing of this bill. I commend this bill to the House.

"Leeser, Julian, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr LEESER
 (Berowra) (18:35):  This week we're assembled in the parliament to debate the results of the same-sex marriage postal survey, to enact legislation to give effect to the outcome of the survey and to seek specific protections for people of faith and religious institutions related to those legislative changes. Giving Australians a say on the issue of same-sex marriage became coalition policy before the last election, and I supported that policy. Once you promise people a say, you cannot take it away.


During last year's election campaign, same-sex marriage was widely canvassed by voters in my electorate. People wanted to know my view of same-sex marriage and what I thought of the plebiscite. Many advocates of same-sex marriage opposed giving Australians a say, but I think, on balance, they were wrong to do so. Same-sex marriage will ultimately have greater social acceptance in Australia than, say, in the United States, where it came about through a decision of the US Supreme Court, because all Australians have had the opportunity to have their say about the issue. Australia, in that case, is a rare country. It's one of a handful of national jurisdictions, including Ireland, Slovenia and Switzerland, where the public have had an opportunity to have a direct say on same-sex marriage. There are also a number of countries—including the United States, South Africa, Taiwan and several South American countries—where same-sex marriage has been brought about via court decisions, which is the most unsatisfactory way of achieving social change.


The statistics illustrate the strength of the 'yes' vote in the postal survey. Nationally, 61.6 per cent of people voted yes and 38.4 per cent voted no. The vote was carried in all states and 79.5 per cent of voters participated across Australia. The national result represents the seventh-highest 'yes' vote ever for a question successfully put to Australians. Across the country, women were more likely to participate than men, at 81.6 per cent compared to 77.3 per cent. Some people have suggested to me that 'no' voters were less likely to participate; but older Australians were more likely to vote no and their participation rate was higher than among younger Australians. Those aged 70 to 74 were the most likely to respond to the survey, with 89.6 per cent participating. The participation rate was lowest for those aged 25 to 29, at 71.9 per cent.


Berowra residents actively participated in the postal survey. In Berowra, 84.7 per cent responded to the survey. That's the second-highest participation rate in New South Wales and the sixth-highest in the country. Berowra voted 54.6 per cent yes and 45.4 per cent no. In comparison to national referendum results, the Berowra majority is the ninth-highest since Federation. As with the national result, in every category women were more likely to participate than men in Berowra: 86.2 per cent of women and 83.2 per cent of men participated. The participation rate in Berowra was highest for people aged between 65 and 84, where the rate was above 90 per cent for all categories; it was the lowest in the 30 to 34 age group, at 78.5 per cent. But everywhere in Berowra, the result was above the national average. The result of the postal survey put to bed my fears that the turnout would be low and that there would be widespread allegations of voter fraud, which there weren't. The success of the postal survey is a credit to the government and in particular to the responsible minister, Senator Cormann.


As I'd said prior to the postal survey, I'm not for changing the definition of marriage. This has never been because I wish to diminish the relationships of same-sex couples, but simply because of the view I have that marriage is between a man and a woman. I've been on the public record consistently on this issue since 2009. I spoke in this House on the plebiscite bill. I wrote a column in The Daily Telegraph. My view was widely reported in the local press in my electorate. As I said in the House last December, when debating the plebiscite bill:


In the plebiscite, I will vote against changing the definition of marriage. However … in the event that the plebiscite is carried nationwide, I will vote to implement the result of the plebiscite.


      …      …      …


My view of marriage is a personally held view. One advantage of the plebiscite is that it gives all Australians the chance to have their own say on what is a deeply moral and personal issue. Another advantage of the plebiscite is that, because it is a vote of the Australian people, the result will carry a political weight much greater than a vote in the parliament. Whatever the result, following a plebiscite I think activists on both sides should regard the issue as being settled.


It was people on my side of the debate who called for the public to have a direct say on this matter. Having elevated this issue and asked people for their view, we have to implement that view and respect the wishes of the Australian people. To do otherwise would be to offer a Brechtian response, as if to say, 'The people are wrong. Let us elect a new people.' Therefore, I will vote yes to the bill. The passage of this bill will create a legally recognisable right for gay and lesbian Australians to marry. We all have gay and lesbian friends and family, and this will be rightly a time of celebration for them.


While this has been an important debate, it has perhaps removed attention from other issues which are important to gay and lesbian Australians, such as the need for additional support services, especially given the higher rate of suicide among gay and lesbian Australians. I call on the government to put more funding into counselling services for suicide prevention, particularly among young gay and lesbian Australians.


In passing this legislation for same-sex marriage, it's important to provide protections for religious institutions and people of faith. Many of those who, like me, voted no did so in accordance with their faith tradition. As parliamentarians, we need to balance competing rights as between minorities and majorities and as between competing minorities, and that is our task in this bill. So, while I'll vote yes to this bill, I'll also vote yes to additional religious protections. I believe we can have same-sex marriage and religious protections too. Many people of faith in Berowra have written to me to express their concerns about the need to protect religious freedoms. I will vote to give voice to those protections within the bill.


Unfortunately, the public reaction to the idea of religious protections has revealed that religious literacy is not what it once was—not our level of religious observance but our level of knowledge, particularly about Christianity, the religion which has shaped the free society in which we live today. If understanding of Christianity in our culture were stronger, perhaps there'd be more sympathy for religious protections. Despite the census result, people of faith often feel that they're in a cultural minority, if not a numerical one. In some quarters, there's been an attempt to usher faith out of the public square and to diminish or mock people of faith as being superstitious, backward looking or not relevant to modern Australia. We see this especially when church leaders appear on Q&A. But faith and religious communities are important to the moral ecology of our country. Religion provides answers to some of the fundamental questions of life like: Who am I? Why am I here? How then should I live? At the heart of the Judaeo-Christian tradition is the radical notion that, whoever we are—young or old, black or white, gay or straight—we are created in the divine image and derive our human dignity from that fact. This fact motivates people of faith to great acts of heroic service. Religious communities provide much of the education, health and social welfare infrastructure in this country, and they bring an extra element to their service because of their teaching about human dignity.


Sometimes this debate has been presented as same-sex Australians versus people of faith. It shouldn't have been put that way. On that point, I note the statement of the Catholic bishop of Broken Bay, Peter Comensoli, whose diocese covers my electorate. Bishop Comensoli wrote:


While I had hoped for a different outcome, I readily acknowledge the result of this survey and respect the firm decision made by the Australian people.


…   …   …


I want to stress, once more, that I never considered this a 'referendum' on the worth or dignity of gay and lesbian people, which is beyond question. My concern has always been with the question of what constitutes marriage as a distinctive kind of relationship, and the unique roles of husband and wife in a family.


Before I came to this place, I had the privilege of working as a senior executive in the largest mission of the Catholic Church in Australia, at Australian Catholic University. I also served on the board of a Catholic aged-care and health organisation. As a person of the Jewish faith, it was a particular privilege to work for these large Catholic institutions. I regard working for these missions of the church as one of the greatest privileges of my life.


Christians, as I learnt, have a holistic perspective on the nature of marriage, life and family. It's not a minor article of faith but is central to their tradition and, indeed, to their whole outlook on life. It's a perspective which is shared by people of my faith, and yet it is a perspective which is not well understood and often not sympathetically treated in broader parts of society, particularly the media. My concern about religious freedom is motivated by the way in which this issue has played out in our country and also in foreign jurisdictions. Activists have resorted to lawfare to make a point. Some of those activists are not interested in the position of same-sex couples. Rather, they're interested in attacking the churches and further diminishing their role and status in society. It's for this reason, in the context of litigation, that people of faith seek particular protections and defences, which I support.


The religious protections in the bill currently before us focus on protections relating to the marriage ceremony and subsequent celebrations. However, the need for religious protections goes beyond the marriage ceremony itself. It goes to the right to teach and preach about marriage. In changing the definition of marriage, we need to ensure that religious leaders and people of faith can continue to preach without harassment, even though the law has changed, that, according to their tradition, marriage means between a man and a woman. The right of people of faith to choose to teach their children about the faith of their parents is vital to the continuity of any faith community. We also need to ensure that these rights are granted to religious schools so that they can continue to teach unimpeded what marriage means according to their tradition. Therefore, I will be supporting protections for people of faith and religious institutions, which are proposed by some of my colleagues.


I want to say something about the inquiry on religious freedom which has been set up under the chairmanship of my distinguished predecessor Philip Ruddock. To the extent that such an inquiry makes recommendations about specific protections in legislation, addressing individual problems and issues identified by faith groups, then I will support them. But, to the extent that it becomes a stalking horse for the introduction of a bill of rights, to that I am implacably opposed.


I know the idea of legislating for the broad principle of religious freedoms as opposed to individual exemptions is increasingly attractive to people involved in the governance of faith based organisations. But the global experience, not least in Victoria, should gave faith leaders serious pause before enacting global human rights conventions and broader principles into our law, especially in the form of a bill of rights, which will do little to protect people of faith and instead transfer decisions on issues such as these from the parliament to the courts, which are no friendlier to people of faith and indeed may be more hostile than elected representatives.


At the end of his long life, Sir Isaiah Berlin, the great British philosopher, received an honorary doctorate at the University of Toronto. Reflecting on the 20th century, he spoke up for compromise from absolutist positions. That compromise is what is needed now. In addressing the question of how to reconcile competing values, Berlin had this to say:


I am afraid I have no dramatic answer to offer: only that if these ultimate human values by which we live are to be pursued, then compromises, trade-offs, arrangements have to be made if the worst is not to happen. So much liberty for so much equality, so much individual self-expression for so much security, so much justice for so much compassion. My point is that some values clash: the ends pursued by human beings are … generated by our common nature, but their pursuit has to be to some degree controlled—liberty and the pursuit of happiness, I repeat, may not be fully compatible with each other, nor are liberty, equality, and fraternity.


So we must weigh and measure, bargain, compromise, and prevent the crushing of one form of life by its rivals. I know only too well that this is not a flag under which idealistic and enthusiastic young men and women may wish to march—it seems too tame, too reasonable, too bourgeois, it does not engage the generous emotions. But you must believe me, one cannot have everything one wants—not only in practice, but even in theory. The denial of this, the search for a single, overarching ideal because it is the one and only true one for humanity, invariably leads to coercion. And then to destruction, blood—eggs are broken, but the omelette is not in sight, there is only an infinite number of eggs, human lives, ready for the breaking. And in the end the passionate idealists forget the omelette, and just go on breaking eggs.


Like Berlin, we need to make the omelette that is this law through compromise by saying yes to same-sex marriage and yes to protections for religious institutions and people of faith beyond the marriage ceremony as well. That is why I'll vote yes to religious protections, but, even if those protections amendments do not succeed, in accordance with my promise, I will vote for the bill in the second and third reading stages.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (18:48):  It is a pleasure to follow the other Julian—always thoughtful and reasoned, even when I don't agree with him, but I often do. I will also record some words, although, in my view, this debate has dragged on for far too long. Like so many people in my electorate, I'm frustrated because there are so many other enormously important issues facing the nation that we could and should be spending time on. Indeed, we could have come here last week and turned up to work and cleared some out of the Notice Paper. But here we are still, and finally now we can finish this.


I know that this means so much to many Australians, straight and gay. I know that many of my colleagues also feel strongly about this, as do my friends. This issue should have been addressed, debated and resolved by this parliament years ago, without an unnecessary, divisive, wasteful, expensive, time-consuming and legally ineffectual optional postal survey—or quiz, as it would be more accurately styled. When the government failed to get their legislation through for the plebiscite, we should have simply had a free vote—radical, I know! Do the job we are elected to do. 


I know from private conversations that many of those opposite agree with that. But the Prime Minister is too weak, too bruised, too hostage to the Taliban faction in his own party room for something that sensible to have happened, or for him to have done what he actually believed was right. So, in their inimitable way, they came up with the worst possible outcome or solution to the Prime Minister's spinelessness: an optional, Dolly-Doctor style, 'answer and tell us only if you want to' quiz—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie
):  Order. The member will resume his seat. A point of order?




Mr Sukkar:
  I'd ask the member to withdraw his reference to 'the Taliban faction'. It is inappropriate to refer to anyone in this House or to make any such comparisons to anyone that sits in this chamber.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I ask the member to withdraw.




Mr HILL:
  I withdraw in the interests of proceeding with the debate, although I notice that's a term your own members use all the time in relation to the conservatives and it has been in the newspaper a lot. But, anyway, let's move on. As I was saying, in your brilliant way, you came up with the worst possible solution to the Prime Minister's spinelessness: an optional, Dolly-Doctor style, 'answer and tell us only if you want to' kind of quiz, to obstruct, delay and stymie. 


The only silver lining to this mess is that the Australian people have stepped up wonderfully with a turnout rate around 80 per cent, which has given this whole sorry, shameful exercise sufficient validity to finish it now. This was not because Australians wanted to have their say, as the Prime Minister keeps waffling. The real scientific polls would suggest quite the contrary. People stepped up and sent back their surveys when we, the parliamentarians and the legislators, failed to do our jobs. I'm greatly relieved the national turnout was strong and that the people took charge when we failed them. 


Senator Smith was absolutely correct when he described his own government's policy to hold a plebiscite on this issue as 'abhorrent'. A waste of $100 million, this weak, pathetic excuse for a Prime Minister called it 'an investment'. Yet, here we are, finally doing the work we were elected to do at a cost of $100 million just to get to the starting line and open the debate. This is only the financial cost. We heard at the outset that this would be a harmful and divisive debate. And so it came to pass. Sadly, the warnings of mental health impacts have been more than borne out with a reported surge and enormous spike in demand for mental health support for too many LGBTQI Australians and their families. For that we should all say sorry. Most especially, Senator Canavan, should say sorry for his callousness and lack of empathy—pretty much every time he opens his mouth. A touch of compassion, understanding and generosity would not have gone astray. Indeed, it would have been the decent, Christian thing to do, and people might dislike him a little less. 


We heard that the debate would be disrespectful. I think most Australians conducted the debate about the definition of marriage quite respectfully. Most people put their views on the issue at hand sensibly, at least in my community from what I heard. I had many thoughtful conversations with many of my constituents and heard a wide range of views. The problem was the licence that this weak Prime Minister's quiz gave for all sorts of other vile rubbish. It is a pity most of the national 'no' campaign seemed to be about everything and anything but the actual question at hand. It is probably good the standing orders preclude us from reading into Hansard many of the horrible emails we all received. Probably the worst stuff was said about the children of our LGBTQI families.


But, truth be told, the primary reason for my strident and abiding opposition to this quiz is quite simply because this is not how we make laws in Australia and it is of no legal effect. The fact that we now have to have this parliamentary debate proves that. Under our Australian Constitution, this federal parliament has the power to legislate on this issue and the responsibility to do so. Mob rule is not how laws are made in a diverse, liberal, representative democracy like ours. The last time we tried plebiscites was in 1916 and 1917 on the issue of conscription. This tactic also divided the country, community and families. 


I understand and share the euphoria and the relief of the 'yes' campaigners and my fellow LGBTQI Australians when the result was announced. I congratulate and applaud everyone who campaigned so hard, for having the strength of their convictions and for giving voice to their values. While I do believe that equality will ultimately win in Australia, the land of a fair go, change is not inevitable and is never easy. Change and equal rights are only secured through the efforts of social warriors like those who fought for this. I record my thanks and acknowledgement of the wonderful Tim Gartrell, who led the national 'yes' campaign and should be applauded for his work and commitment. 


These people continue, and honour, the proud decades-long legacy of those who came before us fighting for decriminalisation and equal rights—as the member for Grayndler so eloquently articulated earlier today—drawing on the heritage and the legacy of the '78ers, those brave people who marched in the first Mardi Gras. That was not a celebration on TV; they were being pelted with rocks and eggs. I am not that old, but, not that long ago, homosexual acts were still criminalised in every part of Australia. It sounds ridiculous to modern ears, but, even worse, there are many Australians alive today who were born when, in some states, being gay was an offence still punishable by death.


There is not enough time today to explore the sad similarities between many of the conservative arguments run by the 'no' case—indeed, we heard some with the previous speakers—and the arguments that were put every single time the issue of equal rights came up in the past such as 'but that's just how things are;' 'it's against nature;' 'I have nothing against them but…;' and 'it's a slippery slope to…' The same arguments were used years ago to oppose decriminalisation of homosexuality, interracial marriage, the abolition of slavery and women's right to vote. It's the same conservative logic. I am pleased the matter has been resolved decisively by the Australian people, and my vote will reflect that outcome. But I remain troubled by the dangerous precedent of 'the quiz', which I hope our nation never repeats. Who will be the next minority group you put to a vote? It is a very serious question that warrants careful, quiet reflection by so-called people of conscience. I hope we learn from this and Australia never does this again.


A few words are in order to acknowledge that the result of the quiz in my electorate was against the overwhelming national response. I love my electorate and I love my community. I have said numerous times that the human diversity in Bruce, especially the multiculturalism and the high percentage of first-generation migrants, is something I take daily delight in. I'm so proud to serve and represent my wonderfully diverse and caring community in this place. Of course, I know my community well and I'm not entirely surprised that the result of the quiz was a bit lower than the national vote. In significant part, there is a nationwide and decades-long established pattern that many first-generation migrants have fairly conservative views on some social issues. Bruce also is a little older age-wise than surrounding seats and the youth turnout was well below the average. These factors combined to produce a result lower than the national response—although, of course, many older people and many migrants voted and campaigned 'yes' in support of equality and we can't generalise too much. But the most common view I heard from people—from both those supportive and those opposed—was bemusement that the parliament couldn't just have a vote. And there was utter frustration that we were not dealing with what most people in my community perceive to be more important issues—jobs and the economy, the rising cost of living, the increasing taxation burden on PAYG taxpayers, fixing Medicare and the mess of the NBN.


I remember a conversation I had with a lovely woman at a community event. She had migrated from South Asia some years ago. She told me she would tick the 'no' box, consistent with her cultural tradition, although she wasn't overly fussed. She told me that, being from a developing country where there is enormous need and poverty, Australians, to her mind, seem downright crazy to be spending $100 million on this. I could not disagree with her. A common view regarding marriage I heard from many people who had nothing against gay people but feel strongly about the traditional definition of marriage was to ask why marriage must be legislated at all—why not have a common national civil union under the law, so that people are equal, and leave marriage to whatever institutions people want to deal with it according to their traditions and preferences? Personally, that is a view I have much sympathy for. But the reality is that the Constitution specifically empowers us to make laws with respect to marriage, and that is what we must do. Ultimately, this is a national issue and these are national laws. Like everyone here, I too feel bound to respect the overwhelming national support for marriage equality.


There is one other important point I want to make. I want to make it very clear, as I have done since the moment I was preselected to run for the seat of Bruce, that equality is a core and overriding principle that I am, and will be, guided by. In representing such a diverse community, I will always keep to my word and vote to back equality under the laws of Australia for everyone, every time, every day of the week. I do so now in this parliament on this matter, and I assure my constituents and this House that I will do so in the future should one part of our community ever suffer, or be at risk of, discrimination under Australian law. We are one of the most diverse nations on earth, and I don't believe that politicians should pick and choose on equality, including in relation to love and marriage. People love who they love.


Personally, I've never been married or desired marriage. My daughter was born when I was 22, and it was never a question then between her mum and I. I do quite like weddings, especially those that are palpably, tangibly filled with love, and I was at one, with my friends Daniel and Paula, trying not to drown in the rain in their backyard on Saturday night, surrounded by their kids. But this isn't about my personal choices. I believe my role as a legislator, as I said, is to ensure equality before the law of Australia so that people are equal, and free to make their own choices.


Finally, in relation to this bill, I've said consistently that I'd never support legislation that forces a religion to marry people against their tradition and that proper protections for religion are also important. Religious freedom is a serious topic which deserves proper consideration. The issues raised are much broader than marriage, which this bill deals with, and the bill before the parliament does not stop religious traditions or people of faith from expressing their view of marriage. We need to give careful thought, in a separate process, to what may be necessary, and I will carefully consider the outcomes of Philip Ruddock's panel next year. But we must not use this issue as a licence or pretext to expand discrimination.


Some in this debate are misusing the notion of religious freedom, confusing it with religious privilege, and also forgetting that freedom from religion is, for many people, just as important in the public sphere. I'm glad that the Prime Minister—I'll say this—found at least one vertebra and killed off Senator Paterson's self-promoting bill. It's astounding, though, that Senator Paterson even actually came up with it, and he'd do well to remember that this is the national parliament, where we make laws that impact on real people in the real world; it's not like a brainstorming session at the IPA right-wing lobby group where he, no doubt, excelled. We shouldn't really be surprised, I suppose, that that was his second notable contribution to public debate, following on from his stunning debut, where he proposed that we sell the national art collection and bank the proceeds! But anyway, that's enough.


This whole episode has diminished this parliament, and the Liberals should get no credit for it. As with the history of every other social reform where they happen to have been in government, they've been dragged kicking and screaming to it. 'Leading' to them means 'being the last one to act' when public opinion is overwhelming and the activists—mainly from our side—for decades have done all the hard work. But here they are. Liberal Party HQ should be sent a giant invoice for the cost of this quiz, kind of like the reverse of the old big cheques—remember the old big cheques that were so popular in yesteryear at launches and grant announcements?—and they should cough up $100 million and a big apology note.


But, as I said, I'm thankful—and I'll record that again in closing—that the Australian people have stepped in and stepped up when this parliament failed to do our job and that the people have expressed a clear, overwhelming view, which I respect and am now guided by. So I hope we get this done quickly so that those whom this change will affect—not many, in the scheme of the population—can live their lives the way they want to, and so that we in this parliament can then get on and actually deal with the many critical issues that demand our attention.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (19:03):  I am pleased to contribute to this debate. I want to start by thanking the 83,194 people within the electorate of Dickson who took part in the electoral process. It was an important democratic process, and I pay tribute to those people who voted, yes or no. In the end, my electorate recorded a high 'yes' vote of 65.2 per cent, which compared with 61.6 per cent overall and the 60.7 per cent vote in Queensland. I want to pay tribute also to the 7.8 million people who, across the country, voted yes and the 4.8 million people who voted no. There is no moral high ground in this debate, and we shouldn't be chastising the 4.8 million people who, we recognise, have firmly-held beliefs and have voted no in this plebiscite; we recognise the value of their vote and their opinion, and they are not diminished through this process at all.


I want to make just a couple of points on what obviously has been an emotive debate over a long period of time. I can remember, going back to the Howard government days, debates within the party room and within the ministry around the issue of the prospect, at least, of changing the definition of marriage, and, in my judgement, from the moment when the Abbott government took the decision to ask the Australian people about whether or not a change should take place, it was obvious to me that the public would support a change in the definition of marriage, and so it followed. I pay tribute to my colleagues, both within cabinet and across the party, for the grace with which they've conducted themselves in this debate. It is an emotive debate. People have held strong views for a long period of time, but I think the fact that people have been able to respect those differences and contribute to the debate is a great credit to each of them.


I acknowledge what has been an important process through the postal plebiscite, which was contentious to start with but necessary, in my judgement. I thank those people who were in favour and those who were against such a process. We had a number of conversations with people, but, in the end, it resulted in 11 million or 12 million people plus voting and having their voices heard in this debate. Had we had a parliamentary vote where several of our colleagues had crossed the floor in a five-minute-to-midnight move, it would have been a bad outcome for the government and a false start to this change in social policy. Given that an overwhelming number of Australians have voted in favour of the change, it gives a legitimacy that would not otherwise have existed had a parliamentary vote taken place. For any important social change, whether you're in favour of or against that change, it is important for the Australian public to know that the process has been a proper one, that the majority have been heard and that those people that have conducted themselves during the course of the debate have ultimately had the ability to cast their vote. I made it very clear during the course of this debate that I would vote no during the plebiscite but I would vote for the bill in parliament if a majority of Australians voted yes, and that's what I will do. I believe that if we proposed a democratic process—and I pushed very hard for the postal plebiscite—we should adhere to the outcome of that vote. That is what the government has undertaken and that is what we are in the process of delivering.


It is important that further protections be provided within this bill. I will support sensible protections that are being proposed. I pay tribute to a number of my colleagues, including Senator Seselja, Michael Sukkar, Andrew Hastie and others from the Senate and this place for the courage they have demonstrated in relation to this debate. There have been a lot of critics around whether we have been active enough in the 'no' campaign or in the subsequent process. I'll leave that for others to comment on, but I pay tribute to those colleagues and thank them for having the courage of their convictions and for working through that process. It is very hard to see how those protections can survive the vote in this House, as was the case in the Senate. The fact is that on a good day, as we know, we have a one-vote majority in the lower House and, given the circumstances of this debate, where Labor—shamefully, in my judgement—has bound its members to a position of not supporting amendments, it makes it near impossible for that vote to get up. Nonetheless, the debate will continue over the course of the next 48 or 72 hours or so. Perhaps there is some prospect, but in this business we face the reality of arithmetic, and that is the reality in this parliament, which, given our one-seat majority, is what led to the plebiscite.


I pay tribute to colleagues, including Trevor Evans, the member for Brisbane; Warren Entsch; Tim Wilson; and others on the other side of this debate, who had a very passionate view and prosecuted their argument. I thought that during our discussions with them around the plebiscite they conducted themselves in an honourable way, and I acknowledge that. It is the case that, as I said in my opening remarks, the definition of marriage was always destined for change when the Abbott government took a decision to go to a plebiscite. The Labor Party and Mr Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, had been opposed to change for a long period of time. Julia Gillard, the former Prime Minister and Leader of the Labor Party, had been opposed to any change to the definition of marriage, and Labor had done nothing to change the law or introduce same-sex marriage during the six years of their time in government. Mr Shorten, of course, has now flipped his position and has, remarkably, claimed credit for the outcome, even though he was quite a passive participant in it.


The decision having been made to go to a plebiscite process, it's hard in this country to carry a debate or, in this case, to see a successful 'no' case prosecuted when, essentially, this argument distilled down to one of religious belief. Much of the argument around children of same-sex couples has been dealt with and legislated for by state governments over the last decade or so. When this distils down to a question of religious belief or practice, the case remains that it is difficult to prosecute that particular argument when even the churches were absent from the argument or, in many cases, were advocating a case for change of the definition, including Jesuit priests in Sydney. That's the reality of the debate.


I believe very strongly that the postal plebiscite was the right judgement. It was the right decision for this government, and the number of people who turned out—the number of people who have had their say in a peaceful democratic process—was very important. We embrace social change when it happens and that's the job of this parliament. There have been social changes and changes to legislation that people have agreed with or not, and election outcomes that people have agreed with or not, but, in the end, we abide by the outcome that the people provide. I congratulate those people who have been involved in the 'yes' case, some of whom I mentioned in my earlier remarks, and acknowledge the work that they've done to achieve an outcome that they saw fitting.


I don't think there will be success around the level of protection that is required to enhance this bill. It's not a frustrating process, in the sense of delaying the passage of this bill through the parliament, but I do think it would be improved if we had additional safeguards in place—sensible safeguards and safeguards that I believe that people would, in the majority across the country, support. If they gave proper contemplation to what is being proposed over the course of the next couple of days, I do believe that Australians would support those safeguards. It's why it is important for us to have another process, which—and I can understand the arguments for and against this—the Prime Minister has announced will be led by Philip Ruddock and will report back next year, because I think there is a proper debate to be had in this country around religious protections, around parental protections and around parents being able to have a say about how their children are taught, particularly if they make a decision to send them to an independent school. I think it's important for us to respect, even if we don't share the same Christian values or beliefs, people's right to practise their religious belief unhindered. Out of the shadow of the marriage debate, once this law has passed and once this question has been settled, we'll have a greater chance of success next year because people, including the churches, will be able to advocate for this position, not in the context of the debate surrounding same-sex marriage but in a fresh light, and I think that is important because those protections are necessary. This debate—this trend; this vilification—is heading in one direction. We need to, as many other democracies have where same-sex marriage has been legislated for a long period of time, have religious protections in place. We need protections because the fundamental belief structures are what underpin our society. Our success as a human race and our civilisation depend upon those pillars going forward. It is incumbent upon us, in the new year, to have a more sophisticated debate than we've been able to have in relation to the protections aspect in recent months, and I think that is important. It's a process that I will support.


I hope that some of the protections that are being proposed by honourable members are successful in this place, but, as I say, the arithmetic, in my judgement, dictates otherwise. This is an important debate to continue, and I think it has greater success of public traction, of greater understanding within the public's mind and of greater contemplation of the complexities that have been proposed, the difficulties that we seek to address and the attacks that we seek to neutralise during the course of debate next year. I think that is incredibly important. I said at the start that my intention is to vote yes on this bill, and I commit to that again tonight

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (19:15):  A man named Brian wrote to me last week. He said, 'The past year has been excruciating for Andrew and me. For me, it evoked memories of being harassed and bullied when I came out in high school in 1993. Vacillating between pride and self-loathing, this was a period when I attempted suicide four times. I felt vulnerable again during the debate, a feeling not felt since I was that 15-year-old. I had to take medical leave from work to manage my anxiety and depression when it became apparent earlier this year that the marriage equality debate was about to intensify. I had to take steps to protect myself mentally. I had to affirm my value and worth. I'm hopeful that when marriage equality is achieved it will satisfy my 15-year-old self and all the young vulnerable people in our community that we are not the rejected, the abnormal, the deplorable, the deviant but are cherished and highly respected equals.' Brian, I'm voting yes this week for you, mate, and for Andrew.


I went to school with Brian in the early to mid-1990s. I'm voting yes because the bullying that he went through at our school, that I'm ashamed of not stopping, does not square with what I took from those 12 years of Catholic education—not just the lifelong friends or the ideas of service and social justice, but, above all, to love thy neighbour, the idea that we treat others as we would be treated. We failed Brian then—I failed him then—but we will not fail him now. Because as we reflect on the overwhelming support for marriage equality in this country, one inspiring thing about the last few weeks, amidst the wreckage, is that we showed that we as a country have the capacity to treat others as we would be treated; that we do have the collective ability to walk in each other's shoes, that most admirable of all human attributes; and that we can support change which may not narrowly impact on our own lives or marriages but which welcomes, includes and enriches us all.


The government asked an incredibly difficult thing of gay and lesbian people in Australia. It asked Australians to judge whether some of us deserve to love and be loved and to have that recognised like everybody else. It is hard to overstate the hurt that has been inflicted on our brothers and sisters by asking the country to vote on the worth of their relationships.


I'm voting yes for my brilliant friends Chris and Dan, who wrote this about that survey: 'We are very lucky people with nothing to complain about. We have amazing families and friends and have had the good fortune of a great education and careers, yet during the survey campaign there were days when we both felt like outsiders in our own country. We felt at times sad, angry, confused and sometimes all three.' Chris and Dan believe that in resolving this here this week 'it is that new feeling of equality that counts the most. It's knowing that kids growing up today that happen to be gay won't have to worry about being the odd one out anymore'.


The postal survey was unnecessary and divisive, and we now need to come together. We do so having learned a lot more about ourselves, about our ability to walk in each other's shoes, about the capacity for our community to step up and lead when the government fails the community and also about how changes which may seem so far down the track can all of a sudden appear within reach and be achievable.


Many of us fear that as a country we are becoming more polarised and polarising, more insular, more concerned with our own circumstances than the circumstances of others, afraid and intolerant of differences. But this vote shows the opposite. More than six in 10 of us said yes, so many of us with enthusiasm and with pride. That shows that we care about the people around us, that we understand their situation and that we empathise with them, and that gives me great hope and great heart for the future.


I was confident that the 'yes' vote would succeed nationally, but, if I'm honest, I underestimated the groundswell of support in my own state and in my own community. Queensland, where I am proud to be from, is in many ways still viewed as a very conservative place. In 1991, we were the last mainland state to decriminalise homosexuality, thanks to our finest Premier, Wayne Goss. As a state we have come so far. We have confounded our critics, with Queenslanders delivering a resounding 'yes' vote of 60.7 per cent, more than New South Wales. In Logan city, the place where I was born, where I grew up, the place I live in and love, I thought it could go either way. But, in my seat of Rankin, I'm so proud to say that three-quarters of people participated and 54.6 per cent of our community voted yes, and there was an even more resounding result next door in Forde. I'll be proudly representing them when I cast my 'yes' vote on their behalf in this place this week.


My community and so many other electorates around the country have overwhelmingly voted for compassion, for fairness and for equality. They stepped up when the parliament failed to deliver the resolution that so many on this side of the House and other friends have been pushing for for so long and for too long. And we know that this progress is being made despite the Prime Minister and not because of him.


I'm voting yes because it is not for us to determine where love begins and ends. When I asked my wife to marry me, I didn't survey millions of people. I never had to worry about fundamental questions like: could we marry, and how would society judge our relationship? We got married in Byron Bay, a cherished place, a sentimental place not far from our home. We didn't have to leave our own country to have our vows recognised.


On our wedding day, Penny Wong was there with Sophie, and Penny and Sophie had to sit through that formal part of the ceremony that many people here are familiar with that limits weddings to being between a man and a woman. Chris was there as well. I've mentioned Chris already. It was before Dan was a part of our scene. Chris described that part of an otherwise happy wedding as 'a seed of sadness', in his words, which 'makes gay people feel like they are the odd ones out'.


My stepbrother, Shannon, is a total legend, a great mate of mine. He was there too of course on that on that wedding day, and he describes that part of the ceremony as being 'that stab in our hearts'. He and his partner, James, have been together for two years now, ever since they met for a quiet beer on a Saturday afternoon like countless other couples have throughout time. I'm voting yes for Shannon and for James. What our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters are asking for in this bill is not actually that much to ask. It's certainly not too much to ask. It's the very least that we can do.


I finish by reflecting on the words of a very talented and charismatic mate of ours called John who worked with us here in this building for a long time but who now lives overseas and who has been closely watching and celebrating our progress from afar. He reckons this debate has been about more than marriage equality. It's about addressing the dread that many young gay people feel that something is wrong with them and addressing the feelings of shame and self-hatred that accompany coming out. John wrote over the weekend: 


'To me, the greatest significance of this recent vote and this legislation is not that anyone in Australia will now be able to marry whomever they love—though that is indeed an act of electrifying power and something that my friends and I celebrate with happy hearts. The greatest significance is in the affirmation that we are all equal, that we are all worthy of love and respect, that we are all valued and accepted. It is in knowing that the entire nation has said to the young person struggling with being different that 'There is nothing wrong with you; you are as important and as human and as Australian as the rest of us.' It is in knowing that, when I arrive in Australia this month for Christmas with my family, the country I have always loved loves me back.'


I'm voting 'yes' for John; for Brian, Andrew, Shannon, James, Chris and Dan; for Penny and Sophie; for gay and lesbian Australians I know, work with and represent; and for those I've never met, who are no less Australian, no less deserving of the right to have their love recognised like the rest of us have been fortunate to have ours recognised. I say to all of them and to all of us the same thing that I have been signing off to emails back to hundreds, if not thousands, of people who have written to me in the past few weeks: 'We are nearly there. Let's get this done.'

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (19:24):  I've had the privilege of serving the people of Fisher and, more broadly, the Australian people for only 18 months. It has been the greatest privilege of my life, but with every privilege comes responsibility, and it is now my responsibility as the member for Fisher to speak on this marriage equality bill and to vote in accordance with my conscience. I would like to thank the Prime Minister for affording me that opportunity.


I think it's fair to surmise that few bills will generate as much controversy and consternation amongst the Australian people as the one which is the subject of this debate. As a barrister I acted as counsel assisting the coroner in respect of number of road deaths on the Sunshine Coast. The coroner, Maxine Baldwin, would often remark that in her role she needed the patience of Job and the wisdom of Solomon. I find myself wishing today, as I often do, that I too had Solomon's wisdom as I prosecute my responsibilities as a parliamentarian.


I closed my maiden speech in this place with a prayer written by Reinhold Niebuhr—a prayer I should like to open this speech with today:


God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.


The issue of same-sex marriage is a deeply personal one for many Australians and for many more Australian families. Many of us have a story to tell about same-sex marriage, and these stories illustrate and illuminate the complexity of the legislative challenge before us. Like many colleagues, in contributing to this debate I'd like to tell the House about my own experience and the experience of my family which has brought me to my position today. This issue has perplexed me for a number of years. I am a practising, committed Catholic. I do my best to go to church every Sunday. In fact, in my late teens I joined a monastery, willing to give my life to God through the service to others. The teachings of the Catholic Church on the issue of marriage are very clear. The church teaches that marriage is between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others for life. There is no ambiguity in that stance. It is a stance which I shared for most of my adult life.


My daughter, Caroline, struggled through much of her teenage years with mental illness. She suffered from an insidious disease, an eating disorder, most notably anorexia and bulimia. My family and I watched our beautiful daughter and sister fight her demons as she slowly became nothing more than skin and bone. In and out of hospital for long stretches at a time, over a number of years she would wax and wane between sheer determination to regain her health, and utter desperation, sinking into the abyss of feeling that there was no hope of an end to this internal conflict. 


As a dad, I am very pleased and proud to say that my daughter is now in a much healthier and happier place. She has a terrific job and a wonderful partner who our family love very much. 'What does this story have to do with same-sex marriage?' you may ask. About three years ago, our daughter told my wife that she was attracted to—

"Wood, Jason, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr WOOD
 (La Trobe) (18:17):  As I was just saying before the interruption, in 2013 a briefing paper released by the National LGBTI Health Alliance revealed that same-sex-attracted Australians have a rate of suicide attempts up to 14 times as high as that of their heterosexual peers, and discrimination and exclusion are the key causal factors for their mental health and suicide attempts. Medical studies demonstrate overwhelmingly that being married is a good way to live longer. Research shows that having a spouse gives individuals something to live for, compared to their single counterparts.


Looking globally, there are now more than 20 countries that have legalised same-sex marriage, including countries as diverse as Argentina, Norway, South Africa, France, Colombia and Ireland. Support in these countries for same-sex marriage is in certain instances overwhelming. For example, Denmark reported 87 per cent support for same-sex marriage. There was also compelling evidence that support for legal same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world.


Back home, in May this year football players from every AFL team signed a petition in support of marriage equality, and this petition is part of an overwhelming equality campaign which hopes to continue the push for same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, the AFL Players' Association has been a signatory to marriage equality for the past two years.


I believe anyone who is still unclear about the need for a change in legislation should ask the next generation how they feel about this important subject. Nowadays, when I do school visits around my electorate and get the Q&A questions as part of my session, I am faced with a new phenomenon. Primary school children used to ask me about my dog or the make of my car I drive. Now both primary and secondary students ask me, totally unprompted questions by adults: what is my position on same-sex marriage or marriage equality? When I ask the students, with permission of the teachers, what their view is, their response is that they are overwhelmingly in favour irrespective of their age or the kind of school they are attending, which really surprised me. It is clear to me that the majority of my electorate is well and truly ready to embrace change on this important topic, and it is my responsibility to represent their majority views in the forthcoming vote.


So today, in conclusion, I stand to say that, as my electorate has now voted 'yes' on two occasions, La Trobe overall supports a change with the times. Love is love and, therefore, I support this bill. Let there be same-sex marriages in the Dandenong Ranges, and it will be great for business. Thank you.

"Lamb, Susan, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (18:20):  I acknowledge that many Australians have lost faith in our political system in recent years. I understand that; I really do. This 45th Parliament has been plagued with inaction, indecision, infighting and instability. This catastrophic mess has turned many away from the major parties and many more from the establishment as a whole. So I say to these people: I hear you and I empathise with you. I understand you feel angry, silenced or maybe disillusioned—maybe all three—but I urge you to look at today and recognise the importance of our political system and the great changes that a parliament can make in an individual's life.


We live in a great country filled with great people, and it's exactly that which we can all too easily lose site of. Our country is only great because it is made up of great individuals, of course. Whether you are someone living on a very high income in an electorate like Wentworth or you are somebody just getting by like in my electorate of Longman, it is you as an individual that makes our country great. It's not your pay packet, it's not the colour of your skin and it's certainly not your sexuality. It is the role of your elected representatives to stand up on your behalf and to treat everyone as equals—and, of course, to create change to make it easier for you to get by, easier to live your life, easier to be happy.


These may be small changes, of course, that might help a single individual, just like how recently my office helped a man who was living on the streets to find some housing. He now lives on Bribie Island. He's getting by. In actual fact, he's more than getting by. We bumped into each other at Woolworths just last week. He has a home. He has a TV. He has a bed. He's actually got a physical address where he can say to people, 'Come and visit me.' All of these things mean that he has hope back in his life. He's happier than that sad and frustrated man that walked into my office a little bit earlier in the year. These small changes are important, and we can't deny this. Everyone should feel valued, and we must not overlook the importance of helping single individuals.


But it really is sweeping changes that make life better for many individuals, and we must truly recognise these as great. There are great changes such as the introduction of Medicare, of course, by the Hawke government in 1994, which allowed anyone and everyone, regardless of privilege or disadvantage, to have access to quality and affordable health care. In 2008 Kevin Rudd officially apologised to our nation's first people for the horrific mistreatment that they have endured. As recent inaction by this government has highlighted, we still have a long way to go and a lot to do in this space, but the gesture of the Rudd government was a huge deal to many marginalised individuals, and now today I can stand here to encourage the passing of another great change, another hugely significant gesture that will be a huge deal to many more marginalised individuals.


This is the responsibility of a government. It is our responsibility to change lives for the better and to forge the way, of course, for great things to happen, to take a stand and to lead the way. A government should not be dragged kicking and screaming to deliver something which could have been done a long time ago, delaying and obstructing the passage of what is right. A government should not waste over $100 million of taxpayers' money to cower from its responsibility, and a government should not open the doors for the hate and vitriol against members of our community, like members of the LGBTIQ community who have had to suffer insults and slander that was directed towards them, like those who had to hear a hateful comment when they were walking down the street and those who had to read abhorrent material in newspapers, online, public places or in a flyer in their letterbox. LGBTIQ people are strong people. They are strong people of great character and of great resolve. They are strong people that this really did take its toll on.


What this vote unleashed was not fair. It was not fair that these people had to vote on their own rights, to vote for something that so many Australians already have. It was not fair they were told by so many hate-filled individuals along the way that they were inferior. To the LGBTIQ individuals across Australia, I tell you that you are not inferior, and I stand here today and I tell you: you are great and you are incredible. You are incredible for so many reasons and your sexuality is just one of those many reasons, but it is not the defining reason, of course. It is just an intrinsic part of who you are as an individual. It is just another singular part of your collective whole, like your personality, your smile or the experiences which have shaped you. No matter what anyone tells you or whatever you've heard across the reprehensible campaign, you are incredible. You are incredible, and you deserve just as much as every other Australian, and you deserve equality.


Over the course of this parliament, I have spoken many times about four incredible men that I love more than anything else in this world, my four sons: Chris, Kyle, Jack and George. As any proud mum would, I have spoken of how wonderful it is to see these four boys grow into the four amazing men that they are today. Just last month, my youngest graduated from high school and so I am very proud of George, but it means I am no longer a school mum—there's a bit of relief in that. I am no longer responsible for the way these four men choose to live their life. I trust each one of them to live their live with love and compassion, to follow their dreams, to do what's right—and I know they will.


But now, as a member of parliament, I have taken a new responsibility. I may no longer be responsible for the way my children choose to live their lives, but I bear the responsibility for helping change the laws that give each one of my sons a choice, an equal choice. As I have said before in this chamber, one of my sons is a member of the LGBTIQ community, and because of this—and for no other reason—he's been discriminated against by the laws of this country. Each of his brothers have grown up with the right to marry the person they happened to fall in love with, the person they want to share their life with, but he has been denied this right. I stand here today for him. I stand here today for every other Australian like him, for every other Australian who has been denied something to which everyone else is entitled to, to right this wrong, to support the progress of this bill in the name of equality. With the passage of this bill, we finally end any form of official discrimination by the Commonwealth against gay and lesbian people. We will finally recognise that the gender of the participants in a marriage does not diminish, does not change or increase the importance of that relationship, and that the state should not preclude people from participating in one of the civic norms because of people they love.


For many people, their wedding day is the happiest day of their life. So how cruel is it for a government to deny someone this happiness solely based upon their sexuality? I, of course, 100 per cent support the passage of legislation that removes discrimination. However, I once again need to say that while this bill is to be celebrated, the manner of its conception leaves a lot to be desired. We didn't need an expensive survey to get here. What we needed was a government that had a bit of courage, courage equal to that displayed by generations and generations of gay and lesbian activists, activists who have changed our society for the better, who should watch with pride as this bill passes through this place. I think one of the reasons we saw such widespread community support for this change is because of the courage that was shown by gay and lesbian Australians.


The change in attitudes that has taken place just within my lifetime is immense. These changes started with the brave few who were prepared to come out at risk of prosecution and certain persecution up until the decriminalisation in the seventies, eighties and nineties. In my state of Queensland, you can actually pinpoint the start of changes and attitudes to the election of the Goss government in 1989. It is easy to think that a change was just of its time, an inevitability that came with modern society, but unfortunately that is not the case. You see, the National Party at the time campaigned strongly against decriminalisation. In 1989, Nationals election ads featured then Premier Russell Cooper warning Queenslanders: 'Labor even plans to make homosexuality legal.' They reassured us with: 'That's a floodgate that the Nationals will never open.' Of course Premier Cooper lost. Wayne Goss was elected, and the floodgates of progressive change really opened up. But, even after decriminalisation, the Nationals in Queensland attempted to ensure Queensland was seen as a bigoted, red-necked laughing stock. Former Nationals minister Yvonne Chapman, the mayor of Pine Rivers, removed all the toilet doors in the shire of Pine Rivers upon hearing there were a group of gays visiting Brisbane for a conference. Can you believe this?


Many things have changed since then. Look where we are today. This is in part hugely because of the bravery of those who apprehensively uttered the words to their mums, 'Mum, I'm gay.' Of course, changes legislated by this bill will come too late for many of those brave activists. But, as we should remember, in any great social change we merely stand on the shoulders of giants—giants who founded a parade in Sydney, who marched in demonstrations in the face of police brutality in Brisbane, who conducted a kiss-in in front of the offices of Mayor Yvonne Chapman at Strathpine, and who came to Labor Party conferences and moved motions that at the time weren't at all popular. These were the giants who built a consensus for change. The giants in this debate were not just activists but every gay and lesbian Australian who stood up to be counted, whose relationships we celebrate not just today but at marriage ceremonies for evermore.


I'd also like to acknowledge the people who object to this bill. I understand how you feel. I empathise with you; I really do. My office has received correspondence from a number of people who do not support enshrining same-sex marriage in legislation. Some of the correspondence has been filled with vile, hateful atrocities that do nothing but spread hate, anger and hostility. But most of it has been respectful opposition. I don't think less of any of these people; I don't think of them as bigots. I don't agree with the opinions that they shared with me, but I respect their right to have that view. I welcome any of my constituents passing their views on to me, whether in support or in opposition. It is an important part of the democratic process. Whether it is for religious reasons or a conservative line of thought, you are entitled to be resistant to change. But please let me tell you that the passing of this bill will not encroach on you or on any of your freedoms. This is sensible legislation that has protections in place.


While we stand on the opposite sides of the respective chambers, I also commend Senator Smith and thank him for crafting it. Despite the deceptive and misleading rhetoric of many 'no' campaigners, Senator Smith has proposed legislation that allows two people of the same gender to be married under Australian law. This legislation does no more than this. In no part does it say what clothes people have to wear. It has no impact on children. There will be no changes to educational programs. It won't affect any religious ceremonies. The only people who will be directly impacted by this legislation are the consenting adults who wish to share their love for one another.


This is not a slippery slope. It is a cumbersome mountain. We have lived in the shadow for far too long. It has been a long journey, a demanding climb, but we are close to the summit. We have lived in the shadow for so long now, but finally—finally—there is light. I am so proud to stand here today, to pledge my passionate support for the passage of this bill. This is a monumental change for our country. It is a monumental change for many individuals but, further than that, it is a monumental change for its couples, for the LGBTIQ couples who love each other and wish to share their love. To all of you, when this bill passes through this parliament, the 45th Parliament of Australia, should you decide that you wish to act upon your newfound right to get married, I wish you all the best. I wish you a life of love and happiness. You are all incredible individuals and, together, you will make for incredible married couples, I'm sure. I will end with this: there is nothing wrong with being gay; there is a lot right about what will pass into law with the passing of this bill. I commend this bill to the House.

"Leeser, Julian, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr LEESER
 (Berowra) (18:35):  This week we're assembled in the parliament to debate the results of the same-sex marriage postal survey, to enact legislation to give effect to the outcome of the survey and to seek specific protections for people of faith and religious institutions related to those legislative changes. Giving Australians a say on the issue of same-sex marriage became coalition policy before the last election, and I supported that policy. Once you promise people a say, you cannot take it away.


During last year's election campaign, same-sex marriage was widely canvassed by voters in my electorate. People wanted to know my view of same-sex marriage and what I thought of the plebiscite. Many advocates of same-sex marriage opposed giving Australians a say, but I think, on balance, they were wrong to do so. Same-sex marriage will ultimately have greater social acceptance in Australia than, say, in the United States, where it came about through a decision of the US Supreme Court, because all Australians have had the opportunity to have their say about the issue. Australia, in that case, is a rare country. It's one of a handful of national jurisdictions, including Ireland, Slovenia and Switzerland, where the public have had an opportunity to have a direct say on same-sex marriage. There are also a number of countries—including the United States, South Africa, Taiwan and several South American countries—where same-sex marriage has been brought about via court decisions, which is the most unsatisfactory way of achieving social change.


The statistics illustrate the strength of the 'yes' vote in the postal survey. Nationally, 61.6 per cent of people voted yes and 38.4 per cent voted no. The vote was carried in all states and 79.5 per cent of voters participated across Australia. The national result represents the seventh-highest 'yes' vote ever for a question successfully put to Australians. Across the country, women were more likely to participate than men, at 81.6 per cent compared to 77.3 per cent. Some people have suggested to me that 'no' voters were less likely to participate; but older Australians were more likely to vote no and their participation rate was higher than among younger Australians. Those aged 70 to 74 were the most likely to respond to the survey, with 89.6 per cent participating. The participation rate was lowest for those aged 25 to 29, at 71.9 per cent.


Berowra residents actively participated in the postal survey. In Berowra, 84.7 per cent responded to the survey. That's the second-highest participation rate in New South Wales and the sixth-highest in the country. Berowra voted 54.6 per cent yes and 45.4 per cent no. In comparison to national referendum results, the Berowra majority is the ninth-highest since Federation. As with the national result, in every category women were more likely to participate than men in Berowra: 86.2 per cent of women and 83.2 per cent of men participated. The participation rate in Berowra was highest for people aged between 65 and 84, where the rate was above 90 per cent for all categories; it was the lowest in the 30 to 34 age group, at 78.5 per cent. But everywhere in Berowra, the result was above the national average. The result of the postal survey put to bed my fears that the turnout would be low and that there would be widespread allegations of voter fraud, which there weren't. The success of the postal survey is a credit to the government and in particular to the responsible minister, Senator Cormann.


As I'd said prior to the postal survey, I'm not for changing the definition of marriage. This has never been because I wish to diminish the relationships of same-sex couples, but simply because of the view I have that marriage is between a man and a woman. I've been on the public record consistently on this issue since 2009. I spoke in this House on the plebiscite bill. I wrote a column in The Daily Telegraph. My view was widely reported in the local press in my electorate. As I said in the House last December, when debating the plebiscite bill:


In the plebiscite, I will vote against changing the definition of marriage. However … in the event that the plebiscite is carried nationwide, I will vote to implement the result of the plebiscite.


      …      …      …


My view of marriage is a personally held view. One advantage of the plebiscite is that it gives all Australians the chance to have their own say on what is a deeply moral and personal issue. Another advantage of the plebiscite is that, because it is a vote of the Australian people, the result will carry a political weight much greater than a vote in the parliament. Whatever the result, following a plebiscite I think activists on both sides should regard the issue as being settled.


It was people on my side of the debate who called for the public to have a direct say on this matter. Having elevated this issue and asked people for their view, we have to implement that view and respect the wishes of the Australian people. To do otherwise would be to offer a Brechtian response, as if to say, 'The people are wrong. Let us elect a new people.' Therefore, I will vote yes to the bill. The passage of this bill will create a legally recognisable right for gay and lesbian Australians to marry. We all have gay and lesbian friends and family, and this will be rightly a time of celebration for them.


While this has been an important debate, it has perhaps removed attention from other issues which are important to gay and lesbian Australians, such as the need for additional support services, especially given the higher rate of suicide among gay and lesbian Australians. I call on the government to put more funding into counselling services for suicide prevention, particularly among young gay and lesbian Australians.


In passing this legislation for same-sex marriage, it's important to provide protections for religious institutions and people of faith. Many of those who, like me, voted no did so in accordance with their faith tradition. As parliamentarians, we need to balance competing rights as between minorities and majorities and as between competing minorities, and that is our task in this bill. So, while I'll vote yes to this bill, I'll also vote yes to additional religious protections. I believe we can have same-sex marriage and religious protections too. Many people of faith in Berowra have written to me to express their concerns about the need to protect religious freedoms. I will vote to give voice to those protections within the bill.


Unfortunately, the public reaction to the idea of religious protections has revealed that religious literacy is not what it once was—not our level of religious observance but our level of knowledge, particularly about Christianity, the religion which has shaped the free society in which we live today. If understanding of Christianity in our culture were stronger, perhaps there'd be more sympathy for religious protections. Despite the census result, people of faith often feel that they're in a cultural minority, if not a numerical one. In some quarters, there's been an attempt to usher faith out of the public square and to diminish or mock people of faith as being superstitious, backward looking or not relevant to modern Australia. We see this especially when church leaders appear on Q&A. But faith and religious communities are important to the moral ecology of our country. Religion provides answers to some of the fundamental questions of life like: Who am I? Why am I here? How then should I live? At the heart of the Judaeo-Christian tradition is the radical notion that, whoever we are—young or old, black or white, gay or straight—we are created in the divine image and derive our human dignity from that fact. This fact motivates people of faith to great acts of heroic service. Religious communities provide much of the education, health and social welfare infrastructure in this country, and they bring an extra element to their service because of their teaching about human dignity.


Sometimes this debate has been presented as same-sex Australians versus people of faith. It shouldn't have been put that way. On that point, I note the statement of the Catholic bishop of Broken Bay, Peter Comensoli, whose diocese covers my electorate. Bishop Comensoli wrote:


While I had hoped for a different outcome, I readily acknowledge the result of this survey and respect the firm decision made by the Australian people.


…   …   …


I want to stress, once more, that I never considered this a 'referendum' on the worth or dignity of gay and lesbian people, which is beyond question. My concern has always been with the question of what constitutes marriage as a distinctive kind of relationship, and the unique roles of husband and wife in a family.


Before I came to this place, I had the privilege of working as a senior executive in the largest mission of the Catholic Church in Australia, at Australian Catholic University. I also served on the board of a Catholic aged-care and health organisation. As a person of the Jewish faith, it was a particular privilege to work for these large Catholic institutions. I regard working for these missions of the church as one of the greatest privileges of my life.


Christians, as I learnt, have a holistic perspective on the nature of marriage, life and family. It's not a minor article of faith but is central to their tradition and, indeed, to their whole outlook on life. It's a perspective which is shared by people of my faith, and yet it is a perspective which is not well understood and often not sympathetically treated in broader parts of society, particularly the media. My concern about religious freedom is motivated by the way in which this issue has played out in our country and also in foreign jurisdictions. Activists have resorted to lawfare to make a point. Some of those activists are not interested in the position of same-sex couples. Rather, they're interested in attacking the churches and further diminishing their role and status in society. It's for this reason, in the context of litigation, that people of faith seek particular protections and defences, which I support.


The religious protections in the bill currently before us focus on protections relating to the marriage ceremony and subsequent celebrations. However, the need for religious protections goes beyond the marriage ceremony itself. It goes to the right to teach and preach about marriage. In changing the definition of marriage, we need to ensure that religious leaders and people of faith can continue to preach without harassment, even though the law has changed, that, according to their tradition, marriage means between a man and a woman. The right of people of faith to choose to teach their children about the faith of their parents is vital to the continuity of any faith community. We also need to ensure that these rights are granted to religious schools so that they can continue to teach unimpeded what marriage means according to their tradition. Therefore, I will be supporting protections for people of faith and religious institutions, which are proposed by some of my colleagues.


I want to say something about the inquiry on religious freedom which has been set up under the chairmanship of my distinguished predecessor Philip Ruddock. To the extent that such an inquiry makes recommendations about specific protections in legislation, addressing individual problems and issues identified by faith groups, then I will support them. But, to the extent that it becomes a stalking horse for the introduction of a bill of rights, to that I am implacably opposed.


I know the idea of legislating for the broad principle of religious freedoms as opposed to individual exemptions is increasingly attractive to people involved in the governance of faith based organisations. But the global experience, not least in Victoria, should gave faith leaders serious pause before enacting global human rights conventions and broader principles into our law, especially in the form of a bill of rights, which will do little to protect people of faith and instead transfer decisions on issues such as these from the parliament to the courts, which are no friendlier to people of faith and indeed may be more hostile than elected representatives.


At the end of his long life, Sir Isaiah Berlin, the great British philosopher, received an honorary doctorate at the University of Toronto. Reflecting on the 20th century, he spoke up for compromise from absolutist positions. That compromise is what is needed now. In addressing the question of how to reconcile competing values, Berlin had this to say:


I am afraid I have no dramatic answer to offer: only that if these ultimate human values by which we live are to be pursued, then compromises, trade-offs, arrangements have to be made if the worst is not to happen. So much liberty for so much equality, so much individual self-expression for so much security, so much justice for so much compassion. My point is that some values clash: the ends pursued by human beings are … generated by our common nature, but their pursuit has to be to some degree controlled—liberty and the pursuit of happiness, I repeat, may not be fully compatible with each other, nor are liberty, equality, and fraternity.


So we must weigh and measure, bargain, compromise, and prevent the crushing of one form of life by its rivals. I know only too well that this is not a flag under which idealistic and enthusiastic young men and women may wish to march—it seems too tame, too reasonable, too bourgeois, it does not engage the generous emotions. But you must believe me, one cannot have everything one wants—not only in practice, but even in theory. The denial of this, the search for a single, overarching ideal because it is the one and only true one for humanity, invariably leads to coercion. And then to destruction, blood—eggs are broken, but the omelette is not in sight, there is only an infinite number of eggs, human lives, ready for the breaking. And in the end the passionate idealists forget the omelette, and just go on breaking eggs.


Like Berlin, we need to make the omelette that is this law through compromise by saying yes to same-sex marriage and yes to protections for religious institutions and people of faith beyond the marriage ceremony as well. That is why I'll vote yes to religious protections, but, even if those protections amendments do not succeed, in accordance with my promise, I will vote for the bill in the second and third reading stages.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (18:48):  It is a pleasure to follow the other Julian—always thoughtful and reasoned, even when I don't agree with him, but I often do. I will also record some words, although, in my view, this debate has dragged on for far too long. Like so many people in my electorate, I'm frustrated because there are so many other enormously important issues facing the nation that we could and should be spending time on. Indeed, we could have come here last week and turned up to work and cleared some out of the Notice Paper. But here we are still, and finally now we can finish this.


I know that this means so much to many Australians, straight and gay. I know that many of my colleagues also feel strongly about this, as do my friends. This issue should have been addressed, debated and resolved by this parliament years ago, without an unnecessary, divisive, wasteful, expensive, time-consuming and legally ineffectual optional postal survey—or quiz, as it would be more accurately styled. When the government failed to get their legislation through for the plebiscite, we should have simply had a free vote—radical, I know! Do the job we are elected to do. 


I know from private conversations that many of those opposite agree with that. But the Prime Minister is too weak, too bruised, too hostage to the Taliban faction in his own party room for something that sensible to have happened, or for him to have done what he actually believed was right. So, in their inimitable way, they came up with the worst possible outcome or solution to the Prime Minister's spinelessness: an optional, Dolly-Doctor style, 'answer and tell us only if you want to' quiz—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie
):  Order. The member will resume his seat. A point of order?




Mr Sukkar:
  I'd ask the member to withdraw his reference to 'the Taliban faction'. It is inappropriate to refer to anyone in this House or to make any such comparisons to anyone that sits in this chamber.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I ask the member to withdraw.




Mr HILL:
  I withdraw in the interests of proceeding with the debate, although I notice that's a term your own members use all the time in relation to the conservatives and it has been in the newspaper a lot. But, anyway, let's move on. As I was saying, in your brilliant way, you came up with the worst possible solution to the Prime Minister's spinelessness: an optional, Dolly-Doctor style, 'answer and tell us only if you want to' kind of quiz, to obstruct, delay and stymie. 


The only silver lining to this mess is that the Australian people have stepped up wonderfully with a turnout rate around 80 per cent, which has given this whole sorry, shameful exercise sufficient validity to finish it now. This was not because Australians wanted to have their say, as the Prime Minister keeps waffling. The real scientific polls would suggest quite the contrary. People stepped up and sent back their surveys when we, the parliamentarians and the legislators, failed to do our jobs. I'm greatly relieved the national turnout was strong and that the people took charge when we failed them. 


Senator Smith was absolutely correct when he described his own government's policy to hold a plebiscite on this issue as 'abhorrent'. A waste of $100 million, this weak, pathetic excuse for a Prime Minister called it 'an investment'. Yet, here we are, finally doing the work we were elected to do at a cost of $100 million just to get to the starting line and open the debate. This is only the financial cost. We heard at the outset that this would be a harmful and divisive debate. And so it came to pass. Sadly, the warnings of mental health impacts have been more than borne out with a reported surge and enormous spike in demand for mental health support for too many LGBTQI Australians and their families. For that we should all say sorry. Most especially, Senator Canavan, should say sorry for his callousness and lack of empathy—pretty much every time he opens his mouth. A touch of compassion, understanding and generosity would not have gone astray. Indeed, it would have been the decent, Christian thing to do, and people might dislike him a little less. 


We heard that the debate would be disrespectful. I think most Australians conducted the debate about the definition of marriage quite respectfully. Most people put their views on the issue at hand sensibly, at least in my community from what I heard. I had many thoughtful conversations with many of my constituents and heard a wide range of views. The problem was the licence that this weak Prime Minister's quiz gave for all sorts of other vile rubbish. It is a pity most of the national 'no' campaign seemed to be about everything and anything but the actual question at hand. It is probably good the standing orders preclude us from reading into Hansard many of the horrible emails we all received. Probably the worst stuff was said about the children of our LGBTQI families.


But, truth be told, the primary reason for my strident and abiding opposition to this quiz is quite simply because this is not how we make laws in Australia and it is of no legal effect. The fact that we now have to have this parliamentary debate proves that. Under our Australian Constitution, this federal parliament has the power to legislate on this issue and the responsibility to do so. Mob rule is not how laws are made in a diverse, liberal, representative democracy like ours. The last time we tried plebiscites was in 1916 and 1917 on the issue of conscription. This tactic also divided the country, community and families. 


I understand and share the euphoria and the relief of the 'yes' campaigners and my fellow LGBTQI Australians when the result was announced. I congratulate and applaud everyone who campaigned so hard, for having the strength of their convictions and for giving voice to their values. While I do believe that equality will ultimately win in Australia, the land of a fair go, change is not inevitable and is never easy. Change and equal rights are only secured through the efforts of social warriors like those who fought for this. I record my thanks and acknowledgement of the wonderful Tim Gartrell, who led the national 'yes' campaign and should be applauded for his work and commitment. 


These people continue, and honour, the proud decades-long legacy of those who came before us fighting for decriminalisation and equal rights—as the member for Grayndler so eloquently articulated earlier today—drawing on the heritage and the legacy of the '78ers, those brave people who marched in the first Mardi Gras. That was not a celebration on TV; they were being pelted with rocks and eggs. I am not that old, but, not that long ago, homosexual acts were still criminalised in every part of Australia. It sounds ridiculous to modern ears, but, even worse, there are many Australians alive today who were born when, in some states, being gay was an offence still punishable by death.


There is not enough time today to explore the sad similarities between many of the conservative arguments run by the 'no' case—indeed, we heard some with the previous speakers—and the arguments that were put every single time the issue of equal rights came up in the past such as 'but that's just how things are;' 'it's against nature;' 'I have nothing against them but…;' and 'it's a slippery slope to…' The same arguments were used years ago to oppose decriminalisation of homosexuality, interracial marriage, the abolition of slavery and women's right to vote. It's the same conservative logic. I am pleased the matter has been resolved decisively by the Australian people, and my vote will reflect that outcome. But I remain troubled by the dangerous precedent of 'the quiz', which I hope our nation never repeats. Who will be the next minority group you put to a vote? It is a very serious question that warrants careful, quiet reflection by so-called people of conscience. I hope we learn from this and Australia never does this again.


A few words are in order to acknowledge that the result of the quiz in my electorate was against the overwhelming national response. I love my electorate and I love my community. I have said numerous times that the human diversity in Bruce, especially the multiculturalism and the high percentage of first-generation migrants, is something I take daily delight in. I'm so proud to serve and represent my wonderfully diverse and caring community in this place. Of course, I know my community well and I'm not entirely surprised that the result of the quiz was a bit lower than the national vote. In significant part, there is a nationwide and decades-long established pattern that many first-generation migrants have fairly conservative views on some social issues. Bruce also is a little older age-wise than surrounding seats and the youth turnout was well below the average. These factors combined to produce a result lower than the national response—although, of course, many older people and many migrants voted and campaigned 'yes' in support of equality and we can't generalise too much. But the most common view I heard from people—from both those supportive and those opposed—was bemusement that the parliament couldn't just have a vote. And there was utter frustration that we were not dealing with what most people in my community perceive to be more important issues—jobs and the economy, the rising cost of living, the increasing taxation burden on PAYG taxpayers, fixing Medicare and the mess of the NBN.


I remember a conversation I had with a lovely woman at a community event. She had migrated from South Asia some years ago. She told me she would tick the 'no' box, consistent with her cultural tradition, although she wasn't overly fussed. She told me that, being from a developing country where there is enormous need and poverty, Australians, to her mind, seem downright crazy to be spending $100 million on this. I could not disagree with her. A common view regarding marriage I heard from many people who had nothing against gay people but feel strongly about the traditional definition of marriage was to ask why marriage must be legislated at all—why not have a common national civil union under the law, so that people are equal, and leave marriage to whatever institutions people want to deal with it according to their traditions and preferences? Personally, that is a view I have much sympathy for. But the reality is that the Constitution specifically empowers us to make laws with respect to marriage, and that is what we must do. Ultimately, this is a national issue and these are national laws. Like everyone here, I too feel bound to respect the overwhelming national support for marriage equality.


There is one other important point I want to make. I want to make it very clear, as I have done since the moment I was preselected to run for the seat of Bruce, that equality is a core and overriding principle that I am, and will be, guided by. In representing such a diverse community, I will always keep to my word and vote to back equality under the laws of Australia for everyone, every time, every day of the week. I do so now in this parliament on this matter, and I assure my constituents and this House that I will do so in the future should one part of our community ever suffer, or be at risk of, discrimination under Australian law. We are one of the most diverse nations on earth, and I don't believe that politicians should pick and choose on equality, including in relation to love and marriage. People love who they love.


Personally, I've never been married or desired marriage. My daughter was born when I was 22, and it was never a question then between her mum and I. I do quite like weddings, especially those that are palpably, tangibly filled with love, and I was at one, with my friends Daniel and Paula, trying not to drown in the rain in their backyard on Saturday night, surrounded by their kids. But this isn't about my personal choices. I believe my role as a legislator, as I said, is to ensure equality before the law of Australia so that people are equal, and free to make their own choices.


Finally, in relation to this bill, I've said consistently that I'd never support legislation that forces a religion to marry people against their tradition and that proper protections for religion are also important. Religious freedom is a serious topic which deserves proper consideration. The issues raised are much broader than marriage, which this bill deals with, and the bill before the parliament does not stop religious traditions or people of faith from expressing their view of marriage. We need to give careful thought, in a separate process, to what may be necessary, and I will carefully consider the outcomes of Philip Ruddock's panel next year. But we must not use this issue as a licence or pretext to expand discrimination.


Some in this debate are misusing the notion of religious freedom, confusing it with religious privilege, and also forgetting that freedom from religion is, for many people, just as important in the public sphere. I'm glad that the Prime Minister—I'll say this—found at least one vertebra and killed off Senator Paterson's self-promoting bill. It's astounding, though, that Senator Paterson even actually came up with it, and he'd do well to remember that this is the national parliament, where we make laws that impact on real people in the real world; it's not like a brainstorming session at the IPA right-wing lobby group where he, no doubt, excelled. We shouldn't really be surprised, I suppose, that that was his second notable contribution to public debate, following on from his stunning debut, where he proposed that we sell the national art collection and bank the proceeds! But anyway, that's enough.


This whole episode has diminished this parliament, and the Liberals should get no credit for it. As with the history of every other social reform where they happen to have been in government, they've been dragged kicking and screaming to it. 'Leading' to them means 'being the last one to act' when public opinion is overwhelming and the activists—mainly from our side—for decades have done all the hard work. But here they are. Liberal Party HQ should be sent a giant invoice for the cost of this quiz, kind of like the reverse of the old big cheques—remember the old big cheques that were so popular in yesteryear at launches and grant announcements?—and they should cough up $100 million and a big apology note.


But, as I said, I'm thankful—and I'll record that again in closing—that the Australian people have stepped in and stepped up when this parliament failed to do our job and that the people have expressed a clear, overwhelming view, which I respect and am now guided by. So I hope we get this done quickly so that those whom this change will affect—not many, in the scheme of the population—can live their lives the way they want to, and so that we in this parliament can then get on and actually deal with the many critical issues that demand our attention.

Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (19:03):  I am pleased to contribute to this debate. I want to start by thanking the 83,194 people within the electorate of Dickson who took part in the electoral process. It was an important democratic process, and I pay tribute to those people who voted, yes or no. In the end, my electorate recorded a high 'yes' vote of 65.2 per cent, which compared with 61.6 per cent overall and the 60.7 per cent vote in Queensland. I want to pay tribute also to the 7.8 million people who, across the country, voted yes and the 4.8 million people who voted no. There is no moral high ground in this debate, and we shouldn't be chastising the 4.8 million people who, we recognise, have firmly-held beliefs and have voted no in this plebiscite; we recognise the value of their vote and their opinion, and they are not diminished through this process at all.


I want to make just a couple of points on what obviously has been an emotive debate over a long period of time. I can remember, going back to the Howard government days, debates within the party room and within the ministry around the issue of the prospect, at least, of changing the definition of marriage, and, in my judgement, from the moment when the Abbott government took the decision to ask the Australian people about whether or not a change should take place, it was obvious to me that the public would support a change in the definition of marriage, and so it followed. I pay tribute to my colleagues, both within cabinet and across the party, for the grace with which they've conducted themselves in this debate. It is an emotive debate. People have held strong views for a long period of time, but I think the fact that people have been able to respect those differences and contribute to the debate is a great credit to each of them.


I acknowledge what has been an important process through the postal plebiscite, which was contentious to start with but necessary, in my judgement. I thank those people who were in favour and those who were against such a process. We had a number of conversations with people, but, in the end, it resulted in 11 million or 12 million people plus voting and having their voices heard in this debate. Had we had a parliamentary vote where several of our colleagues had crossed the floor in a five-minute-to-midnight move, it would have been a bad outcome for the government and a false start to this change in social policy. Given that an overwhelming number of Australians have voted in favour of the change, it gives a legitimacy that would not otherwise have existed had a parliamentary vote taken place. For any important social change, whether you're in favour of or against that change, it is important for the Australian public to know that the process has been a proper one, that the majority have been heard and that those people that have conducted themselves during the course of the debate have ultimately had the ability to cast their vote. I made it very clear during the course of this debate that I would vote no during the plebiscite but I would vote for the bill in parliament if a majority of Australians voted yes, and that's what I will do. I believe that if we proposed a democratic process—and I pushed very hard for the postal plebiscite—we should adhere to the outcome of that vote. That is what the government has undertaken and that is what we are in the process of delivering.


It is important that further protections be provided within this bill. I will support sensible protections that are being proposed. I pay tribute to a number of my colleagues, including Senator Seselja, Michael Sukkar, Andrew Hastie and others from the Senate and this place for the courage they have demonstrated in relation to this debate. There have been a lot of critics around whether we have been active enough in the 'no' campaign or in the subsequent process. I'll leave that for others to comment on, but I pay tribute to those colleagues and thank them for having the courage of their convictions and for working through that process. It is very hard to see how those protections can survive the vote in this House, as was the case in the Senate. The fact is that on a good day, as we know, we have a one-vote majority in the lower House and, given the circumstances of this debate, where Labor—shamefully, in my judgement—has bound its members to a position of not supporting amendments, it makes it near impossible for that vote to get up. Nonetheless, the debate will continue over the course of the next 48 or 72 hours or so. Perhaps there is some prospect, but in this business we face the reality of arithmetic, and that is the reality in this parliament, which, given our one-seat majority, is what led to the plebiscite.


I pay tribute to colleagues, including Trevor Evans, the member for Brisbane; Warren Entsch; Tim Wilson; and others on the other side of this debate, who had a very passionate view and prosecuted their argument. I thought that during our discussions with them around the plebiscite they conducted themselves in an honourable way, and I acknowledge that. It is the case that, as I said in my opening remarks, the definition of marriage was always destined for change when the Abbott government took a decision to go to a plebiscite. The Labor Party and Mr Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, had been opposed to change for a long period of time. Julia Gillard, the former Prime Minister and Leader of the Labor Party, had been opposed to any change to the definition of marriage, and Labor had done nothing to change the law or introduce same-sex marriage during the six years of their time in government. Mr Shorten, of course, has now flipped his position and has, remarkably, claimed credit for the outcome, even though he was quite a passive participant in it.


The decision having been made to go to a plebiscite process, it's hard in this country to carry a debate or, in this case, to see a successful 'no' case prosecuted when, essentially, this argument distilled down to one of religious belief. Much of the argument around children of same-sex couples has been dealt with and legislated for by state governments over the last decade or so. When this distils down to a question of religious belief or practice, the case remains that it is difficult to prosecute that particular argument when even the churches were absent from the argument or, in many cases, were advocating a case for change of the definition, including Jesuit priests in Sydney. That's the reality of the debate.


I believe very strongly that the postal plebiscite was the right judgement. It was the right decision for this government, and the number of people who turned out—the number of people who have had their say in a peaceful democratic process—was very important. We embrace social change when it happens and that's the job of this parliament. There have been social changes and changes to legislation that people have agreed with or not, and election outcomes that people have agreed with or not, but, in the end, we abide by the outcome that the people provide. I congratulate those people who have been involved in the 'yes' case, some of whom I mentioned in my earlier remarks, and acknowledge the work that they've done to achieve an outcome that they saw fitting.


I don't think there will be success around the level of protection that is required to enhance this bill. It's not a frustrating process, in the sense of delaying the passage of this bill through the parliament, but I do think it would be improved if we had additional safeguards in place—sensible safeguards and safeguards that I believe that people would, in the majority across the country, support. If they gave proper contemplation to what is being proposed over the course of the next couple of days, I do believe that Australians would support those safeguards. It's why it is important for us to have another process, which—and I can understand the arguments for and against this—the Prime Minister has announced will be led by Philip Ruddock and will report back next year, because I think there is a proper debate to be had in this country around religious protections, around parental protections and around parents being able to have a say about how their children are taught, particularly if they make a decision to send them to an independent school. I think it's important for us to respect, even if we don't share the same Christian values or beliefs, people's right to practise their religious belief unhindered. Out of the shadow of the marriage debate, once this law has passed and once this question has been settled, we'll have a greater chance of success next year because people, including the churches, will be able to advocate for this position, not in the context of the debate surrounding same-sex marriage but in a fresh light, and I think that is important because those protections are necessary. This debate—this trend; this vilification—is heading in one direction. We need to, as many other democracies have where same-sex marriage has been legislated for a long period of time, have religious protections in place. We need protections because the fundamental belief structures are what underpin our society. Our success as a human race and our civilisation depend upon those pillars going forward. It is incumbent upon us, in the new year, to have a more sophisticated debate than we've been able to have in relation to the protections aspect in recent months, and I think that is important. It's a process that I will support.


I hope that some of the protections that are being proposed by honourable members are successful in this place, but, as I say, the arithmetic, in my judgement, dictates otherwise. This is an important debate to continue, and I think it has greater success of public traction, of greater understanding within the public's mind and of greater contemplation of the complexities that have been proposed, the difficulties that we seek to address and the attacks that we seek to neutralise during the course of debate next year. I think that is incredibly important. I said at the start that my intention is to vote yes on this bill, and I commit to that again tonight

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (19:15):  A man named Brian wrote to me last week. He said, 'The past year has been excruciating for Andrew and me. For me, it evoked memories of being harassed and bullied when I came out in high school in 1993. Vacillating between pride and self-loathing, this was a period when I attempted suicide four times. I felt vulnerable again during the debate, a feeling not felt since I was that 15-year-old. I had to take medical leave from work to manage my anxiety and depression when it became apparent earlier this year that the marriage equality debate was about to intensify. I had to take steps to protect myself mentally. I had to affirm my value and worth. I'm hopeful that when marriage equality is achieved it will satisfy my 15-year-old self and all the young vulnerable people in our community that we are not the rejected, the abnormal, the deplorable, the deviant but are cherished and highly respected equals.' Brian, I'm voting yes this week for you, mate, and for Andrew.


I went to school with Brian in the early to mid-1990s. I'm voting yes because the bullying that he went through at our school, that I'm ashamed of not stopping, does not square with what I took from those 12 years of Catholic education—not just the lifelong friends or the ideas of service and social justice, but, above all, to love thy neighbour, the idea that we treat others as we would be treated. We failed Brian then—I failed him then—but we will not fail him now. Because as we reflect on the overwhelming support for marriage equality in this country, one inspiring thing about the last few weeks, amidst the wreckage, is that we showed that we as a country have the capacity to treat others as we would be treated; that we do have the collective ability to walk in each other's shoes, that most admirable of all human attributes; and that we can support change which may not narrowly impact on our own lives or marriages but which welcomes, includes and enriches us all.


The government asked an incredibly difficult thing of gay and lesbian people in Australia. It asked Australians to judge whether some of us deserve to love and be loved and to have that recognised like everybody else. It is hard to overstate the hurt that has been inflicted on our brothers and sisters by asking the country to vote on the worth of their relationships.


I'm voting yes for my brilliant friends Chris and Dan, who wrote this about that survey: 'We are very lucky people with nothing to complain about. We have amazing families and friends and have had the good fortune of a great education and careers, yet during the survey campaign there were days when we both felt like outsiders in our own country. We felt at times sad, angry, confused and sometimes all three.' Chris and Dan believe that in resolving this here this week 'it is that new feeling of equality that counts the most. It's knowing that kids growing up today that happen to be gay won't have to worry about being the odd one out anymore'.


The postal survey was unnecessary and divisive, and we now need to come together. We do so having learned a lot more about ourselves, about our ability to walk in each other's shoes, about the capacity for our community to step up and lead when the government fails the community and also about how changes which may seem so far down the track can all of a sudden appear within reach and be achievable.


Many of us fear that as a country we are becoming more polarised and polarising, more insular, more concerned with our own circumstances than the circumstances of others, afraid and intolerant of differences. But this vote shows the opposite. More than six in 10 of us said yes, so many of us with enthusiasm and with pride. That shows that we care about the people around us, that we understand their situation and that we empathise with them, and that gives me great hope and great heart for the future.


I was confident that the 'yes' vote would succeed nationally, but, if I'm honest, I underestimated the groundswell of support in my own state and in my own community. Queensland, where I am proud to be from, is in many ways still viewed as a very conservative place. In 1991, we were the last mainland state to decriminalise homosexuality, thanks to our finest Premier, Wayne Goss. As a state we have come so far. We have confounded our critics, with Queenslanders delivering a resounding 'yes' vote of 60.7 per cent, more than New South Wales. In Logan city, the place where I was born, where I grew up, the place I live in and love, I thought it could go either way. But, in my seat of Rankin, I'm so proud to say that three-quarters of people participated and 54.6 per cent of our community voted yes, and there was an even more resounding result next door in Forde. I'll be proudly representing them when I cast my 'yes' vote on their behalf in this place this week.


My community and so many other electorates around the country have overwhelmingly voted for compassion, for fairness and for equality. They stepped up when the parliament failed to deliver the resolution that so many on this side of the House and other friends have been pushing for for so long and for too long. And we know that this progress is being made despite the Prime Minister and not because of him.


I'm voting yes because it is not for us to determine where love begins and ends. When I asked my wife to marry me, I didn't survey millions of people. I never had to worry about fundamental questions like: could we marry, and how would society judge our relationship? We got married in Byron Bay, a cherished place, a sentimental place not far from our home. We didn't have to leave our own country to have our vows recognised.


On our wedding day, Penny Wong was there with Sophie, and Penny and Sophie had to sit through that formal part of the ceremony that many people here are familiar with that limits weddings to being between a man and a woman. Chris was there as well. I've mentioned Chris already. It was before Dan was a part of our scene. Chris described that part of an otherwise happy wedding as 'a seed of sadness', in his words, which 'makes gay people feel like they are the odd ones out'.


My stepbrother, Shannon, is a total legend, a great mate of mine. He was there too of course on that on that wedding day, and he describes that part of the ceremony as being 'that stab in our hearts'. He and his partner, James, have been together for two years now, ever since they met for a quiet beer on a Saturday afternoon like countless other couples have throughout time. I'm voting yes for Shannon and for James. What our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters are asking for in this bill is not actually that much to ask. It's certainly not too much to ask. It's the very least that we can do.


I finish by reflecting on the words of a very talented and charismatic mate of ours called John who worked with us here in this building for a long time but who now lives overseas and who has been closely watching and celebrating our progress from afar. He reckons this debate has been about more than marriage equality. It's about addressing the dread that many young gay people feel that something is wrong with them and addressing the feelings of shame and self-hatred that accompany coming out. John wrote over the weekend: 


'To me, the greatest significance of this recent vote and this legislation is not that anyone in Australia will now be able to marry whomever they love—though that is indeed an act of electrifying power and something that my friends and I celebrate with happy hearts. The greatest significance is in the affirmation that we are all equal, that we are all worthy of love and respect, that we are all valued and accepted. It is in knowing that the entire nation has said to the young person struggling with being different that 'There is nothing wrong with you; you are as important and as human and as Australian as the rest of us.' It is in knowing that, when I arrive in Australia this month for Christmas with my family, the country I have always loved loves me back.'


I'm voting 'yes' for John; for Brian, Andrew, Shannon, James, Chris and Dan; for Penny and Sophie; for gay and lesbian Australians I know, work with and represent; and for those I've never met, who are no less Australian, no less deserving of the right to have their love recognised like the rest of us have been fortunate to have ours recognised. I say to all of them and to all of us the same thing that I have been signing off to emails back to hundreds, if not thousands, of people who have written to me in the past few weeks: 'We are nearly there. Let's get this done.'

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (19:24):  I've had the privilege of serving the people of Fisher and, more broadly, the Australian people for only 18 months. It has been the greatest privilege of my life, but with every privilege comes responsibility, and it is now my responsibility as the member for Fisher to speak on this marriage equality bill and to vote in accordance with my conscience. I would like to thank the Prime Minister for affording me that opportunity.


I think it's fair to surmise that few bills will generate as much controversy and consternation amongst the Australian people as the one which is the subject of this debate. As a barrister I acted as counsel assisting the coroner in respect of number of road deaths on the Sunshine Coast. The coroner, Maxine Baldwin, would often remark that in her role she needed the patience of Job and the wisdom of Solomon. I find myself wishing today, as I often do, that I too had Solomon's wisdom as I prosecute my responsibilities as a parliamentarian.


I closed my maiden speech in this place with a prayer written by Reinhold Niebuhr—a prayer I should like to open this speech with today:


God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.


The issue of same-sex marriage is a deeply personal one for many Australians and for many more Australian families. Many of us have a story to tell about same-sex marriage, and these stories illustrate and illuminate the complexity of the legislative challenge before us. Like many colleagues, in contributing to this debate I'd like to tell the House about my own experience and the experience of my family which has brought me to my position today. This issue has perplexed me for a number of years. I am a practising, committed Catholic. I do my best to go to church every Sunday. In fact, in my late teens I joined a monastery, willing to give my life to God through the service to others. The teachings of the Catholic Church on the issue of marriage are very clear. The church teaches that marriage is between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others for life. There is no ambiguity in that stance. It is a stance which I shared for most of my adult life.


My daughter, Caroline, struggled through much of her teenage years with mental illness. She suffered from an insidious disease, an eating disorder, most notably anorexia and bulimia. My family and I watched our beautiful daughter and sister fight her demons as she slowly became nothing more than skin and bone. In and out of hospital for long stretches at a time, over a number of years she would wax and wane between sheer determination to regain her health, and utter desperation, sinking into the abyss of feeling that there was no hope of an end to this internal conflict. 


As a dad, I am very pleased and proud to say that my daughter is now in a much healthier and happier place. She has a terrific job and a wonderful partner who our family love very much. 'What does this story have to do with same-sex marriage?' you may ask. About three years ago, our daughter told my wife that she was attracted to—

Mr KHALIL
 (Wills) (19:30):  As a federal member of parliament, I occasionally receive updates from private providers about the delivery of essential services in my electorate, and during November I received such a letter from Telstra. The letter informed me that ADSL exchanges in the suburb of Fawkner, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, are currently at full capacity and, as a result, some residents have been unable to access fixed broadband service at their home or business. While Telstra have informed me they will endeavour to resolve the ADSL availability crisis in Fawkner as soon as possible, it struck me as extremely disturbing that even a best-case scenario for the families that live there and the businesses that work there will merely result in them receiving a standard of connection that reached obsolescence near the turn of the millennium, 18 years ago. They will be increasingly unable to cope with modern online services. 


I wrote about this issue in an opinion piece for the Moreland Leader, the local newspaper, the week after receiving the letter, which induced an inundation of complaints from frustrated people in similar situations, both from my electorate and elsewhere in the country. Without access to a fixed broadband service, they are forced to use a cellular wireless service, which is not suitable for all applications, particularly not for commercial use. In some cases, there are people relegated to dial-up internet. It should be plain to everyone in this place how unacceptable that is. Broadband internet—I would hope those opposite agree—is no longer considered a luxury item. 


A US government Broadband Opportunity Council report from January this year described broadband as having taken its place alongside water, sewerage and electricity as essential infrastructure for communities. The situation is no different in Australia, with so many of our affairs now being conducted online. Virtually everything is done online. Banking, filing a tax return, Medicare or Centrelink paperwork—which is actually online—or even applying for a job are now approaching the point of being impossible without access to a computer and access to internet. With an increasing number of essential services and communications moving online, the challenge for us is to make the Australian internet more inclusive, and this is becoming far more urgent.


The purpose of making these comments today is not to have a go at Telstra for the issue of no expansion of their technology in that particular suburb of Fawkner, or for the fact they are expanding an obsolete technology as a back-up. It is to yet again highlight the desperate need of this government to get the rollout of the national broadband network under control. While the suburb of Fawkner is one of the more egregious examples of this government's failure—indeed, pretty much all the northern suburbs in my electorate have suffered from a lack of rollout and are on ADSL and are really struggling with their connections—it's this government's failure to deliver essential infrastructure where it's desperately needed which is having the greatest impact.


There is nowhere in this country where the benefits that flow from modern broadband connectivity would not be felt. It is in the national interest for the government to get the NBN right, to get the project under control, and to get it rolled out uniformly to the whole nation. We remember the Prime Minister famously proclaiming before the last election that the government would deliver the NBN to all premises by the end of 2016. It is now close to the end of 2017. We remember when those opposite broke that promise they made to Australia. We are a full year after that. They've let the nation down. We are still waiting for the NBN rollout to be completed. Meanwhile, the project is plagued with cost blowouts, delays and rising dissatisfaction from people who are connected, as connection quality slips and consumers suffer.


I hear the member for Leichhardt muttering about it. I'm sure there are people in his electorate who are not getting the NBN and who need the NBN for their businesses and for their work. I'm sure there are many people. In fact, I might give him the statistics so he can have a look at how many people in his electorate have been let down by his government. Many people do not have even the slightest indication of when they will be receiving the NBN. In the final sittings of 2016, I spoke in this place to highlight how the failure was having a very real impact on homes and businesses in my electorate—as you do as a member. I'm here today saying many of the same things I said a year ago, and I don't want to be saying them again a year from today. You need only ask residents in the south of my electorate, who actually received the first-rate fibre-to-the-premises NBN under the previous Labor government, about the benefits that should be delivered to everyone.

Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (10:30):  As a member of parliament I'm fortunate to be able to do and experience things that I could never have dreamed of in any other realm. Visiting Australian military bases in the Middle East, getting involved in training exercises and daily briefings, eating in the mess with ADF personnel and experiencing 60-degree heat are some of these experiences. In July this year I spent 10 days in the UAE and Afghanistan, visiting the ADF members involved in Joint Task Force 663, as part of the ADF Parliamentary Program. This program is open to members and senators on all sides of the political divide. While we may have different views on key political issues, we all acknowledge the importance of our Defence Force and the sacrifices they make for us each day.


On this particular trip I was joined by the members for Brand, Batman, Fisher, Oxley and Whitlam. One must have sympathy for the member for Fisher, who not only was the sole Liberal Party MP on our trip but also had to share a room with me! The program gave us access to all levels of the chain of command and provided us an opportunity to ask the men and women at various bases we visited what we as politicians can do to support them in their role, as well as to learn directly from them about their lived experiences on the ground and to let them know that they have our full support here in Canberra and across the country.


Our Navy, Army and Air Force do an incredibly challenging job in often difficult circumstances, and it is important that we support them. We have an obligation to ensure that they are kept safe abroad and are supported both mentally and physically. The same goes when they come home. As a Western Australian MP and a new dad, I'm very conscious of the toll taken on family by a FIFO lifestyle. Standing at Darwin airport, watching a Defence Force mum say goodbye to her young family before flying out with us, and talking to troops, sailors, airmen and airwomen about their families, whom they can go three to six months at a time without seeing, brought home the personal sacrifice behind the lines and behind the scenes.


I thank our guardian angels on our trip: the soldiers and sailors who got us around and ensured our safety; the Air Force personnel who flew us into Kabul; Major Erica Abend and Warrant Officer Jeffery Marshall, for arranging the tours and for escorting us on our journey; our mentor, Major John Spencer; Flight Sergeant Caroline Carruthers of the RAAF, Captain Danielle Andretzke of the Australian Army, and Flight Lieutenant Veronica Manalvo from the RAAF, for our combat first-aid training; and Colonel Mark Ascough and Corporal Sebastian Beurich, from the Army News. I take this opportunity to personally thank all the soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen who are deployed in Afghanistan, across the Middle East and across the globe this Christmas. This is an incredibly tough time of year to be away from family and friends, but I know that those personnel accept their duty with pride, dedication and an unwavering enthusiasm.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (11:02):  I want to thank all of the members of the House for their contributions to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2017 Measures No. 1) Bill. In particular, the changes and amendments in this bill are about a simple concept, and that is firstly and most importantly supporting the availability of high-quality, safe and effective therapeutic goods and delivering them in the most timely way to the community—in other words, better medicines, better treatments and better devices, at the earliest possible time to the community. Secondly, it is about ensuring that there is a reduction in potential health risks to the public. Thirdly—something that I'm very pleased about—it is about streamlining and improving the regulatory environment, which is something I've endeavoured to assist with and to deliver across all of the different portfolios.


These amendments continue the implementation of the government's response to the Review of Medicines and Medical Device Regulation, and they establish a provisional approval scheme so that patients can have access to promising new medicines up to two years sooner. Other changes to the regulation of complementary medicines will allow indication as to pre-approved claims, all through a new pathway that will allow assessment of the efficacy or effectiveness for indications that fall outside the current permitted list. This will allow consumers to make more informed product choices.


In addition, there are significant reforms that will streamline the advertising framework for therapeutic goods. This will ensure that enhanced compliance and monitoring provisions will be in place to strengthen consumer protections. It will also increase post-market monitoring for listed products, leading to efficient reporting of any adverse effects. What that means is better protection for patients.


Medical devices will reach the market sooner through the greater use of comparable overseas regulator assessments afforded by this bill. In other words, this is the long-held objective of allowing us to adopt the best quality international regulatory findings and to bring them into the Australian system to help bring the devices into Australia earlier. Patients' lives will be prolonged, protected and improved through this process. 


This bill in particular, coupled with the recent amendments already enacted, will strengthen Australia's therapeutic goods regulatory framework. It will ensure that it remains well positioned to respond effectively to global trends in the development, manufacture, marketing and regulation of therapeutic goods. It makes Australia a more desirable destination for clinical trials. It helps make Australia a more desirable destination for manufacture and development of medical devices. We will receive better health outcomes and better economic outcomes as a result of these changes. Ultimately, this is our opportunity to make significant reforms to the regulation of therapeutic goods in Australia that ensure better access to medicines, streamlined administrative processes and stronger consumer protections. 


In addition, in addressing the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2017, I would also like to thank members for their contribution to this debate. This bill amends the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act, enabling the imposition of annual charges on newly designated Australian conformity assessment bodies to undertake conformity of medical devices. Annual charges will be introduced on the sponsors who choose the new evaluation pathway of provisionally registering promising new prescription medicines up to two years earlier than the current framework. In other words, it's a fee for service which allows better and earlier access to new medicines. While these new provisions are important for timely availability of medical devices and for access to emerging medicines introduced through the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2016 Measures No. 1) Act 2017, these are new regulatory functions for which the TGA must cost recover in accordance with the Australian Government Cost Recovery Guidelines. 


Ultimately, and in particular, I want to thank Medicines Australia and I want to thank other medical bodies, such as the AMA, the Royal Australian College of GPs and the Pharmacy Guild, for their support. These developments will give Australians better access to medicines at an earlier date. I also want to acknowledge and appreciate the constructive work of the opposition. The opposition spokesperson, the member for Ballarat, has been a valued partner in this process, and I think it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that. This is an example of the policy process, the engagement process with Medicines Australia and the magnificent TGA, led ably by Professor John Skerritt and his team, and the parliamentary process all working in tandem to produce a multipartisan result in the best possible way to produce better health outcomes for Australia. I thank everybody involved and I also want to acknowledge my adviser in this space, Alex Best, who has been remarkable in his work with Medicines Australia; the guild; the opposition; and all of the different players. I am delighted to commend this bill to the House.


I present for the information of members an addendum to the explanatory memorandum for the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2017 Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and an addendum to the explanatory memorandum for the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2017.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (11:02):  I want to thank all of the members of the House for their contributions to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2017 Measures No. 1) Bill. In particular, the changes and amendments in this bill are about a simple concept, and that is firstly and most importantly supporting the availability of high-quality, safe and effective therapeutic goods and delivering them in the most timely way to the community—in other words, better medicines, better treatments and better devices, at the earliest possible time to the community. Secondly, it is about ensuring that there is a reduction in potential health risks to the public. Thirdly—something that I'm very pleased about—it is about streamlining and improving the regulatory environment, which is something I've endeavoured to assist with and to deliver across all of the different portfolios.


These amendments continue the implementation of the government's response to the Review of Medicines and Medical Device Regulation, and they establish a provisional approval scheme so that patients can have access to promising new medicines up to two years sooner. Other changes to the regulation of complementary medicines will allow indication as to pre-approved claims, all through a new pathway that will allow assessment of the efficacy or effectiveness for indications that fall outside the current permitted list. This will allow consumers to make more informed product choices.


In addition, there are significant reforms that will streamline the advertising framework for therapeutic goods. This will ensure that enhanced compliance and monitoring provisions will be in place to strengthen consumer protections. It will also increase post-market monitoring for listed products, leading to efficient reporting of any adverse effects. What that means is better protection for patients.


Medical devices will reach the market sooner through the greater use of comparable overseas regulator assessments afforded by this bill. In other words, this is the long-held objective of allowing us to adopt the best quality international regulatory findings and to bring them into the Australian system to help bring the devices into Australia earlier. Patients' lives will be prolonged, protected and improved through this process. 


This bill in particular, coupled with the recent amendments already enacted, will strengthen Australia's therapeutic goods regulatory framework. It will ensure that it remains well positioned to respond effectively to global trends in the development, manufacture, marketing and regulation of therapeutic goods. It makes Australia a more desirable destination for clinical trials. It helps make Australia a more desirable destination for manufacture and development of medical devices. We will receive better health outcomes and better economic outcomes as a result of these changes. Ultimately, this is our opportunity to make significant reforms to the regulation of therapeutic goods in Australia that ensure better access to medicines, streamlined administrative processes and stronger consumer protections. 


In addition, in addressing the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2017, I would also like to thank members for their contribution to this debate. This bill amends the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act, enabling the imposition of annual charges on newly designated Australian conformity assessment bodies to undertake conformity of medical devices. Annual charges will be introduced on the sponsors who choose the new evaluation pathway of provisionally registering promising new prescription medicines up to two years earlier than the current framework.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (11:11):  I'm pleased to be able to make a contribution to this discussion and want to commend the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for its comprehensive report and the recommendations it made within it. As a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I'm all too well aware of the issues that this report deals with, and it's quite confronting. We know that the suicide rate for defence members in service is a lot lower than it is in the broader population. Sadly, though, with the effluxion of time after people separate from the Defence Force, the incidence of self-harm and suicide increase quite dramatically. That needs to be understood from a number of points of view, and I think this committee did a pretty good job in bringing out into the public domain many of the issues which are confronting us. It makes a series of recommendations around how the Department of Veterans' Affairs, in particular, might change the way it operates to service and support the needs of veterans, including the development of specific suicide prevention programs for veterans identified as at-risk. 


My colleague who will be speaking next, the member for Solomon, is a veteran himself, and I'm sure he will have some observations to make, but one of the things that concerned me as a minister is this. When we had people in uniform and in service we had visibility of them. When we have visibility of them, and their mates have visibility of them, there are ways of intervening and providing support. This means, as a result of esprit de corps and a whole range of things that come with being in the services, that you are able to look after people in a way that does not happen in the broader community. What we suffer from, I think, occurs when Defence Force members separate. This is a young person's game. We have lifers, people who become generals, but I think the average length of service is something short of eight years. That means people by their mid-20s have done their service, and over recent years they would have had a number of tours of duty overseas. No doubt that will have brought complications with it—we know that as a result of the instances of PTSD and other issues around mental health that have been reported upon. What concerns me is that there will be young people who leave the defence forces—it doesn't matter what service—and think, 'It's all over, I've had enough of it, I'm gone, I'm moving on' and then sadly, some time later, it could be some years later, they become sick. They don't have the support structures around them, they've lost contact with their service colleagues—some of them are doing that quite deliberately—and they're not part of any group which can monitor them. As a result I think we've seen the sad outcomes which are reported upon in this report. 


The difficulty is trying to make sure that everyone who signs up in the Defence Force understands that the day they walk in to Kapooka they are potentially a client of the Department of Veteran Affairs for the rest of their lives and they have entitlements as a result of that that they should use. Too sadly, many just don't know—and when they don't know, they don't do. That is a real problem. So, trying to find a way to keep connection with people once they have done their service and separated is a real challenge, and I note that the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the defence department and the three services are all aware of this and are trying to look at creative ways of sustaining people. There is a real issue about relevance and we have to make sure the defence service organisations are seen as relevant by today's soldiers, Navy personnel and Air Force people. They have got to be seen as relevant so that they can provide additional support. You might be a part-timer who has been sent overseas. You don't go back to a unit, necessarily. You may not go back to Darwin or to Enoggera in Brisbane; you might go back to where you live, which might be Shepparton, for example. You don't have a unit. You are one-out. You may not have the contacts within that community to give you the support that you properly need. 


Some of the recommendations in this report make a great deal of common sense. Recommendation 5, that Defence and Department of Veterans' Affairs align arrangements for the provision of mental health care, is a no-brainer. It is something I know has been in the minds of Defence and Veterans' Affairs for some time—making sure there is consistency of treatment and that when people do move from one part of the organisation to another, from being a full-time member serving in the Navy, Air Force or Army to becoming part of the veteran community, there is a seamless transition and their care is provided in a seamless way and is properly monitored. It is important, understanding the tragedy of suicide, that we do establish a national veteran suicide register to be maintained by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. It is important so we know precisely what is going on. There are a lot of unknowns in this space and we have to get that knowledge and make sure that we put in place the interventions that will properly address the needs of these young men and women—not all young men and women, but mostly young—and ensure those needs are met. There is a recommendation that the Department of Veterans' Affairs:


conduct a review of its training programs to even sure relevant staff have understandings of the realities of military service,


have an understanding of health issues of veterans …


I think many of them do that already. I think one of the issues we've got now is that we have a lot of people who have done three, four, five, six, seven tours of duty overseas, and when they come back they need real care. The problem is not that the departmental officials don't understand them; it is, I think, that the broader community doesn't understand them. Making sure the department services them, though, is a priority which we all ought to make sure happens.


I think, when commending the committee for this work, that there is a need to address and continue to support the veterans-centric reform program within the Department of Veterans' Affairs. We're talking about people who will be in the care of these agencies for the rest of their lives, effectively. They have entitlements and rights which need to be respected. But what is most important is that we do things that will intervene and make well again those who are unwell, and drive them away from the challenge and the threats of self-harm and suicide. I commend the report.

"Wallace, Andrew, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (11:21):  I've been fortunate to meet many current and former service men and women in my first 18 months as a federal member of parliament. I met them in Afghanistan whilst I was over there on an ADF parliamentary program tour, I have met them through my Fisher Defence Industry Initiative, I spoke at the RSL Queensland AGM at Caloundra this year and I've also been approached by many committed veterans advocates.


The service men and women and the veterans that I have met have raised three main issues, in particular, with me. Firstly, they've impressed upon me the importance of the provision of appropriate equipment for our men and women serving in the ADF. Secondly, they've discussed with me the importance of the help that is available when transitioning from service life to civilian life. Thirdly, they've talked to me about mental health and the support available to veterans and their families. 


Tragically, we know that the challenges of transition can have terrible consequences for too many of our veterans. In 2013, of the 148,000 veterans with service related disability being supported by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, 46,400—almost a third—were living with an accepted mental health disorder. These included post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorder, depression and substance dependency. In the 13 years to 2014, there were, sadly, 292 deaths by suicide among people who had served in the ADF for at least one day since 2001. Among male veterans, the suicide rate is 13 per cent higher than for the equivalent general population. Among those men aged 18 to 24, veterans are twice as likely to commit suicide than the wider population. There have been 23 deaths since 2001 among that statistically small group. 


There are many veterans living on the Sunshine Coast, and our community comes together to provide what support we can for them. In Fisher, we have very active RSL sub-branches at Caloundra, Beerwah and District, Kawana Waters, Glass House, and Maleny. I've attended numerous events at these RSLs and I was delighted to join the Caloundra RSL and also the president of the Glass House Country RSL just recently.


Separate to the RSLs in my community, we have the Young Veterans Sunshine Coast group. This is a group with 268 members, headed by Jane McFadden and Tay Sukhanthapree aka 'Barrow'—they called him 'Barrow' in the Army because he had so many letters that he had to carry a wheelbarrow around, and that nickname has continued on into his civilian life. They are a great young bunch of men and women that come together about once a month to share in each other's company. They are a terrific bunch of young men and women because they just get together and share each other's company. There are no counselling sessions or anything like that. Just being around one another seems to be of great benefit to them. I want to do what I can to encourage them and support them because many young veterans, sadly, feel there is a disconnect between them and the older RSL groups. There's another group headed by a gentleman by the name of Kevin Moss, from Caloundra. He operates an organisation called Vet-Treks Australia and has done so since 1999. It provides repatriation benefits and health education services to war veterans and widows in rural and remote areas of Australia.


The Sunshine Coast community provides wonderful support for veterans. But as a government we owe it to our current and former service men and women to lead the way, and that is what we do. There are 291,000 veterans and family members who currently receive government support, and 48 per cent of these are women. In total we deliver $11.3 billion to veterans and their families each year.


In helping veterans to transition to civilian life and in providing support for their mental health, the coalition government is already taking comprehensive and decisive action to deal with veterans' concerns. We are investing more money and we are making bold reforms. In January last year, the government reformed the rules so that the Department of Defence could inform the DVA that a serving member has left the service and become a veteran. That ensures that more veterans can receive much earlier engagement. The government is investing $2.7 million in the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program launched in November last year. This money will be used to help businesses understand the unique skills and attributes that a former ADF member can bring to civilian life and to their employment. It is a wonderful initiative. In terms of mental health, last year's budget made treatment for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and drug and alcohol misuse free for anyone who had served full time in the ADF. However, the tragic case of Jesse Bird, who took his own life this year at the age of only 32, reminds us that much more can and must be done.


Men and women in the ADF have a sense of purpose. They have a feeling of belonging, a sense of tribe and a sense of mission. Alongside this sense of direction and belonging, they have structure provided in their lives. The day that they leave the ADF they lose that structure, they lose their place in the tribe and, most importantly, they lose their sense of purpose. One minute they're driving, flying or sailing multibillion-dollar equipment; the next, they can't get a job driving a car. How is that so? How can we as a nation allow that to continue?


Our ADF personnel are highly trained. They have learnt and developed the highest level of skills in their fields. Out in civilian life, however, these skills are not widely acknowledged and they are too often not valued by employers and educational providers. As a society, we do not take advantage of these skills as we should. I'm optimistic that, given time, the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program will help with this situation, but we need to do more. Fundamentally, we need to help our veterans get that sense of purpose back. As a nation we need to throw our gratitude, love and support around our veterans in return for the service they have given. Most importantly, I believe, we need to help our veterans have their skills and qualifications recognised by employers and educational institutions. We need to help them get a meaningful job. I believe that is what will make the greatest difference to their transition to civilian life.


I know that the government is as committed as I am to improving our veterans' transition. As I have described, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Prime Minister have already brought forward many important reforms and new initiatives. As the minister's statement has shown, they have accepted the recommendations of the Senate report and are already working on new programs, like the development of targeted new suicide prevention programs and the expansion of online engagement.


As I said, we still need to do more. There is scope to do more. We need to encourage our service men and women to return to education to get degrees and other qualifications and to have the experience they've had in the service acknowledged in civilian life, because that will be the key to their success in civilian transition.

"Gosling, Luke, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (11:31):  I am very happy to make a contribution to the debate we're having this morning about this very important topic. The report of the Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, The constant battle: suicide by veterans, is very welcome. It is a comprehensive report and I, like those who have spoken before me, very much welcome the recommendations. I think there is a great deal of bipartisan support for the recommendations in this report.


The aim, of course, is that we provide greater assistance to our veterans and ex-service people—and currently serving people—by addressing not only administrative issues in the Department of Veterans' Affairs but a wider problem we have in our community. When we send our young men and women, in our name, to do jobs that are often dangerous, where they confront significant challenges, life events and traumas, we must make sure that we look after them. It is the very least that we can do as a country. So I want to thank the members of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for all of their work on this important inquiry, in particular former Senator Lambie for initiating the inquiry. I acknowledge the consistently hard work by the chair, Senator Alex Gallacher, and the deputy chairs, Chris Back and Bridget McKenzie. It is fantastic work, and really important work for our nation.


I thank each and every individual out there in the community, whether they are part of ex-service community based organisations, whether they are from the department, or whether they are lone former service men or women who are dealing with their issues and who put forward their experience in order to make life better for their comrades. I'll reflect on one of those people shortly, but first I want to say thanks to every individual and organisation that made a submission. It is because of their strength and resilience that this report builds such a comprehensive picture of the difficulties some veterans and ex-service personnel experience post their time in the ADF.


I say 'some veterans and ex-service personnel' because thankfully not all veterans and ex-service personnel are affected in negative ways. I think it is true to say that service most definitely has an effect on everyone. I don't think there are too many people, men or women, who go through training in our services who aren't changed, but the overwhelming majority of the time those changes are positive. They build the resilience of the individual and build the character of our country. But, as the previous speakers have said and as the member for Lingiari, Warren Snowdon, knows from his time in the role of Minister for Veterans' Affairs, there is a very multifaceted collection of experiences and reactions to experiences that brings about a very complex set of circumstances that we, as a government, need to provide the framework for within the Department of Veterans' Affairs to support our ex-service organisations but also to build that resilience in our community and that connectivity between the community and our serving people that will really provide the best context for people to make a transition that maintains the wellbeing of the individual and, of course, their families. Families are obviously the ones that are there, side by side, as our veterans and ex-service people engage in this constant battle.


The stats on suicide by veterans are just phenomenal—and some of them aren't even being counted. So, again, I welcome this report because there is so much that we need to do. The ex-service suicide rate is 13 per cent higher than the general population's. As I said, there is a lot of bipartisanship in this space, but I am really glad that on our side before the last election we committed to a first principles review of veterans' affairs. The government has agreed with the report's recommendations, so again I welcome that in a bipartisan way. Transition back into civilian life with that structure that the former speaker spoke about is a time of great vulnerability. I have seen that play out for constituents in my electorate. There are many former defence personnel in Darwin, in Palmerston and, indeed, in the rural area which is in the member for Lingiari's seat but very much part of our greater Darwin community. I could tell many stories of individual accounts and phone calls with distressed parents. So I know I can speak on behalf of all of those parents, such as Jesse Bird's parents, when I say that we need to make sure that these recommendations are turned into practical and effective support to ex-service people and veterans on the ground as soon as possible.


I just want to reflect on a good mate of mine, an old commando comrade of mine, Todd Berry or 'Chuck' as we all called him—a real champion of a bloke. I was very happy to see him again last year when I joined with the member for Menzies, the member for Warringah and others on the Pollie Pedal which was raising awareness and funds for Soldier On. It was great to see Todd Berry again. I had not seen him since the time we served together. He found himself in a very difficult place in life, dealing with a trauma that he'd been part of during his military career. He went to the depths. What he has done with a mate called Rob Ginnivan is quite extraordinary. With the support of family and friends, Todd got himself together through a long process and he's written a book called Everything's OK: Post-Traumatic Stress Dissolved. What he's attempted to do—and he's done an incredibly good job of it—is to reflect on his own experiences, what he was feeling while he was going through this very difficult process, the effect it had on his family, the depth that he went to, the actions that he took and the relief that he was not successful in taking his own life. He put his energy, love, ideas, thoughts and reflections into a book. I'm very happy to say that, in the new parliamentary year, we're going to launch that book here in Parliament House, on 6 February at noon. I'll send an invite around to everyone. It was great to hear Todd's reflections on his life and what his book is about. The great message that it has is about connectivity to the community.


Some other friends recently have given me some feedback that I thought I'd share with the House. We talk about digital communication and technology nowadays. There's a young soldier who had an idea, after one of his mates took his own life, that there would be an app for a phone. I don't want to misrepresent the idea, but it's a bit like Tinder in that you can see where other ex-servicepeople are in the vicinity if you need a chat, if you need to say, 'Oh, mate,' or if you need to reach back into the tribe and just reconnect with someone that you knew before. I think that's a great initiative, and I look forward to helping them with that.


I think we need to take into account these ideas, these reflections that come from those with that lived experience of serving our country, experiencing trauma and having difficulty transitioning but getting through with the help of their friends and family. I think we need to take those into account, as well as these recommendations that I commend to the House.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2017-12-04,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:41):  This is a long overdue and very worthwhile report, and I commend the committee that did such a comprehensive review. You can tell how comprehensive the recommendations of this review are. There are very significant recommendations over a broad range of sectors We have 24 recommendations, and they cover everything from the DVA white card through to transition assistance, which is vitally important, and through to the delivery of services from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, as well as the first principles review that my colleague just mentioned.


As the shadow assistant minister for defence, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important report produced by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. There have been a number of reports over the years into issues addressing the wounded and soldiers returning from conflict. In my time on the Defence Sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, we did an extensive review into how well DVA, particularly, was managing the return of wounded or injured soldiers from Afghanistan at that time. That report highlighted a number of significant gaps. One of the most significant was that—despite assurances in the evidence given to that committee that the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs were working closely or they were attempting to improve the connectivity and seamlessness between those agencies to ensure that, when someone was transitioning out of Defence into the DVA environment, it would be disrupted as little as possible—we discovered that there were still significant challenges there and that the seamlessness that was suggested by those officials who were giving evidence didn't exist. This report has highlighted that as well.


Once again, there are still these challenges, particularly in that transition from Defence into the DVA environment. It's still incredibly chaotic in some instances. We have veterans who have left the service and are going through the trauma and the challenges that you face having signed up to be a warrior for your nation and a defender of your nation. Many of them have been through conflict. They have gone from that into this environment where they are a veteran, seemingly with very little support services, not just in terms of career transition arrangements, which this report highlights, but also in terms of mental health support and just financial support.


Quite often there are gaps, and we hear that people aren't getting the support that they need, the financial support that they need. They are in this limbo, in this no-man's-land, and it's for too long, despite the fact that so many reports from Senate committees and joint standing committees have highlighted that transitioning from being a warrior in Defence to a veteran being processed through DVA is still not seamless. This has been highlighted; this has been an issue for a very long time. The fact that we are still having this conversation and that this report highlights that this is still a significant issue is concerning. That's why I welcome this report. As my colleagues have mentioned, it has bipartisan support. It highlights a number of very concerning issues, and I trust that the government will accept these recommendations and address them as soon as possible.


It's tragic, as this report highlights, that so many of our younger ex-serving men are at risk of suicide death when compared to all Australian men of the same age. Ex-serving men aged between 18 and 24 have a suicide rate almost two times as high as for Australian men of the same age. I remember that in my last term the actual suicide rate of ADF members was an issue that was being debated—what was the true figure? Was it higher than the Australian average? These were issues that were debated quite extensively, and, in a way, they delayed any government agency addressing the actual issue. Now we know that ex-serving men aged between 18 and 24 have a suicide rate two times higher, and those aged between 25 and 29 have a suicide rate 1.5 times higher than the Australian male average for those of the same age and that ex-serving men aged between 25 and 29 have a suicide rate of 1.5 times the Australian male average of the same age. As the committee chair said in the foreword of the report:


For modern veterans, it is likely that suicide and self-harm will cause more deaths and injuries for their contemporaries than overseas operational service.


How extraordinary is that! Suicide and self-harm will cause greater injury than actually serving in conflict overseas.


We know that the effort to prevent suicide by our veterans is one of the biggest challenges facing our Australian Defence Force. We know that. It's quite clear that we still have a long way to go to address the stigma around mental health. As beyondblue has said:


People with depression and anxiety, and their family and friends, experience significant levels of stigma and discrimination.


…   …   …


People with depression and anxiety report that the stigma and discrimination they experience may be worse than their mental health condition(s).


We must do better to ensure that veterans and those currently in the ADF who are dealing with depression or anxiety are provided with the appropriate support they require and that they are not stigmatised in any way. It's vitally important. I note that the stigma of actually coming forward and saying, 'I have a depression or anxiety issue,' is a barrier for many of our warriors coming forward and identifying the fact that they need some help.


In the nearly four or five years I've been holding a shadow defence portfolio, I've met many veterans, and, along that course, I've met many serving ADF members. Whenever I meet veterans—young veterans particularly—who have been damaged by what has taken place in conflict, by what they've seen in conflict and by what they've experienced, it breaks my heart. I think about these young men who have been, in many ways, broken. Their self-esteem has gone; their self-confidence has gone.


One of the men I met when I was in Afghanistan was part of a very large team that was looking after the four MPs who were there on a visit to Afghanistan. Years later I again met this young man, who I remembered as being incredibly fit, energetic, effusive, enthusiastic and proud of the work that he was doing. He was a broken man. He was a broken man from the fact that he suffered from PTSD. He had put on a significant amount of weight. He was trying to work his way through the system to get support for a university education from the ADF, and it was a struggle. Not only was he struggling with personal and mental health challenges; he was also going into battle, so to speak, with the actual ADF to try and get some support for him to make the transition out of military service. In Queensland, I met another young man who was, again, very broken and bruised from PTSD. He had had a real struggle in trying to get support for his condition, but he got through it. One of the great joys was seeing him supported by an assistance dog, which was providing great relief for him. 


I commend the committee on this report. I commend the courage, bravery and conviction of all those people who made submissions to the inquiry and appeared before the committee. This is a significant issue. These figures are frightening in the fact that, as Jeff Kennett said, our modern veterans are more likely to suicide and self-harm than be injured in conflict. This is a significant challenge for Australia, and we need to address it.

Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (11:51):  I am pleased to speak on this report into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel. I want to start by acknowledging the submissions made by Jesse Bird's family and ex-partner to the inquiry, and I thank them for their words. I cannot imagine how difficult it must have been for them, but their submissions were vital and have assisted in forming the recommendations put forward. This matter needs to be put and said quite simply. The system has failed. The system failed Jesse Bird. The system failed Jesse's family. The system failed his friends and loved ones, and the system is continuing to fail many of our veterans, families and defence personnel. We must be honest in order for real change to occur. And 'by the system', I do not mean just the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Governments have allowed this to happen. Service providers have allowed this to happen. Community support has failed. 


These men and women have put their lives on the line to serve and protect our country. When they return, we as a country need to acknowledge the sacrifices that they and their families have made and we must provide them with the support that they say desperately need. If we are to create change then we cannot be scared to look at ourselves in the mirror and ask: could we have done more, or could we have done something different? The answer is generally, 'Yes.' 


The black dog is not a problem that the defence community faces alone or needs to face alone. Mental illness is something that we as a community need to tackle. Assisting current and ex-service personnel, veterans, family members and peacekeepers does not simply mean checking and ticking boxes. It is so important that we understand that these are people and not just numbers. For their needs to be properly understood, it is really important that we ask the right questions so that we can shine a light on the many issues that have led us to this point in time. This is not a one-person problem, but a problem for many. 


In Australia, we are on the verge of an epidemic, where our soldiers and veterans are taking their lives at incredibly high rates. We are losing more Australian soldiers to suicide than in the war in Afghanistan. Figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show that, from 2001 to 2014, there were 292 Defence Force personnel who took their lives, but that figure only includes personnel who joined from 2001. Ex-servicemen aged between 18 and 24 accounted for 23 suicides during that time, a rate that is almost twice that of Australian men on average. These figures are shocking and an outrage. Our veterans fight for us, and it is time the community stood up and fought for them. 


This is not just a Defence problem. This is a problem for the community to address, because mental health is everybody's responsibility. Our defence personnel are part of our community, and it will take a community to help keep the black dog from the door—or, better still, nowhere near the door. We need to focus on health services, community organisations, employment programs and financial assistance. 


Communities should be honoured and proud to have defence communities. I represent the largest garrison city in Australia and I am proud that I represent an electorate of which, it is estimated, 20 per cent are currently serving and ex-serving men and women, veterans, peacekeepers and their families. Since being elected in 2016, I have continually said that I will be a strong representative for our defence community and that I will engage with our defence community to ensure that their voices are heard loudly in Canberra. 


Last year, I was proud to launch the first-ever Townsville Defence Community Reference Group. This group contains a collective of 25 current, serving and ex-serving personnel and ESOs, and the first thing that we as a group tackled was that very issue of mental health. Since forming this group, in less than a year we have already had some fantastic achievements. The reference group has fought—and won the fight—for a local young veteran to be included on the national mental health review panel, and for community consultation to occur in Townsville for the veterans suicide review. The veterans suicide review panel came to Townsville to meet with defence group members. The group drafted the terms of reference and the project management job description and appointed the steering committee and the chair of that steering committee for the veterans suicide prevention trial that is currently underway in Townsville. 


The reference group has fought for and won, in partnership with the state government, the Oasis Townsville hub, a one-stop shop for all veterans' needs. When it is up and running, it will have the space to house all ESOs, and additional community and health support services. Further to this, the reference group members have been involved in the RSL Queensland Employment Program for veterans, which has now commenced in Townsville. I have to say this is one of the most outstanding employment programs that I have seen in many, many years. To that end, this program is currently being considered by the government for a rollout nationally. I fought against this government when locals reported to me that it was trying to shut Townsville's Department of Veterans' Affairs office and move services to Centrelink. The minister, Dan Tehan, was forced to make a public statement that this would not happen, on the very day that I raised the alarm. 


By bringing the defence community together and supporting each other, the Townsville Defence Community Reference Group have achieved so much in just one year, and we will not stop there. Locally, we are getting on with the job and supporting our defence community, but more needs to be done—and more needs to be done in this place, including more work around good, solid employment opportunities. Our soldiers need a reason to get out of bed. Our veterans need a reason to get out of bed. They need purpose and meaning, and their children need to see them going to work. We need more staff and departmental access for our veterans, more assistance for transitioning defence personnel and more assistance with community connection. 


I say to our currently serving and ex-serving personnel, veterans and peacekeepers: thank you for your service to this country, and please know that my door is always open. I will continue to listen to you, work with you and fight hard for you in this place. Townsville is proud to be the largest garrison city in the nation. Defence veterans and families make a huge social and economic contribution to our community, and, for that, we are truly grateful. Defence are valued in the Townsville community.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (11:59):  Yesterday morning I had the privilege of joining the 336 Squadron of the Australian Air Force Cadets at their annual trophy day parade, where they displayed their skill on the parade ground and several received awards for the very hard work that they had done throughout the year. There were around 50 cadets in all. There was a look of pride on their faces, whether they won an award or not. That was matched only by the pride on their parents' and families' faces. These are young people who spend often years involved in cadets and, when I speak with the older ones who are ageing out of cadets, many express a desire to join the Defence Force. It's these bright young faces I think of when we talk about suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel. This group had within it some of our service personnel of the future, and we need to be taking steps to make sure that the trust they place in an institution like the Defence Force, and the RAAF, is well placed. It's their parents' faces, glowing with pride as they watch their children, that I think about because they're the ones who trust that this parliament and the departments that we guide will provide a safe environment for their young people to work in as they go through their career. 


It is the trust that something like the cadets has developed in these young people—the trust they have for the RAAF, the trust their parents have for the way they expect their children will be supported in a respectful way—that is so important in relation to this Senate inquiry and the findings it has made into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, because it's clear that the trust has not always been well placed. It's beyond doubt that veterans and ex-serving personnel are not receiving the support that they have every right to expect and that their families have every right to expect for them. The 458 submissions that the Senate inquiry received from peak bodies, ex-service organisations and many individual veterans and their families show that, as does the data. It never ceases to shock us when we hear that the suicide rates of ex-serving men are more than twice as high as for those serving full time or in the Reserve. Ex-serving men aged 18 to 24 are at particular risk, two times more likely to die from suicide than other Australian men of the same age. Those who left the ADF after less than a year of service are 2½ times more likely to die by suicide than other groups, and those discharged involuntarily have a similarly high rate of suicide. Those figures show us that we haven't got it right. 


The government has announced that it will accept every recommendation the Senate inquiry made, and we on this side are very supportive of that. That bipartisanship is crucial as we move forward. There's obviously work to do on the detail and we look forward to a collaborative approach bringing these recommendations to a practical implementation. There are 24 recommendations in the report about providing greater assistance to veterans. There are recommendations about the compensation claims process, which in itself is a fearful process for many people. I have been told that it exacerbates mental illness by its very nature. There are recommendations about the training of the staff who work in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and it is crucial that they understand what it has been like for people who have stepped up and served Australia as members of the Defence Force. There are recommendations about the medico-legal firms involved in the assessment of veterans, and I have to say that all of these issues touch on conversations that I've had on the doorsteps of Glenbrook, Hobartville, South Windsor or McGrath's Hill, where many defence families live. It is often a mother or a father who talks to me about the challenges that their son, often, is having, having left the Defence Force. I find it interesting that it isn't always the immediate family who wants to talk about this stuff—it's not the partner, and certainly not the person themselves. They have enormous loyalty to the Defence Force. They spent years of their life there, the family has made enormous sacrifices and it gets to a point where it's the mum or the dad who quietly talks to me and says, 'What's happening is just not right.' I think this inquiry was able to give voice to many of those issues and has fulfilled a very important role in taking away the opaqueness that was around it. People were able to speak without it being seen as a disloyalty to the Defence Force, and that's really important. The RSLs and the Blue Mountains Vietnam Veterans association have very reasonable expectations of the way people should be treated, as do, by and large, the mums, the dads, the partners and the children.


In my electorate we have RAAF Base Richmond and Glenbrook air headquarters, so we have a large number of RAAF defence personnel. We are also very lucky to have St John of God Richmond Hospital, which focuses on veterans' mental health issues. But I welcome in this report the government's acceptance that we cannot just rely on existing services and we need to see some improvement in services. I'm particularly keen to see the trial program that will provide assistance animals for veterans suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. My electorate actually has a hand in developing these assistance dogs, because we have the Guide Dogs breeding program at Glossodia. The guide dogs that don't quite make it through the program for assisting visually impaired people are often moved into an assistance program. I like to think that my electorate is going to be part of the solution through some of these programs. We certainly have some terrific stories of the assistance dogs that have been born and bred in the Hawkesbury.


One of the key areas the inquiry touched on was the danger of transition—that it is a really vulnerable time. Anybody who has had any involvement with mental health and how it affects someone's life knows that change is a real trigger for mental illness—things are going along well but then a set of circumstances changes. Why would it be any different for our people who have served in Defence, particularly when you think about the structure and the amazing support that people have within the services? I got a taste of that at Amberley through the ADF Parliamentary Program, when I got to see the sorts of structure and support that are there. It's easy to understand why leaving it creates vulnerabilities for people. So it's great to see that there are four or five recommendations that look at how we support people as they transition. I'm particularly pleased to see that all ADF members will have access to the DVA white card while they transition into civilian life. That's a really important step. It stops there being that gap, that time when all the support they had is suddenly gone.


The gaps in medical services are important to overcome, as are the employment issues. We need to provide more work not just at the point of transition, at the point of leaving the ADF, but as people are considering their future. My experience is that a lot of people in their 30s who have families ask: is Defence really where I want to stay for the next 10 or 20 years? They may or may not decide to leave, but we know that if they do they will need education and training support to help them transition into a civilian life where their skills are identified and they are recognised for what they are: diverse, highly skilled—often multiskilled—individuals who just need some support in shifting from the Defence structure to civilian life.


I want to finish where I started, and that's with the families. Ex-Defence families carry a huge load. Anyone with a family member suffering mental health issues carries a load, but for Defence it's an even greater load. So it's very good to see recommendations 19 and 20 in particular, which talk about more support for partners of veterans and for families. It's an area in which the Labor Party certainly want to see a lot more work done. When I think of family days for Defence I think of them as being not just about getting a ride in a plane but about supporting Defence families with their mental health.

Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (16:00):  Over the last two years, there's been a turnaround to a more realistic view of our major trading partner, China, and its very different political nature from our Australian democracy. Both sides of Australian politics are committed to oppose foreign donations and what's been called foreign interference or the activities of the 'China club'. One of those aspects, in particular, is the Foreign Investment Review Board, which has adopted a much more active role in all of this—a very good role. 


Let's remember that the China club got a lot of prominence years ago when the then communications minister and now Prime Minister supported Beijing's telco Huawei constructing and controlling our $50 billion NBN network. Let's also remember that the Western Australian Liberal Party and, in particular, the member for Curtin accepted $230,000 of a $500,000 donation from the Beijing linked Huang Xiangmo Yuhu Group. Let's remember, too, that former minister for trade Andrew Robb took an $880,000 sinecure from the Beijing controlled Landbridge corporation immediately after he ceased office at the 2016 election. Finally let's remember the low point of where our naive attitudes towards China began, and that was when the Liberal government in the Northern Territory sold the port of Darwin, next to our joint Australian-US naval facility, for a trifling half a billion dollars.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2017-12-04,"



Mr Fletcher:
  The answer to the member's question is as follows:


(a) NBN Co. Limited (nbn) is on track to complete the rollout nationally, including the North Coast of NSW, by 2020. Anticipated Ready for Service (RFS) dates for individual addresses are available using the 'Check your address' function on nbn's website at www.nbnco.com.au.


(b) On 27 June 2017, Minister Fifield announced that nbn would double the maximum monthly wholesale data limits and increasing average peak download plans by up to 50 percent on the Sky Muster service. While it is up to retailers to decide what plans they offer, nbn will increase the average allowable download per customer from 30 gigabytes (GB) to 45GB of peak data a month, and around another 150 GB of off‑peak data per month.


Going forward, nbn will continue to optimise the pricing model and data plans of the Sky Muster service, with further offerings on business and education services expected to be available in the next 12-18 months. nbn also has a process to provide more capacity to ""Public Interest Premises"" such as eligible education and health locations.
