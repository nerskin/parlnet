Response of the Presiding Officers to the Report of the Joint Committee on Publications
FUTURE OF THE PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS SERIES
The report of the Joint Committee on Publications on the future of the parliamentary papers series was prepared in response to a request for advice by the Presiding Officers on a proposal to discontinue the series.
The Presiding Officers, the Committee and the Government all have a responsibility for the series and are involved in the consideration and implementation of the Committee's recommendations. This response therefore relates only to those recommendations falling within the Presiding Officers' jurisdiction. The remaining recommendations relate to the responsibilities of the Government or the joint committee.
The Presiding Officers have responded to Recommendations 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and have noted the others.
Recommendation 1
The Parliamentary Papers series should continue in its present form until there is a viable replacement either in electronic or printed form (or both).
The Presiding Officers accept this recommendation.
Recommendation 2
Ministers should ensure that agencies for which they have responsibility fulfil the obligation to produce sufficient copies of documents for the Parliamentary Papers series. A report identifying those agencies which default should be tabled in each House every twelve months.
The Presiding Officers note this recommendation, and support the production of an annual report on defaulting agencies as recommended.
Recommendation 3
Government agencies producing Parliamentary Papers should publish the documents electronically as well as in print. The Committee intends regularly to monitor developments in this area and will report on progress in twelve months' time.
Where agencies do not produce these documents electronically, the reason for not so doing should 
 be advised to the Minister in the letter of transmittal accompanying the document.
The Presiding Officers note this recommendation.
Recommendation 4
As stated above in Recommendation 1, the Committee, having heard the evidence relating to the value of the Parliamentary Papers series, considers that the series should continue. It recommends, however, that the Presiding Officers should explore further the proposals of the Departments of the House of Representatives and the Senate relating to the replacement of the Parliamentary Papers series, and should establish a working party consisting of representatives of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (coordinator of reporting bodies), the Australian Government Publishing Service (or its successor within the Department of Finance and Administration) (co-administrator of the series), the Parliamentary Departments, the Australian Council of Libraries and Information Services and other relevant bodies, to examine and report to them within six months on the feasibility of such proposals. The Committee would be willing to assist the working party in its endeavours.
The Presiding Officers will, as soon as practicable in the next Parliament, establish a working party as recommended to explore further the proposals of the Departments of the House of Representatives and the Senate relating to  the replacement of the Parliamentary Papers series. Terms of reference for the working party will be determined in consultation with the committee, and the committee will be consulted also on any recommendations of the working party.
Recommendation 5
Pending consideration of the report of the working party, the Parliamentary Papers series continue to be provided free of charge to the National, State and Northern Territory libraries, to university libraries, to Commonwealth government departments and to other recipients on the current `free list'.
The Presiding Officers accept this recommendation.
Recommendation 6
Organisations not falling within the guidelines should be removed from the `free list' for the parliamentary papers series.
The Presiding Officers accept this recommendation.
Recommendation 7
Collated volumes of Parliamentary Papers should continue to be made available free to major libraries. 
The Presiding Officers accept this recommendation.
Recommendation 8
Administration of the series should continue to be the responsibility of the Department of the House of Representatives, assisted by the Department of the Senate, with the Australian Government Publishing Service (or its successor) maintaining its role on behalf of the Parliament. Unless there are good reasons to the contrary, the costs of the series borne by the Parliament should be more equally allocated between the Departments of the Senate and House of Representatives.
The Presiding Officers accept that current arrangements for the administration of the Parliamentary Papers are effective and appropriate. In relation to that part of the recommendation relating to costs of the series borne by the two House departments, the Presiding Officers note that labelling, packaging and some distribution costs are already shared equally between the House departments, and agree that the costs of bound volumes, production and distribution of blister packs, and the binding and distribution of the index to the Parliamentary Papers should also be equally shared.
Recommendation 9
Ministers should ensure that agencies for which they have responsibility fulfil their statutory obligation under the provisions of the Copyright Act1968  to deposit a copy of their publications with the National Library of Australia.
The Presiding Officers note this recommendation.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-11-10,"—Madam President, I simply wish to move that the committee reports be dealt with.
—Madam President, I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the Auditor-General's report No. 12.
—Senator Alston's motion will cover that, Senator Faulkner. Senator Alston, would you move your motion?
—I move that the committee reports, Business of the Senate, Work of Committees, the Consolidated Register of Senate Committee Reports and annual reports of the parliamentary departments, just tabled by you, be printed.
Ordered that the reports and documents be printed. 
—In accordance with the usual practice, I ask that government responses to committee reports be incorporated in Hansard .
The responses read as follows—
REPORT OF THE INQUIRY INTO THE ROLE OF THE AUSTRALIAN ELECTORAL COMMISSION IN CONDUCTING INDUSTRIAL ELECTIONS
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE

Recommendation 1 
That section 215 of the WR Act be amended to provide that when a secret postal ballot is conducted by the AEC it shall be by a standard form of declaration envelope. The form of the envelope should be developed in consultation between the AEC and peak employer and trade union bodies and be prescribed in the WR Regulations. (p 20)
Response
Supported.
Recommendation 2
That the WR Act be amended to require that voters' rolls in all industrial elections should be cut-off rolls. The cut-off date should be 30 to 60 days before the opening of nominations. Organisations should be given a reasonable period within which to bring their rules into compliance with this requirement, which should also be contained in the model rules recommended elsewhere in this report. (p 22)
Response
Supported in principle.
The government supports the introduction of mandatory cut-off rolls. However the proposed period appears to be too long and could result in `stale rolls'. The government considers a shorter period would be appropriate. Accordingly, the government will give consideration to the most appropriate time period.
Recommendation 3
That when, having regard to the nature of the organisation concerned, the AEC considers that the membership records of an organisation contain an unduly large proportion of members for whom only a workplace address is recorded, or whose workplace and/or residential address is out of date, the AEC should include that fact in the post-election report to be prepared by returning officers (see Recommendation 15).
In addition, the AEC should inform the organisation concerned and request that it take action to ensure that it has current residential and workplace addresses for as many members as possible. Model rules developed in accordance with Recommendation 4 should provide that, as far as practicable, the 
 membership records of an organisation shall contain residential rather than workplace addresses. (p 25)
Response
Supported.
Recommendation 4
There should be consultation between the AEC, the AIR, DIR [now DWRSB] and peak employer and union bodies with a view to developing a `menu' of model rules for the conduct of industrial elections. Any model rules should deal only with the conduct of industrial elections and not with matters such as management structures, terms of office and eligibility to vote and to be a candidate. Organisations should be strongly encouraged but not required to adopt model rules, and should have the further option of adopting such rules in whole or in part. (p 32)
Response
Supported.
Recommendation  5
That the WR Act be amended to provide that:
(a)	 where a post-election report identifies any rule (or rules) of the organisation or branch concerned that was difficult to interpret or apply, the report shall be accompanied by a letter inviting the organisation or branch concerned to hold discussions with a view to amending the rule;
(b)	 the accompanying letter shall be published in the next journal or newsletter of the organisation or branch concerned, together with the post—election report;
(c)	 within 30 days of receiving such an invitation the organisation or branch concerned shall respond in writing and a copy of the response shall be published in its next journal or newsletter;
(d)	 in considering an amendment of the rule (or rules) in question, regard shall be had to any model rules contained in the WR Regulations; and
(e)	 failure to comply with paragraphs (b) and (c) above is an offence under Part XI of the Act. (p 34)
Response
Recommendations 5(a), (b), (c) and (d) are supported.
Recommendation 5(e) is supported in principle. The government will give further consideration to the most appropriate sanction for breach of these requirements. The government notes that not all organisations (or branches) publish a journal or newsletter, and is therefore considering what alternative requirements should apply to such organisations or branches.
Recommendation 6
That:  

(a)	 section 218 of the WR Act be amended to include the Electoral Commissioner as a person who may make an application for an inquiry by the Court into an alleged irregularity; and
(b)	 the WR Act should be further amended to provide that, where the Electoral Commissioner is satisfied that it is more likely than not that an irregularity has occurred, the Electoral Commissioner must make an application for an inquiry. (p 44)
Response
Recommendation 6(a) is supported.
Recommendation 6(b) is supported in principle.
However, the government does not consider it appropriate to require the Electoral Commissioner to seek an election inquiry in relation to every irregularity, including minor administrative errors. Rather, the government proposes to amend the Act to require the Electoral Commissioner to make an application for an inquiry into the conduct of an election where he or she believes that an irregularity may have affected the outcome of the election, or where there are allegations of criminal behaviour.
Recommendation 7
That:
(a)	 the penalties prescribed by sections 310, 313, 314, 315, 316 and 317 of the WR Act be increased to $5000 or imprisonment for 12 months, or both, for an individual; and to $10 000 for a body corporate; and
(b)	 regulation 62 of the WR Regulations be amended to provide that an application for an inquiry into an election must be made not later than three months after the day on which the result of the election is declared. or such longer period as the Court allows. (p 51)
Response
Recommendation 7(a) is supported in principle.
The government strongly supports increased penalties for electoral offences, particularly those involving electoral fraud. This recognition of the more serious nature of such offences will remove a statutory limitation on the time within which prosecutions may be brought.
The precise level of penalties for particular offences is being considered in accordance with current Commonwealth criminal law policy.
Recommendation 7(b) is supported.
Recommendation 8
That section 221 of the WR Act be amended to make clear that the Court may make an order that a person may occupy an office to which an inquiry 
 under the Act relates pending the outcome of a fresh election to fill that office. (p 52)
Response
Supported.
Recommendation  9
That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918  (CE Act) be amended to give the AEC authority to conduct elections for non-industrial organisations on a fee-for-service basis, subject to the proviso that the conduct of such elections is not permitted to detract from the AEC's capacity to fulfil its statutory obligations under the WR Act, the CE Act, the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984  and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989  (ATSIC Regional Council elections). (p 67)

Response
Supported.
Recommendation 10
That the WR Act be amended to provide that;
(a)	 in each industrial election where the rules of the organisation do not require the returning officer to verify the voters' roll, the returning officer shall nevertheless carry out such checks of the roll against records of the organisation as are necessary to satisfy the returning officer that the roll is accurate;
(b)	 where, following such checks, the returning officer is not satisfied that the roll is accurate, the returning officer may postpone the election until such defects as have been identified in the roll are corrected; and
(c)	 no application for an inquiry into an election may be made on the ground that any check of the voters' roll by the returning officer was inadequate or that, following such a check, the returning officer did not postpone the election.	 (pp 72-73)
Response
Not supported.
The government believes that responsibility for the accuracy of the electoral roll should be placed on the organisation or branch for which the AEC is conducting an election.
Accordingly, the government proposes to require organisations to lodge a declaration with the AEC similar to that required to be provided annually to the Industrial Registry under section 268. This would not prevent an inquiry being sought on the basis that there were discrepancies in the roll.
Recommendation 11
That:
(a)	 section 91 A(3) of the CE Act be amended to include elections and ballots conducted under the WR Act; and 

(b)	 the WR Act be amended to provide that no application for an inquiry into an election shall lie on the ground that, in carrying out a check of the accuracy of the voter's roll for an industrial election, the returning officer did not check the voters' roll against the Electoral Roll (p 75)
Response
Supported.
Recommendation 12
That the WR Regulations be amended to:
(a)	 include a regulation similar to existing regulations 81 and 980 in relation to the voters' roll for an industrial election, but which provides that while candidates in an election may inspect and obtain copies of the voters' roll, members who are not candidates may only inspect the roll and may not obtain copies;
(b)	 provide that where the AEC is required to provide copies of the voters' roll for an industrial election or for a ballot for an amalgamation or withdrawal from an amalgamation it may do so in electronic form on disk; and
(c)	 make it an offence to use information obtained from the voters' roll for an industrial election or for a ballot for an amalgamation or a withdrawal from an amalgamation for a purpose other than in relation to the election or ballot in respect of which access to the roll was sought. (p 78)
Response
Supported in principle
The government agrees that members of an organisation should be able to access the roll, but considers that members who are not candidates should also have the right to inspect and make copies of the roll
Recommendation 13
That:
(a)	 the WR Act be amended to provide that where ballot material is to be sent to a workplace the returning officer may direct the employer at the workplace as to disposition of that material; and
(b)	 section 215(1)(b) be amended to provide that, where a returning officer considers that adherence to the rules of an organisation or branch may give rise to an irregularity or produce a procedural defect, the returning officer shall take such actions and give such directions as the returning officer considers necessary to avoid the irregularity or procedural defect. (p 80) 

Response
Supported.
The government will also consider whether it is desirable to require organisations conducting their own elections to include such a power in their rules.
Recommendation 14
That regulation 102 of the WR Regulations be amended to include a list of all elections required by the rules of an organisation to be held for offices in the organisation, and each branch of the organisation, during the calendar year commencing on April l (p 82)
Response
Supported.
The government will consider whether there is a more effective means of amending the WR regulations (for example amending regulation 61) to achieve the objective of the recommendation.
Recommendation 15
That the WR Act be amended to require that, not  later than 14 days after the declaration of the ballot for an industrial election, the returning officer who conducted the election shall provide to the Industrial Registrar and the organisation (or branch) concerned, a report on the conduct of the election containing prescribed information. It should also be a requirement that such reports are to be published in the next journal or newsletter of that organisation (or branch). The prescribed information should be the same as is prescribed by regulation 96 and 98Z in respect of ballots for amalgamations and withdrawals from amalgamation, with any necessary changes and with the following additions:
.	 the percentage of workplace addresses to which ballot papers were transmitted;
.	 the number of complaints (if any) of irregularities made to the returning officer during the election,
.	 action taken by the returning officer in respect of those complaints;
.	 results of checks of the voters' roll;
.	 results of checks (if any) of signatures on the declaration envelopes:
.	 any rules of the organisation or branch which, because of ambiguity or other reasoned were difficult to interpret or apply, and
.	 any other matter the returning officer thinks fit. (pp 84-85)
Response
Supported.
The government notes that not all organisations (or branches) publish a journal or newsletter (see recommendation 5). 

The government also proposes to extend the protection afforded by regulation 119 of the WR Regulations to post-election reports. (Regulation I 19 protects the Commonwealth and electoral officials against defamation actions in relation to the publication of candidate's statements.)
Recommendation 16
That the government consult with the AEC and with peak union and employer organisations with a view to developing legislation prohibiting the use of union resources for electioneering purposes, except as permitted by the WR Act and Regulations or by model rules developed in accordance with Recommendation 4. (pg 8)
Response
Supported.
The government believes the prohibition should apply to both employee and employer organisations.
Recommendation 17
That the WR Act be amended to prohibit the publication by any means of `misleading statements of fact' during an industrial election. (p 89)
Response
Not supported.
The government firmly believes that election advertising should be truthful in its content. However, at this stage any legislation introduced to enforce this principle—would be difficult to enforce. It should not be good public policy to enact a commendable legislative principle that was incapable of effective enforcement. In the absence of any effective enforcement mechanism, the current balance of interests between commendable principle and practicality means that voters, using whatever assistance they see fit from electioneering material and other sources, remain the most appropriate arbiters of the worth of each candidates claims.
The government notes that this response is consistent with its response to a similar recommendation made by the Committee in relation to federal Parliamentary elections in its report into the 1996 federal election.
Recommendation 18
That the WR Act be amended to provide that, in respect of each industrial election, the cost of advertising shall be borne by the Commonwealth only up to an amount determined by the AEC, with the AEC having the statutory power to recoup any excess. The AEC should be required to determine in advance of each election what would be a `reasonable' amount to be spent on advertising for the election. In determining the amount to be borne by the Commonwealth, the AEC should be required to take account of the following factors: 

.	 the amount spent on advertising in the previous corresponding election for the organisation concerned;
.	 any significant changes in the type or nature of election advertising by that organisation since the last corresponding election and the reasons for such changes;
.	 any changes in the size, structure or nature of the organisation;
.	 the amount spent on advertising in similar elections by other organisations of a similar size and structure, and
.	 any increases in the cost for advertisements of the kind to be used in the election in question.
It should be further provided that where the AEC considers that the Commonwealth should pay less than the full cost of advertising for the election in question, it shall invite the organisation concerned to put its views as to why the Commonwealth should bear the full cost, and shall take those views into account before making a final determination. It should also be provided that, except in exceptional circumstances, the AEC shall not determine an amount that is less than the amount spent on advertising in the previous corresponding election for the organisation concerned. (pp 90
Response
Supported.
The government will also consider making similar provision in relation to excessive postage costs (for example, the use of registered mail).
Government Response to Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee's Report on `Payment of a Minister's Legal Costs Part 2'
In its report the Senate Committee welcomed advice that a proposal was being developed within the Government for a statute-based scheme to be established by regulation under the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 for assistance to Ministers in relation to legal proceedings and inquiries. I am pleased to advise that the Government has decided that such a scheme should be established and that regulations are expected to be made very shortly.
2. The Government shares the Committee's views that:
(a)	 a scheme should be based on transparent criteria and procedures:
(b)	 the guidelines for payment of legal costs should be included in the regulations establishing the scheme; 

(c)	 the guidelines should enunciate principles that are capable of sensible, consistent and predictable application;
(d)	 the Attorney-General's Department should monitor the strategies being pursued by Ministers in legal proceedings for which assistance has been provided;
(e)	 extravagant or unnecessary strategies, as determined and advised beforehand by the Attorney-General's Department, should not be funded by the Commonwealth;
(f)	 if, as the Government proposes, assistance is to be funded from the standing appropriation in section 11 of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act:
	 -	 the Attorney-General should be required to inform the Parliament of each decision to pay a Minister's legal costs at the earliest opportunity, including the initial reasons for the decision and any limitations placed on expenditure;
	 -	 a consolidated statement on current cases, including progressive levels of expenditure, should be tabled in the Parliament. However, for the reasons in paragraph 10 below, the Government considers such a statement should be tabled once each financial year and not every three months.
3. The scheme will also provide for assistance in relation to inquiries relating to the performance by a Minister of his/her ministerial duties. There will be no assistance for legal challenges by Ministers to inquiries.
4. The scheme will also further extend to subpoenas issued to Ministers, in circumstances where there might be difficulty in providing assistance to Ministers under existing normal arrangements.
5. The scheme will apply to existing and former Ministers.
6. In relation to damages claims against a Minister, the basic criteria for Commonwealth assistance will be that the proceedings have arisen out of the performance of ministerial duties and that the Minister acted reasonably and responsibly. These are, in essence, the same criteria as apply under the current administrative guidelines.
7. The Government does not share the Senate Committee's views that:
(a)	 all decisions concerning assistance in relation to a personal claim against a Minister should be made by Cabinet;
(b)	 the guidelines should include indicative limits on costs payable and on the level of professional legal services that are considered appropriate; 

(c)	 a consolidated statement on current cases, including progressive levels of expenditure, should be tabled in Parliament every three months.
8. In relation to the level of the decision maker, the Government will be proposing different levels depending on the circumstances in which assistance is being provided, with only some circumstances requiring Cabinet consultation. The Government considers that a requirement for Cabinet consideration in all cases would be unnecessarily cumbersome and wasteful of resources.
9. In relation to indicative limits on costs and levels of professional legal services, it is not practicable to contain such limits in guidelines covering the whole range of possible legal proceedings in which Ministers may be involved. However, to the extent practicable, there should be such limits in relation to specific cases. This should be part of the Attorney-General's Department's role in relation to monitoring strategies and expenditure.
10. In relation to the period within which reporting is to occur, the Government considers that tabling a consolidated report on expenditure in respect of every financial year, in addition to reporting each decision at the earliest opportunity, will provide sufficient information to meet the aim of providing appropriate transparency and accountability .
11. As recommended by the Senate Committee, the Government will maintain its policy of not using public funds to assist Ministers to institute defamation actions.
12. In summary, the purpose and effect of the scheme will be to place on a firm legal basis the provision of Commonwealth assistance to Ministers in relation to matters covered by the scheme, to provide transparent criteria and procedures capable of sensible, consistent and predictable application, and to provide for appropriate monitoring and control of expenditure and reporting of expenditure to the Parliament.
13. I add that the scheme is intended to cover situations where there might be difficulty in providing Commonwealth assistance to a Minister under existing normal procedures. Those procedures include, for example, assistance in relation to administrative law challenges to Ministers' decisions. Also, the Government does not wish to preclude the possibility that, in special circumstances. a Government might wish to provide legal assistance to a Minister outside the scope of the proposed scheme. Accordingly, the regulations establishing the scheme will make it clear that the scheme supplements existing arrangements and is not intended to exclude the provision of Commonwealth legal assistance to a Minister in other circumstances where it can be lawfully provided. 

14. As indicated, the regulations establishing the scheme will be made shortly and will, of course, be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny in the normal course.
—I seek leave to move a motion to list documents on the Notice Paper  for further consideration.
—Is leave granted?
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. I indicated to you that I wished to move a motion by leave in relation to the Auditor-General's report No. 12. With respect, I do not think Senator Alston's motion does that. I have listened carefully now to what he is proposing. I proposed to move my motion under what I believe is standing order 169(2). In accordance with the standing orders, while I appreciate that—
—Senator Faulkner, do you wish to speak to it now?
—Yes.
—I can put these motions first. Then you may move to do so, and proceed.
—Madam President, with respect, I would seek leave. If leave were not granted, then the only course of action opposition speakers would have would be to speak on the motions of Senator Alston. I would have thought it would be proper to determine that, prior to us proceeding further.
—Madam President, could I simply say—if necessary, by leave—that Senator Faulkner's premature intervention meant that I was not able to move the very motion that I think addresses his concerns. If he would allow me to move—
Senator Faulkner interjecting—
—I have not moved it yet.
—I have heard it.
—No, you have not heard it. I just sought leave to move a motion and I am just about to move it. Then, if you are still not satisfied, you can have another go.   
Senator Faulkner interjecting—
—But I have not moved it.
—But you have explained that—
—If Senator Alston does what he intends to do with respect to the others, you then may move to take note of that report and speak to it.
—Hear what I have to say. If you are not satisfied, then you can follow it up.
—I have heard what you have to say.
—But you have not, because I have not said it yet.
—You have indicated why you are seeking leave.
—I have sought leave to move a motion to list documents on the Notice Paper  for further consideration. If leave is granted, I would then move that consideration of each of the committee reports, responses to committee reports, annual reports of parliamentary departments, audit reports and government documents tabled this day be listed as separate orders of the day on the Notice Paper . I seek leave to move accordingly.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That consideration of each of the documents just tabled be listed on the Notice Paper  as separate orders of the day in the appropriate categories of business.

Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document. 

As the election approached, the opposition became aware of and was able to expose the government's plan for massive public expenditure on the Liberal and National parties' GST proposal. That was a campaign promise, not a policy or an operating program of government.
As time went by, as we were able to get to the bottom of this particular advertising campaign, we found much more subterranean activity being undertaken by the government. The cost went up from $5 million to $10 million. Senator Newman sent a letter to all Centrelink pensioners as well as to all pensioners on the DVA database. We were able to expose the use of public servants in connection with information hotlines and call centres. We were able to expose the use of senior public servants for a rapid response advisory group for the Prime Minister. Also, we were able to expose the use of the advance to the Minister for Finance in trying to hide this expenditure.
During the election campaign, I asked the Auditor-General, Mr Barrett, to investigate these matters on behalf of the opposition. We do thank Mr Barrett for his audit on this particular matter. We do welcome the Auditor-General's report. We especially welcome the fact that the Auditor-General has called for a parliamentary inquiry into matters which emerged from his audit.
Mr Barrett found that the government acted legally, but he was obviously very seriously concerned about the ethics and the propriety of this particular tax advertising exercise. Madam President, the Auditor-General found that $15.7 million had already been spent by the government at the time he furnished his report to you. Of course, there would be more bills to have been paid since the election was called. The government ultimately approved $20 million for this sleazy exercise.
The Auditor-General qualified his findings in the audit report by stating he does not have—and let me quote him—`a mandate to judge the nature of the advertisements, whether they are political or party political in nature.' These advertisements were patently and blatantly party political. There is no doubt what their intent and nature was. They were 
 authorised by Minister Minchin on behalf of the government. They went to the main issue in the recently conducted federal election campaign.
It was the major difference between the parties in the last election campaign. This was an advertising blitz that took place in the weeks leading up to the calling of the election. In what I think was a very clear signal from the Auditor-General as to what should be done, Mr Barrett, the Australian Auditor-General, noted that his New Zealand counterpart ruled that a government should not disseminate material that is designed to secure or has the effect of attempting to secure popular support to the party political persuasions of the members of that government. If you apply the New Zealand Audit Office test to what occurred before our election campaign and our election on 3 October this year, the government here has miserably failed the probity test.
The government's pathetic claims to precedent applying in this situation were swept aside by the Auditor-General in his report. You only have to look at the table on page 29 of the Auditor-General's report to compare the three months prior to the 1998 election campaign with the three months prior to the 1996, 1993 and 1990 election campaigns. The truth of the matter is: the coalition, the Liberal Party, were running a 14-week re-election campaign, but they—the parties of government—were only paying in their own right for five of those weeks. In fact, you had a situation where the national secretary of the Liberal Party skited about the fact that the Liberal Party spent less on its national advertising budget than the Labor Party did. The only reason he was able to skite in that way was because Commonwealth taxpayers funded the Liberal Party's re-election campaign in the weeks leading up to the calling of the election.
The graph, published on page 29 of the Auditor-General's report, reveals the extent of what was a massive rort—a massive misuse of taxpayers' money—that took place prior to the calling of the recent election. The graph completely refutes the government's claim that such advertising expenditure had a 
 precedent in Australian politics. There is no precedent. We have never seen an advertising campaign of such extent and we have never seen an advertising campaign paid for and conducted by government to promote a policy for which a government was seeking support in a general election. It is unprecedented. This particular graph, contrary to the claims of the government, shows that the former Labor administration actually dropped its level of expenditure on advertising campaigns in the lead-up to the 1996 election.
Most importantly, the Auditor-General has called for a parliamentary review of the rules surrounding government advertising. He has also called for—as either part of that review or as a separate parliamentary inquiry—an investigation into the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance and the use of Commonwealth copyright. Both those calls by the Auditor-General are welcomed by the opposition. In fact, we will be progressing in the Senate itself the issue for a parliamentary review of the rules surrounding government advertising.
We have here before us a report which really does expose the government's chicanery in relation to its own advertising. I must say that we still do not know what the responses will be to some of the inquiries and complaints that the opposition has made. We await the report of the Privacy Commissioner on what we believe is a flagrant and possibly criminal misuse of the Centrelink database for party political campaigning. That matter is currently being reviewed, and we will hear more about it when those inquiries have been completed.
As I say, we welcome the Auditor-General's expose of the coalition's misuse of Commonwealth taxpayers' funds for the advertising in the lead-up to the last election campaign. The government stands condemned for this blatant misuse and massive rort, the like of which is totally unprecedented in Australian politics.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,18,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-11-10,"—Madam President, it looks as though we are off to a bad start. I can understand Senator Faulkner's need to try 
 to bowl himself in again. Clearly, he started off at the very bottom, but he has a long way to go before he can get the ball on the pitch.
—You couldn't even get the test televised. What are you talking about?
—I wanted you to concentrate on the main game—that is, in here.
—There's a one-day match on today. None of us can watch it.
—You didn't ask, did you? I thought you were more interested in hearing the Governor-General's speech, but maybe I was wrong.
In response to Senator Faulkner's very lame contribution, the Australian National Audit Office report confirmed the probity of government action in the implementation of the Taxation Reform Community Education and Information Program. As the report stated:
. . . on the basis of evidence available and legal advice . . . the Government acted legally and officials acted ethically.
The report went on to say, `It goes without saying that governments have a right and indeed a responsibility to keep the public informed and to ensure that the public is aware of their policies and implementation'.
All I can say is: if you want to have a debate about advertising, let us look at what possessed you to retain Saatchi and to get rid of Singleton—talk about quantity over quality. You outspent us by millions of dollars. I know you are very grateful to your union mates for kicking in that money, but—boy!—if they conduct an audit to see whether they got value, you will all be put away for life. If there was ever a monumental mistake made in relation to the election campaign, it was your decision to get rid of Singleton. Every time those ads ran, we cheered. If you are interested in substance, that is what the debate on advertising ought to be about. Otherwise, I think the Auditor's report, as I have quoted, says it all.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,18,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-11-10,"—It is a pity Senator Alston started with a cricket analogy because we are seeing the captain of the Australian A-side over there in 
 Senator Hill's absence. One of the more interesting things in this is the way language is used. What was this advertising campaign? Senator Alston said it himself: a community education and information program. What a terrible distortion of the English language that is. The campaign was rorting taxpayers' funds for partisan political purposes—nothing more than that.
Why did we go to an election six months early? We went to an election on the timetable of a Prime Minister who wanted to have his tax proposals released, the advertising paid for by the taxpayer for two weeks, and then five weeks of the campaign. He did not want real scrutiny of these proposals. But, to make matters worse, he got his lackeys from the Business Council of Australia to tip another $4 million in at the start of the campaign to advertise for tax reform.
I hope every businessman who put that $4 million in knows that under the Electoral Act they have to declare that as electoral expenditure in this cycle. Otherwise, we might find some of the Business Council of Australia types making a trip down to their local gaol and enjoying some free hospitality there. They have to declare that $4 million as political expenditure.
If this was a community education and information program—what a wonderful euphemism that is—why did we have to have Senator Minchin and the late, lamented Mr Miles authorise the ads? We have seen government advertising stretching back over the last 10 years that has not required authorisation—and therein lies the definition of whether it is a genuine government advertising campaign or whether it is a partisan political campaign.
As Senator Faulkner has indicated, we have never seen a campaign of this scale paid for by taxpayers. It is basically four times higher than any past expenditure in the three months prior to a federal election. The only reason that it got capped off at $15 million or so is because the Prime Minister called an election and saved the taxpayers another $5 million. If you want to know why that happened, just have a look at TV advertising rates: they went up after 3 October. The Liberal Party wanted 
 to pay right through its campaign the rates that were cheaper than the pre-Christmas rates which started almost immediately post 3 October.
One of the least noted changes made in the administrative orders is the removal of OGIA from the Department of Finance and Administration and the sneaking of it across into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. One wonders why that was done, why they have moved it under the direct control of the Prime Minister. I am always the optimist—maybe they have done that to clean this area up because of the embarrassment it has caused them over the last 2½ years.
Let me remind the Senate of the government's first major advertising campaign. We had the tragedy of Port Arthur. We had the strong political leadership of not only Mr Howard but Mr Beazley and others on gun control. There was an enthusiasm to advertise various aspects of that bipartisan political approach.
So what did we get? First of all, we got an advertising firm that was not on OGIA's register put on the list of firms to be chosen from. Even though it was not one of the 1,000 firms on the register, it was put on. It did not make the short list, so the chief political adviser to the Prime Minister intervened and had it put on. Guess who actually got the firm up even though OGIA said it was by far the weakest bid? It was a political committee which included Senator Minchin, in particular, who pushed this particular firm through. When we had a look at the firm, guess who was on the firm? Toby Ralph. All the team that was involved in the Liberal Party's 1996 election campaign won the contract.
And Senator Alston makes reference to poor advertising. There was never a worse campaign run. There was never a more unprofessional campaign than the gun buyback advertising. It was absolutely abysmal. It was a terrible campaign—and all their professional associates through the industry described it as such.
Not content with rewarding them, the Liberal Party then had to reward one of their own with their PR contract. It again did not make the short list. The Attorney-General, Mr 
 Daryl Williams, intervened, and the political fix was put in yet again. So in the first two tests of this government when it came to advertising, the fix went in and the good old boys from the team got the contracts—and they have got several since. That means: when you come to an election campaign, you get a good discount from the boys. They will go and work for you for virtually nothing because they are getting paid by the taxpayer through a politically rorted process where clapped out Liberal Party apparatchiks—you in the National Party do not even get a look in—choose these contracts. They clear the officials out of the room so that they cannot be sprung on these particular proposals.
So we were not particularly surprised when we saw in the budget papers an allocation of money to advertising. But they could not even get that right. They had to go to the Advance to the Minister for Finance for what they described as unforeseen expenditure. Of course it was foreseen—it was foreseen because it was in a previous set of budget papers.
So, as the Auditor-General has outlined, this is one area that needs examination, this misuse of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. The government should take that seriously, otherwise they will find that, every time the advance is put in this particular chamber, we will have to start itemising and questioning the items. That is not a good process of government. We all acknowledge that the Advance to the Minister for Finance is a necessary and valuable tool to the executive government, but their misuse and abuse of it on this occasion will lead us to question it in future.
The second thing the Auditor-General has basically said in the code that Auditor-General's talk is that this decision by the government is technically legal and he will not judge the morality of it. But implicitly, by calling for an inquiry by a parliamentary committee, he believes this is an area that should be looked at. Guess what? The Acting Treasurer of the time came out of his burrow just long enough to say, `I don't think that's a good idea.' Of course not. Of course they do not want that particular element examined.
You do not have the Treasurer do it; it is one of the minor flunkies in the ministry who has to come out. The only sort of stuttering response we got was, `We wouldn't like a parliamentary inquiry into that.' In other words, they will accept as rolled gold everything else in the Auditor-General's report, but what happened to his serious recommendation that parliamentary scrutiny be given to this sort of advertising, especially advertising of this scale requiring this political endorsement? Those on that side of the chamber rejected it automatically. That is not for them because what is turned up might be embarrassing.
There is a lot more to come out about this advertising campaign and the way Treasury has handled it. We know that, and that will be pursued in other avenues. We do not want to delay proceedings today too long. But it is probably the most blatant political exercise ever conducted in this country, the most cynical and the most blatant misuse of funds that has happened since Federation.
The dichotomy between Mr Howard's professed standards and the reality of the operation of this government is absolutely drawn in this case, as it is in many other cases of standards. The words flow, the pomposity and the sincerity come out but, when you actually look at the way this government operates, poor old ex-President Nixon must be turning in his grave in envy.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,18,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-11-10,"—I will just respond briefly to a number of the comments that Senator Ray made.
—We want you on the record for this rort, Kemp.
—If you want to get up and speak, you speak, Senator Conroy, but I am going to have my go now. In the earlier part of his remarks, Senator Ray gave us an insight into how the Labor Party works with mates. It is not the way the Liberal Party works with mates. Senator Ray was speaking from deep experience.
Can I just make a couple of brief comments. Is it not strange that, after 13 years of the rules under which the Labor Party operated, they have suddenly decided that those 
 rules are not appropriate. We operate under the same rules the Labor Party operated under.
—You are joking!
—Yes, we operate under the same rules the Labor Party operated under for 13 years. For 13 years you operated under those rules, and there was not a hint from Robert Ray or John Faulkner that those rules should be changed.
This is what happened. Senator Faulkner, who made no serious policy contribution in the last parliament, tried to get himself a position in the election campaign through this big stunt about political advertising. Senator Faulkner referred this all to the Auditor-General and he struck out on every issue. On every issue, Senator Faulkner was found to be wrong.
The first question of Senator Faulkner was whether the CEIP was for a Commonwealth purpose. The short answer from the Auditor-General is yes. Senator Faulkner struck out once. In relation to the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance and Administration, which you spoke on, Senator Ray, this is what it says:
In the light of legal advice received, the ANAO was satisfied that the approval of funds from the AMFA met the legislative conditions that the requirement for the funds was urgent and unforeseen.
Senator Faulkner struck out again.
—He said it was a shonk and we should have a parliamentary inquiry.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Order! There are too many interjections.
—That is two strikes against Senator Faulkner.
—It was corrupt.
—Order! There are far too many interjections. Senator Kemp, you are addressing your remarks across the chamber and not through the chair.
—Thank you, Madam President. As you know, I was being unduly provoked on this issue. The third issue raised by Senator Faulkner related to public servants, 
 their duties and responsibilities. This is what the Auditor-General said:
Given the legal advice that the CEIP was for Commonwealth purposes, on the basis of the evidence available, there was no breach of the Public Service Regulations or the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 by Commonwealth officers.
Senator Faulkner struck out yet again. Normally it is three strikes and you are out, Senator Faulkner—accept the umpire's decision.
—So what he said is have an inquiry because it is corrupt.
—Order! Senator Faulkner, you have had a chance to speak.
—Thank you, Madam President. Fair enough it was an election campaign, and why not try to get yourself on the box. He did that. He referred this to the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General examined the issues that Senator Faulkner raised. Senator Faulkner struck out, and that is the problem, that is the issue.
So here we have this spleen being vented on day one of the resumption of the Senate. I have to say it reflects again the priorities of the Labor Party. It reflects the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. The Labor Party operated under these rules for 13 years, as Robert Ray knows better than any other person, and not a hint that there was anything wrong with those rules. When we operate under the same rules, we get attacked. We were cleared by the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General gave us a clean bill of health. We were right; Senator Faulkner was wrong. That was the answer.
—He said you were corrupt.
—The Auditor-General looked very closely at the issue Senator Faulkner raised, and Senator Faulkner was found not to have any case on any of the points he raised.
—That is an absolute lie.
—That is what happened. Read the Auditor-General's report, Senator Faulkner.  
—I have. We are very happy with it.
—If you are happy with it, you will be happy in opposition. It is no wonder you are happy in opposition, Senator Faulkner, because on every issue you raised, you struck out. That is what happened with the Auditor-General's report.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Why don't you hold an inquiry?
—Why don't you read the report?
—Order! Senator Faulkner and Senator Conroy should cease shouting.
—I urge Labor Party senators—including Senator Robert Ray and Senator Faulkner—to read the Auditor-General's report and note that their leader in the Senate got it wrong and that the government was cleared on all counts.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,18,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-11-10,"—This afternoon we have had a pathetic effort by the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Richard Alston, to defend the government against the sensible, realistic and, I might say, devastating charge put against it by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner. Senator Alston took 90 seconds to defend the government from a $17 million electoral rort. That is what he took—90 seconds. He could not think of another word to say in that 90 seconds. What the government then did was call down a well-known senator who can speak under wet cement on any circumstance to obfuscate this debate. He was called in to muddy the waters, confuse the listeners and take attention away from the facts.
The Auditor-General's report does three things and it does them quite clearly. It says there is a public perception in the Australian community that this was funding for political ads; it says this was an inappropriate use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance; and it says this was an inappropriate use of 
 Commonwealth copyright. We would add a fourth point: it invades the civil liberties of clients of Centrelink in the sense that it invades their privacy. There are four reasons that demonstrate that the government used public funding in order to promote its own narrow electorate agenda and pursue its goal of trying to foist an unwelcome tax on the Australian people. There were $17 million of taxpayers money used to do that. That is a scandal. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-11-10,"—I seek leave to move that the Senate take note of Auditor-General's report No. 10 of 1998-99: Performance Audit—Sale of One-Third of Telstra .
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to start my speech by looking at the government's own objectives for the sale of one-third of Telstra. The government had five overall objectives, two of which are pertinent to this discussion and I wish to address only those two. Those objectives were, firstly, to achieve an optimum financial return from the sale and, secondly, to secure a timely sale process, conducted to high standards of probity and accountability.
I must say at the outset that the government failed and failed miserably to achieve anywhere near maximum possible return. Consider the following sequence of events: the gross proceeds from the Telstra sale were around $14.2 billion; the price set on issue day was around $3.30 to $3.40 per share; at the close of business on the first day, the receipts were at a premium of 67c per share, the largest initial premium of any Commonwealth public share offer on record; in the 11 months since listing, the trading price of Telstra has increased more than 160 times the increase in the all ordinaries; and, at the close of business yesterday, Telstra shares were trading at $6.70, more than double the initial 
 retail price. So in the space of a bare 11 months, the government has given away, or failed to collect, nearly $14 billion of money properly owned by the taxpayers of Australia.
We do not argue that Telstra shares should have been priced at 200 per cent of the issue price, but we do point out that Telcos are in a boom sector. There is an acknowledged significant international demand for Telco shares, and we appreciate this huge domestic retail interest in purchasing Telstra shares. The government certainly had knowledge of all of those factors, considering over 2½ million Australians registered for a prospectus before final sale price was announced. We point out that the government had knowledge of the institutional and likely retail demand for Telstra shares. We say that the government and the relevant ministers failed to act responsibly in the planning process, failed to provide sufficient oversight of the float process and failed to take sufficient expert independent advice on the scale of likely investor interest in the Telstra sale.
In the race to sell off the farm—to get rid of the family silver—the government and Minister Alston failed to maximise the return to the true owners of Telstra, the taxpayers of Australia. If the issue price had been priced more accurately—somewhere between the then price of $3.30 and the current price of $6.70—we may not now be facing the issue of a $6 billion GST on food and the government may have been able to retire more debt to save interest repayments and hence cut less from the outlay side of the budget in recent years. The $14 billion give-away by the government is simply an example of incompetence, wilful ignorance and lack of work, planning and supervision of the entire process. The findings in paragraph 13 on page 14 of the ANAO report state:
ANAO's review of the institutional book suggests the bookbuild process and allocation criteria did not provide sufficient incentive for bidders to reveal their individual price elasticity of demand for Telstra shares.
That is cute language and economic jargon, but it means quite simply that the government has given Telstra away—it has set the price far too low—and that the bidders of Telstra shares provided a con and the government fell 
 for it. ANAO said that there was insufficient `incentive for bidders to reveal their individual price elasticity of demand', and the government did not press them hard enough for a higher price. This government is responsible for losing up to $14 billion of taxpayers' money.
The following analogy is apt. For example, a couple in Toorak, Melbourne, going through an acrimonious divorce, possess a house worth something in the order of $3 million. The Family Court orders the husband to sell the house and give half the proceeds to his wife. He sells it to the first bidder for $1 million. The wife only gets half a million dollars instead of $1½ million—half the market price. It is the same with this government. It deliberately, or with great incompetence, chose a low price and failed to gain for taxpayers up to $14 billion from the sale of Telstra.
Unfortunately, things get worse. We leave the path of incompetence and ignorance to go down a different trail. The trail, as always, is the money trail. This time the government has been overly generous with taxpayers' money. It has been greatly generous to its mates in the broker community and investment banks in Australia and around the world. The budgeted cost of the international roadshow blew out from $1 million to $3 million. Footnote 65 on page 56 of the report outlines the detail.
Two million dollars was wasted in the United States on private aircraft charter, costing $466,000, and private chauffeur and limousine services, costing $136,000. Luxury hotels, costing $1,000 per day per person, were booked ad nauseam. Limousines, costing $6,100 per day for those persons involved in the international roadshow in the United States, were booked up. As if the Hilton hotel in major cities in the United States does not charge $200 or $250 for a room. As if cabs to airports or minibuses cannot be hired for $50 to $100 per session in big United States cities. As if scheduled commercial flights do not fly regularly between New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and the rest. The full details are listed on page 55 and 56 of the report.  
In summary, the budget blew out from $1 million to $3 million. Huge amounts of money were paid for private limousines, private aircraft charter and luxury hotel rooms. Payments were not independently verified and an audit trail was not established. But the money trail story gets even worse. At paragraph 3.24, ANAO concludes:
. . . certain expenditure did not appear to relate to organising and conducting the Telstra roadshow; certain travel expenses exceeded entitlements by a significant margin; and some expenditure did not reconcile to the roadshow itinerary.
This code language of the ANAO report begs the following questions. Firstly, what was the $2 million expended on? Secondly, why was it reimbursed without receipts or checking? Thirdly, who made the claims and is it fraud? Fourthly, when and how will the money be recovered by the government? Fifthly, will the relevant personnel and firms if engaged in fraud be barred from future floats? Sixthly, what action has the minister insisted upon to ensure that there will be no repeat of possible fraud in the future? Finally, will the minister instruct the department to ensure that charges are laid to recover these hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, wilfully spent on fraudulent activities?
In this Telstra float process the government had two objectives: to maximise a financial return from sale and to secure a sale process conducted to high standards of probity and accountability. How did it fair? It received $14 billion. It could have received $28 billion. A reasonable figure would be somewhere between $19 billion and $22 billion. That extra $5 billion to $8 billion, reasonably capable of being gained, could have been used to retire debt and save outlays of that amount having been cut from the budget for the last two years.
The sale process, particularly the international roadshow, was just a big party for dozens of wealthy individuals—hired, retained and instructed by this government—all around the United States. Luxury hotel rooms were used and abused at a premium. Fancy chauffeur driven cars were on tap to the tune of $6,000 per day. Big fat meals and lots of wine were on tap and are receipted, and 
 private aircraft jaunts around the United States appeared to be the norm through this process.
There was no independent verification of the receipts. There were few, if any, receipts provided by the coordinators to Telstra management and, in turn, to the government of Australia. There was unauthorised expenditure tantamount to fraud on a large scale. We can certainly draw one conclusion from the two objectives: the government failed to maximise the sale price of Telstra and use the money appropriately within the law. The government did not even approach the margin with its own high standards of probity and accountability. From beginning to end throughout the United States, from city to city, tens of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money was spent on luxury hotel rooms, on big fat meals and on private aircraft jetting from city to city, from LA to Philadelphia.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-11-10,"—I seek leave to move that the Senate take note of Auditor-General's report No. 12.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document. 

As the election approached, the opposition became aware of and was able to expose the government's plan for massive public expenditure on the Liberal and National parties' GST proposal. That was a campaign promise, not a policy or an operating program of government.
As time went by, as we were able to get to the bottom of this particular advertising campaign, we found much more subterranean activity being undertaken by the government. The cost went up from $5 million to $10 million. Senator Newman sent a letter to all Centrelink pensioners as well as to all pensioners on the DVA database. We were able to expose the use of public servants in connection with information hotlines and call centres. We were able to expose the use of senior public servants for a rapid response advisory group for the Prime Minister. Also, we were able to expose the use of the advance to the Minister for Finance in trying to hide this expenditure.
During the election campaign, I asked the Auditor-General, Mr Barrett, to investigate these matters on behalf of the opposition. We do thank Mr Barrett for his audit on this particular matter. We do welcome the Auditor-General's report. We especially welcome the fact that the Auditor-General has called for a parliamentary inquiry into matters which emerged from his audit.
Mr Barrett found that the government acted legally, but he was obviously very seriously concerned about the ethics and the propriety of this particular tax advertising exercise. Madam President, the Auditor-General found that $15.7 million had already been spent by the government at the time he furnished his report to you. Of course, there would be more bills to have been paid since the election was called. The government ultimately approved $20 million for this sleazy exercise.
The Auditor-General qualified his findings in the audit report by stating he does not have—and let me quote him—`a mandate to judge the nature of the advertisements, whether they are political or party political in nature.' These advertisements were patently and blatantly party political. There is no doubt what their intent and nature was. They were 
 authorised by Minister Minchin on behalf of the government. They went to the main issue in the recently conducted federal election campaign.
It was the major difference between the parties in the last election campaign. This was an advertising blitz that took place in the weeks leading up to the calling of the election. In what I think was a very clear signal from the Auditor-General as to what should be done, Mr Barrett, the Australian Auditor-General, noted that his New Zealand counterpart ruled that a government should not disseminate material that is designed to secure or has the effect of attempting to secure popular support to the party political persuasions of the members of that government. If you apply the New Zealand Audit Office test to what occurred before our election campaign and our election on 3 October this year, the government here has miserably failed the probity test.
The government's pathetic claims to precedent applying in this situation were swept aside by the Auditor-General in his report. You only have to look at the table on page 29 of the Auditor-General's report to compare the three months prior to the 1998 election campaign with the three months prior to the 1996, 1993 and 1990 election campaigns. The truth of the matter is: the coalition, the Liberal Party, were running a 14-week re-election campaign, but they—the parties of government—were only paying in their own right for five of those weeks. In fact, you had a situation where the national secretary of the Liberal Party skited about the fact that the Liberal Party spent less on its national advertising budget than the Labor Party did. The only reason he was able to skite in that way was because Commonwealth taxpayers funded the Liberal Party's re-election campaign in the weeks leading up to the calling of the election.
The graph, published on page 29 of the Auditor-General's report, reveals the extent of what was a massive rort—a massive misuse of taxpayers' money—that took place prior to the calling of the recent election. The graph completely refutes the government's claim that such advertising expenditure had a 
 precedent in Australian politics. There is no precedent. We have never seen an advertising campaign of such extent and we have never seen an advertising campaign paid for and conducted by government to promote a policy for which a government was seeking support in a general election. It is unprecedented. This particular graph, contrary to the claims of the government, shows that the former Labor administration actually dropped its level of expenditure on advertising campaigns in the lead-up to the 1996 election.
Most importantly, the Auditor-General has called for a parliamentary review of the rules surrounding government advertising. He has also called for—as either part of that review or as a separate parliamentary inquiry—an investigation into the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance and the use of Commonwealth copyright. Both those calls by the Auditor-General are welcomed by the opposition. In fact, we will be progressing in the Senate itself the issue for a parliamentary review of the rules surrounding government advertising.
We have here before us a report which really does expose the government's chicanery in relation to its own advertising. I must say that we still do not know what the responses will be to some of the inquiries and complaints that the opposition has made. We await the report of the Privacy Commissioner on what we believe is a flagrant and possibly criminal misuse of the Centrelink database for party political campaigning. That matter is currently being reviewed, and we will hear more about it when those inquiries have been completed.
As I say, we welcome the Auditor-General's expose of the coalition's misuse of Commonwealth taxpayers' funds for the advertising in the lead-up to the last election campaign. The government stands condemned for this blatant misuse and massive rort, the like of which is totally unprecedented in Australian politics.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Report No. 12 of 1998-99</title>,Documents,18,2
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-11-10,"—Madam President, it looks as though we are off to a bad start. I can understand Senator Faulkner's need to try 
 to bowl himself in again. Clearly, he started off at the very bottom, but he has a long way to go before he can get the ball on the pitch.
—You couldn't even get the test televised. What are you talking about?
—I wanted you to concentrate on the main game—that is, in here.
—There's a one-day match on today. None of us can watch it.
—You didn't ask, did you? I thought you were more interested in hearing the Governor-General's speech, but maybe I was wrong.
In response to Senator Faulkner's very lame contribution, the Australian National Audit Office report confirmed the probity of government action in the implementation of the Taxation Reform Community Education and Information Program. As the report stated:
. . . on the basis of evidence available and legal advice . . . the Government acted legally and officials acted ethically.
The report went on to say, `It goes without saying that governments have a right and indeed a responsibility to keep the public informed and to ensure that the public is aware of their policies and implementation'.
All I can say is: if you want to have a debate about advertising, let us look at what possessed you to retain Saatchi and to get rid of Singleton—talk about quantity over quality. You outspent us by millions of dollars. I know you are very grateful to your union mates for kicking in that money, but—boy!—if they conduct an audit to see whether they got value, you will all be put away for life. If there was ever a monumental mistake made in relation to the election campaign, it was your decision to get rid of Singleton. Every time those ads ran, we cheered. If you are interested in substance, that is what the debate on advertising ought to be about. Otherwise, I think the Auditor's report, as I have quoted, says it all.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Report No. 12 of 1998-99</title>,Documents,18,2
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-11-10,"—It is a pity Senator Alston started with a cricket analogy because we are seeing the captain of the Australian A-side over there in 
 Senator Hill's absence. One of the more interesting things in this is the way language is used. What was this advertising campaign? Senator Alston said it himself: a community education and information program. What a terrible distortion of the English language that is. The campaign was rorting taxpayers' funds for partisan political purposes—nothing more than that.
Why did we go to an election six months early? We went to an election on the timetable of a Prime Minister who wanted to have his tax proposals released, the advertising paid for by the taxpayer for two weeks, and then five weeks of the campaign. He did not want real scrutiny of these proposals. But, to make matters worse, he got his lackeys from the Business Council of Australia to tip another $4 million in at the start of the campaign to advertise for tax reform.
I hope every businessman who put that $4 million in knows that under the Electoral Act they have to declare that as electoral expenditure in this cycle. Otherwise, we might find some of the Business Council of Australia types making a trip down to their local gaol and enjoying some free hospitality there. They have to declare that $4 million as political expenditure.
If this was a community education and information program—what a wonderful euphemism that is—why did we have to have Senator Minchin and the late, lamented Mr Miles authorise the ads? We have seen government advertising stretching back over the last 10 years that has not required authorisation—and therein lies the definition of whether it is a genuine government advertising campaign or whether it is a partisan political campaign.
As Senator Faulkner has indicated, we have never seen a campaign of this scale paid for by taxpayers. It is basically four times higher than any past expenditure in the three months prior to a federal election. The only reason that it got capped off at $15 million or so is because the Prime Minister called an election and saved the taxpayers another $5 million. If you want to know why that happened, just have a look at TV advertising rates: they went up after 3 October. The Liberal Party wanted 
 to pay right through its campaign the rates that were cheaper than the pre-Christmas rates which started almost immediately post 3 October.
One of the least noted changes made in the administrative orders is the removal of OGIA from the Department of Finance and Administration and the sneaking of it across into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. One wonders why that was done, why they have moved it under the direct control of the Prime Minister. I am always the optimist—maybe they have done that to clean this area up because of the embarrassment it has caused them over the last 2½ years.
Let me remind the Senate of the government's first major advertising campaign. We had the tragedy of Port Arthur. We had the strong political leadership of not only Mr Howard but Mr Beazley and others on gun control. There was an enthusiasm to advertise various aspects of that bipartisan political approach.
So what did we get? First of all, we got an advertising firm that was not on OGIA's register put on the list of firms to be chosen from. Even though it was not one of the 1,000 firms on the register, it was put on. It did not make the short list, so the chief political adviser to the Prime Minister intervened and had it put on. Guess who actually got the firm up even though OGIA said it was by far the weakest bid? It was a political committee which included Senator Minchin, in particular, who pushed this particular firm through. When we had a look at the firm, guess who was on the firm? Toby Ralph. All the team that was involved in the Liberal Party's 1996 election campaign won the contract.
And Senator Alston makes reference to poor advertising. There was never a worse campaign run. There was never a more unprofessional campaign than the gun buyback advertising. It was absolutely abysmal. It was a terrible campaign—and all their professional associates through the industry described it as such.
Not content with rewarding them, the Liberal Party then had to reward one of their own with their PR contract. It again did not make the short list. The Attorney-General, Mr 
 Daryl Williams, intervened, and the political fix was put in yet again. So in the first two tests of this government when it came to advertising, the fix went in and the good old boys from the team got the contracts—and they have got several since. That means: when you come to an election campaign, you get a good discount from the boys. They will go and work for you for virtually nothing because they are getting paid by the taxpayer through a politically rorted process where clapped out Liberal Party apparatchiks—you in the National Party do not even get a look in—choose these contracts. They clear the officials out of the room so that they cannot be sprung on these particular proposals.
So we were not particularly surprised when we saw in the budget papers an allocation of money to advertising. But they could not even get that right. They had to go to the Advance to the Minister for Finance for what they described as unforeseen expenditure. Of course it was foreseen—it was foreseen because it was in a previous set of budget papers.
So, as the Auditor-General has outlined, this is one area that needs examination, this misuse of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. The government should take that seriously, otherwise they will find that, every time the advance is put in this particular chamber, we will have to start itemising and questioning the items. That is not a good process of government. We all acknowledge that the Advance to the Minister for Finance is a necessary and valuable tool to the executive government, but their misuse and abuse of it on this occasion will lead us to question it in future.
The second thing the Auditor-General has basically said in the code that Auditor-General's talk is that this decision by the government is technically legal and he will not judge the morality of it. But implicitly, by calling for an inquiry by a parliamentary committee, he believes this is an area that should be looked at. Guess what? The Acting Treasurer of the time came out of his burrow just long enough to say, `I don't think that's a good idea.' Of course not. Of course they do not want that particular element examined.
You do not have the Treasurer do it; it is one of the minor flunkies in the ministry who has to come out. The only sort of stuttering response we got was, `We wouldn't like a parliamentary inquiry into that.' In other words, they will accept as rolled gold everything else in the Auditor-General's report, but what happened to his serious recommendation that parliamentary scrutiny be given to this sort of advertising, especially advertising of this scale requiring this political endorsement? Those on that side of the chamber rejected it automatically. That is not for them because what is turned up might be embarrassing.
There is a lot more to come out about this advertising campaign and the way Treasury has handled it. We know that, and that will be pursued in other avenues. We do not want to delay proceedings today too long. But it is probably the most blatant political exercise ever conducted in this country, the most cynical and the most blatant misuse of funds that has happened since Federation.
The dichotomy between Mr Howard's professed standards and the reality of the operation of this government is absolutely drawn in this case, as it is in many other cases of standards. The words flow, the pomposity and the sincerity come out but, when you actually look at the way this government operates, poor old ex-President Nixon must be turning in his grave in envy.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Report No. 12 of 1998-99</title>,Documents,18,2
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-11-10,"—I will just respond briefly to a number of the comments that Senator Ray made.
—We want you on the record for this rort, Kemp.
—If you want to get up and speak, you speak, Senator Conroy, but I am going to have my go now. In the earlier part of his remarks, Senator Ray gave us an insight into how the Labor Party works with mates. It is not the way the Liberal Party works with mates. Senator Ray was speaking from deep experience.
Can I just make a couple of brief comments. Is it not strange that, after 13 years of the rules under which the Labor Party operated, they have suddenly decided that those 
 rules are not appropriate. We operate under the same rules the Labor Party operated under.
—You are joking!
—Yes, we operate under the same rules the Labor Party operated under for 13 years. For 13 years you operated under those rules, and there was not a hint from Robert Ray or John Faulkner that those rules should be changed.
This is what happened. Senator Faulkner, who made no serious policy contribution in the last parliament, tried to get himself a position in the election campaign through this big stunt about political advertising. Senator Faulkner referred this all to the Auditor-General and he struck out on every issue. On every issue, Senator Faulkner was found to be wrong.
The first question of Senator Faulkner was whether the CEIP was for a Commonwealth purpose. The short answer from the Auditor-General is yes. Senator Faulkner struck out once. In relation to the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance and Administration, which you spoke on, Senator Ray, this is what it says:
In the light of legal advice received, the ANAO was satisfied that the approval of funds from the AMFA met the legislative conditions that the requirement for the funds was urgent and unforeseen.
Senator Faulkner struck out again.
—He said it was a shonk and we should have a parliamentary inquiry.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Order! There are too many interjections.
—That is two strikes against Senator Faulkner.
—It was corrupt.
—Order! There are far too many interjections. Senator Kemp, you are addressing your remarks across the chamber and not through the chair.
—Thank you, Madam President. As you know, I was being unduly provoked on this issue. The third issue raised by Senator Faulkner related to public servants, 
 their duties and responsibilities. This is what the Auditor-General said:
Given the legal advice that the CEIP was for Commonwealth purposes, on the basis of the evidence available, there was no breach of the Public Service Regulations or the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 by Commonwealth officers.
Senator Faulkner struck out yet again. Normally it is three strikes and you are out, Senator Faulkner—accept the umpire's decision.
—So what he said is have an inquiry because it is corrupt.
—Order! Senator Faulkner, you have had a chance to speak.
—Thank you, Madam President. Fair enough it was an election campaign, and why not try to get yourself on the box. He did that. He referred this to the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General examined the issues that Senator Faulkner raised. Senator Faulkner struck out, and that is the problem, that is the issue.
So here we have this spleen being vented on day one of the resumption of the Senate. I have to say it reflects again the priorities of the Labor Party. It reflects the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. The Labor Party operated under these rules for 13 years, as Robert Ray knows better than any other person, and not a hint that there was anything wrong with those rules. When we operate under the same rules, we get attacked. We were cleared by the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General gave us a clean bill of health. We were right; Senator Faulkner was wrong. That was the answer.
—He said you were corrupt.
—The Auditor-General looked very closely at the issue Senator Faulkner raised, and Senator Faulkner was found not to have any case on any of the points he raised.
—That is an absolute lie.
—That is what happened. Read the Auditor-General's report, Senator Faulkner.  
—I have. We are very happy with it.
—If you are happy with it, you will be happy in opposition. It is no wonder you are happy in opposition, Senator Faulkner, because on every issue you raised, you struck out. That is what happened with the Auditor-General's report.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Why don't you hold an inquiry?
—Why don't you read the report?
—Order! Senator Faulkner and Senator Conroy should cease shouting.
—I urge Labor Party senators—including Senator Robert Ray and Senator Faulkner—to read the Auditor-General's report and note that their leader in the Senate got it wrong and that the government was cleared on all counts.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Report No. 12 of 1998-99</title>,Documents,18,2
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-11-10,"—This afternoon we have had a pathetic effort by the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Richard Alston, to defend the government against the sensible, realistic and, I might say, devastating charge put against it by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner. Senator Alston took 90 seconds to defend the government from a $17 million electoral rort. That is what he took—90 seconds. He could not think of another word to say in that 90 seconds. What the government then did was call down a well-known senator who can speak under wet cement on any circumstance to obfuscate this debate. He was called in to muddy the waters, confuse the listeners and take attention away from the facts.
The Auditor-General's report does three things and it does them quite clearly. It says there is a public perception in the Australian community that this was funding for political ads; it says this was an inappropriate use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance; and it says this was an inappropriate use of 
 Commonwealth copyright. We would add a fourth point: it invades the civil liberties of clients of Centrelink in the sense that it invades their privacy. There are four reasons that demonstrate that the government used public funding in order to promote its own narrow electorate agenda and pursue its goal of trying to foist an unwelcome tax on the Australian people. There were $17 million of taxpayers money used to do that. That is a scandal. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-11-10,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on Saturday 24 october 1998, of the Honourable Charles Edward Barnes, a member of the House of Representatives for the division of McPherson from 1958 to 1972, Minister for Territories from 1963 to 1968 and Minister for External Territories from 1968 to 1972, places on record its appreciation for his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Charles Edward Barnes was born on 13 November 1901 at Einasleigh, Queensland. Ceb, as he was called, was educated in Sydney. His family moved to their Canning Downs property near Warwick in 1917. Ceb left school in 1918, aged 17, and gained employment with the Union Trustee Company. Ceb bought the Canning Downs property from his father after World War II and lived there until his death.
Canning Downs is a horse stud where Ceb and his family have bred fine race horses including `Tails' who, on his third attempt, finished third in the 1971 Melbourne Cup. In fact, Ceb credited one horse, Basha Felika, the 1951 Caulfield Cup winner, with winning him an election when his constituents found out that he owned him.
During World War II, Ceb served in the Royal Australian Air Force. He enlisted in 1942 and was discharged in 1944, having reached the rank of Flying Officer after serving in Australia and New Guinea.
Ceb was elected as the Country Party member for McPherson in 1958. His maiden speech in the House of Representatives was full of praise for the farming industry in Queensland. He commented on how Queensland had gone from importing flour to growing some of the best wheat in Australia and how Queensland had changed from relying on its mining industry to sustaining a thriving agricultural sector. His parliamentary career was distinguished—serving for 14 years, eight as a minister.
Ceb's association with New Guinea did not end with his war service but continued through his parliamentary duties. As Minister for External Territories, he will be remembered for his dedication to the economic and political development of Papua New Guinea and its progress toward self-government. He had responsibility for a difficult and controversial portfolio which would have tested any minister, but he fulfilled his duty honourably.
During Ceb's 14 years in this parliament, he contributed to the work of parliamentary committees. He was a member of both the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines and the Select Committee on Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserve. He also attended the inauguration of the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly in 1964 and led a parliamentary delegation to the South Pacific in 1971.
Ceb retired from federal politics in 1972 and returned to Canning Downs and breeding horses. He has been quoted as saying that he gained so much from his years in parliament and would not have missed them for anything, but in the end was a farmer at heart.
Ceb will be remembered by all who knew him as a man whose honesty, integrity and dignity were but a few of his virtues.
On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Barbara, his daughters, Patricia and Jill, son John and their families our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Barnes, Hon. Charles Edward `Ceb'</title>",Condolences,22,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-11-10,"—On behalf of the opposition, I associate the opposition with this condolence motion on the death of Ceb Barnes, a former Country Party minister. We also express our sincere regret at his death and offer our condolences to his family.
Ceb Barnes will be remembered as a gentleman who treated people with respect and who lived his life with dignity. I am told that he had a straightforward style about him, that he was a person who fought hard for his convictions, that he gave no quarter and that he sought none.
He entered federal parliament quite late in life. He was in his late 50s when he first won the seat of McPherson in Queensland in 1958, and he held that seat until he retired from parliament in 1972. He was appointed Minister for Territories in 1963, which at the time included a responsibility for Papua New Guinea. In 1968 his title and portfolio responsibilities were changed when he became Minister for External Territories. It was that portfolio that he held until his retirement from the Commonwealth parliament in 1972. It was a difficult and, at times, controversial portfolio which he held for eight years.
As Minister for Territories he was responsible for the introduction of equal pay for indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory. He also played a major role in the campaign to give indigenous Australians the vote. During his time as minister, he was also responsible for advancing the cause of self-government for what we now know as Papua New Guinea. By 1970 he, along with others, had steered the process to the point where the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly was able to take over management of many of its affairs along the process towards full self-government. He strongly wanted to see Papua New Guinea prepared for self-government by 
 ensuring social stability and sound economic development. Of course, full independence for Papua New Guinea was achieved in 1975.
I am told that Ceb Barnes was a man of strong character. We have learnt that he turned a knighthood down after his retirement as he modestly judged his own achievements to be unremarkable. I think he had substantial achievements and, as Minister Kemp and I have indicated, they are there on the public record for all to see. Madam President, let me say on behalf of the opposition that we offer our most sincere condolences to his family and friends.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Barnes, Hon. Charles Edward `Ceb'</title>",Condolences,22,1
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1998-11-10,"—I rise to extend the condolences of the National Party to the family of our former National Party colleague Charlie Edward Barnes, known as Ceb Barnes. I can remember that he addressed some of the meetings in the earlier part of my association with the National Party. I have also met him personally.
Ceb Barnes was the National Party member for McPherson from 1958 until 1972, succeeding in the seat of McPherson another admirable Queenslander, the Hon. Sir Artie Fadden. At the time the electorate covered a huge part of Queensland—from Warwick, Boonah, right down to Southport and to what is now known as the Gold Coast.
 Ceb Barnes was always described as a true gentleman. He was a man of many achievements: a miner, an aviator, a thoroughbred breeder, a politician and a farmer. His rural interests and knowledge were tremendous assets to the Country Party. He was particularly well known as a dedicated horse breeder on his family property, Canning Downs, at Warwick. As a government minister, he had the distinction of receiving newspaper headlines for his horses' racing successes, which included his famous chestnut colt Tails that he bred at Canning Downs. In fact, on the day Ceb retired from politics, Tails retired from racing.
As a breeder of thoroughbreds, he was a pursuer of colonial blood as the principal source of breeding lines for Canning Downs—as had his father John H.S. Barnes 
 been before him. In the foreword to his biography, Ceb—exploits of an uncommon man, it is said:
As a breeder of thoroughbred racehorses Ceb Barnes can take his place as a master of both—a scientist and a craftsman—a man whose knowledge and understanding of bloodlines combined with his ability and sensitivity as a horseman has earned him a place as a nobleman of the bloodstock industry in Queensland.
In 1963 Ceb Barnes was appointed Minister for the Territories in the Menzies government, following Sir Paul Hasluck. In 1968 he became the Minister for External Territories—covering Papua New Guinea, the Northern Territory, Norfolk Island, Cocos Island, Christmas Island and Nauru—which he held until January 1972. Ceb Barnes held portfolios under four prime ministers: Menzies, Holt, Gorton and McMahon.
His achievements were considerable. He gradually introduced equal pay for Aborigines in the Northern Territory, a right which was extended by the vote to right through referendum. As minister, his focus on Papua New Guinea was to achieve economic development and social stability. It was a difficult period leading a country to nationhood and a time when he received criticism from many quarters. During this period leading into self-government—immediate independence was the catchcry of many, including the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gough Whitlam—Barnes as the responsible minister saw this as a matter for the people themselves and should not be imposed upon them. His involvement as minister with Papua New Guinea echoed his time there during the Second World War as a flying officer in the RAAF, responsible for radar installations at Milne Bay and the Trobriand Islands.
Ceb Barnes could reply ably to his critics, citing the achievements during his years as minister. These included the trebling of territory spending, a trebling of education spending, a doubling of health spending, an increase of nearly 50 per cent in school enrolments and the opening of the university and other tertiary educational institutions which endure as proud and valuable contributors to Papua New Guinea today. On his retirement, his contribution to Papua New 
 Guinea was paid tribute through the words of the President, Tuit To Kubak of the Gazelle Peninsula Local Government Council, who said:
The people of this territory have highly admired the marvellous and splendid work you have carried out . . . Now the time has come that you have to retire but the council will not forget you.
What you have done for the improvement of our territory of Papua New Guinea will always recall your name back to the people.
The life of Ceb Barnes, 20 days short of 97 years, reveals a full life of public service and a valuable contribution to primary industry and family life. His biographer, Lorraine Nott, concludes his autobiography with the words:
One cannot help but wonder to what greater heights Canning Downs might have climbed had Ceb Barnes not given those years to government. Ceb Barnes is quoted as saying, ""But I gained so much from those years—I wouldn't have missed them for anything.""
I extend the condolences of the National Party to his widow, Barbara, and children, Patricia, Jill and John, and his sister, Mrs Adelaide Bell.
