"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2009-06-15,"—Pursuant to standing order 38, I present reports Nos 6 and 7 of the Selection of Bills Committee, which were presented to the President since the Senate last sat. In accordance with the terms of the standing orders, the publication of the documents was authorised.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-06-15,"—I move:
At the end of the motion add:
“but, in respect of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2009 and two related bills:
(a)      the reference of the bills to the Economics Legislation Committee be transferred to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 5 August 2009; and
(b)      in considering this matter, the Community Affairs Legislation Committee may consider the relevant evidence and records of the Economics Legislation Committee.”
Just to clarify the points, the amendment indicates that we wish the bills to be considered by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee with a reporting date of 5 August this year. That also incorporates the brief inquiry by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee and provides that those findings be examined by the committee also and that the economics committee does not report their findings as they are transferred to the community affairs committee.
The technical wording of the amendment has been circulated. The main reason we are suggesting this is that this is a very complex suite of bills. It has raised a lot of community concern and it was the coalition’s wish for these bills to be referred to the community affairs committee with the later reporting date. The bills were caught up in the catch-all notice of motion that brought all budget measure bills an opportunity to be referred to the economics committee and reported upon. The spirit of this particular motion was caught up in that and we did not intend for that to take place. I think the manager of government business acknowledged that was the case. We wish this to be dealt with at a more opportune time and over a longer period of time. Then it can be dealt with quite effectively.
There was media speculation last week about the bills being examined briefly, on one day, during the one week that the Senate was not sitting either through estimates or through the regular sitting schedule. Our senators did not believe this was an appropriate way to deal with these bills. We made that known at the Selection of Bills Committee meeting on Thursday the week before the bills were considered by the economics committee.
There are a variety of reasons as to why these bills need to be considered by the community affairs committee, none less than by the responsible minister who has the portfolio assignation for these bills. We feel as though the matters have not been properly canvassed. Through the estimates process, questions were asked by senators in relation to these bills and, as of yet, answers have not been forthcoming in relation to these bills. Certainly, of last week those answers were not available. We feel it is only fit and proper that answers to estimates questions do form part of this inquiry, because they can assist the committee in its deliberations.
Also, figures keep changing. We were informed that 25,000 Australians would drop private cover as a result of this measure. It appears that during estimates it became clear that some 40,000 may drop their cover. It is important to get all the information on the table prior to any committee considering these important matters. We are also concerned that public hospital admissions will increase and, again, it is important to have full examination of all these issues by the appropriate committee to determine that the public hospital system will not come under a lot of undue stress and pressure.
We just feel that the government is rushing this through unnecessarily. The start-up date for these measures does not come into effect until 2010. The idea of referring all matters in relation to the budget and appropriations to the economics committee was for those measures that started on 1 July 2009. These bills do not fall into that category; hence there is no urgency. So it is our strong argument, and our strong position, that these bills be referred to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee for report by 5 August.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-06-15,"—Looking at the numbers around this place, the government recognises it does not have them in respect of this motion; we submit it to the will of the Senate. The government is keen to get its budget bills through during this fortnight. That was the premise for us to agree to the original motion—they would be available for debate. Unfortunately, that is not going to be the case in this instance. Be that as it may, we are still keen to get our budget bills, and the bill that we are dealing with now, through as soon as possible. I think 5 August has been suggested as a committee date. If that bill can then be available as early as possible after that date for parliament to deal with, the government would be appreciative of that.

Stephen Parry

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-15,"—The Senate is considering the Nation-building Funds Amendment Bill 2009. The practical effect of this legislation is to rip $2,500 million out of the Education Investment Fund. I repeat: it will rip out $2,500 million. It is important  from time to time to remind ourselves that $2.5 billion, which so easily slips off the tongue, actually represents $2,500 million. This is from the fund that was created with all the ‘wow’ factor of the The Hollowmen only 12 months ago. This Education Investment Fund was going to be the fundamental underpinning of the Labor Party’s education revolution—it was fundamental to it—but, of course, ‘education revolution’ was yesterday’s slogan. It was yesterday’s slogan to be forgotten today. The focus group has told the government that there should be a new slogan, that of ‘nation building’.
So the government, shortly after introducing its budget—the very same evening, about half an hour later—slipped into the House of Representatives this legislation, which will strip $2,500 million out of the Education Investment Fund and place it in the so-called nation-building fund. Why have I been concentrating on this stripping out of funding from the Education Investment Fund? It is because of all the words spoken so very hollowly by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and, indeed, the Treasurer in relation to this Education Investment Fund. Ms Gillard, on 17 September last year, said:
Our reform agenda will be complemented by increased investment in innovation and infrastructure through the new $11 billion Education Investment Fund.
It will be interesting to hear the minister’s response at the end of this debate as to how much money will actually be in the Education Investment Fund after this raid. Prime Minister Rudd, on 25 August, was bemoaning the supposed, alleged run-down by the Howard government in this area, and he said:
We sought to turn that around, and one of the main vehicles for turning—
that—
around in the Budget was the announcement of … an Education Investment fund.
But, of course, as with everything with this government, that was five minutes ago. Now we need a new slogan and we need new money, so we just take the money out of one fund, slip it into another, give it a new name and once again are able to placate the 24-hour news cycle, which is the real driver of this government’s agenda.
That is the matter that concerns us in the coalition the most, Madam Acting Deputy President, because if you have a look at this government’s approach to economic management in this country then you will recall that it was only some 18 months ago or so that Kevin Rudd thundered, about the coalition government, ‘This reckless spending must stop.’ It had to stop. So, in their very first budget, they hoovered $20 billion out of the Australian economy through extra tax revenue measures because we had to slow the economy down! The reckless Howard government had so overheated the economy that it had to be slowed down! Indeed, the Reserve Bank was goaded and cajoled into increasing interest rates with that memorable line that the inflation genie was out of the bottle, one of the more infamous comments by a federal Treasurer—and, of course, no wonder that it comes from the current federal Treasurer, Mr Swan!
That was in May 2008, but, of course, that was for the news cycle for that month. Shortly thereafter, rather than slowing the economy down, they had to inject over $10 billion into the economy for a stimulus package. This is a government that simply has no idea day to day as to how to manage the economy. It has no vision for the future. It has no idea what the fundamentals that need to be addressed are in our economy. One day it is reckless spending: ‘That sounds like a good, focus-group-tested idea, so we’ll throw that into the media for a while. When that’s run its course, we’ll talk about the inflation genie getting out of the bottle and run that for a little while. Then we’ll talk about an overheated economy for a little while.’ Then, without blinking an eyelid, having said all these things only a matter of a few months earlier, the government turns around and says, ‘We’ve got to stimulate the economy.’
It is this same ad hoc, stop-start approach that Labor are now taking to education. The interesting thing is—and I must say that I will keep scanning the newspapers and listening to the airwaves—that I do not seem to hear the Australian Education Union, such a huge funder of the Labor Party at the last election, complaining about this siphoning of money out of the Education Investment Fund into what the minister described in his second reading speech to the House by saying:
This amount will be made available for the new Clean Energy Initiative.
These new clean energy initiatives may well be worthwhile projects, but what we are saying is: why is it that this money is being taken out of the Education Investment Fund, which was promised to the Australian people and, in fact, funded by Howard government surpluses? That is how the money got into this investment fund in the first place—make no mistake. Now Labor, having pledged themselves to the Education Investment Fund and to ramping it up to $11 billion, are siphoning out $2.5 billion—and I remind myself that that is $2,500 million.
What it shows is that this government has no consistent set of priorities. One day it will be education if that is what focus groups are telling it, but the next day it will be nation building, and it will not bother to check to see if its two lots of rhetoric actually match into a common theme for its management of the Australian economy. Indeed, it is interesting to note—and I invite honourable senators to have a look at the legislation that, in fact, set up the Education Investment Fund—that it was specified in the legislation that this money would only be available for certain purposes, which are enumerated from (a) to (l) in the legislation. I have read through those subparagraphs time and time again, and nowhere—and this might surprise honourable senators—does the Education Investment Fund legislation say that the money might be used for new clean energy initiatives. Nowhere in the legislation does it say that. But, of course, the Australian people were told and guaranteed by Ms Gillard, this great champion of education—how she has allowed this $2.5 billion to be ripped out of her portfolio nobody knows—on 13 May 2008, at the time of the second last budget:
The Future Fund Board of Guardians will be responsible for managing the fund.
Let Ms Gillard tell the Australian people and this parliament whether the board of guardians of this Future Fund had any say whatsoever in the diversion of $2.5 billion out of the fund. Let her tell the Australian parliament when it was considered. I have a funny feeling that these guardians on the board of this Future Fund would in fact be experts in the field of education. Chances are they are highly qualified capable individuals, able to make decisions as to where an investment fund in education ought be directed. I just have a feeling that if they were to be asked, ‘Where would money be well spent if you were to pursue new clean energy initiatives?’ they might say, ‘You’re asking the wrong people.’ If that is the case, what it shows and highlights is that Ms Gillard’s promise to the Australian people that the guardians would be responsible for managing the fund was wrong, that there was no intention whatsoever of allowing these guardians to manage this fund, which we were told on so many, many occasions was so vital to the future of Australians, especially young Australians.
Let’s just keep this in mind: Labor has stripped $13.8 billion out of future funds—the health one, the building Australia one and the education one—in about 12 months. $13.8 billion has now been spent and taken out of these funds. You then consider that the cash splashes that were splashed around the community for no benefit whatsoever, other than to keep us out of a technical recession, cost the Australian taxpayer $22 billion. So the simple fact is, but for the cash splash of $22 billion, this sleight of hand, stealing money out of the education fund and putting it into the clean energy initiatives, would not have been necessary. This is the price young Australians are already paying for the spending spree of this government. Not only do they have a $9,000 debt hanging over their heads as a result of the spending spree, but they have also been denied the investment of this $11 billion Education Infrastructure Fund, courtesy of the sound management of the Howard government, from being spent on educational institutions around this country. So the young people in particular are going to suffer a double whammy as a result of this economic negligence. In fact, I am not even sure if it is negligence. Sometimes I wish it were just mere incompetence, mere negligence. But there is a deliberate pattern emerging—
—Vandalism!
—where the government says one thing one day and does the exact opposite the next day, and still places hand on heart, saying, ‘We are committed to our election policies.’ I note in the chamber Senator Mason, a very excellent advocate for education in this country. He has pursued the issue of the education revolution and shown how hollow it actually is, that it was a mere two words, ‘education revolution’, which meant nothing, especially for the young people of Australia. But for the cash splash, the so-called ‘socks and jocks revolution’, the young people of Australia now are going to be denied a real education revolution. We know the ‘laptops for everybody’ was a disaster. We now know, courtesy of Senator Mason’s questioning at Senate estimates, that the school-building program is also a farce. Schools that were slated to be closed down over the next year or two will still have funding provided to them for new facilities. Indeed, I became aware of one school recently that were given $250,000 for a new facility. They were able to get it for $150,000, but when they put in their submission the department bounced it back to them, saying: ‘No, no, no, naughty people! It has to cost $250,000.’ This is how money is being squandered and that is why the Education Investment Fund has to be raided to the tune of $2,500 million.
—Gross mismanagement!
—Senator Parry, you are absolutely right—it is gross mismanagement. But methinks it is not so much negligence as part of the 24-hour news cycle spin. Education revolution was five minutes ago; that no longer has any traction. Now it is nation building; now we have to talk nation building. And I am sure by the time of the next budget—but let’s just wait on this. What is the bet there will not be a budget before the next election? Let’s wait and see whether Labor are willing to deliver another budget. That is when the young people of this nation will get hit with a triple whammy. The first whammy is the $9,000 debt. The second whammy is that it is their Education Investment Fund that has now been stripped of funding. Of course, the third whammy will show how the economy is in a complete train wreck scenario because of the mismanagement. For those of us that are over 50, chances are we have lived half our lives. But the young people, whose cause people like Senator Mason and I are trying to champion, still have their lives in front of them. They still have their educational needs in front of them. That is why the stripping out of this money from the Education Investment Fund is so very damaging to the future of our country. Indeed, I recall Ms Gillard—and I happen to note the minister for innovation and industry, amongst other things, in the chamber—told us on 17 September 2008:
Our reform agenda will be complemented by increased investment in innovation … through the new $11 billion Education Investment Fund.
How hollow those words now sound, because we know there was never any intention. If the government were genuinely concerned about education and its funding for the future, they would have said, ‘Education is a better long-term investment in human capital in this country than giving a cash splash of $22 billion.’ Remember the first $10 billion? That was supposed to create 75,000 new jobs, yet not a single job can be identified for that gross waste of money. But then not to be outdone they came into this place with another $40 billion-plus stimulus package, and you would have thought that by spending four times the amount of money there may have been the creation of a further four times 75,000 jobs. No, they came into this place and said that $40 billion on this occasion would not create—only support—90,000 jobs.
What a waste of money these stimulus packages have been. We as a coalition would have had a lot more modest a figure. We would not have had the cash splashes and as a result the Education Investment Fund, which was the guarantee to future generations, the legacy that was able to be left by the sound financial management of the Howard-Costello governments, money that was set aside for future generations, is now being squandered by Rudd Labor.  We take the view in general terms that governments are elected to govern. They are entitled to make decisions, and on this occasion we will not stand in the way of this legislation, but I, on behalf of the coalition, hope I have been able to express our concerns as to why this raid on the Education Investment Fund has been necessary, the damage it will do to the future of our country and especially to the future of our young people and that but for the reckless spending spree, the reckless cash splashes, there would have been no need for this raid and education would have been able to continue to shine and grow as it did under the Howard years.
Let me remind those opposite, in case they comment on the so-called lack of investment under the Howard government, the greatest investment that the Howard-Costello government made in the future of young people was to pay off Labor’s $96 billion debt that it left from last time. We paid that off only in April 2006. That is how long it took. It was only after that debt was paid off that we were able to start investing in schools and set aside these future funds, and Labor has squandered the future funds and got us back into debt to the great future detriment of the young people of Australia. We will seek to champion their cause yet again, as we undoubtedly will be required to, when we fix up the economy after the next election.",SENATE,<title>NATION-BUILDING FUNDS AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-06-15,"—The second reading speech to the Nation-building Funds Amendment Bill 2009 says that the legislation is to provide funding for infrastructure spending priorities and that to do that the bill will repeal the crediting of $2.5 billion from the 2007-08 budget surplus—I want to come back to the word ‘surplus’; it is something we do not understand much about these days—to the Education Investment Fund that was to occur by 30 June this year. This amount is now to be made available for the new Clean Energy Initiative. The second reading speech also says that the Clean Energy Initiative will encourage further research and innovation in clean energy generation and low-emissions technology. On that point I refer to a comment by Dr Glenn Withers of Universities Australia, the peak body representing universities, which criticises the decision to divert funds from the education fund to the Clean Energy Initiative. He is reported as saying that ‘little of the money for the Clean Energy Initiative would go towards universities, vocational education and training or research institutes’. So at last academia in Australia is getting to understand the duplicity in the approach of this government to any issue and, in the instance I have quoted, to this particular bill before the parliament.
I refer again to the second reading speech, in which the government talks of surpluses in the 2007 budget. Madam Acting Deputy President, you and all senators would realise that that budget surplus was really money left to the current government by the Howard-Costello government—money and surpluses that had been built up in the previous couple of years after the Howard-Costello government had paid off $96 billion of Labor’s debt. As those senators who were here in 1996 when the government last changed would remember, in 1996 when the new government came in there was no indication that the current account for that particular year was $10 billion in the red. But when the new government came in and had a look at the books we found that there was almost a secret $10 billion deficit that had been run up in that particular year, and that $10 billion deficit went together with other deficits to create the $96 billion that was owing by the last Labor government. Madam Acting Deputy President, you do not have to look far to understand that this is not an isolated instance. That was the last Labor government. It was $10 billion in debt for that particular year and $96 billion in debt for the 13 years that it was in power. Have a look around at all of the state governments now, Madam Acting Deputy President, and you will see that all are in substantial debt.
It just shows that you simply cannot trust Labor with money. Labor is incapable of managing the taxpayers’ finances. My own state of Queensland, regrettably, has lost its AAA rating. We are facing a budget that is cutting services. In Queensland we are even talking about selling Queensland railways. We are talking about selling all of the electricity generation companies. We are talking about selling the ports infrastructure. These were all things which prior to this time I thought were tenets of the Labor Party philosophy—you know: the government should own all of those things. I see the unions, in their typical way, were demonstrating outside the Labor Party conference the other day. They were not going to let this happen. Of course, the Premier went inside the doors, said a few fine words, all the union bosses scurried around to fall in line and so went through the decision to privatise a lot of the Queensland government infrastructure.
Why is the Queensland government doing that? Because they have run out of money. They are now at a state where they cannot even borrow money without the support of the federal government. If any of you were around in Queensland before the state election just a few months ago, you would have heard stories from the Labor Party of how well the state was being managed and what good shape the finances of the state were in, only to find out two or three short months later that we as a state are in the financial pits. If we were a business we would be going into liquidation. That is what you get from the Labor Party when you leave them in charge of money. This bill before us today is another indication of the Labor Party simply being incapable of making financial decisions that stick.
We thought $96 billion in 13 years was pretty horrendous. Now Australians are beginning to realise that in 18 short months this Labor government has provided not for $96 billion of debt but for over $300 billion worth of debt. How are the Australian taxpayers going to pay that off? The Labor Party are not interested in it. This has been well commented upon. They have come to the conclusion that they will not even try to pay off the debt. They know that the electoral cycle will turn. As every day goes by I think it is going to turn much sooner than the Labor Party intended. They always knew that at some time the electoral cycle would turn and the good old Liberals would come back, take the hard, tough decisions, get the economy back on track and pay off the debt.
It is because of this financial profligacy that we hear reports of interest rates going up. Why are interest rates going up? It is not the fault of the Commonwealth Bank. It is not the fault of the National bank or the other banks. It is because of the huge amount of debt that this government has racked up in 18 short months. It is simply incredible that any group of people masquerading under the pretence of government with financial responsibility can have done that in such a short period. You will remember Mr Rudd telling the Australian public, with hand on heart, that he was a financial conservative. How can he possibly lie straight in bed these nights? He knew at the time that he was not telling the truth, and he has proved that in his actions since that time.
I know time is short and we have a busy legislative program. The coalition will be helping the Labor Party get through the urgent bills that are on the program this sitting fortnight, so I do not want to take too much more of the Senate’s time. Suffice it to say that the Labor Party’s ‘Clean Energy Initiative’ is also as fanciful as their suggestions of financial conservatism or of good economic management. In the two Senate committees inquiring into climate change policy and emissions trading that I have sat on, it has become quite clear that this is another piece of legislation that the Labor Party simply have no idea how to manage.
They have appointed a minister who in the first couple of weeks of government slipped over to Bali, got nationwide publicity—not worldwide publicity, as the Labor Party tried to pretend, but at least they did get nationwide publicity—for signing the Kyoto agreement, an action which meant absolutely nothing and did not provide one iota of benefit for reducing the emissions of the world. We had this minister who was going to solve everything. It quickly became clear that the job was far too big for this minister and so when it got into real problems Mr Rudd, at least realising that he was in some real trouble with the unions, with others, with industry and with financiers on the emissions trading scheme, brought in Mr Combet as Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change to go out and do the negotiations to try to bring the Labor Party’s emissions trading scheme back on track. Mr Combet has at least spoken to people; many people who spoke to us could not get in to see the minister, but at least they were able to get in to see Mr Combet. As a result of Mr Combet’s work, there were substantial changes made to the emissions trading scheme.
I would not mind betting you that before this bill sees its time out in this parliament there will be other substantial changes, because even the Labor Party now understands that the bill to come before us is a dog of a bill and one that will not make one iota of difference in reducing world emissions or the changing climate of the world—but it will destroy many Australian industries and will ensure that many working families who were working families in the Howard government years no longer have that title. They will be families of unemployed, families whose parents do not have jobs because of the mismanagement of the Labor Party and particularly this emissions trading scheme. In the two committee hearings that I sat through, witness after witness told us of the job losses that would occur.
In Queensland last week, the bankrupt state government increased electricity prices by 16 per cent. The minister who was given the short straw to go out and announce this 16 per cent increase said that if your electricity bill was something like $360 a bill—and I do not have the exact figures with me—it would go up by $55. This was done just because the Queensland government has run out of money. If you think of electricity and what the people of Queensland are paying now, our committee heard evidence that electricity costs for ordinary households would increase by anywhere between 50 and 200 per cent following the emissions trading scheme and the mandatory renewable energy target—the most modest estimate was a 50 per cent increase. While electricity prices in Queensland went up 16 per cent last week, when the Labor Party’s emissions trading scheme and mandatory renewable energy target come in electricity prices will go up another by 50 per cent at least—and perhaps by up 200 per cent.
The Clean Energy Initiative, which is mentioned in this bill, is a joke. Coal companies who appeared before the committee talked about clean energy and what they were doing to help reduce emissions. They have been cut off the Labor Party’s help list simply because they are coal companies and the Labor Party apparently do not like the coal companies. I can tell the Labor Party that many of their union members love the coal companies because they provide them with jobs, and up in my part of Queensland they provide them with very well paid jobs that in the future will not be available thanks to the Labor Party. I can just imagine the outrage and sense of betrayal that unionists in the Bowen Basin coalfields will exhibit when they realise that the government that they worked so hard to get elected just 18 or 19 months ago has turned on them and taken away their most valuable asset—that is, the right to work. Yet coal companies are doing things to try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They are trying to do their part but they have been shunned by this government and will not be assisted.
These are matters which we will be debating in the future, but what comes to mind when looking at the bill before us is that the Labor Party are using budget surpluses that were put aside in previous years and taking from education and putting it somewhere else. It again shows that where money is concerned you simply cannot trust the Labor Party.",SENATE,<title>NATION-BUILDING FUNDS AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-06-15,"—I rise today to say how very disappointed the Greens are with the government’s decision not to keep the money that was promised to the education infrastructure fund in the fund. I would like to remind the Senate of the genesis of this and the conversation and the argument that occurred in the Senate. In the first quarter of last year when the government brought in its Infrastructure Australia legislation, there was a long debate in the Senate. At that time, I pointed out that the government’s total focus on infrastructure in Australia was based on the assumption that Australia would remain a resource based economy; it was all about building coal ports, railways and roads and the rest of it. I pointed out at the time that if you are going to move to a post-industrial, post-resource based economy and move to a low-carbon economy your major investment has to be in things like education. It is critical infrastructure for the nation to invest in education, skills training and retention, and move Australia from being an economy based on digging up things, cutting down and shipping away. We have to become a more sophisticated economy. We have to invest in manufacturing, innovation and new technology, and to do that we need the innovation coming out of our universities.
Subsequent to the establishment of Infrastructure Australia in the budget last year, the government—taking on board what had been said about the need to move beyond a resourced based economy—announced an Education Investment Fund. At the time the government said that that fund would come from the transfer of what had previously been known as the Higher Education Endowment Fund, and that it would be added to in this year’s budget. Interestingly, the amount at that particular time was $6.5 billion, which would be transferred from the old Higher Education Endowment Fund. Now, as a result of the government’s decision to redirect money and not fulfil its promise to the nation last year in terms of education infrastructure, we find that there will still be $6.5 billion in the Education Investment Fund. In other words, all we have in the Education Investment Fund now is what was transferred from the old Higher Education Endowment Fund.
All of the publicity and all the hype last year about the money and the interest being made available to universities, to the higher education sector, to invest in new infrastructure was no more than hot air. I am really surprised that universities across Australia have not been much more outspoken in their criticism of the government’s failure. In part, that is because the government made several promises to the higher education sector in this year’s budget. But I wonder how closely the universities have actually looked at them, because the government’s promises for this year are going to be funded out of the Education Investment Fund. The Prime Minister announced that $4.1 billion has been committed in the 2009-10 budget, so we have already seen a substantial amount of the previous fund, the Higher Education Endowment Fund, spent in this year’s budget, with very little capacity in the future to build infrastructure in education, as indeed the Chief Executive Officer of Universities Australia, Glenn Withers, pointed out on 20 May this year. He said that the sector would require extra funding to cover the infrastructure needed to support the government’s plans to expand the number of students attending universities—reforms announced in the budget—and that this spending was not currently covered by the Education Investment Fund. He said:
To reach those [new participation goals] we need more volume infrastructure, not just excellence infrastructure.
Where is the ‘more volume infrastructure’ going to come from for our universities to physically house and teach the expanded number of students who are going to come—and I hope they do come—from the initiatives to increase participation at the tertiary level? This really has been an extraordinary sleight of hand: $6.2 billion of an existing fund, the Higher Education Endowment Fund, transferred last year into the Education Investment Fund and the promised increases not put into that fund but diverted. The universities have not realised that they are actually losing big time because their Higher Education Endowment Fund—or the Education Investment Fund, as they are now calling it—is going to fund the initiatives from this year’s budget, leaving them precious little in that fund to cope with the capital needs they will have for building infrastructure into the future. That is a bad idea.
What is the money going to be used for? The government has announced that $2.5 billion will not go into education infrastructure; instead, it will go to the $4.5 billion Clean Energy Initiative. One billion dollars of that already existed, so it will have $3.5 billion and—what a coincidence—$2 billion has been promised for industrial-scale carbon capture and storage projects under the Carbon Capture and Storage Flagship program. So we are seeing $2.5 billion for infrastructure taken out of the universities sector and given straight to the coal industry. This is the community subsidising coal to the detriment of students and increased participation rates in our universities.
The Greens’ view is well known to the Senate—that is, if the coal industry is confident that carbon capture and storage will work then it will fund it itself. After all, the coal industry has made extraordinary profits over the last 150 years by treating the atmosphere as a waste dump for the coal industry, privatising the profits and socialising the costs. The cost is the greenhouse effect. The cost is global warming. And it is being met by increasing numbers of people dying around the world because of the impacts of global warming that are striking us right now. Why wouldn’t you expect the coal industry to spend $2 billion on its own future? It has no legitimacy without carbon capture and storage. Several of Australia’s leading scientists, David Karoly amongst them, wrote to the coal industry recently saying: you cannot continue with coal-fired power stations unless you have carbon capture and storage, and that technology is not going to be available in the foreseeable future—certainly not in the time frame in which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said we need to address dangerous climate change. We only have until 2015, and carbon capture and storage is going to be nowhere in that time frame.
Only last week I was at the CSIRO centre in Newcastle talking to them about the work they are doing on carbon capture and storage. Here is another example of the complete failure to have a whole-of-government approach on these issues. That particular research institution is looking at the capacity to capture carbon from coal-fired power stations—postcombustion capture—but who is actually doing the map on the capacity for storage? It is no use proving you can capture CO2 unless you can also prove you have the volume capacity in suitable geological structures to absorb the liquid carbon dioxide you are going to end up with at the end of the process. It is no use proving it if you cannot afford to pipe the liquid carbon dioxide from the Hunter Valley down to the Otway Basin in Victoria. Whatever that is going to cost—and of course it will be the community who end up paying for that infrastructure too; you can guarantee it—it will never be cost-effective compared with wind and solar thermal, which you can bring on-stream right now.
The issue here is that instead of the government honouring the commitment to the higher education sector that they made in last year’s budget—and there were accolades from one end of the country to the other because at last Australia was going to invest in education—we find that they are not investing in education at all. They are using the previously acquired funds of the Higher Education Endowment Fund to fund this year’s budget promises. There will be no capacity to build the infrastructure that will be necessary if we are to move to a postindustrial society. If we are to get beyond digging holes and cutting down and shipping away, we need not just excellence in our universities but the people and the physical space and infrastructure to absorb them.
I think it is very interesting that the government has not actually specified where the $2 billion is going in terms of the Clean Energy Initiative. It is trying to suggest that the $2 billion will just get mixed up in the $3½ billion of new money that is going to be spent partly on the $2 billion Carbon Capture and Storage Flagships program. There is $500 million going into Renewables Australia, which is the $500 million previously promised. Then there is $1.6 billion in solar technologies including $1.4 billion in the Solar Flagships program. So mixing clean coal and solar into this Clean Energy Initiative could imply that some of this money is going into solar. If that is the case, the government should be finding the money for solar energy elsewhere in its budget; it should not be taking it out of money that was promised to students in Australia to allow them to participate fully in reasonable conditions—physical spaces—in our universities.
This is a retrograde step from the government. I do not believe that one cent of public money should be used to cross-subsidise the coal industry’s research on carbon capture and storage. That industry is rich enough to pay for its own research. Its future depends on paying for its own research and proving it in a time frame that is consistent with the scientific imperatives. I strongly want to put on the public record the fact that the Greens are disgusted with the government’s sleight of hand on the education infrastructure funding initiative announced last year. As I indicated, I am very surprised that the university sector are not more outspoken on this. We can expect them to be more outspoken in the future as they come to realise how little will be left in the education infrastructure fund when the real test is absorbing this larger number of students, whom I hope we get enrolled. When they do enrol in universities across the country, the universities will be back here saying, ‘What happened to our education infrastructure fund?’ What will have happened to it is that it will have gone across to the coal industry to pump good money after bad down holes in the ground—into technology that is not economically viable and will not be economically viable in the time frame required. Every dollar spent on that carbon capture and storage is a dollar that is costing students, and that ought not to be the case.",SENATE,<title>NATION-BUILDING FUNDS AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-06-15,"—I thank senators for their contributions to this debate. I think there are some matters that require some response. First of all let me draw the chamber’s attention to the fact that this budget includes $22 billion worth of investment in nation building and infrastructure. This investment will provide an economic stimulus in the short term to build jobs during a global recession. It will also build critical infrastructure, which we will need for future productivity as the economy recovers and we move forward to ensure the prosperity of this nation into the future. The Nation-building Funds Amendment Bill 2009 is required to give effect to the government’s infrastructure program as well as to investments in a new broadband network and transport infrastructure such as ports, roads, rail, hospital and higher education. The government will also be investing some $4.5 billion in the new Clean Energy Initiative.
The Clean Energy Initiative will encourage further research and innovation in clean energy technologies that will play an important role in Australia’s transition to a low-pollution economy. The Clean Energy Initiative will help accelerate the development and deployment of carbon capture and storage, solar energy and other forms of renewable energy. Of course, the government stand in sharp contrast to the Greens. We are not going to turn our backs on the coal industry. We are not going to turn our backs on the coal communities of this country. We are not going to turn our backs on an industry of this significance in terms of its contribution to both the economy and our society. We are ensuring that we are able to meet some of the greatest challenges this country has ever faced, in terms of climate change, in a responsible manner that ensures we have jobs for people into the future and we are able to provide the economic security that our people rightly deserve.
This bill provides funding for these priorities. It repeals the crediting of some $2.5 billion from the 2007-08 budget surplus to the Education Investment Fund, which was to occur on 30 June 2009. These are propositions that we made clear at Senate estimates; there is no secret about this approach. We made it very clear right from day one that we were able to support an expansion in infrastructure spending for the higher education and research sectors in quite considerable terms. We also said that the future commitments to the EIF program would be conditional on the macroeconomic circumstances of the time, and I do not believe that anyone in this chamber can seriously argue that the economic circumstances of this country have not changed, as they have throughout the world, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the United States last year.
What we said, and remain committed to, was that we were going to have a massive expansion in capital programs in all sectors of education in this country. So, on top of the largest single modernisation program in schools that this country has ever seen, we have also seen the government allocate some $5 billion in the last 18 months to higher education and research infrastructure in this country. How does that stand in comparison to the previous 11 years of coalition government? In that period the coalition invested $1.1 billion. So, in 18 months, we allocated $5 billion; in 11 years the conservatives of this country allocated $1.1 billion. And we see the crocodile tears from those opposite, as they say they now want to ensure there is adequate funding for a range of other programs on top of what is, in this current budget, the largest single investment in research and innovation that this country has seen for 30 years. Have we heard anything in support of that? Not one word.
We note that the government—in terms of draw-downs over the next four or five years, on top of what we have already spent—were only indicating commitments to some $4 billion in EIF funding. We have seen that in posts right across the teaching and research sectors of this country. On top of that, very substantial sums of money are also going for medical research, so that is in addition to what I am arguing in regard to the particular use of this fund. It is not credible for the opposition to claim their concerns about these matters in the context where not only do we have these additional commitments to those we already made but total funding commitments in the context of what is a $5 billion spend. The balance of the EIF will be some $2.4 billion, plus investment earnings estimated to be around $630 million over the forward estimates, and there will be further additional investments in VET, in universities and in research.
What has been put to us by Senator Milne is clearly fanciful. Four hundred million dollars is going to clean energy research in this budget alone. She gives no acknowledgement of that whatsoever but makes spurious claims about what is still available for future investments in higher education, in research and, of course, in ensuring that we have the capacity to provide the answers to some of the challenges that this country currently faces in terms of our climate action program. There is more than $6.5 billion in the Education Investment Fund for education and research, of which $4.1 billion has been committed in the 2009-10 budget and in terms of the nation-building package announced by the Prime Minister on 12 December 2008. There is a substantial proportion of funding available for future commitments on top of that.
The Rudd government’s performance in regard to higher education, research and innovation is second to none in this country. In 18 months we have demonstrated that. You had 11 years, and in 18 months we have surpassed your record by a figure of $5 billion to $1 billion, so I find it extraordinary that these spurious claims could be made by coalition senators, aided and abetted by the Greens, on this matter. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-06-15,"—The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 implements a 2008-09 budget measure which the government says was an election commitment. However, no such commitment can be found—at least, it cannot be easily found. It must be hidden somewhere in the fine print. What we were able to find, however, was a comment by the now Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, when she spoke on this in the House of Representatives on 31 May 2007. This is what the now Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, said before the election:
The PBAC needs to be independent of government and of industry, and we cannot see the justification for this move to the cost-recovery model. I have asked the government to reconsider this approach given the risk to the independence of the PBAC.
And, of course, what we have now is a total reversal—a 180-degree turnaround. We have a measure which will impose fees at three points. It will impose fees for the original submission for pricing, for listing after successful application and for resubmissions.
The introduction of a cost recovery measure was expected to generate additional revenues of $7 million over four years, with a net cost of $2.2 million. However, the explanatory memorandum states that, once fully operational, annual revenue from fees is expected to total about $9.4 million in 2008-09, rising to $14 million in 2009-10. Irrespective, savings are very small compared to the approximately $7 billion spent on the PBS.
Indicative fees and charges proposed under the scheme as at June 2008 were: a major submission, $119,500; a minor submission, $12,500; a secretariat listing, $1,000; generic products, $500; and pricing arrangements, $25,000. This effectively means that it could cost approximately $145,000 to make a submission. To bring new drugs to market, the costs are estimated to be approximately $315,000, provided there is no complication.
Cost recovery measures were first introduced in the 2005-06 budget, with a proposed implementation day of 1 July 2007. Implementation at that time was delayed due to consultations with the pharmaceutical industry about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme reform process during 2006. When originally proposed in 2005-06, there was concern that the measures were undermining the independence of the PBAC and might result in manufacturers declining to list drugs on the PBS. In fact, in 2005-06 Medicines Australia argued that the operation of the PBAC was a Commonwealth government function and cost recovery measures would be inappropriate.
Arguments in favour of cost recovery suggest a pharmaceutical company receives significant benefit from listing and that it is unreasonable that the taxpayer should pay the bill for listing. However, manufacturers already incur significant costs in preparing a submission and, under such a proposal, the pharmaceutical industry would also have to pay the additional fee when a submission is considered by the PBAC. There are concerns that cost recovery could affect the independence of the PBAC and the PBS. In fact, as I have previously mentioned, the Minister for Health and Ageing raised those concerns in the lead-up to the last election—but, of course, now in government, the minister’s position has changed. We have had a bit of a pattern of this. We have seen it with the changes to the Medicare levy surcharge thresholds; we have seen it with the now broken promise in this year’s budget on the private health insurance rebates; and we are now seeing it in relation to the government’s approach to cost recovery of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listings. They say one thing in opposition and they do another in government. It is well and truly in line with what Mr Garrett said before the election: ‘Once we get in, we’ll just change it all; don’t you worry about that.’
Cost recovery has been implemented successfully in the TGA process, which has maintained its independence. However, the TGA and the PBAC have very different roles. The TGA decides whether a drug or medical device can be marketed in Australia, whereas the PBAC advises the minister on which drugs should be approved for a public subsidy.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-06-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
In particular, I would like to make some comments about the answer given by Senator Sherry to my question. The most that can be said of Senator Sherry’s maiden voyage representing the Treasurer in question time is that his performance was a minuscule improvement on that of Senator Conroy, who, unsurprisingly, has been dumped from this very important role. But Senator Sherry’s attempts to explain the principles of causation were, quite frankly, embarrassing. His answers showed just how comprehensively the Rudd Labor government has lost control of the nation’s finances.
Australia’s largest home lender is putting up interest rates because of the increased cost of funds due in part to Mr Rudd’s massive spending spree and the need to borrow funds to fund the spending. Australian householders will face increased mortgage payments, in part because the government is out in the bond market borrowing around $3 billion per week. For Senator Sherry to claim that this has no impact on the cost of funds for home lenders is simply flying a kite. Australia, as we all know, is in deep debt, with the Rudd Labor government now admitting that debt will peak at $315 billion, and that is before we have the farcical broadband plan—another $43 billion—and Ruddbank, yet another $28 billion. This is all borrowed money, borrowed to fund poorly thought-out policy choices, examples of which are now bubbling to the fore.
As if it is not enough that every man, woman and child is now in hock to the tune of $9,000 for Labor’s reckless spending, there is nothing concrete or permanent to show for the $95 billion ploughed into the so-called stimulus packages. Just take the farce that is the so-called education revolution, which the ministers failed to clear up this afternoon in question time. Not content to have computers sitting in boxes becoming obsolete, unused and no use to anyone, Ms Gillard’s latest botched job is to spray money at schools slated for demolition or for amalgamation. Media reports have identified 21 schools due for closure that have been allocated funds from the $14.2 billion Building the Education Revolution fund. As I say, the answers given in question time today as to where these funds have gone and whether or not there will be value for money for the allocation were very unconvincing. You certainly cannot put much faith in a program name that, of course, helps with photo shoots, hard-hat opportunities and stunts but where, when it comes to the crunch, there is money going to schools that, so far as we know, are to be closed and money going to schools for buildings they do not need and have not asked for. This shambles is yet another example of a Labor government great at talking and absolutely hopeless at delivering anything.
These examples merely reinforce Labor’s incompetence, spending $40 million in stimulus cheques to 16,000 deceased estates and 27,000 people overseas. I think on any view, Mr Deputy President, you would have to admit that these people would be highly unlikely to be spending the money in Australia as intended. Obviously this denotes haste, it denotes panic and it denotes a government so desperate to react to what it perceives as a crisis that it could not take time to simply get it right. Australians have every right to question why Australia is now in deep debt—at least $315 billion—and why there is a need to pay interest of $12 billion per annum for such massive borrowings. What we see is reckless spending with nothing concrete to show for it, nothing permanent—millions and millions wasted. Eighteen months ago Australia had no debt and cash in the bank. Now Labor has plunged Australia back onto the debt treadmill. (Time expired)

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2009-06-15,"—Not only are the opposition climate change deniers; they are also global financial crisis deniers. They do not want to recognise that the financial markets are in turmoil—that there is a global financial crisis plunging other major nations into huge debt and massive restructuring of their financial markets. No, they want to do nothing. They want to sit back on their past glories, fuelled by the resource boom, and do nothing. They want to do nothing when there has been a write-down in revenues in Australia of $210 billion, which is the most extensive write-down confronted by an Australian government since 1931. They would sit back and do nothing in the face of that, and the Australian economy would go down the tube with them. So it is a very happy circumstance that at the last election the Australian population voted in a Labor government that is able to take the strong, necessary and decisive measures to ensure that our economy holds up well in the face of the global financial crisis.
The opposition come in here, deny that there is a financial crisis and do not put up any solutions to what might happen but instead want to nitpick and try and find every single small problem. They are saying that nothing needs to be done—that the Labor government is spending billions on nothing. Nothing? What we are doing is putting in place a tiered system through which that first tranche of money went to short-term payments to people and helped prop up the retail sector, the economy and jobs. The intermediate tier is happening right now. That decisive action by the government has allowed, in a short space of time, for those jobs to be rolled out and for those funds to be put into schools. I think Senator Coonan said they were ‘buildings they don’t need’. Schools were neglected for nearly 12 years by the Howard government. They are desperate for funding, desperate for buildings and desperate for upgrades. They are very grateful for this money that is coming into their system at last—at long last. How can you say that schools do not need science and language centres? How can you say that they do not need that money put in? No school that I have been to would say: ‘We do not need any money for buildings. Our local communities do not need jobs in putting up these buildings.’
Finally, there is the funding for long-term infrastructure that was also neglected under the Howard government. It is for roads, rail and ports—the infrastructure that, in opposition, Labor were crying out for during the Howard government’s term and which was ignored. That is what we will spend billions of dollars on. It will not only support jobs and our economy but also build infrastructure for the future that will assist productivity, which went down, down, down during the Howard government’s term. That is what we are doing. What would the opposition do? Probably what Senator McGauran has advised in respect of the wholesale funding guarantee. Against the strong and ongoing advice of the regional banks, who are using the guarantee widely, Senator McGauran’s advice is that the markets will sort it out. That is what he said to the Courier Mail today. He said, ‘Oh, let the market sort it out.’ That is exactly why the popularity of the Rudd Labor government is holding up. It is because people see that the Liberal opposition have no solution whatsoever. They would stand back and let the financial turmoil happening overseas infect Australia. Instead, we have an economy that is now looking forward to a future in which jobs are holding up and in which growth is a possibility—instead of a recession and the kinds of deficits that are hitting major industrialised countries elsewhere.

"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2009-06-15,"—I would like to contribute to this debate on interest rates and say how extremely disappointed I am about what has happened since September 2008, a period when we have seen a 2.4 per cent reduction in official rates by the Reserve Bank. We know that times are tough, especially in rural and regional areas of Australia. We know that drought has been around in many areas since January 2002. I find it very alarming that we now see upward pressure on interest rates and I believe, from a good source of knowledge, that tomorrow Westpac will announce a rise in their home loan interest rates, following on from the Commonwealth Bank today. But the most disappointing thing I have seen is that, no doubt, the government has put a lot of pressure on the banks to lower interest rates for home loan borrowers. I was privileged to talk to David Bell, who represents the Australian Bankers Association, and we discussed this very issue. He made it quite clear that the government has put a lot of pressure on the banks to pass on those reductions in interest rates over those months—as I said, from last September being the big falls.
The question is: what pressure did the government put on the banks to reduce interest rates for small business and farmers? The answer to that is none. I talk to farmers who are paying 11.5 per cent on overdrafts totally secured with real assets, as in land. How can these people recover from the tough times that they are going through, from the drought to the high input cost to many farmers and the way that those reductions in moneys affect the regional communities, where the small businesses suffer as their sales are down? Yet they are paying high interest rates because the government has failed to put the same pressure on our banks to pass those rates onto small business and farmers. This is a very alarming situation, when we see official rates of three per cent and we see people in business trying to survive, many of them competing on world markets—such as our agricultural producers, our farmers, do—and relying on exports of food. They are paying 10, 11 and 12 per cent interest rates. I think that is just an utter disgrace.
The government are great at beating their chests about how they are doing this, that and everything else to stimulate the economy, but the real stimulation should be directed at those in the private sector. As I have said before, it is the private sector that drives the nation’s wealth. It is small business, including the farm sector, that is paying through the nose on interest rates today. The government have failed dismally to put any pressure on the banks to forward those reductions—in other words, the banks are surviving on the high interest rates to the people they lend to.
I touch on the underwriting of the bank investments that Senator Hurley referred to a minute ago. It has been very obvious that the credit unions are now calling for the removal of the bank guarantee. Those small institutions are paying more for their premiums to have that guarantee. Here is a problem in itself where the competition simply cannot be put in place. It is unfair because we have smaller competitors such as our credit unions, which are out there in many rural and regional areas, doing the best they can but failing to compete against the big banks, who are obviously paying smaller premiums for the underwriting of their investments. This again is a huge problem, because we see the big boy at the big end of town with an advantage over the small one at the small end of town. As a National I am very proud to represent and bat for the small business people—the people who battled through all sorts of tight conditions and tough times, the people who worked long hours, often for low wages, no superannuation and very few holidays. They are the people who are battling now and they are the people whom this government has failed to look after.
As I said, they have not put any downward pressure on interest rates for the banks to do that for small businesses and farmers. It is a disgrace. It is holding the economy back. The more these small businesses and farmers have to pay in interest, the less money they have to keep people employed. The government wonders why unemployment is on the rise. We are looking at more than a million Australians unemployed next year. That is in the budget forecast of the government. They should do something positive and pass on a strong message that those interest rate reductions should be passed on to small business and farmers, not just to home borrowers.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2009-06-15,"—I rise to participate in this debate on taking note of answers. I note at the outset that a number of issues were canvassed during question time. I want to touch on a couple of them, but I begin with the issue of interest rates, which Senator Williams has just spoken about. I respect Senator Williams. I think he is a person with genuine concern for the rural constituency, but I have to say that the speech he has just made was one that could have been made—and, I am sure, was made—by members of the Labor Party in opposition in the last 12 months of the Howard government. Why do I say that? Let’s remember. The opposition sits here today and lectures us about interest rates because the Commonwealth Bank have just announced an increase in their mortgage rates, but it was under the Howard government that there were eight increases in interest rates in a row. The situation that we inherited when we came to office in November 2007 was a treadmill of interest rate rises; every couple of months they were going up again as a result of the decisions of the Reserve Bank being followed by the banks.
Those eight interest rate rises were the opposition’s legacy to us. There was even one during the election campaign—something that was unheard of—because it was clear that at that time the Reserve Bank saw no alternative but to raise interest rates again. We had to confront that reality in the first few months of our term of office. After the first few months that we were in office, interest rates declined. They have done so steadily throughout most of the period that we have been in government. To say that the Labor government is pushing up interest rates is completely incorrect. Senator Coonan asked this question initially, and I recall Senator Coonan interjecting, saying, ‘What are we doing about it? What are we doing about it?’ I find this argument from the opposition somewhat strange because, as was quoted by Senator Hurley, it is Senator McGauran who has the view—no doubt reflecting the view of the vast majority, if not all, of that Liberal Party—that the market should decide. In other words, government should stay out of trying to inject activity into the economy to deal with the global financial crisis. The Liberal Party view is that you do not need a stimulus package; you just let the market decide. But over in cockies corner the National Party has a different view, which is that government should hop in wherever it can to prop up their sector—which I acknowledge is doing it tough.
The other point I make is that throughout the period of the Howard-Costello government the current opposition constantly pointed to their economic record of removing debt and so on. What happened with private debt in this country? It exploded. It increased and increased as more and more people built up debt at high interest rates of 17 and 18 per cent on their MasterCards, Visa cards, Amex cards and all the other cards. That was the real debt that was incurred by the Australian people. While you can wax lyrical about government debt, the real debt that was crippling a lot of people in this country was on credit cards. That legacy remains. Then the opposition have the hide to criticise our economic stimulus package because some people might have used it to pay off part of their credit card. There are a lot of other issues. We had Senator Fisher raising award modernisation. Frankly, that is a joke. The record of the National Farmers Federation, which Senator Fisher worked for, as I recall, is one that opposed even superannuation for farm workers. They did not want farm workers to have access to superannuation. Fortunately, that was a fight that we won. On all of these issues and many more you are just—(Time expired)

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-06-15,"—I rise to support Senator Coonan’s motion. Today we are seeing Australian families paying a very, very high price for Kevin Rudd’s and Labor’s reckless spending.
—Order! You must refer to the Prime Minister by his proper title.
—They are paying for the Prime Minister’s and his Labor government’s reckless spending and rapidly rising debt. Labor’s budget is the first in a decade to increase the burden on Australian families, with a record debt of $315 billion—and, of course, that does not include the potential extra debt that could be created by the Ruddbank and Labor’s $43 billion broadband excursion—and a record $58 billion deficit. We also will have one million unemployed by 2010-11, private health insurance rebates being attacked—meaning longer waiting lists and higher costs for all Australians—and the cutting by a third of the superannuation co-contribution scheme, which bolstered the retirement savings of low and middle income earners. Australians will need to work much longer to pay off all this debt. This reckless economic mismanagement will hurt Australian families. This budget reveals the high price that will be paid.
Labor are doing what they always do best, which is racking up debt and splashing the red ink about. They certainly are doing it at a record rate. With this debt to surge to $315 billion, the Rudd government will make even the Gough Whitlam and Paul Keating governments look fiscally responsible. Two-thirds of net public debt will be due to spending decisions taken by the Rudd government over the past 18 months. Since the November 2007 election, Labor have announced new spending of $124 billion, an average of $225 million per spending day. It took the coalition $9 billion worth of interest and about eight years to pay off $96 billion of Labor’s debt. Just think how long it is going to take for us to pay off $315 billion. And that is assuming it stays at $315 billion. Knowing the track record of Labor governments, that $315 billion is only the starting point; it is going to get higher and higher.
We have had the feigned outrage of Mr Swan and Mr Rudd in their complaints about the interest rate increase, but they are directly responsible for it. If this government is going to go out and borrow $3 billion a week, it is inevitably going to put upward pressure on interest rates. The decision by the Commonwealth Bank was just the beginning. The government is borrowing record amounts of money in competition with the major banks and as a result the cost of money is inevitably going to rise. You cannot continue with low interest rates while the Australian government is borrowing billions of dollars a week in order to hand out the $900 cheques. Senator Hurley was talking about the so-called spending in Australia. Might I remind her that there are about 514,000 nonresidents who are also eligible to get the $900, and millions of dollars just left these shores because Centrelink could not be bothered asking the Department of Immigration and Citizenship who these people were and thereby at least saving us some money on that front. Mr Rudd and Mr Swan will voice their displeasure, yet what are they going to do about it? Absolutely nothing.
Before I conclude, I would like to say a couple of things about New South Wales. New South Wales was plundered and pillaged and, of course, the architects of that plundering and pillaging were Senator Arbib and all his New South Wales Right mates. They have abandoned ship in New South Wales and are going to do federally what they did to New South Wales, which is to send it into a record state debt that is going to cost a staggering $30,000 per household—an absolute and utter disgrace.

I refer to the Banking Amendment Regulations 2008 (No. 2) and the Insurance Amendment Regulations 2008 (No. 2) that make provision for the Financial Claims Scheme.
The definition of ‘explanatory statement’ in section 4 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 requires an explanatory statement to describe the nature of any consultation that has been carried out or, if there has been no consultation, to explain why none was undertaken. The Committee’s consideration of these regulations identified the following concerns with regard to the adequacy of the consultation information provided in the explanatory statements.
Banking Amendment Regulations 2008 (No. 2), Select Legislative Instrument 2008 No. 280
The Explanatory Statement that accompanies these Regulations makes no reference to consultation. The Committee therefore seeks your advice on whether consultation was undertaken and, if so, the nature of that consultation. The Committee also seeks an assurance that future explanatory statements will provide information on consultation as required by the Legislative Instruments Act.
Insurance Amendment Regulations 2008 (No. 2), Select Legislative Instrument 2008 No. 281
The Explanatory Statement that accompanies this instrument notes that there was only limited consultation due to the urgency of the amendments. The Committee therefore seeks further explanation about the nature of this limited consultation.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 6 March 2009, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Wortley
Thank you for your letter of 5 February 2009 concerning explanatory statement requirements for the financial claims scheme regulations. I apologise for the delay in replying to you.
I note that section 18 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 lists circumstances where consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate. One of these circumstances includes where an instrument is required as a matter of urgency.
The Banking Amendment Regulations 2008 (No. 2) and the Insurance Amendment Regulations 2008 (No. 2) were required to make the practical aspects of the financial claims scheme workable. The Financial Sector (Financial Claims Scheme and other Measures) Act 2008 was legislated as a matter of urgency in October 2008 to provide confidence to depositors and policyholders. Because the financial claims scheme could not have been fully operational until regulations were in place, it was considered inappropriate to delay making the regulations for reason of consultation.
In relation to both the banking and insurance regulations, Treasury had previously consulted with the authorised deposit-taking institution and insurance sectors on the broad parameters of the financial claims scheme.
No industry consultation was undertaken in either case in relation to the regulations to which the explanatory statement refers although the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority was consulted on drafts of these regulations.
I trust this information will be of assistance to the committee. Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Wortley
Thank you for your letter dated 5 February.2009 (your reference 2/2009) on the distinction between the Tiger Airways and Qantas Airways Instruments.
Firstly, let me reiterate that the safety of the travelling public remains the Australian Government’s highest priority.
The reason for the distinction is that Qantas Airways found that it would not be able to comply with the standard exemption instrument when carrying very small passenger loads. For example, the instrument does not allow flights when carrying less than eight passengers. Instead of cancelling those flights, Qantas Airways approached the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) with a proposal to amend the instrument specifically for flights carrying less than eight passengers in emergency exit rows. On reviewing the Qantas Airways proposal, CASA decided that Qantas Airways’ guidance to the cabin attendants on the location of passengers in the emergency exit rows did not result in a decrease in passenger safety, and issued the instrument.
Tiger Airways has not notified CASA that it cannot comply with the conditions on the current instrument regarding passenger numbers in emergency exit row seats. We conclude that, while Qantas Airways wanted the flexibility to continue to operate with very small passenger numbers, Tiger Airways’ business model means that they would probably not operate such flights.
I trust this information addresses your concerns. Yours sincerely

CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister
I refer to Instrument No. CASA 51/09 made under regulation 208 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988. This instrument permits certain aircraft operated by Macair Airlines Pty Ltd to be operated with one flight attendant.
The Committee notes that the Explanatory Statement indicates that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) consulted ‘within CASA and with Macair Airlines’ prior to making this instrument. Notwithstanding the consultation with the airline, it is not clear how consultation by a rule-maker with itself meets the requirement of section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. It is also unclear what consultation ‘within CASA’ means.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 13 March 2009, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this instrument. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament I louse, Canberra.
Yours sincerely
Senator Dana Wortley Chair

Dear Senator Wortley
Thank you for your letter dated 12 February 2009 (your reference 19/2009) on the process of consultation for making of instruments under section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA).
Section 17 of that Act states that before a rule-maker makes a legislative instrument, and particularly where the proposed instrument is likely to have a direct, or a substantial indirect, effect on business; or restrict competition, the rule-maker must be satisfied that any consultation that is considered by the rule-maker to he appropriate and that is reasonably practicable to undertake, has been undertaken. In determining whether any consultation that was undertaken is appropriate, the rule-maker may have regard to any relevant matter, including the extent to which the consultation drew on the knowledge of persons having expertise in fields relevant to the proposed instrument and ensure that persons likely to he affected by the proposed instrument had an adequate opportunity to comment on its proposed content.
In relation to the instrument for Macair Airlines Pty Ltd, it is CASA’s view that this instrument would not have a direct, or a substantial indirect, effect on business or restrict competition. Therefore, section 17 was complied with by external consultation only, that is, with the operator affected by the instrument.
Whilst it was unnecessary for CASA to state in the Explanatory Statement that it consulted “within CASA,” the fact it was stated does not affect CASA’s compliance with section 17, but simply records that persons having expertise within CASA in fields relevant to the proposed instrument were consulted.
Yours sincerely
Anthony Albanese
Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government

Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
These Amendment Regulations insert new regulation 111 into the principal Regulations which creates the strict liability offence of handling a refrigerant.
Paragraph 111 (2xb) defines the phrase ‘handle a refrigerant’ to include the situation where a person manufactures, installs, commissions, services or maintains refrigeration or air conditioning equipment even where there is no refrigerant present.
It thus appears that a person can be liable for the strict liability offence created by subregulation 111 (1) relating to handling a refrigerant even where they do not handle a refrigerant because no refrigerant is present.

That the Senate take note of the document.
I want to respond briefly to the Prime Minister’s statement, which was tabled in the Senate a short while ago, deploring the violence against Indian students in Melbourne. I visited India as a child, I have visited India several times since then and I am travelling there again in a fortnight or so. I want to put a couple of comments on the record. India is an extraordinary country. It is, in fact, the world’s largest democracy. It has a unique and important contribution to make to the world community of peoples. Of course all efforts, including the Prime Minister’s statement, which seek to stigmatise racial violence are urgently needed and very welcome. We need to send a strong and clear message from the top that racist attacks, racial vilification and racial discrimination are not acceptable in Australian society. I note also that the Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, joined in support of the Prime Minister’s statement—although he somehow could not resist working into his speech a reference to uranium exports, which is a truly random bit of speech writing. Nonetheless, the comments on racism from the country’s leadership are extremely welcome.
The Prime Minister characterised Australia as a country of harmony and tolerance. While that is certainly a very relevant and appropriate goal, I think it is more of a welcome aspiration than an accurate description of Australia as we find it today. We have a very long way to go in this country. Racist attitudes and beliefs are visible and present in our culture, which systematically values and devalues certain groups and certain contributions. The apology last February from the current government addressed a shockingly racist chapter in our history which is obviously still not closed. Quite apart from the racist laws of the past and the behaviour of the present, we also have a form of structural racism that is revealed when you look at the photographs of everyone who sits in this chamber. Our parliament does not represent the diversity of Australian society—that is quite simple—it does not represent the gender make-up of our society and it certainly does not accurately represent the cultural background of Australian society. Australia needs to work to address racism, which is why it would have been a good idea to participate in the review conference of the UN’s World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance. Australia is a member of the United Nations. That means we should participate and be involved and engaged—or else you cannot decide whether we are part of the international community. A smorgasbord approach to these sorts of conferences is simply not appropriate.
In the global efforts to identify, analyse, understand and eliminate racism, Australia has been missing. We have not participated in the global agreement to achieve real changes for the millions of victims of racism and racial discrimination. We should not pretend that mistreatment of overseas students is a recent phenomenon either. Overseas students, as we know, bring a lot of revenue to this country—they have been seen as something of a cash cow—but we know that insufficient services and support are provided in turn. I would like to acknowledge the work of my colleague Sarah Hanson-Young, who has taken a very strong interest in this issue since its most recent manifestation hit the front pages in Victoria.
The Australian Greens support the Prime Minister’s statement on this issue. We call on the government to address the challenges faced by overseas students. I also call on the government to rejoin the United Nations in its work to fight racism. Australia should not have absented itself from the UN conference when quite obviously we have issues of racism to deal with here at home. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to make a statement.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2009-06-15,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I have pleasure in presenting the committee’s report entitled Inquiry into the Immigration Bridge proposal. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Since its inception, Canberra has been designed with the highest ideals in mind. Its design elements are unique and it is home to some of the most distinctive landscape design and architecture in the country. Canberra, as our national capital, is the chosen location to commemorate aspects of our democracy and our history. The Immigration Bridge Australia proposal seeks to commemorate the contribution that migrants have made to Australia. The proposed 400-metre bridge would, if successful, cross Lake Burley Griffin in the area of West Basin, linking the National Museum of Australia with the Parliamentary Zone at Lennox Gardens.
While the objective of recognising the contribution migrants have made to Australia’s development is worthy, the proposal to build a bridge in this location has provoked concerns from many in the community. In view of this, the committee was pleased to receive the reference from former Minister Debus to inquire into the Immigration Bridge proposal. The committee had been made aware of the proposal through evidence at previous inquiries, and it was clear that there was some confusion within the community about the status of the proposal, the works approval process and the method adopted by Immigration Bridge Australia to raise funds for the construction of the bridge. The confusion in the community has been exacerbated by the television advertising and sale of family plaques on the History Handrail of the proposed bridge despite the actual design of the bridge not being available and a development application for the bridge not yet having been submitted to the National Capital Authority.
This report traverses the history of the proposal from its roots in the vision by migrant workers from the Snowy Mountains to commemorate the contribution of migrants to Australia’s development, including the role that the National Capital Authority has played over the years in supporting this proposal and the amendment that inserted the footbridge into the National Capital Plan as part of the Griffin Legacy amendments. The report also details the final development approval process and required statutory consultation measures, including heritage assessment, that will ultimately determine whether or not the bridge proposal proceeds in its current form, in a different form, in a different location or not at all. Not surprisingly, the bridge proposal raised passionate views both for and against, but a uniting sentiment was that the national capital was the appropriate location for commemorating the contribution of Australia’s migrants.
The committee’s objective was never to adjudicate on whether the Immigration Bridge ought to proceed or not. What the report does is to provide clarity into how the proposal got to this point and what checks and balances are in place as the organisation of Immigration Bridge Australia moves towards making a development application to the National Capital Authority. The committee received over 80 submissions, and there is now increased awareness of the consultation processes as the IBA—Immigration Bridge Australia—advances its proposal.
The committee made three recommendations, which, if implemented, will improve aspects of this process. First, Immigration Bridge Australia, in improving its transparency and accountability, should clarify its refund policy to contributors in order to make sure that, if the project does not proceed, people understand the nature of the investment and whether they will get their money back. The committee has recommended that IBA make its financial documents available on its website in the interests of accountability and transparency.
The committee also recommends that if the proposal proceeds and the bridge, as is currently suggested, is ceded to the Commonwealth then the government should ensure that agreement to receive the bridge is met by an appropriate level of government funding to make sure that the National Capital Authority is in a position to manage its ongoing maintenance. Thanks to an Audit Office report, we are all aware of the situation of the ongoing pressures on the National Capital Authority in having the appropriate resources to manage national capital assets, and that audit report informed this recommendation.
The last recommendation encourages Immigration Bridge Australia to reconcile the competing issues relating to lake users, as well as the vista and heritage values of Lake Burley Griffin and its foreshores. If Immigration Bridge Australia finds that this challenge cannot be met or their development application for the proposed bridge is unsuccessful then Immigration Bridge Australia should, in the committee’s view, consider changing the location of the bridge or propose an alternative memorial to migration.
These three recommendations, we believe, will not only increase the accountability and transparency that the committee believes is necessary but provide the clarity that I think many in the community have been seeking about the current status of this bridge. It is not a fait accompli; it has very formal and specific approval processes yet to be gone through. The committee notes the commitment by Immigration Bridge Australia to spend the better part of the next two years, as they have foreshadowed, in consulting extensively with the community above and beyond the statutory consultation requirements. In conclusion and on behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all of the groups, organisations and individuals who contributed to this inquiry, and I would also like to extend my thanks to the hardworking staff of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>National Capital and External Territories Committee</title>,Committees,20,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2009-06-15,"—I also rise to welcome the tabling of this report and to adopt the comments of the chair of the committee, Senator Lundy, with respect to the process which has been undertaken in this matter. As she points out, this was not an inquiry into either the concept of a bridge across Lake Burley Griffin at approximately that position or the particular design that the bridge, if it goes ahead, ought to adopt. The reason is that one is in the past—that is, the concept of a bridge at that point in the lake has already been determined and decided by the National Capital Authority, back in 2006—and the specific question of the design of a bridge is yet to be considered; the proponents are not yet ready to bring that proposal on for specific consideration. But I have to say that, as one listened to the submissions made and the witnesses who presented to this inquiry, one had to come to the conclusion that many proceeded on the basis that we were indeed inquiring into just those things. This is based on an unfortunate tendency of some people to reject any notion of change in the appearance of Canberra.
The recommendations of the report, as Senator Lundy has indicated, suggest that the proponents of the Immigration Bridge proposal attempt to reconcile the concerns—about the heritage value of the lake and so on—of lake users, particularly rowers and sailors, with their plans before they proceed to the design stage. I warmly support that recommendation. But I have to say that those who have made submissions hesitant about or even critical of the proposal to build the bridge across the lake ignore a number of important considerations. First of all, it is worth pointing out that the Immigration Bridge proposal is a community driven endeavour to create a major new monument of national significance in our national capital. I welcome the community based decision here to drive and to fund this new monument in the middle of the national capital. It is a refreshing approach to the architecture and design of our city that it should be a community initiated proposal rather than one initiated by government, as is usually the case.
The second point I want to make is that the monument will honour the contribution of migrants to modern Australia. There is at present no such monument within the national capital, a city which itself has been substantially built by people from overseas. It is a great omission in the design and layout of the national capital and it should be rectified. A proposal as grand and visionary as this is an appropriate response to that need.
The third point is that the Immigration Bridge proposal and the Immigration Bridge Australia proponents have properly prosecuted the case for their proposal through the appropriate stages. They have sought and obtained a variation to the National Capital Plan to allow the concept of a bridge over the lake to occur at this point. They have sought and obtained cross-party support from the federal parliament and from state parliaments for the concept of a bridge of this kind. They are seeking public donations but they have held off on the major push for public support for the bridge until the design of the bridge has been completed and presented for approval in the appropriate way. They appropriately have not committed to a design as yet because they wish to ensure that they have got the best possible design to address the sorts of issues that were raised during the inquiry. They suggest that a design competition might be possible to make this happen.
The other point which I think is overlooked by many people in this debate is that the bridge lies on the site of a proposed bridge actually envisaged by Walter Burley Griffin himself. On page 12 of the committee report one can see, though not very clearly, the winning design submitted by Walter Burley Griffin, and it contained a bridge at approximately that point across the lake. So those who generally rely on the vision of Walter Burley Griffin as a bible for Canberra’s planning in some cases seem to have abandoned that consideration when it comes to considering whether a bridge on this location is appropriate in these circumstances. In my view it clearly is within the vision foreshadowed by Walter Burley Griffin.
My appeal to the community is to give this proposal a fair go. This proposal is a bold, imaginative idea which will see ordinary Australians driving the construction of a new national monument in their national capital. That is a community based approach which we have not seen in the past with respect to the creation and development of our national capital. I welcome it very warmly. If it succeeds, it will be the biggest community initiated investment and community funded investment in the history of Canberra. We should not lightly turn such an investment in the national capital aside.
It does not need to be held back by people who apparently cannot see the wood for the trees. I say that quite deliberately because, frankly, some of the arguments that were put forward to the inquiry suggesting that there was not a need for a bridge or that the bridge was inappropriate in some way relied on arguments that bordered on the absurd. We heard, for example, that winds at that point in the lake would be too strong and people would be frightened to cross the lake when winds of that kind were blowing. Apparently people are not affected by those winds a few hundred metres away at the Commonwealth Bridge. Children would be unable to sail up to the Captain Cook fountain if the bridge went ahead, according to another witness. A third argued that the bridge would be a haven for crime. I reject all of those suggestions. I think we fail to appreciate the grandeur of the vision that has been put forward when we resort to such arguments.
This is a proposal which deserves to have its day in court, and its day in court is in effect consideration of a design proposal by the National Capital Authority when the proponents are appropriately funded and in a position to bring such a design forward. No-one should interpret the report of the joint standing committee as any kind of repudiation of that approach. Indeed, the committee quite expressly understands that it is the way in which the proposal should proceed and it is appropriate for the idea to be considered on its merits when the time comes and not be pre-judged before that point.

So those who generally rely on the vision of Walter Burley Griffin as a bible for Canberra’s planning in some cases seem to have abandoned that consideration when it comes to considering whether a bridge on this location is appropriate in these circumstances. In my view it clearly is within the vision foreshadowed by Walter Burley Griffin.
My appeal to the community is to give this proposal a fair go. This proposal is a bold, imaginative idea which will see ordinary Australians driving the construction of a new national monument in their national capital. That is a community based approach which we have not seen in the past with respect to the creation and development of our national capital. I welcome it very warmly. If it succeeds, it will be the biggest community initiated investment and community funded investment in the history of Canberra. We should not lightly turn such an investment in the national capital aside.
It does not need to be held back by people who apparently cannot see the wood for the trees. I say that quite deliberately because, frankly, some of the arguments that were put forward to the inquiry suggesting that there was not a need for a bridge or that the bridge was inappropriate in some way relied on arguments that bordered on the absurd. We heard, for example, that winds at that point in the lake would be too strong and people would be frightened to cross the lake when winds of that kind were blowing. Apparently people are not affected by those winds a few hundred metres away at the Commonwealth Bridge. Children would be unable to sail up to the Captain Cook fountain if the bridge went ahead, according to another witness. A third argued that the bridge would be a haven for crime. I reject all of those suggestions. I think we fail to appreciate the grandeur of the vision that has been put forward when we resort to such arguments.
This is a proposal which deserves to have its day in court, and its day in court is in effect consideration of a design proposal by the National Capital Authority when the proponents are appropriately funded and in a position to bring such a design forward. No-one should interpret the report of the joint standing committee as any kind of repudiation of that approach. Indeed, the committee quite expressly understands that it is the way in which the proposal should proceed and it is appropriate for the idea to be considered on its merits when the time comes and not be pre-judged before that point.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,20,2
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2009-06-15,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Audit report No. 34 of 2008-09: The Australian Taxation Office’s management of serious non-compliance. This is a very important report by the Audit Office and it refers to the fact that in 2007-08 the Taxation Office collected tax and excise revenues of $278.6 billion and made related payments of $9.6 billion. It notes that the tax office aims to achieve a high level of voluntary compliance with Australia’s tax laws. It also refers to the importance of responding to fraud and serious evasion and it notes that noncompliance in the form of fraud and serious evasion against the Commonwealth has the potential if left unchecked to undermine community confidence in Australia’s taxation system and reduce voluntary compliance levels.
This confidence in the tax system and the government’s overall management of our economy concerns me greatly. In an answer to a question on notice from me and others, the federal Commissioner of Taxation has released some information which is now on the public record. It confirms that the Rudd Labor government’s cash splash is both indiscriminate and reckless. The federal Commissioner of Taxation confirmed that the tax bonus payments had been paid to 15,934 dead people and 27,252 Australians living overseas, totalling an estimated $40 million. With regard to the former, the tax commissioner noted that 47,111 deceased estates had lodged a tax return in the 2007-08 year. The answer was as at that time, so we do not know exactly how many deceased estates will benefit from the tax bonus payments which have been and will be paid by the government under their plans. We know the figures for a couple of weeks ago, and the numbers are obviously rising.
What we do know is that there are over 27,000 Australians living overseas who will receive this funding. The government’s objective for this package and the tax bonus payments was to strengthen the Australian economy, not overseas economies. Which overseas destinations benefited most? The United Kingdom benefited, with 20 per cent of the payments; New Zealand, with 19 per cent; Ireland, with seven per cent; Canada, with six per cent; Germany, with five per cent; France, Korea, the United States and Japan, with four per cent each; Brazil, with three per cent; and other countries with three per cent. This is all noted in that response to the question put to the federal Commissioner of Taxation. Those countries will receive an estimated $24.5 million. As I say, those figures are correct as of a couple of weeks ago and they will no doubt go up. That means that an estimated $38.8 million, nearly $40 million, of payments designed to stimulate the Australian economy have been paid to deceased estates and those living overseas.
What else have we learnt from this answer to the question on notice and to other investigations during budget estimates? The Department of Immigration and Citizenship disclosed and confirmed that up to 540,921 non-Australian residents as at 30 June 2008 may be eligible for the Rudd government’s $900 tax bonus payment. The department confirmed that 540,921 non-Australian residents have temporary visas with work rights, including 134,238 temporary skilled workers on 457 visas, 317,897 international students, 86,558 working holiday-makers and 2,228 work and holiday visa holders, but, sadly, the government appears unable to identify how many of these nonresidents have received or will receive the tax bonus. This question must be answered by the government. As far as I and those on this side of the chamber are concerned, the government must disclose exactly how many of those non-Australian residents have received or will receive the tax bonus. This confirms again that the government’s handling of the economy is reckless, indiscriminate and certainly wasteful. It highlights the mismanagement and maladministration of our economy. If only one in 10 of those eligible meet the criterion and receive the tax bonus, that could mean up to another $48 million in payments to nonresidents, which could then go overseas. These are the concerns we have. The community is clearly paying the price now for Labor’s reckless and indiscriminate spending.
We have also had confirmed by the federal Commissioner of Taxation that criminals in prison have received and will be receiving the tax bonus. That is on the public record. What perhaps is not clear to the community but has also been made clear in the last few days is that some millionaires have received multiple payments of this $900 tax bonus under the tax bonus scheme. We would like to know how many millionaires have received the tax bonus payments and, in each case, how many tax bonus payments they received. Was it two, three, four, five? We have been advised that there were multiple tax bonus payments to one millionaire in particular. We would like to know exactly how many payments have been made to these millionaires and, indeed, how this is possible. We would like the government to come clean and make it clear.
These are the questions that need to be answered. We have put them on the record, and the government has to come clean. We know that we are all now paying the price for the government’s reckless spending, and we say enough is enough. They have to come clean and answer these questions so that we are all in the know. Enough is enough.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE JOINT COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT REPORT 412 – RECOMMENDATIONS 11 AND 12

Recommendation 11 (p.126 of JCPAA Report 412)

The Committee recommends that, in an effort to minimise inefficient use of legal services, PM&C, Finance, and any other relevant bodies, implement monitoring systems to ensure that legal advices obtained by agencies, with implications broader than that specific agency’s circumstances, are appropriately distributed to other relevant government agencies.

Accepted.

The Legal Services Directions 2005, issued by the Attorney-General under section 55ZF of the Judiciary Act 1903 establish a framework to maximise the efficient use of legal services as well as reducing the risk that legal advice is inconsistent or does not address whole of government and public interest issues.  For example:
An agency must ensure arrangements concerning legal services deliver efficient and effective services.  See paragraph 1 of the Directions.
Agencies must report to the Office of Legal Services Coordination on significant issues arising in the provision of legal services, especially in relation to claims and litigation.  See paragraph 3 of the Directions.
Where legal advice is sought on legislation administered by another agency, the administering agency must generally be consulted before advice is requested.  See paragraph 10 of the Directions.  This provision prevents agencies obtaining unnecessary or duplicate advice.  It also facilitates consistency across government in statutory interpretation.
Core areas of government legal work such as constitutional, cabinet, national security and public international law work are tied to the Australian Government Solicitor and the Attorney-General’s Department.  See Appendix A of the Directions.  This means that significant legal opinions provided on these issues are readily available to AGS and the Department.
There are special arrangements for constitutional advice.  Agencies must provide a copy of a request for advice on a constitutional law issue to the Secretary of the Attorney-General’s Department.  The Australian Government Solicitor must provide a copy of any advice it gives on a constitutional law issue to the Attorney-General’s Department.  This enables the Department to monitor constitutional issues, coordinate requests for advice across agencies and avoid unnecessary duplication. See paragraph 10A of the Directions.
Agency chief executives have specific responsibilities concerning the handling of legal services and compliance with the Directions.  See paragraph 11 of the Directions. An annual compliance certificate must be provided to OLSC.
The Directions are a legislative instrument and have the force of law.  Sanctions can be imposed for non-compliance.  They apply to Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 agencies and, to a lesser extent, to Commonwealth agencies regulated by the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997.  
The OLSC conducts ongoing education and monitoring to ensure government agencies comply with their obligations under the Directions. 

Recommendation 12 (p.126 of JCPAA Report 412 )

The Committee recommends that PM&C and Finance establish a repository of legal advices obtained by government agencies, for use by all government bodies where practicable.

Not accepted.

The Australian government legal services market comprises close to 200 departments, agencies and other bodies.  A government agency may obtain legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor, a private sector law firm or an in-house lawyer.  For certain matters, an agency will obtain advice from the Attorney-General’s Department, the Solicitor-General or may directly brief counsel from the private bar.
There is currently a database that gives the Attorney-General’s Department, the Australian Government Solicitor, the Solicitor-General and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel access to each other’s legal opinions. 
To implement the Committee’s recommendation would require all legal services providers to the Commonwealth to contribute to a repository (database) and would give all government bodies (and by extension their legal representatives, who may be government or private sector) access to that database.
This raises financial, technical and practical concerns.  The costs of establishing and maintaining a database and the risks it would create, particularly regarding access and undue reliance, outweigh the benefits that could accrue from its establishment.
In purely financial terms, it is questionable whether the costs of establishing and maintaining a Commonwealth-wide opinions database would be matched by reduced legal costs of government bodies seeking legal advice.  This analysis is based on experience relating to the costs involved in the upgrade and maintenance of the existing legal opinions database referred to above.
Technical concerns primarily relate to quality control, that is, which advices would be included in, or excluded from, the database and who would be responsible for making the decision to include or exclude an advice.  Who would determine when an advice was superseded or should be removed in the face of conflicting advice?  These issues arise with the existing legal opinions database, but would be more difficult to resolve if multiple users from different organisations were submitting advice. 
The integrity and technical security of the database, for example in relation to password protection, access controls and unauthorised forwarding of contents is also of concern and the risks would be compounded if multiple users from different organisations were granted access to the database.
Practical concerns relate to the specific nature and type of advice sought by agencies.  Legal advice databases carry a risk of over reliance or inappropriate application of previous advice to different factual contexts.  Reference to previous advice and precedents in the course of researching a legal issue can be useful but there is no substitute for a government agency obtaining its own legal advice on an issue.
The participation of private sector legal providers in the Commonwealth market means that it is inevitable some firms will at times act against the Commonwealth.  This intensifies the potential for users to have a conflict of interest.  It would be difficult to establish access controls or firewalls that would prevent a legal service provider who is, or may in future act against the Commonwealth from accessing advices for reasons other than performing work for the Commonwealth.
It would be resource intensive to ensure that legal advices included in the repository were appropriately amended to protect privacy and confidentiality.  Access to advices that touched on constitutional, cabinet or national security matters would need to be restricted.  There are numerous other examples of advices that would not be suitable for broad access by all government bodies or their legal service providers.  For example, publication of opinions that relate to the corporate governance of a department or management of Commonwealth litigation could inappropriately prejudice the legitimate interests of the Commonwealth.  The need to edit advices, suppress publication and restrict access within the database would limit the capacity of the database to serve as a broad ranging and comprehensive legal resource.
Finally, the protection of legal professional privilege would also be problematic.  There is a risk that allowing broad access to third parties may deprive legal advice of the confidentiality necessary to establish a claim for legal professional privilege.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,25,1

PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY

REVIEW OF THE RELISTING OF Ansar al-Islam, Asbat al-Ansar (AAA), Islamic Army of Aden (IAA), Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ)

Senator Gavin Marshall MP
CANBERRA  -  XX June 2009
Mr President, on behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security I have pleasure in presenting the Committee’s report entitled Review of the re-listing of Ansar al-Islam, AAA, IAA, IMU, JeM and LeJ as terrorist organisations.
Mr President, this report has departed from the usual format of terrorist proscription reports. It has done so because the Committee has sought some improvements to the way in which statements of reasons are drafted. The Committee recommends that in future the Attorney-General provide the Committee with a statement of reasons where a decision is taken not to re-list an organisation similar to that now supplied when an organisation is listed.
Mr President, there is no requirement for the Attorney-General to provide the Committee with detailed reasons when he decides not to re-list an organisation. The Committee, however, feels that it would be useful if, where the Attorney-General has decided he will not be re-listing an organisation as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code, a statement of reasons explaining his decision is provided to the Committee and that there also be a publicly released statement of reasons.
On the subject of decisions not to re-list the Committee was advised that the Attorney-General recently considered advice from the Director-General of Security with respect to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ). Based on this advice he stated he would not be re-listing EIJ as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code after the current listing expired on 30 March 2009.
Mr President, I now turn to requested improvements to the statements of reasons.
The Committee in this Parliament and earlier Parliaments has taken the view that non-statutory guidelines used by ASIO are useful tools in evaluating the evidence supporting a listing or re-listing. The Committee believes it would be helpful in its role if the statements of reasons be written in a way that directly links the evidence with ASIO’s guidelines.
This approach would also better inform public understanding of the listing process and outcomes.
The Committee has also requested that future statements of reasons be drafted, at least in part, in such a way that the information is directly referrable to the statutory criteria for listing contained within the Criminal Code.
Mr President, to turn to the current regulations, they were signed by the Governor-General on 13 March 2009. They were then tabled in the House of Representatives and the Senate on 17 March 2009. The disallowance period of 15 sitting days for the Committee’s review of the listing began from the date of the tabling. Therefore the Committee was required to report to the Parliament by today, Monday 15 June 2009.
Notice of the inquiry was placed on the Committee’s website. One submission was received from a public organisation. Representatives of the Federation of Community Legal Centres (Vic) Inc, the Attorney-General’s Department and ASIO attended a private hearing on the listings.
Mr President, I will now take this opportunity to outline some brief information on each organisation and I will also outline the Committee’s findings in relation to each of these six organisations.

Ansar al-Islam

Ansar al-Islam’s immediate objectives are to overthrow the Iraqi Government, expel Coalition forces from the country and establish a Sunni Islamic state administered under Shariah law.
The last terrorist act Ansar al-Islam was involved in was an attack on a Peshmerga barracks, reportedly killing 19 people and destroying two vehicles on 13 August 2008.
The Committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to Ansar al-Islam.

Asbat al-Ansar (AAA)

Asbat al Ansar’s objectives are to establish a Sunni Islamic state in Lebanon by overthrowing the Lebanese government, eliminating Israel and impeding anti-Islamic and pro-Western influences in Lebanon. The group believes its struggle justifies violence against civilians. The group’s strategy in seeking its objectives includes the use of terrorist tactics.
AAA remains focused on supporting jihad in Iraq and planning attacks against Lebanese security forces, and Western interests.
The Committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to the AAA.

Islamic Army of Aden (IAA)

The Islamic Army of Aden is a Sunni Islamic extremist group that first came to public prominence in 1998 when it issued statements detailing its intention to overthrow the Yemeni government and implement Sharia law; and called for operations against Western interests in Yemen.
In March/April members of the group suspected of planning to travel to Iraq to fight foreign forces were arrested.
The Committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to the IAA.

Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan

The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan’s current stated goal is to establish an Islamic caliphate in Turkestan, stretching from the Caspian Sea to China’s Xinjiang Province and encompassing the current Central Asian nations.
The IMU is now fighting in support of the Taliban and other Islamic groups against the Afghan government and international military forces in Afghanistan.
The Committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to the IMU.

Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM)

Jaish-e-Mohammed is a Sunni Islamic extremist organisation based in Pakistan
Jaish e Mohammed is a group that uses violence in pursuit of its stated objective of uniting Indian Administered Kashmir with Pakistan under a radical interpretation of Islamic law, as well as the eradication of Hindu and other non-Muslim presence on the sub-continent. The group actively promotes jihad against the US and other nations for perceived violations of Muslim rights. Reporting continues to suggest that JeM remains operational and is continuing to recruit and train new members as well as plan attacks.
The Committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to JeM.

Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ)

Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ) is a Sunni Deobandi Islamic terrorist group. LeJ’s goals are to establish an Islamic Sunni state in Pakistan based on Sharia law, through the use of violence if necessary; to have all Shias declared non-believers; and to eliminate followers of other faiths, especially Jews, Christians, and Hindus.
Recent events confirm LeJ’s continued existence and involvement in terrorist attacks and planning for future attacks. For example on 20 June 2008: two LeJ members were among five men arrested in Lahore who confessed to planning suicide attacks in Lahore and other cities.
The Committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to LeJ.
Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow Committee members for their work in reviewing these and other terrorist organisations. Lastly I would like to thank the Secretariat.
Mr President, I commend the report to the Senate.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2009-06-15,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, Senator Polley, I present the report of the committee on the Plebiscite for an Australian Republic Bill 2008, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.",SENATE,<title>PLEBISCITE FOR AN AUSTRALIAN REPUBLIC BILL 2008</title>,<title>Report of Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-06-15,"—by leave—This is an important report on the Plebiscite for an Australian Republic Bill 2008 from the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, which heard evidence from a wide spectrum of Australians who are for and against the proposal that Australia should have an Australian as head of state. As shown by the strength of opinion polls that we are seeing, the feeling in this nation is that we should be moving towards a republic, and that was indeed the outcome of the Prime Minister’s 2020 gathering of Australians. It was the one proposal that was greeted with general acclamation last year. We have a Prime Minister who is a republican and a Leader of the Opposition who is a republican, and I think this is a great time—because the country has other problems—to be looking at moving forward on this matter.
The proposal in my legislation, which I do not want to pre-empt but which as soon as I can will be brought before the chamber for debate, is that there be a plebiscite held with the election next year, which is the cheapest option, simply to ask people whether or not Australia should become a republic with an Australian as its head of state. The committee proceedings lead to the inevitable conclusion, I believe, that the answer to that is yes. A lot of public thought has gone into this. The question may be adjusted, but it is the obvious next question to ask and the obvious time to ask it is at the next available opportunity. That opportunity is with the next election. If there is some fault in that reasoning, I do not know what it is. We should proceed.",SENATE,<title>PLEBISCITE FOR AN AUSTRALIAN REPUBLIC BILL 2008</title>,<title>Report of Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-06-15,"—Before question time, I was reflecting on how the views of the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, had changed from before the election, when she was the opposition spokesperson on health, to now, when she is the minister. Before the election, she was opposed to and could not see any justification for a system of cost recovery for PBS listings, in fact raising the prospect of the risk that cost recovery would pose to the independence of the PBAC. Cost recovery, as I was saying before question time, has been implemented successfully in the TGA process, which has been able to maintain its independence, but of course the TGA and the PBAC have very different roles. The TGA decides whether a drug or a medical device can be marketed in Australia, whereas the PBAC advises the minister on which drugs should be approved for a public subsidy.
The Productivity Commission has made the point that cost recovery arrangements should only be introduced to improve efficiency and should not be implemented where they are inconsistent with policy objectives. Whilst cost recovery may improve efficiency, if it leads to higher drug prices and delays PBS listings it would be inconsistent with the objectives of the PBS, which are to provide timely and affordable access to pharmaceuticals.
The industry has pointed out quite vigorously a number of concerns. The first of those is that this is a global first. It is indeed unprecedented around the world that cost recovery principles, in terms of the listing process of pharmaceuticals, be implemented in this fashion. The measures do not adhere to the principles of cost recovery from the industry’s point of view, in that there is no service to the seller. Recovery is being made for a purchaser’s function and could, from the industry’s point of view, take the cost of listing to over $1 million. That presents a risk to patients across Australia in getting access to new medicines which might not be listed in Australia as a result of what the government is proposing through the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 [No. 2]. It could well impact on small patient population groups. The real risk is that some companies may decide that it is not worth listing some drugs for those groups.
Finally, there is a real concern that this measure will deter innovation and investment in the Australian pharmaceutical industry because it is in fact a tax. It should be acknowledged as such, and there is no proper comparison to the TGA process, where payment is made for registration. The government is reintroducing this measure at a time when the industry is already dealing with a substantial four-year reform process, which was initiated in 2007. It comes at a time when the budget is already imposing a further $175 million in price cuts on the industry, and, of course, it comes at a time of a significant global economic downturn.
The minister’s views on this have changed, as I have noted. Rather than agreeing with the proposition that she put before the election that this measure would threaten the independence of the PBS, she is now actively pursuing it on behalf of the Rudd government. I do note that the Chairman of the PBAC suggested that there were no concerns about cost recovery impacting on the recommendations or independence of the PBAC.
The PBS does give Australia one of the best pharmaceutical delivery systems in the world. It gives Australians access to the best available medicines that are safe and of the highest quality. We fully support the charter of the PBS to provide timely and affordable access to subsidised medications for the Australian community. We are very concerned about the impact of the measures in this legislation. We understand that the government have given indications to the Greens that they will agree to an amendment that the Greens will move later. We will also support that amendment by the Greens to have a review of the impact of these cost recovery measures. If that amendment is passed by the Senate, as it seems that it will be, the opposition will be supporting this legislation. However, we continue to have very grave concerns about the impacts that it is likely to have into the future.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS—COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-06-15,"—We made our position clear on this bill the first time we considered it. I am not going to go through all the comments that I made last time but I do want to reiterate a number of our points and put the reasoning behind the Greens position on this National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 [No. 2]. In principle we support the cost recovery mechanism. The pharmaceutical industry makes a great deal of money from the PBS. We believe that, in general, cost recovery makes sense given the large amount of money the industry makes out of the PBS and the large cost of the scheme to the taxpayer. The Greens strongly support the PBS. We think that it is appropriate that the industry pays for cost recovery.
When we originally looked at this bill, we were concerned about the independence of the PABC. As a result of the two inquiries we had, our questions to government and our looking at the legislation in detail, we were somewhat assured that it did not undermine the independence of the PABC. We had particular concern about non-orphan drugs—those specialised drugs that are used for purposes for which they are not listed. Those drugs include some used in specialist and rare cancer treatment and some that are used in Aboriginal communities. A number of drugs have proved to be very beneficial for palliative care. These drugs are often used in low volumes but it is quite an expensive process to list them. So we were concerned to ensure that those drugs were protected in any cost recovery scheme.
The other issue we were concerned about at the time was the fact that the regulations, if I can remind the chamber, were made public the day that the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs was due to report on this legislation. We were extremely disappointed about that. We did not think it was good process given that this particular piece of legislation was going to significantly impact not only the industry but also stakeholders. There was a particular level of concern around those non-orphan drugs, particularly from people involved in palliative care. In fact, we had a number of submissions to the Senate inquiry about that specific issue. Following that, the government referred the regulations to committee. So the community affairs committee has had two inquiries into this bill: one into the bill itself and the second into the regulations. Once we had had a look at the legislation, it helped to allay a lot of the concerns of the Greens, but there were terms in the legislation that were confusing and not adequately defined. When we go into committee, I will seek government assurance around some of those definitions.
There has been a lot of concern in the industry and amongst those that rely on non-orphan drugs as to the impact of this legislation. Although a lot of the issues have been dealt with, we think it is appropriate that there be a review around its impact. We believe it would increase transparency and accountability to look at the application of the cost recovery processes, so we will be moving an amendment to the legislation. I understand that it has support from the government and that the opposition, as we just heard, will be supporting it. In fact, the amendment incorporates amendments put by the opposition in terms of annual reporting. I will go through those amendments in more detail in the committee stage. Whilst the government has made further attempts to improve the regulations, this is a substantive change. We are not sure whether this legislation and the cost recovery process is going to have the impact that people are worried about in terms of making it impossible for non-orphan drugs to go through the process, even with fees waived or reduced.
Senator Fielding has circulated some amendments around the minister retaining discretion to waive fees. I signal right now that the Greens have very strong concerns about those particular amendments. Again, I will go into more detail in committee, but we are very concerned that those amendments go way beyond what is already in the regulations and that they could introduce an element that undermines the independence of the PABC. The legislation has been at pains not to do that. We are very concerned that these amendments may do just what we have all been trying to avoid.
The Greens will be supporting this legislation provided the amendment is accepted. We believe the amendment provides the safeguards to ensure that this legislation is not adversely impacting those groups that everybody in this chamber, from my recollection from the previous debate, was at pains to protect. Those are the small groups who use the non-orphan drugs, those drugs that are low volume and that are too expensive to put through the process if there is not a fee waiver process. We will obviously make our decision once we see what the government does with the amendments that the Greens are proposing.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS—COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2009-06-15,"—The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 [No. 2] amends the National Health Act 1953 to provide authority for the cost recovery of services provided by the Commonwealth in relation to the exercise of powers for listing medicines, vaccines and other products or services on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the designation of vaccines for the National Immunisation Program. The aim of the PBS is to ensure that Australians have affordable access to high-quality medicines in the community. An initiative of a Labor government 60 years ago, the PBS is now accepted by both sides of politics as a success story. Access to high-quality medicines is maintained by subsidising the cost of the PBS medicines and limiting the amount that people pay for prescriptions at the point of sale. Medicines that are listed on the PBS are assessed by experts to be clinically safe and cost effective. The PBS serves Australians well and is justifiably regarded as one of the best systems of its kind in the world.
Similarly, the government is dedicated to ensuring that all Australians can continue to receive fully funded vaccines under the NIP. The NIP is a joint program of Commonwealth and state and territory governments which provides fully funded vaccines for major preventable diseases. The states and territories provide vaccines free of charge to health providers for them to administer to the community.
The cost of providing subsidised medicines and fully funded vaccines to the Australian community is a significant financial outlay to the Commonwealth and taxpayers. In 2007-08 the Commonwealth paid around $7 billion to approved pharmacists, hospitals and medical practitioners for the subsidised supply of medicines under the PBS. A further $543 million was provided by the Commonwealth to the states and territories for the fully funded supply of vaccines under the NIP within their respective jurisdictions.
In implementing a cost recovery fee for Commonwealth services, it is important to note that patient co-payments will not be affected. They are administered separately to the PBS and subject to annual review and indexation adjustment. In 2009 these co-payments are $5.30 for concession card holders and up to $32.90 for general patients.
Cost recovery is not a new policy. Cost recovery arrangements have been applied with success to many departments and agencies at state and federal level including, for example, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, TGA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority. The pharmaceutical industry is familiar with cost recovery—the industry has been paying for the pre-market evaluation of products by the TGA since 1991.
The trigger for fees will be the lodgement of a submission, which in the case of pharmaceutical companies is a purely commercial decision. Pharmaceutical companies are free to market their products in Australia independently of the PBS or NIP subsidies. However, financial returns from the PBS and NIP, especially in relation to high sales ‘prescription only’ items, are significantly increased by PBS listing.
The government first announced its intention to introduce cost recovery of the PBS listing process in the 2008-09 Budget and it is scheduled to start from 1 July 2008. It has, however, been delayed previously in this place and been subject to intense parliamentary scrutiny, including two inquiries in 2008 by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. The interest taken by stakeholders in the inquiries demonstrates how the PBS is valued by the Australian community. The government appreciates and values the contributions made during those inquiries, particularly concerns about access to medicines targeted for small patient populations groups such as medicines for palliative care and paediatric patients and medicines specifically listed to assist people from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.
The government will ensure that cost recovery is not a barrier to the continued listing of orphan and niche products within the PBS and that they will not be adversely affected by the introduction of fees. Applications relating to drugs designated orphan drugs under the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 will be exempt from fees. The subordinate regulations will allow for the applicant to request a waiver of the fees when lodging their submission, where the application involves the public interest test and where payment of the required fee would make the application financially unviable.
After consideration of the committee’s findings and evidence presented to the committee, the government is re-presenting the bill. The delay in passing the bill has led to a loss of expected revenue to the government—at least $9.4 million in 2008-09. The government is pleased that the opposition now supports the thrust of the bill and has negotiated in good faith on amendments suggested by both the opposition and the Australian Greens. The government accepts the suggested amendments that will provide for an independent review of the operation of the cost recovery regime after it has been up and running for two years and for the report of that review to be tabled in Parliament. In addition the minister will be required to table an annual report on the processes leading up to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee’s, PBAC’s, consideration of applications.
The government guarantees the continued independence of the PBAC. The government will continue to directly fund all the activities of the PBAC and its subcommittees. The PBAC will have no role in setting fees and it will not receive any revenue from industry. All revenue collected from cost recovery will be paid directly into consolidated revenue. I would like to emphasise that the expertise, integrity and sense of propriety that PBAC members bring to their task will not change as a result of cost recovery.
Pharmaceutical companies receive much by way of benefits from the Australian taxpayer once products are listed on the PBS. It is not unreasonable that they contribute toward maintaining the architecture of the PBS. Achieving a product listing on the PBS provides a high level of commercial certainty to a company in relation to that product’s sales. It is time for the pharmaceutical companies to contribute something back to the system.
The bill provides for a commencement date of 1 July 2008. The government has no intention of introducing the cost recovery regime to allow for the retrospective collection of fees. It will be the regulations made under the power provided in the bill which will specify the actual date from which cost recovery fees will commence. No fees can be imposed until the regulations are made by the Governor-General. The regulations will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance.
The Department of Health and Ageing has continued to consult with key stakeholders, including peak industry, consumer and healthcare provider bodies. The department has met with industry and agreed to establish a consultative mechanism with industry on cost recovery. In addition, a cost recovery impact statement will be finalised, reporting on compliance and consultations within the government’s cost recovery policy. In accordance with the cost recovery guidelines, the department will introduce ongoing monitoring mechanisms to ensure fees remain based on efficient costs and it will continue to liaise closely with key stakeholders.
Revenue from cost recovery will depend on the number and type of submissions brought to the PBAC for consideration. As a general rule, the more complex and time consuming the evaluation and price negotiation the higher the fees. Once fully operational, annual revenue from fees is expected to total about $14 million a year. In addition to the legislative reviews agreed to, a full review will be undertaken within five years, in accordance with the cost recovery guidelines.
The government has asked the Department of Health and Ageing to liaise with industry before finalising an implementation date. The minister will announce that date as soon as practicable to allow industry time to prepare. That said, the government does not anticipate that the implementation of these arrangements will be unduly delayed, and on passage of this bill the Department of Health and Ageing will work quickly to submit the proposed regulations to the federal Executive Council for the Governor-General’s consideration.
Cost recovery will be a simple system, recovering costs from parties that are in a position to gain financial benefit from the listing of their drugs or changes to listings within the PBS subsidy framework and from the designation of their vaccines for funding under the NIP. It is all about ensuring that the PBS continues to be able to provide reliable, timely and affordable access to a wide range of medicines for all Australians. I thank those who have contributed to the debate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS—COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-15,"—We are considering the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009. This bill creates a legislative bridge from the existing industrial relations system, underpinned by the Workplace Relations Act 1996, to Labor’s new system, underpinned by the Fair Work Act 2009. The bill is necessary as some parts of the existing system remain ongoing under the new system. Some parts will remain ongoing for a limited period, which is called the bridging period, and other parts are abolished completely. The attitude that we as a coalition will be taking to this legislation is, I must say, still a matter of some reflection. We understand that the Labor Party, despite having moved 120 amendments to their own legislation in the House of Representatives, are still going to be introducing into this chamber another tranche of three lots of amendments to this legislation. They have asked us to engage in the second reading debate on this legislation without having seen the amendments.
I have a funny feeling—and I might be able to predict—that there will be a requirement for a definition in this legislation along the lines that Senator Fielding negotiated with Ms Gillard in that shameful episode in the Senate where Senator Fielding joined with Labor to pass the Fair Work Bill 2009. That was the occasion when this Senate had unanimously, in the previous third reading debate, buried Work Choices good and thorough, but Ms Gillard and Senator Fielding went back to the grave site, unearthed it, threw in jobs, threw in small business and then covered it over again. That was the effect of the amendments that unfortunately Senator Fielding was able to effect with Labor and the Greens on the last occasion.
The very small deal that Senator Fielding was able to achieve—might I add, at great expense to small business overall—was that the definition of ‘small business’ would be addressed in a transitional sense. As I read the current legislation before us, those definitions have still not been presented to the Senate and to this parliament. So that is one lot of amendments that Labor still have to move. I understand that Labor will have to move some further amendments dealing with the rules of state registered unions, and regulations will need to be allowed for to prescribe how state based unions can become part of the federal system. I would have thought that these matters were well and truly on the agenda, like the definition of small business, which should have been dealt with previously.
It is not often that I would agree with the National Tertiary Education Union, but they have made a sensible submission to us—which I assume the government is willing to accept as well—which is that industrial action and secret ballots which have already taken place before 1 July 2009 should be allowed to continue to clothe with legality industrial action that takes place after 1 July 2009. That seems to me to be a sensible amendment to make to the legislation. I understand that the government is interested in it and, in fairness to everybody, it seems a sensible course of action.
But why is this not in the raft of legislation that is before us? I am holding this legislation here, and it really is a huge amount of legislation. I remember, when Work Choices came in, Senator Wong condemning the amount of paperwork involved in relation to that legislation. For consistency’s sake, I trust that Senator Wong will have a look at the Fair Work Australia Bill and the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009 and tell us if there is more paperwork involved in the approach that the current government is taking to industrial relations. I dare say we all know what the answer will be to that challenge: she will not take it up, because she already knows the answer. Can I, in general terms, indicate that we the coalition, despite not being provided with all the information, are minded to be supportive of this legislation and will be supportive of the three areas of amendment that I have been able to identify as clearly the government’s responsibility. Can I flag, however, that in the committee stage I will be moving, on behalf of the coalition, nine amendments dealing with a range of issues but concerned with protecting small businesses in particular. We said in relation to the Fair Work Australia Bill—and I say on behalf of the coalition yet again in relation to this transition legislation—that jobs, small business and excessive union power are the three criteria on which we will judge the legislation. Once again small businesses will be hard-hit if some of the amendments that we are seeking are not made.
Can I point out in particular the huge cost to business in relation to the issue of award modernisation. Reality has finally mugged Ms Gillard in relation to restaurants and catering. She has now advised the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, I understand, that there are certain factors—in fact she wrote to the Hon. Justice Giudice on 29 May 2009—indicating that data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that cafes, restaurants and catering services are characterised by comparatively low profit margins and high labour costs as a proportion of total expenses. That, of course, is part of her rationalisation for doing a backflip for restaurants and caterers. It is a welcome backflip, but we are not sure that it is actually going to pay dividends. But if that is the rationale, the consideration, that Ms Gillard has applied in relation to restaurants and caterers—namely, that the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that cafes, restaurants and catering services are characterised by comparatively low profit margins and high labour costs as a proportion of total expenses—I would invite Ms Gillard to put on a pair of gumboots—and it is raining in some areas of rural and regional Australia, thank goodness—and visit some of the horticultural pursuits, like the ones in my home state of Tasmania; for example, the stone fruit industry and the berry fruit industry.
In these industries the fruit has to be picked not on the day that Ms Gillard determines but on the day that nature or God determines. We know that Ms Gillard has delusions of grandeur, but can I say to her and to those who are so busily pushing this nonsensical one-size-fits-all approach to industrial relations: if you put a 30 per cent weighting on the cost of picking fruit on a Saturday or Sunday, it will no longer be viable for those businesses to pick fruit on those days and, as a result, market supplies will be adversely impacted. Fruit that starts rotting will impact on unripened fruit and the consequences will be huge. The consequences will be substantial. Knowing some of the berry farmers and stone fruit farmers as I do, I know that they fit into the category that Ms Gillard told Justice Giudice about on 29 May 2009—that is, they are ‘characterised by comparatively low profit margins and high labour costs as a proportion of total expenses’.
In fairness, the pharmacy sector might be seen—and I note that I am wearing their tie today, albeit by coincidence—to be a bit more profitable than other sectors. Interestingly enough, with award modernisation they too will be severely impacted. But do you know who will really be impacted? It will not be the pharmacists; it will be the students and casual workers. You see, a lot of the pharmacists engage university students to do those pill packets that are done up especially for aged-care facilities, where older people are provided with a morning, noon and night schedule of tablets for the day of the week. This is all set out for them and delivered once a week. You need careful workers to do that. I know pharmacies that employ university students and that say, ‘We don’t care when you do it, as long as they are ready for delivery Monday morning.’ Most university students say, ‘We study, have lectures, tutorials et cetera nine to five, Monday to Friday, so can we work Saturday and Sunday?’ It suits the students, it suits the pharmacies and it gets the job done. But all of a sudden there will be a cost impost for students to work on a Saturday and Sunday, which will price them out of the market.
So who are the people who are going to suffer? Not the pharmacists; I am sure they will get around it. It will be the university students, who of course are already being attacked by this government through their attempts to get rid of the opportunity of a gap year. But these are the real on-the-ground impacts of this Labor government’s legislation. If you are a pharmacist you are not exempt. If you are a farmer or a horticulturist you are not exempt. If you are a restaurant caterer you are not exempt. Senator Arbib, in a most undistinguished first question time today, when asked about what was unique about restaurants and caterers as opposed to all these other areas, was unable to give an answer.
—He had no idea.
—I think Senator Ronaldson is right: he had no idea. He thought he was on Sky News again and could just talk his way out of the issue rather than abide by standing orders, which in fact require direct relevance to be provided to the questions asked.
So what we have here is once again policy on the run. There are three lots of amendments that I am predicting Labor will need to introduce to have this legislation in some sort of shape, but we cannot address that in our second readers because we do not see the actual amendments—and that was after a raft of 120 amendments that had to be moved in the other place. We are concerned about award modernisation impacting on small businesses, and I trust that I have outlined that. I can indicate that we will be moving amendments in relation to the no-detriment rule, relief from increased labour costs, default superannuation, state based differences in modern awards and also the union representation orders.
It is important that we get the workplace relations regime right in this country, especially at this time. If there is any disincentive to employ, guess what? Employers will not employ. Employers are actually called employers for a very simple reason: they employ people. The Labor Party often forget that. And the more difficult you make it for employers, the less likely they are to employ. That is why we have already seen a substantial increase in the unemployment rate in this country. Sure, the global financial crisis is having an impact, but can I tell you from anecdotal evidence all around the country that it is obvious that a lot of businesses are shedding workers already in anticipation of the new regime that is going to come into place on 1 July.
As I have said on a number of previous occasions in this debate, Work Choices is dead, and we as a coalition and as an opposition acknowledge it. But one thing we do say to the Australian people is that we were motivated by one thing, and that was to try to make it easier for employers to employ people. We dared to dream at the time that unemployment could have a four in front of it, and people told us we were mad; you would never get unemployment below five per cent. When we did put in Work Choices, unemployment fell. Yes, we did fail to have a four in front of it at the end. You know why we failed? Because it had a three in front of it; we got unemployment down to 3.9 per cent. When you think of the social good and the social benefit that does for a community, to see unemployment fall by a full one percentage figure or more down to 3.9 per cent, that was our motivation.
We accept that we got it wrong because some elements of Work Choices were too harsh and that needed to be addressed, and the people spoke. But one thing I would say to those opposite is that what you are doing now is swinging the pendulum back not only pre Work Choices, not only pre Howard, Costello and Kernot changes of the early years of the Howard government but even further back to before the Hawke-Keating reforms. This is really the revenge of the dinosaurs in the Labor Party and trade union movement, those who would not have truck of Work Choices—and I accept that—but also never had truck with the Howard-Costello reforms or the Hawke-Keating reforms. In a time when people are desperate to keep their jobs, when employers are finding it difficult to keep employees, the Labor Party and those that manipulate it from behind from trades halls around the country are now swinging the pendulum back way, way beyond pre Work Choices to pre Hawke-Keating, and that is going to have flow-on consequences for employment levels. I know that Labor will say that it is the global financial crisis. They will hide behind it. But they will know in their heart of hearts that that is not the full picture. It is their industrial relations changes that will be part of the driver of the ever-increasing number of unemployed. This is Labor’s legislation and Labor will bear the responsibility of it.
Having said that, I flagged the areas where we will be moving amendments in the committee stage. I would be interested if the minister could confirm in the summing-up speech that there will be further amendments moved by the government and, if so, whether the three areas I have indicated are to be the subject of amendment. If not, we might be minded to move amendments, and of course there may be other areas of amendment above and beyond their 120 amendments that have already been moved in the other place.
In general we will be supporting the passage of the legislation but can indicate that we have very grave concerns about certain areas of this legislation, in particular how it builds on the unfortunate events when the Fair Work Bill was passed by the Senate where the grave on Work Choices was reopened and jobs and small business were thrown in as well, which will be of great detriment to our economy, to the workforce and to small business, who after all are the engine room of job creation in this country.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-06-15,"—I rise tonight to speak on both the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009 and the Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill 2009. I will refer to these bills as the ‘fair work transition bill’ and the ‘fair work referral bill’ respectively.
With the passing of Fair Work Act in March this year, Australia is moving away from what we believed was the profoundly unjust Work Choices regime of the Howard government. The Greens have consistently argued for a fair, just and sustainable industrial relations system to replace Work Choices. We are not satisfied that the government has moved far enough from and truly repudiated all the unjust elements of Work Choices, but the Fair Work Act is now here and today we are focusing on the process of transitioning away from those elements of Work Choices that the act amended.
The fair work transition bill is important as it deals with the most immediate effects of changing from Work Choices to the Fair Work Act. The Greens are generally supportive of the approach taken by the government in this fair work transition bill. We do, however, have a number of concerns that we believe should be addressed in the interests of working Australians.
We are particularly concerned about unfair Work Choices agreements. The biggest problem in the government’s approach to transitioning from Work Choices is that the government is leaving thousands of employees stuck on unfair Work Choices agreements, including AWAs. This chamber has heard time and again about the travesty of AWAs: how they ripped away working people’s conditions, made them vulnerable to their employer and undermined collective bargaining. AWAs were at the forefront of the union movement’s Your Rights at Work campaign against Work Choices, which assisted the ALP into government. AWAs are at the forefront of the ALP’s promise to abolish Work Choices. As the Deputy Prime Minister said in her second reading speech on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 in March last year:
All last year, every member now sitting on this side of the House campaigned in electorates all over this country on our commitment to abolish Australian workplace agreements and to introduce Labor’s new system.
When the Australian people read our policy documents, or heard the Prime Minister speak, including at our campaign launch, or listened to me debate the previous Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations they were left without a doubt that central to our workplace relations policy was a commitment to rid Australia of all statutory individual employment agreements
               …              …              …
We believe that … there is no need for AWAs or any statutory individual employment agreement. The essence of such agreements is that they override the safety net.
These are the sentiments that the Greens agree with. We too campaigned vigorously against AWAs. We also passionately believe that the safety net should be there for all workers and should not be able to be undermined by individual agreements. Yet, despite the ALP’s promises, AWAs are still with us and will be for many more years to come. Work Choices will not be dead until the last AWA is terminated. Work Choices is having a slow and—for those stuck on unfair AWAs—painful death. The Greens have held a consistent position since before the last election that substandard agreements—individual or collective—should be able to be terminated and the employee employed on the more favourable conditions of the award or superior collective agreement that covers the employer.
We moved amendments to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill in 2008 to provide a mechanism for employees to terminate unfair AWAs. These amendments were not supported by the government and many workers have unfortunately stayed on unfair AWAs ever since. We are going to try again with this bill. We will be moving an amendment to give Fair Work Australia the power to terminate or vary unfair workplace instruments where they disadvantage the employee compared to the new safety net. The substance of this amendment was recommended by the ALP senators in their report on the Senate inquiry into this bill. We will also move another amendment, recommended by Professor Andrew Stewart and adopted by the majority report of the inquiry into this bill, that a new enterprise agreement will automatically replace an AWA or ITEA without the need for conditional termination provisions. The conditional termination provisions do not address the problem of employees stuck on unfair AWAs or ITEAs. Neither employers nor unions believe that they will be used effectively. The requirement that an employer must agree to a transition termination prior to the nominal expiry date of the AWA or ITEA renders them useless for the workers who are most in need of relief from AWAs.
Too many workers have been subject to inherently unfair workplace agreements due to the aberration that was Work Choices. In providing a fairer safety net comprising the National Employment Standards and modern awards, the ALP government has an obligation to ensure that workers cannot continue to be employed on conditions that fall below this safety net. The ALP government is failing to meet this most basic of obligations to the workers who suffered under Work Choices.
Another area of concern to us is the award modernisation process. It always makes me shudder when I agree with the opposition on IR, although I think we have different perspectives of award modernisation. Award modernisation has been attracting a great deal of criticism recently from both employers and some unions. The Greens voiced our concerns about the process right from the very beginning. We were concerned that the process would result in a watered-down safety net, to the detriment of workers. While we agree that awards do need to be modernised, we do not want to see the fundamental value of Australia’s unique award safety net eroded.
The government has set the Australian Industrial Relations Commission a massive undertaking, which was always going to be difficult to achieve in the time frame provided. There were always going to be winners and losers out of this process. The government’s intention that the process would neither disadvantage employees nor increase employer costs was never going to be realised in such an exercise. For the Greens, the success of the award modernisation process is whether or not it results in a comprehensive safety net of wages and conditions that underpin a decent standard of living for workers.
We note and support the intervention by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to ensure that no award can remove from its protection workers who earn less than $100,000 a year. The Greens were very concerned to hear of the Clerks—Private Sector Award and, in particular, the provision exempting employees on as little as $44,000 a year from key award conditions. This decision clearly contradicts the award system envisaged under the Fair Work Act. We also note the minister’s intervention to create a separate clerks and restaurants award. We would be very concerned if the minister makes a habit of undermining her own independent process in the interests of the lobby groups that can shout the loudest.
The Greens support the take-home pay provisions in the bill. They are necessary to ensure workers do not lose pay as a result of the safety net shifting beneath them. We agree with submissions from various unions to the Senate inquiry that Fair Work Australia should be able to take into consideration the loss of significant conditions as well as financial considerations in making these orders. We note too that the majority report of the inquiry from the ALP senators supported this position. Such an extension is vital for many of the most vulnerable award reliant workers, who will face potentially significant changes in their working hours due to the award modernisation process.
We do not support the amendments put forward by the opposition for cost recovery orders for business. We note that the AIRC will be determining transitional arrangements which can last up to five years. The Greens, unlike the Liberal Party, believe in the need for a strong, robust and adequate award safety net. It is an essential part of building a fair society. The opposition’s amendments, we believe, would allow employers to essentially get exemptions from awards that would undermine the safety net.
I also want to specifically note the provisions in the transitional bill for a two-year review of modern awards, which was included as a result of an agreement with the Australian Greens when we were debating the Fair Work Bill. This earlier review was generally supported in submissions to the inquiry from both businesses and unions. The Greens believe an earlier review is important in ensuring that the new award safety net is adequate.
The Australian Greens continue to be concerned about the long-term consequences of the new award system under the Fair Work Act. As we stated in the debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill way back in March 2008, we want to see a fair, robust and relevant award system. We believe that awards should provide a comprehensive safety net for workers on an industry or occupational level that is flexible enough to allow for industry-specific conditions but secure enough to provide appropriate protections. Awards must be living documents. They must be able to adapt to the changes in community standards. Time will tell if the modern awards system will provide the fairness Australian workers expect.
I want to make a brief comment on a notable inconsistency in the bill, which is the government’s approach to bargaining and industrial action currently underway. Unlike most other processes dealt with in the fair work transitional bill, bargaining must begin again from 1 July. This also means that any authorisation for industrial action becomes void and employees will have to start the process again. Given that the regime for taking protected industrial action is very similar under the Fair Work Act to what it was under Work Choices, this seems another unnecessary impediment to the right of workers to take industrial action. I understand there may be a particular problem for employees of Telstra and in some universities who have long-running authorisations in place. We urge the government to address this issue and ensure that parties who are undergoing bargaining now and have industrial action authorisations in place are not disadvantaged by the transition to the Fair Work Act.
I also wish to briefly comment on the low-paid bargaining stream. In the debate on the Fair Work Act, the Australian Greens moved an amendment to delete the requirement that an employer must not have been covered by an enterprise agreement in the past to be subject to a low-paid workplace determination. Our amendment was not supported by the government. The fair work transitional bill extends that requirement to any collective agreement made in the past. This means that an employer may be exempt from the low-paid bargaining stream if they made a collective agreement years ago or if they made a Work Choices non-union collective agreement where actual bargaining may never have occurred. In places such as Western Australia, where we have had unfair statutory individual agreements for many years, in fact, before AWAs, this provision could undermine the intention of the low-paid bargaining stream—a stream which the Greens strongly supported. It is an unnecessary and counterproductive limitation on accessing a low-paid workplace determination.
The Greens support the low-paid bargaining stream provisions. They are vitally important in encouraging and achieving genuine collective bargaining in low-paid industries, which are often female dominated industries. We do not understand why the government initially sought to limit their application. We are pleased to see that the government is partially addressing this issue with its amendments with the effect that collective agreements that have ceased to operate will not exempt an employer from low-paid bargaining. We would prefer a broader amendment, as recommended in the majority committee report, to the effect that Fair Work Australia is given the discretion to decide on a low-paid workplace determination after considering all the circumstances, including past bargaining.
The final part of the transitional bill that the Greens have significant issues with is the new representation orders. In our view this as another example of the government putting the interests of business ahead of the rights of workers. The purported reasoning for these new orders is to deal with the new rules for right of entry and the fears expressed by business that demarcation disputes between unions will increase as a result. We note the new orders are not limited to right-of-entry disputes. Indeed, there need not even be an actual dispute at all. We note the amendments the government moved in the House to clarify that a dispute need only be threatened, impending or probable. Like the senators in the majority report on this inquiry, we do not believe these provisions are necessary. We believe they will have the potential to breach the rights of workers to freedom of association and will be used by employers to pick and choose the unions they wish to deal with. If this occurs it will be unacceptable.
I now wish to make some brief comments in support of the two sets of amendments moved by the government in the House. Firstly with respect to outworkers, the Greens are pleased the government has been prepared to listen to the needs of these most vulnerable workers and to act to ensure more complete and appropriate award protection for these outworkers. The Greens have a longstanding commitment to ensuring appropriate and robust protections for outworkers. The analysis and recommendations made by the majority report on the inquiry into the transitional bill points to unfinished business, and we note the government has not acted on all the recommendations. The Greens will be keeping a close eye on the operation of the Fair Work Act and the transitional provisions in respect of outworkers to ensure the utmost protection for these workers is assured. Secondly, we note the insertion of a requirement that Fair Work Australia provide a report on the operation of the unfair dismissal system after three years. The Greens support this proposal. We think it is important for accurate and useful data to be collected on the unfair dismissal system to inform the debate on this issue and on the operation of the unfair dismissal system under the Fair Work Act.
I would like to briefly turn now to the Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill 2009. The Greens support the bill and understand the necessity for Victorian workers to be brought within the ambit of the Fair Work Act. We also note that the Queensland, South Australian and Tasmanian governments have indicated in-principle support for referring powers in respect of private sector employees. This however does not assist non-federal-system employees in my home state of WA.
The Greens have been concerned for some time about the plight of non-federal-system employees, especially those in the community and social services sector. As we discussed in the debate on the Fair Work Bill, many of these employees do not know whether or not they are in the federal system given the technical and complicated determinations of whether their employers are constitutional operations. If they are not in the federal system then while they may be currently covered by transitional instruments these instruments will be terminated in 2011 and the workers will lose important protections. We appreciate that the government is attempting to deal with the jurisdictional mess by negotiating with the states to refer their powers. Unfortunately the Western Australian government has specifically ruled out such a referral. This situation is a consequence of moving away from the conciliation and arbitration power to a reliance on the corporations power. It is an issue that is not going to go away and the government must ensure that those workers caught out by its law under this approach are protected.
The Greens will be moving a number of amendments in the committee stage of this debate, as I indicated, particularly to deal with the issue of unfair AWAs. We will continue to raise this issue because we believe it is an extremely important issue. The government made a commitment that AWAs would cease. That commitment has not been followed through. There are workers around Australia who will continue on unfair AWAs for a good many years. It seems nonsensical to me that the government does not move to address those and to support those workers who find themselves on AWAs that are unfair. The government has mechanisms it can use to address this issue and it should take the opportunity to support amendments that get rid of unfair AWAs. I will be going through the details of those amendments once we move to the in-committee stage consideration of amendments.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2009-06-15,"—I have great pleasure in rising to speak in support of the Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill 2009 and the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009. These bills contain the necessary transitional and consequential changes to ensure that there is a smooth and fair transition to the new workplace relations system. Importantly, the provisions in these bills will ensure certainty as the new workplace relations system comes into operation. These bills, when they come into law, will operate with the Fair Work Act 2008. This will mark the end of one of the darkest periods in Australia’s industrial relations history.
If there is one thing more than any other that caused Australian electors to drive the Howard government from office, it was Mr Howard’s trashing of the strongly held principle within Australian society that fairness should always be a core element of Australia’s industrial relations system. At the same time as the Howard government was orchestrating a massive deterioration in employee pay and conditions, business was experiencing record profits. In aggregate, company profits were growing at a substantially greater rate than the growth in aggregate wage and salary expenditure. In other words, there was no credible reason that could justify the then federal coalition government’s assault on employee wages and conditions. The whole exercise was a sham from start to finish. Plainly, Mr Howard’s attack on the working conditions of working men and women was driven by ideology together with a pathological and irrational hatred of unions.
Certainly for a while John Howard thought he had got away with the progressive dismantling of the employment conditions. In this endeavour he was lauded, egged on and abetted by extreme elements within the Liberal Party, especially in the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party. However, at the same time, it was becoming increasingly obvious to the large majority of Australians from direct experience in their workplaces that the spin being peddled by John Howard and his ministers about the marvellous benefits that would flow to working Australians from the coalition government’s workplace policy revolution was shaping up to be a massive hoax.
While many in the workforce knew that the Howard government’s rhetoric did not match the facts, it had become strangely difficult for the broader public to find out the true extent to which standard employment conditions were being downgraded. Fortunately, in May 2006, as a result of Labor questioning at Senate estimates, information came to light about what was being lost by Australians on Australian workplace agreements. What was emerging was that employers had been provided an array of opportunities to manipulate the fine print of the Work Choices legislation to enhance their bargaining strength at the expense, unfortunately, of employees. People in lower paid jobs found that they were encountering more and more a ‘take it or leave it’ response from their employers or potential employers as far as their conditions of employment were concerned. This is why so many employers loved Work Choices.
With John Howard and his ministers crisscrossing the country and saturating the airways and the nation’s letterboxes with Work Choices propaganda laced with fairytales and half truths, employers knew they were being given a nod and a wink to dismantle anything in Australia’s industrial relations system that they did not particularly like. As a result, the pace of the erosion and cutting of employment conditions increased rapidly. Typically this was justified by the often made claim trotted out by many employers that employees had to be much more flexible in today’s workplaces. Workers are well aware that in today’s world we need to adapt and adjust to often rapidly changing circumstances. Families are doing this all the time. Australian workers do not need to be consistently harassed by employers or conservative governments about the need to be more flexible. However, from bitter experience Australian working men and women also knew that all too often in the workplace there can be a very, very fine line between flexibility and exploitation. All too frequently when an employee hears the word ‘flexibility’ being spouted by an employer he or she knows that bad news could be following. You know straight away that in all likelihood your duties and responsibilities are about to increase, and quite possibly your workload is about to get a lot heavier, but there will be no increase in pay—you just have to be ‘more flexible’.
The problem for the Howard government was that employers moved faster than expected in slashing and burning employee conditions and it was becoming more and more obvious to the Australian electorate that it had been badly misled by John Howard and his Work Choices minister. With a federal election looming, the Howard government attempted a number of manoeuvres to get out of the mess it had created, all of which failed miserably. The Howard government’s cover had been blown by the actions of too many employers, and Australia’s voters were not going to have a bar of it. While there continued to be an information blackout on the effects of Work Choices in workplaces, in April 2007 information was leaked to the media that revealed that 44 per cent of Australian workplace agreements excluded all 11 protected award conditions.
The Howard government’s Work Choices legislation was born in deceit and was clothed in deceit. Nothing demonstrated this more than the claims by Howard government ministers that Work Choices provided individual employees the ability to bargain productively and constructively with their employers. For the vast majority of employees this was simply never the case. In fact, Work Choices did the exact opposite: it destroyed the bargaining power of most Australian employees. The erosion of the bargaining power of employees for fair pay and conditions was a feature of the Howard government’s years in office.
Indeed, one of the most discouraging facets of modern business has been the increasing disconnect between the interests of business and those of the community and of the workforce. Unfortunately, some segments of business have increasingly put short-term gain before the long-term interests of the community. We saw this in the increasing use of outsourcing and contract labour, the deskilling of the workforce and the loss of apprenticeship positions. Despite the rhetoric, rather than building the future the emphasis by many in the private sector had been on ‘screw the present and to hell with the future’.
As well, too many in private enterprise saw that the way to ever-increasing profits was by shifting the risk of doing business from the businesses to the workers and to the community in general. It is not difficult to gain the impression that the making of the current global financial crisis was in major part due to an abrogation by elements in the private sector of the sector’s broader responsibilities. Let me say also that it is no exaggeration to state that the Howard government encouraged and effectively sponsored an increasing disconnect between businesses and their greater responsibilities to employees and to the community.
As an example of this reality, I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate the situation concerning heavy vehicle drivers and owner-drivers. Having worked previously as a heavy vehicle employee and an owner-driver, I know more than a little about this subject. The major trucking companies and, by implication, the major users of heavy transport services have persistently refused to acknowledge that there is a link between oppressively low rates of pay and return to truck driver employees and owner-drivers and serious heavy vehicle crashes and fatalities. As far as some of the major trucking companies, the Australian Trucking Association and the major users of heavy road transport services are concerned, heavy vehicle road crashes are principally the fault of the drivers.
For a number of years the Transport Workers Union has been advocating on behalf of thousands of heavy vehicle drivers for safe rates of remuneration. This effort by the TWU has been supported by mounting evidence and direct experience of those in the industry that the current payment methods and rates of pay for heavy vehicle drivers are resulting in alarming rates of death and injury from heavy truck road accidents. In the year to June 2008, there were unfortunately no less than 263 fatalities as a result of heavy truck crashes, an increase of approximately 8.7 per cent over the previous year. Over the past three years the average annual number of deaths involving articulated trucks has increased, sadly, by five per cent per year. The truck drivers’ low rates of pay are the direct consequence of the weak bargaining position of owner-drivers and of the many hundreds of small trucking businesses who have little option but to accept poverty rates from the relatively small number of major corporations who make up the bulk of demand for heavy truck transport services.
If air transport companies got up to the same devices in the way they pay their pilots that the major road freight transport companies get up to in the way they pay their truck drivers, there would be a public outcry. In order to make a respectable living, it is now often impossible for drivers to maintain safe work practices. The major trucking companies have remained adamant that nothing should be put in the way of big business to extract even lower transport costs out of the nation’s truck drivers. The result is that most of the benefits of Australia’s highly efficient and competitive heavy vehicle transport sector have been captured by the purchasers of transport services and not the front-line workers in the road transport industry.
In July 2008, Julia Gillard, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations—together with Anthony Albanese, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, and Dr Craig Emerson, Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy—jointly announced that the National Transport Commission, the NTC, would investigate and report on driver remuneration and payment methods in the Australian trucking industry and make recommendations for reform. As the minister’s media release stated:
The trucking industry prides itself on being highly competitive and efficient. However, the industry’s strength can also be its weakness, with truck drivers often finding themselves in a weak bargaining position and unable to maintain safe work practices.
I remind the Senate that this was an issue that the Howard government was happy to ignore. The results of this independent inquiry were reported by the National Transport Commission in October 2008. In brief, the inquiry, conducted by the Hon. Lance Wright QC and Professor Michael Quinlan of the University of New South Wales, found:
This Review finds that the overwhelming weight of evidence indicates that commercial/industrial practices affecting road transport—
and I want to say this very clearly—
play a direct and significant role in causing hazardous practices. There is solid survey evidence linking payment levels and systems to crashes, speeding, driving while fatigued and drug use. This evidence has been accepted and indeed confirmed by government inquiries, coronial inquests, courts and industrial tribunal hearings in Australia over a number of years.
In contrast, in its submission to the safe payments inquiry, the Australian Trucking Association had this to say:
… the consensus view of the ATA—
being the Australian Trucking Association—
is that the most effective and appropriate way to further improve the industry’s on-road safety performance is to implement and enforce the impending Driving Hours and Fatigue Management effectively and that establishing a “Safe Rates” regime is—
and listen to this, Mr Acting Deputy President—
unnecessary and would be ineffective and unsustainable.
I cannot believe they said that—it is absolutely disgraceful.
Since the release of a report prepared for the National Transport Commission it has become impossible to deny that there is not a link between heavy vehicle crash fatalities and rates of pay received by heavy vehicle truck drivers. It will be interesting to see what action the large trucking companies are willing to take to save lives on Australian roads. I raise this example because it illustrates the double talk that typifies much of what is peddled by the opposition in regard to industrial relations policy. In this example we see how, too often, private sector entities—in this case, the Australian Trucking Association—are adept at muddying the water and denying the obvious when it comes to accepting a responsibility to pay drivers fair rates. This real life example shows that the employee-employer relationship is hardly ever a balanced one, and the odds are generally stacked, unfortunately, in favour of the employer.
To the great relief of Australian working families, the federal election was held on 24 November 2007. We all know the outcome: Labor was swept into power, with John Howard suffering the ultimate indignity for a Prime Minister of not only being tossed out of government but also being spurned by the electorate he had represented for 33 years. These events showed how arrogant and out of step with mainstream Australia the Liberal-National coalition government and John Howard had become during their period of office. John Howard’s Work Choices legislation demonstrated that a Liberal-National coalition—let us not forget The Nationals; let us not forget the doormats—should never again be trusted to enact fair workplace laws.
Nonetheless, it is important for the Australian electorate to remain alert to the fact that, even though the Leader of the Opposition has declared that Work Choices is dead, there is plenty of evidence—plenty of it—that extreme elements of the Liberal Party, particularly in the state of Western Australia, retain an ideological commitment to all that Work Choices stood for. The Liberal Party did not spend 20 years to get its extreme and unfair workplace ideology into law to still not harbour a desire to do it all again. It is important for Australians to take note that Work Choices might be dead, but the Liberal Party’s extreme industrial relations ideology is still alive and well. I am sure that, if WA Liberal politicians were given half a chance and had their way, Work Choices would be brought back to life as quick as a flash.
John Howard and the Liberal Party unashamedly devalued the human side of employment contract. These bills, together with the Fair Work Act 2008, restore the dignity of the compact between the employer and the employee. That is what hardworking Australian men and women deserve and should rightly expect. The Liberal Party has shown that it does not value the high standards of performance and commitment that Australian workers give to their employers through their work. I commend these bills to the Senate and congratulate the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations for restoring fairness and dignity to Australia’s system of industrial relations.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2009-06-15,"—It is with significant concern that I rise to speak and contribute to the debate about the Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill 2009 and the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009. This government promised that the award modernisation process, as part of its workplace relations reforms, would not increase costs for employers and would not disadvantage employees. When this place previously considered another piece of legislation and attempted to prevail upon the government to legislate that promise, government senators voted the promise down. If the government meant that promise at the time that it made that promise then why won’t the government legislate that promise? Unfortunately, the proof is now becoming part of the pudding, and the pudding is before us as part of the transitional legislation and the bill that we are about to consider in this place.
The government’s transitional bill may be seen by some to be legislating about half of the government’s promise, and that, of course, is the ‘about half’ that maybe addresses some of the concerns of workers, the concerns that the government keep its promises to workers that workers will not be disadvantaged by the government’s workplace relations reforms. The so-called fair work transitional bill attempts to reassure workers by making provisions for workers to obtain things like take-home pay orders. On the say-so of the union movement, representing employees, those proposed take-home pay orders are in themselves not only (1) a concession that workers do stand to be disadvantaged by the award modernisation process but (2) inadequate for a range of reasons. One of the most compelling reasons is that take-home pay orders are about cash and supposed loss of financial benefits—in other words, workers being supposedly financially worse off.
The union movement has been very clear in saying that the Labor government’s award modernisation process stands to disadvantage workers in ways well beyond financial disadvantage and that these supposed take-home pay orders spectacularly fail to address the disadvantage to be suffered by workers in ways other than financially. We have the government conceding that, on the face of its workplace reforms, yes, employees do stand to be disadvantaged by the award modernisation process, hence some mechanisms may be in the transitional legislation.
But what about the other side of the promise: that award modernisation will not increase costs for employers? That feeds straight back into the promise about workers, because, if costs are increased for employers, the testimony of employers is that unfortunately the jobs for workers will suffer. What do the government propose with this transitional bill? Oh, they propose a couple of things. They propose that, in certain circumstances, at the whim of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or Fair Work Australia, there may be a delay of up to five years in implementing the pain and the increased cost of award modernisation. The very clear and compelling evidence from business is that delayed pain is still pain, and it will still result in death—albeit delayed.
The Deputy Prime Minister, in her second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum, concedes yet again that the award modernisation will fail to keep part of the government’s promise. She concedes that the award modernisation process will increase costs for employers. In a further and failed attempt to address that, the transitional bill provides that if a business considers that its viability is threatened by the impact of award modernisation then that individual business may have the opportunity to put itself under public scrutiny and argue: ‘If this award modernisation process takes place and applies to me and my business, then the viability of my business will suffer.’ What business worth its financial salt is going to feel free to make a submission in public along those lines? A submission that ‘my viability is threatened’ is little less than sure to bring about the demise of the viability of that business. We have token solutions from the Deputy Prime Minister, token solutions from the government and, most compellingly, a concession that they have failed to keep their promise.
In the last couple of weeks, there has been an interesting development. The Deputy Prime Minister has said that award modernisation is going to have a particularly detrimental effect on some parts of the economy and has decided to vary her administrative request to the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in respect of the restaurant and catering sector. She says in a letter:
I have been provided with material that supports the claims—
from the restaurant and catering sector
that the modern award would result in significant cost increases for the restaurant, café and catering sector in many states and that the capacity of that sector to bear such increases, even with transitional arrangements, is limited.
There is, she continues:
... the potential for the modern award to impact upon the continuing viability of restaurant and café businesses which operate in an industry characterised by low profit margins and peak operating times of evenings and weekends.
The letter goes on to list eight grounds upon which she says she is relying in justifying her protection—understandable protection—of the restaurant and catering sector from the brunt of her award overhaul. She talks about things like the spread of businesses to be covered by the hospitality award operating on different business models and typically having streams of revenue from other activities, such as gaming and accommodation. She talks about high labour costs and about high award reliance. It should be little surprise to the government to know that there are many other sectors operating in Australia that consider that they face the same challenges as the restaurant and catering sector. They want the same as what the Deputy Prime Minister has given the restaurant and catering sector, yet the government has steadfastly refused, thus far, to give them the same.
I will illustrate by giving a couple of examples from, in part, my backyard in South Australia. The wine grape growing industry is across states but has a particular part in my home state of South Australia and in my former state of Western Australia. I want to refer to a letter from Mr Neil Delroy, who is Managing Director of Agribusiness Research and Management, which manages a number of vineyards. Mr Delroy has written to me to express his concern about the government, through the award modernisation process, grouping grape growers, farmers and primary producers in the wine industry award with those who process and pack grapes and retail wine. You would think that, based on the words of the Deputy Prime Minister in her letter to the President of the AIRC in the respect of the restaurant and catering sector, there might be some questions about operating on different business models. You would think that there might be some questions about businesses to be covered by the wine award typically having streams of revenue from other activities. Streams of revenue from wine are going to be a bit different from streams of revenue from flogging your grapes—and properly so. Mr Delroy writes about the proposed inclusion of the grape growing industry in the wine industry award having ‘a significant impact on our industry and an increase in labour costs.’ That sounds a bit like the Deputy Prime Minister’s letter to the President of the AIRC in respect of the restaurant and catering sector. He goes on to say:
None of the vineyards that we manage were profitable last financial year nor will they likely be this financial year. This is due to increasing operational costs ...
He then goes on to say:
Vineyard labour costs currently represent approximately 50% of the total site cost for grape growing.
It sounds to me like labour costs are a significant proportion of the operating cost, as they are in the restaurant and catering sector. He goes on to talk about vineyard operating times that are:
... to a great degree dictated by the elements of weather and optimal harvest times ... governed by climate and agricultural factors that are outside the control of management.
It sounds to me like peak operating times. It sounds to me like penalty hours and penalty rates, not unlike those referred to in the Deputy Prime Minister’s letter to the president of the commission about the restaurant and catering sector. And Mr Delroy says:
Vineyard operations rely heavily on wage and seasonal casual employees hence we have a very high award reliance.
Again, it is the same as the Deputy Prime Minister’s letter to the president of the commission about the restaurant and catering sector.
But that is not all. What about the cleaning services sector? Longford Cleaning is a South Australian based cleaning services business which wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister at the end of May referring to the Deputy Prime Minister’s promise that ‘award modernisation should not leave employees worse off or drive up costs for employers’. They are understandably confused about that promise because Mr Gibbie, a director of the business, says to me that the options for his business, in order to sustain the increases from this overhauled award process, will result in the loss of 75 to 80 per cent of their business if they were to pass on to their customers, or attempt to do so, the increased costs. They see no other end result than that their workers will be worse off:
... our workers will be worse off because they no longer have a job or they have less hours and therefore are no better off.
Mr Gibbie goes on to say:
In our industry, margins are slim, hopefully 5%.
The Deputy Prime Minister, in her letter to the President of the Industrial Relations Commission in respect of the restaurant and catering sector, refers to her own words: ‘comparatively low profit margins and high labour costs as a proportion of total expenses’. She goes on to cite Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, saying that in 2006-07 the average profit margin was 3.8 per cent for cafes and restaurants and 5.3 per cent for catering services. She goes on to compare that with a 12.7 per cent average for all industries. Well, Mr Gibbie says that in the cleaning services sector, industry margins are slim—hopefully five per cent, and that is if they are lucky. It sounds to me pretty much on a par with the restaurant and catering sector. So there are, understandably, other sectors in Australia that consider they have the same challenges as the restaurant and catering sector, and they reckon they deserve the same concessions that the restaurant and catering sector is apparently about to get. They want to know whether the government will give those concessions to them.
It is pretty clear that the government does not have a process to deal with these concerns from industry. They do not have a policy and they do not have a process. That becomes clear because the Deputy Prime Minister cannot clearly tell other sectors how they might stand a chance to get what the restaurant and catering sector seem to have got—industries like retail, fast food, pharmacy and cleaning services. They reckon they share the same reasons that Ms Gillard gave to support her saving of the restaurant and catering sector from the brunt of her award overhaul. But she cannot reassure those sectors, who reckon they face similar challenges, that they will get similar relief, and they do not know how to convince her that they need it. I asked Senator Arbib in question time today about whether the government would give the same to those other sectors who the government knows deserve it. He attempted to reassure the opposition and those parts of industry—horticulture, pharmacy, retail, cleaning services and fast food—with these concerns:
In the areas you raised—horticulture, pharmacy and retail—there is an examination going on right now by the department and the Deputy Prime Minister. I do not think that is any surprise because there is extensive consultation with the sector going on right now.
The horticulture, cleaning services, retail, pharmacy and fast food sectors deserve to know exactly what examination and extensive consultation with their sectors is supposedly going on right now because if the government is consulting with these sectors, when, where and how is it happening, and do these sectors know about it? Mr Mark McKenzie, Executive Director of Wine Grape Growers Australia, says to me that ‘wine grape production has not been conferred with by the government’ about the government’s decision to parcel it up in the wine industry award. So if there are examinations and extensive consultations supposedly going on with the sectors right now, it might be a good idea to let the sectors know about it.
If the industries facing similar challenges to the restaurant and catering sector actually get what they think the restaurant and catering sector has got and what the restaurant and catering sector thinks it has got, will it make any difference? Let us look at that. In acknowledging the valid concerns of industry, the Deputy Prime Minister says in her varied award modernisation request to the president of the commission:
... the Commission to create a separate modern award covering the restaurant and catering industry, separate from those sectors in the hospitality industry providing hotelier, accommodation or gaming services ...
She says that the commission should create a modern award. The Deputy Prime Minister knows full well that saying something should happen does not guarantee that it will happen. She then goes on to say, in respect of the restaurant and catering sector, the development of such a modern award ‘should establish a penalty rate and overtime regime that takes account of the operational requirements of the industry, including the labour-intensive nature of the industry and the industry’s core trading times’.
Once again the Deputy Prime Minister knows full well that ‘should’ does not guarantee ‘will’.

Ordered that the report be printed.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,35,2
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-06-15,"—I rise to speak in relation to both the Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill 2009 and the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009. I indicate that I will be supporting both bills at the second reading stage. I will not canvass what occurred during debate on the Fair Work Bill, which passed the Senate in March, and I do not propose to repeat these comments, but I wish to make three quick contextual points before moving on to the provisions of these bills, in particular the transitional provisions bill. As I said in March, Work Choices is dead, and I am not mourning its loss. I see that the purpose of this transition bill is to ensure that the final nails are smoothly struck and unable to come loose.
I wish to again thank the Deputy Prime Minister, and her office, for the manner in which she negotiated the amendments to the Fair Work Bill. I am pleased that as part of these negotiations there were a number of amendments ensuring better protections for outworkers, extending time limits for lodging unfair dismissal claims, expanding flexible working arrangements for parents of disabled children and establishing a specialist information service for small and medium businesses. I still maintain that a better deal could have been struck for small businesses in relation to unfair dismissal claims, but that is now water under the bridge.
It is my understanding that the vast majority of these two bills have the support of both the government and the opposition, so I will limit my specific comments to the amendments foreshadowed by the opposition. The coalition’s first amendments refer to the interaction of the NES and transitional instruments. Their intent is to prevent potential doubling up where the same condition is met twice under different parts of the instruments. It seems that the coalition has taken the term ‘detrimental in any respect’ in schedule 3, part 5, item 23 to mean that line-by-line comparisons will be made in relation to terms. It argues a doubling up may occur where the combining of conditions under previous arrangements has resulted in the term being exceeded against one line and then, because other new arrangements do not align neatly, met again under another line.
My understanding of the government’s response to these amendments is that it has concerns that the amendments could undermine some baseline NES protections and could result in non-negotiable NES protections being traded off for additional pay, while it is argued that workers do not suffer detriment overall. The coalition does not accept this and states that its intent is to maintain all National Employment Standards, but only to avoid the doubling-up resulting from a strict line-by-line approach. This matter would seem to be one of differing interpretations and I will be seeking more detail from both parties prior to the vote.
In relation to the coalition’s amendments to introduce no increased labour costs and to change default superannuation, I have indicated to both parties that I am disinclined to support these amendments and this was a debate that was had in the course of the Fair Work legislation earlier this year. I am always open to listening to the evidence, but I provided my reasons for not supporting these previously and I will not reiterate them. However, I am interested to hear from both parties about the operation of proposed changes to the five-year transition from existing arrangements to the new awards. I have made my views known publicly: that I am very concerned about the possible impact of these changes on the South Australian restaurant and catering industry, on aged care and on the horticulture sectors, particularly in the Riverland, which is an area that has been doing it very tough because of the crisis in the Murray-Darling Basin.
I am pleased to note that the Deputy Prime Minister has acted to address issues relating to the restaurant sector and note that the sector has expressed its satisfaction at her actions. That was welcome because it took into account the circumstances of that industry, and I welcome the Deputy Prime Minister taking that stand. As a result of the changes that have been foreshadowed, literally hundreds if not thousands of jobs in South Australia have been saved. The issues facing the aged-care sector are much more complex, and I look forward to talking to the government about ways to address the looming aged-care crisis. Obviously, it goes beyond the Deputy Prime Minister’s portfolio. I note that the Deputy Prime Minister has instructed the AIRC to use the full five-year transition period with aged care, and this is a positive step. However, I believe that the unique arrangement in the aged-care sector where the government controls public funding and regulates capacity to raise private funding is one that is pertinent to award modernisation.
How do employers pay high salaries and improve conditions if the government ties their hands so that they cannot raise the money to do so? While the five-year transition may be helpful, there are important issues in aged care, with nurses’ salaries and the shortage of nurses contributing to lower standards of care in that sector. The government must take seriously the calls by the ANF and the aged-care providers for increased funding for aged-care nurses. However, I do not support a separation of the award, as the Deputy Prime Minister did with the restaurants and hotels. Rather, it is for the government to increase funding to enable the pay and conditions of aged-care nurses to match that of their colleagues in the hospital sector.
As I said, I will be taking these matters up with the government in the coming days, but let me now deal with the specifics of the coalition’s amendment to the five-year transition arrangements that have been foreshadowed by Senator Abetz. My understanding is that the coalition wishes to enshrine the five-year transition as a default position from which the AIRC can use its discretion for a shorter period if it sees fit. This effectively flips the situation in the legislation to where the AIRC decides the length of transition up to five years. However, I note that the Deputy Prime Minister has publicly strongly encouraged the AIRC to opt for the five-year transition.
My understanding is that the government has concerns that this coalition amendment will allow award modernisation to be put off for five years, in effect delaying some economic pain that will be experienced by some employers at the end of the period. It was my understanding from previous discussions in relation to the Fair Work Bill that a multi-level, graduated approach would be used over the five-year period to minimise the impact, to avoid that short, sharp shock and to assist in the transition. I would like the government to provide specific details in relation to this in the committee stage to reassure me that a one-stage jump to the modern award arrangement could occur either initially, should the AIRC not heed the Deputy Prime Minister’s advice, or at the end of five years, if the government’s criticism of the coalition amendment stands.
Finally, there is the issue of representation orders. The coalition, through their amendments, want to clarify the conditions whereby representation orders can be made in the case of demarcation disputes, as well as a greater role for employers in these decisions. These are addressed in clause 137 of the bill. The coalition’s changes to clause 137(a) appear to be in response to a request for greater clarity from persons submitting to the committee inquiry, such as Professor Andrew Stewart, as well as in the dissenting report. I do not think that anyone could accuse Professor Stewart of being a friend of Work Choices. He has been a very clear voice and a voice very critical of Work Choices, and I think that he provides a robust analysis of these particular clauses.
As a principle, I support measures that produce greater clarity in legislation, and I think that represents responsible legislating. Further, I do not oppose in principle the possibility of an employer approaching Fair Work Australia to request an order if they are aware of disputes so that it is not so narrowly confined. I look forward to the government clarifying why these proposed changes are not desirable, particularly given the comments made by Professor Stewart. He indicated that he thought that there was real scope for change in relation to this to clarify what the position was. I think we need to heed the advice of Professor Stewart in relation to that.
However, I do not find the rationale behind the changes to clause 137(b) quite as clear, especially as to why the views of an employer are vital to making an order. I remain to be convinced, in terms of the coalition’s position, in relation to that. In the case where an employer has had a sound relationship with a union in the past and would like that to continue, surely that would be the first thing Fair Work Australia would look at when making an order. Does it really need to be stipulated? I look to the coalition to clarify why this particular change is necessary, and I seek information from both parties on the practical implications of adopting these amendments in relation to representation orders.
In summary, I look forward to further discussing this with both the coalition and the government and putting an end to Work Choices but in a way that has fair transitional arrangements. It is acknowledged that we are in tough economic times, the worst economic circumstances in some 70 years. We need to take into account these changed economic circumstances. We need to take into account the way that the horticultural industry, particularly in South Australia, is doing it quite tough, as is the aged-care sector, which I have referred to previously. The sort of flexibility that the government has shown in relation to the restaurant and catering industry, which is welcomed, is something that ought to be replicated in other industries to allow for that transition and to avoid the short, sharp shock.
It is also important to consider a broader context, and I think it was summed up pretty well by Kerry O’Brien on The 7.30 Report on 11 June. In prefacing an interview with the Deputy Prime Minister, he made the point that Australia may have just escaped falling into technical recession but, for the 100,000 people who have lost their jobs in the past nine months, the recession is here. My concern is that too many credible employers are saying that unless we have a transition that is relatively smooth and that is graduated, and unless you take into account the genuine economic circumstances in particular industries, you will see a spike in unemployment. People will be laid off, and that is something that needs to be avoided. It is a difficult balancing act but I believe it is a clear public policy imperative. I look forward to discussing this further with both the government and the opposition in the committee stage in respect of the amendments that will be moved and, no doubt, debated at length.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2009-06-15,"—I seek leave to continue my remarks on the second reading debate on the Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill 2009 and the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009 prior to the dinner break.
Leave granted.
—Other industries consider that they suffer the same as the restaurant and catering industry, and they want to know why they cannot have the same as what the restaurant and catering industry seem to have got. Requesting that something happen is, of course, no guarantee that it will happen, and that is what the Deputy Prime Minister has done, but that is all she has done. Professor Ron McCallum, a respected professor of law, is reported as having said that Ms Gillard has now got extraordinary powers. He said: ‘In the modernising process it is the minister that has the power to direct. This modernising process gives the power to the minister to order the commission to do things.’ Requesting that the commission should is no guarantee that the commission will. So it is open to the Deputy Prime Minister to order the commission to do things. Don’t just require that the commission should; order that they must. If the Deputy Prime Minister really meant her promise that costs will not rise for employers and that employees will not be disadvantaged, then she must order the Industrial Relations Commission to bring that about.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2009-06-15,"—I rise to speak to the government’s Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill 2009 and a related bill. These bills form part of a suite of legislation aimed at restoring integrity and fairness to our industrial relations system. These are the foundations—integrity and fairness—that once underpinned our industrial relations system. These are the foundations that were seriously battered and, in fact, butchered by the previous government. Most Australians remember only too well the introduction of Work Choices by the former government and the extraordinary national discussion that took place in the lead-up to the last election. We know that Work Choices saw the removal of the pay and conditions standards of tens of thousands of Australian workers. It affected penalty rates, holiday loading, redundancy pay, 38 hours per week of ordinary time and unfair dismissal protection for workers employed by an organisation with 100 or fewer employees. It is now widely acknowledged that Work Choices facilitated industrial relations changes which actively disadvantaged not only Australian workers but also their families. I received many letters and emails and had many face-to-face meetings with individuals and groups of workers and their partners who told of the devastation that the legislation had brought to their working lives and to the lives of their families.
When the Australian people went to the ballot box in November 2007 and cast their vote—their very deliberate vote—many would acknowledge that Work Choices was a factor in their consideration. The majority of those voters cast their ballots in favour of our Forward with Fairness policy, which means fairness for workers, fairness for employers and fairness for families. I do not propose to revisit the Work Choices debacle at any length this evening. Those dark days have gone. We look to the years ahead; we look to the future. The dark clouds have lifted, but we must remain vigilant. Despite those opposite acknowledging that Work Choices is history, it is apparent that many of those opposite still harbour, in their heart of hearts, lingering memories of the way things used to be—of the way things were. They cherish furtive ambitions to revive, in some coalition-led future, that draconian scheme. In partnership with the Australian people, Labor will work to ensure that this does not happen.
This government is fulfilling its commitment to the electorate—the electorate that rejected Work Choices and endorsed a return to fairness and balance in the workplace. It is a return to the idea of the civilised society that has underpinned our industrial relations system—with the exception, of course, of those few aberrant years prior to the last election when we lived under Work Choices. The civilised society has been prominent in Australia since the Harvester decision, in which, in 1907, the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, Sir Justice Higgins, set the first minimum weekly wage. It was the Harvester judgment that ensured that a worker received enough remuneration to provide decent food, shelter, water and frugal comforts for his family. It was the Harvester judgment that said that every Australian was entitled to every single one of these standards every day of their lives and that if we as a nation did not endorse this we could not claim to be a civilised society. With our Forward with Fairness legislation, we return to a civilised society.
The legislative architecture for our Forward with Fairness scheme includes the bills before us now. It is the product of consultation with a comprehensive range of stakeholders, including employee and employer organisations, small business, industry and state and territory governments. Amongst others, it included consultation with the ACTU and its affiliates, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Australian Industry Group and small business organisations. The full list of stakeholders is of course very lengthy. It represents levels of consultation and of inclusiveness in our approach that were, so patently and blatantly, absent in the approach of the previous government.
The Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009 contains transitional and consequential provisions intended to operate with the Fair Work legislation. This and the Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill 2009 will assist workers and business to move to the new workplace relations system with ease. This bill also finally repeals the current Workplace Relations Act, save for schedules 1 and 10. The act will be renamed the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 in light of the import of schedule 1. It will enshrine the application, from 1 January 2010, of minimum wages and National Employment Standards for all workers within the national system, including those party to instruments entered into before the new system starts.
The National Employment Standards ensure that all workers will be entitled at the very least to: the minimum rate of pay as set out in a modern award, from 1 January 2010; personal, carers and community service leave; the right, under certain circumstances, to request flexible working conditions; notice of termination; redundancy pay where 15 or more workers are employed; long service leave; and public holidays. These will apply to all workers from 1 January 2010, and will prevail in circumstances where a transitional instrument is detrimental by comparison. There is provision for the phasing in of minimum wages in certain exceptional circumstances. By the same token, the bill ensures that employees’ take-home pay will not be adversely impacted by transition to a modern award. And Fair Work Australia will be empowered to make orders to remedy any reduction to take-home pay for both individuals and groups.
The bill also sets out protocols for the treatment of existing instruments—namely Australian workplace agreements—and for award based instruments such as unmodernised awards and so on, once they are replaced by modern awards. The provisions will also allow parties to enterprise awards, or notional agreements preserving state awards derived from state enterprise awards, to seek the modernisation and integration of their award into the modern system. Pay scales, minimum wage guarantees and related minimum entitlements will be protected until 1 January 2010, when the National Employment Standards and modern awards will commence.
Also addressed in the bill are transitional bargaining and agreement-making arrangements. This means that workers presently party to individual statutory agreements will be able, by agreement with employers, to enter into a conditional termination agreement which will allow those workers to take part in collective bargaining. Once a new enterprise agreement is approved, the current agreement will cease. Upon its commencement, the bill will abolish the Workplace Ombudsman, whose functions will then be performed by the Fair Work Ombudsman. Fair Work divisions will be established in the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. Fair Work inspectors will have new powers to ensure compliance with the new rules.
The bill amends schedule 1 and confers on Fair Work Australia the power to make representation orders with regard to union demarcation disputes. In addition, state registered organisations that meet particular criteria will be recognised in the new system whilst still retaining their state registration. With reference to modern awards, the new system will trim down the number of existing awards and make them simpler to locate, read, interpret and apply. Anomalous state award conditions will be phased out over a five-year period, after which they will adhere to the national standard. This will ensure a full five-year period for employers and employees to adjust to the new modern award standard. Modern awards will be reviewed two years after commencement to make sure that they are operating satisfactorily. Thereafter they will be reviewed every four years. Award modernisation represents a practical and long overdue reform of our industrial relations instruments.
The provisions set out in this bill have been given serious consideration, providing genuine opportunity for all parties to have their input. They provide certainty for all parties with an interest in the employment contract. They are fair. The provisions provide employees with a fair safety net of employment conditions that cannot be stripped away. Ultimately, the provisions in the bill provide a right to challenge a harsh, unjust or unfair dismissal for employees. They have as their basis good faith and goodwill, and the endorsement of the Australian people. As I said in this place on a number of occasions, Work Choices reduced people—real living working people with families, relationships and community bonds—to factors in an equation based on the politics of division. This bill and related Fair Work legislation puts an end to that sorry chapter in our national life. I commend the bills before us to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-15,"—At the 2007 election Labor promised to get rid of Work Choices and create a new, fair and balanced workplace relations system. The Fair Work Act 2009, which received royal assent on 7 April, delivers on that promise. The two bills being debated cognately today, the Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill 2009 and the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009, provide for the sensible and measured transition of employers and employees into the new system. The new workplace relations system created by the act starts on 1 July 2009 and will be fully operational by 1 January 2010. Obviously, given those commencement dates, the speedy passage of the legislation is critical. The new system will balance the needs of employees and employers. This balance reflects an unprecedented degree of consultation by this government with employee and employer representatives, as well as with state and territory governments. Representatives from these groups have provided valuable feedback at meetings of the Committee on Industrial Legislation, which examined the two bills before us today, as well as having examined the Fair Work Act itself.
At all stages in developing and drafting a new framework we have responded to legitimate criticisms and issues raised by all sides. No side got everything it wanted, but the result of our consultation approach is that we have succeeded in balancing fairness and flexibility to ensure that Australia will be competitive and prosperous without compromising workplace rights and guaranteed minimum standards. When introducing the then Fair Work Bill 2008 into the House of Representatives on 25 November 2008, the minister indicated that the government would introduce separate legislation to set out transitional and consequential changes to ensure a smooth, simple and fair transition for the new system while providing for certainty in employment arrangements. These transitional and consequential changes are provided for in these two bills now under consideration. The two bills, once enacted by the parliament, will operate with the Fair Work Act and will transition employees and employers into the new workplace relations system simply and fairly.
Let me remind the Senate of the key provisions of the bills. The Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009 repeals the current Workplace Relations Act 1996 other than schedule 1, which deals with registered organisations, and schedule 10, which deals with transitional registered organisations. The Workplace Relations Act will then be renamed the Fair Work Registered Organisations Act 2009. The bill provides for the application of the 10 National Employment Standards and minimum wages to all national system employees from 1 January 2010, including those covered by instruments made before the commencement of the new system. The bill ensures employees’ take home pay is not reduced as a result of any transition to a modern award from 1 January 2010. The bill sets out rules in relation to the treatment of existing industrial instruments in the new system and includes arrangements to enable bargaining under the new system to commence in an orderly way.
The bill includes arrangements for the transfer of assets, functions and proceedings from the Workplace Relations Act institutions to Fair Work Australia and the Fair Work Ombudsman. The bill also includes consequential amendments to create the fair work divisions of the Federal Court of Australia and the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia. On 19 March 2009 the Senate referredthe Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, which reported back on 7 May. The government carefully considered the Senate committee’s report, as well as the detailed submissions, and as a result it proposed a number of technical amendments to improve the bill when the House of Representatives considered its provisions.
These amendments included the following: amendments ensuring special low-paid bargaining determinations are accessible to workplaces that no longer have an operating collective agreement, providing the other criteria are satisfied; amendments preserving the interaction between transitional instruments and state and territory laws; technical amendments ensuring that the transitional arrangements in place for outworkers protect their existing terms and conditions and that outworker unions can properly enforce outworker entitlements; and amendments ensuring registered employee and employer organisations are able to represent their members in the fair work divisions of the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. The government’s intention through the consultations and through the Senate committee was to seek views in order to improve the bill, and those amendments were duly brought forward and are represented by the amendments I have just described.
I can foreshadow a small number of government amendments will be moved to the bill. In relation to protected action ballots, the bill currently provides that protected action ballot orders and authorisations under the Workplace Relations Act are of no effect from 1 July 2009. The government proposes an amendment to allow limited preservation of Workplace Relations Act protected action ballot authorisations after 1 July 2009 on application to Fair Work Australia. Strict criteria will need to be met before Fair Work Australia may make such an order. In relation to registered organisations, the government proposes a number of amendments to further assist state and federally registered organisations to rationalise their affairs and simplify their operations across multiple jurisdictions. The amendments include changes to the provisions allowing federal organisations to extend their eligibility rules to reflect the broader rules of an equivalent state association, and ensure that settled demarcations are not reopened by allowing Fair Work Australia to make a federal representation order that reflects a state order in situations where a federal organisation has altered its eligibility rules to reflect those of an equivalent state association.
In relation to an amendment by Senator Fielding regarding small business employers, the government proposes an amendment to provide a transitional definition of ‘small business employer’—that is, an employer with fewer than 15 full-time equivalent employees—until 1 January 2011 for unfair dismissal purposes. This amendment gives effect to the agreement reached between the government and Senator Fielding to secure the passage of what is now the Fair Work Act. The calculation of the number of full-time equivalent employees is based on the number of ordinary hours of the employer’s employees over the previous four weeks. Where an employee has been on leave associated with the birth or adoption of a child for more than four weeks, their hours of leave are excluded from the calculation.
I now turn to the Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill 2009. The bill marks the next step in the creation of a national workplace relations system for the private sector in Australia—a key election commitment of the government. The bill amends the Fair Work Act to allow states to refer matters to the Commonwealth with a view to establishing a uniform national workplace relations system for the private sector. In addition, the bill makes transitional arrangements for Victorian employees and employers who are currently covered by the Workplace Relations Act as the result of an earlier referral of powers and who are very shortly expected to be covered by a new referral from Victoria. On 4 June 2009 the Fair Work Bill was introduced into the Victorian parliament. The bill provides a text based referral of power to underpin the application of the Fair Work Act to all Victorian employers and their employees. The bill has now passed through both chambers of the Victorian parliament and is due to receive royal assent later this month. This will ensure that there are no interruptions in coverage for the working people and businesses of Victoria.
Victoria is the first state that will be referring its powers under the bill. I am very pleased to note, however, that South Australia and Tasmania have expressed their intention to join Victoria in making a text based referral of powers on workplace relations matters to the Commonwealth and are now negotiating their final details. Queensland has indicated in-principle support for joining a national workplace relations system for the private sector, subject to a number of key issues being resolved. The bill establishes a framework that can be adapted in future Commonwealth legislation to accommodate anticipated future referrals from other states. We are continuing to work cooperatively with the other states to achieve a uniform workplace relations system for the private sector. Over the coming months, we anticipate that they will choose to become participants in implementing this crucial national reform.
The bill also makes transitional and consequential arrangements to 67 Commonwealth acts that refer to parts of the Workplace Relations Act that will be repealed by the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009. The bill replaces those references with references to corresponding concepts, institutions and instruments in the Fair Work Act. Together, these two bills now before the house represent the final batch of legislation needed to complete the transition to Australia’s new workplace relations system. With the repeal of the Workplace Relations Act and as a result of these measures, we will see the final removal of the unfair Work Choices system, which the Australian people rejected when they rejected the Liberal Party at the last election. The death rites of Work Choices are now being administered and we are getting ready to see the Fair Work Act spring into life. The sensible and practical measures in the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill will help to pave the way for the smooth and effective delivery of a balanced, modern workplace relations system for Australia.
The Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill offers clear proof that the government is well on its way to achieving, through cooperation and consultation with state governments, a uniform national workplace relations system for the private sector in Australia—quite a reform. The arrangements set out in these two bills will ensure that the transition to the new workplace relations system is seamless. The new national system is good news for Australia because it is based on fairness for working people, flexibility for business and the promotion of productivity and economic growth for the future prosperity of our nation. That is what the Labor government promised the Australian people at the 2007 election and that is what we are delivering. Given that the Australian people repudiated the opposition’s industrial relations laws at the last election, we are hoping opposition senators do not try to clutch onto Work Choices through procedural delay and tricks but actually fulfil the voice of the Australian people and expedite passage of this legislation so that our new system can commence on time on 1 July this year and we can finally see the end of Work Choices. I commend the bill to the House.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-06-15,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the coalition on the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008. I think it is interesting to first take a look at what this legislation is aiming to address, which of course is cartels. A cartel is an anticompetitive arrangement between two or more businesses. In its simplest form, it is an agreement between competitors not to compete. Cartels disadvantage consumers because they reduce their choices and ultimately lead to higher prices. Here in Australia we are of course not immune to cartel operations. In recent years we have seen the application of civil penalties for cartels, most notably with the Visy case in Victoria, which related to alleged price-fixing behaviour. This case has been described as the most serious cartel case to have been ventilated in our country.
The mere existence of previous cartel operations indicates clearly that the penalties available have not been adequate in deterring serious cartel activity. Not only does our recent history indicate the existence of cartels but also in Australia we have some of the globe’s greatest concentrations of ownership, and this creates an environment that is potentially more conducive to the creation of cartels. A prime example of this is the retail sector—particularly in groceries, alcohol and hardware sales—which has been the focus of much debate about this sort of activity. Top of mind, of course, is the duopoly of Woolworths and Coles, who have cornered over 70 per cent of the Australian grocery market. While I hasten to say I am not suggesting for one moment that Coles and Woolies are running a cartel, this example indicates how close to home concentrations of ownership are for the Australian consumer and why it is important that we have vigilant laws that serve to deter the creation of cartels and ensure consumer protection.
The legislation before us this evening in the Senate gets tougher on hardcore or serious cartel conduct by the application of criminal sanctions in order to deter and detect criminal cartel conduct. It proposes to make it a criminal offence if a corporation makes or gives effect to a cartel provision—that is, conduct which can be described as price-fixing, restricting outputs in the production or supply chain, allocating customers, suppliers or territories, or bid rigging. The maximum penalties for offences under the new legislation will be, for an individual, a maximum jail term of 10 years imprisonment and a fine of $220,000 and, for a corporation, a fine that is the greater of $10 million and three times the value of the cartel.
When the coalition were in government we had identified the risks to the consumer that so-called hardcore cartels present. The need for tougher penalties, such as those described just now, was a key recommendation of the 2003 Dawson review of the Trade Practices Act. In supporting the passage of this bill through the Senate this evening, I am reinforcing, however, the coalition’s renewed commitment to the prevention and deterrence of serious cartel conduct in the future. We believe that the penalties will be a sufficient deterrent to businesses but, most particularly, will deter individuals.
It is important that this legislation is brought into effect, not only for the benefit of domestic consumers but also for Australia’s international relations and trade. Consistent legislation between different countries and trading partners in particular is important in a globalised world where businesses and cartels operate across various jurisdictions. The new legislation will ensure that Australia meets the OECD’s 1998 guidelines, which recommend that member nations ensure that their competition laws halt and deter hardcore cartels. It will also bring us into line with over 15 OECD nations, including the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. These countries already have similar sanctions in place.
Having referred briefly to the reasons why we in the coalition believe this legislation is warranted, I would now like to mention the legislation itself. The recent Senate Standing Committee on Economics inquiry into this bill highlighted some concerns regarding the nature of the legislation we are considering. The first major concern identified is the lack of a definition of and mechanisms to distinguish criminal cartel conduct. Essentially the bill does not establish the exact point at which an activity goes beyond a civil cartel offence, dealing with anticompetitive conduct, and becomes a criminal cartel offence deserving of a jail term.
My concern here is that this creates uncertainty. How will the ACCC, the regulatory body responsible for identifying this activity, decide which matters will proceed to criminal prosecution and which will only be dealt with as a civil penalty? At what point does one identify that coordinated activity is actually hardcore cartel activity? There is a risk that even ordinary commercial transactions could be captured under the bill’s criminal offences, and this is a matter of some significance.
The Senate committee report has identified this weakness in the legislation as drafted, indicating that while the bill states:
... that a criminal cartel must have both a ‘physical’ and ‘fault’ element ... the physical element of a criminal cartel provision is not explained. The prosecutor therefore has only broad guideposts as to whether to treat an activity as a criminal, as opposed to a civil, offence. ... the bill thereby creates uncertainty as to which matters would proceed to criminal prosecution and which would only be dealt a civil penalty.
I believe we will need to agree that, while this situation is far from ideal, a simple approach to defining what is criminal and what is civil for these particular circumstances may never be resolved because so much will depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular situation at hand. In fact, the ACCC has foreshadowed these concerns, stating that ‘whether a particular conduct should be treated as criminal or civil will depend on the particular circumstances of the conduct’ under investigation.
The second concern identified in the report is the nature of the joint venture defence. There are two arguments focused on this area of concern. Some critics claim the defence is too narrow and will limit legitimate business activities. This means commercial arrangements and conduct that are not currently prohibited under the Trade Practices Act might be inadvertently captured as cartel conduct. On the other hand, some who have looked carefully at this believe that the joint venture defence is too broad and would allow illegitimate cartel conduct to go unpunished. This means the joint venture defence will provide a shield for illegitimate cartel conduct.
The Senate report examines these issues in great detail, describing all manner of existing joint business arrangements and potential joint ventures and how they will be affected by the proposed legislation. While it aims to address each of these individual concerns, as a whole the mere existence of this number of concerns and different situations between businesses that are in some form of joint venture indicates how difficult it will be to identify and prosecute criminal cartel conduct in the future, particularly in relation to those parties that participate in joint venture agreements or that operate with coordinated activity. The only clarity that I have been able to glean from this is that consistent application of the legislation threatens to be murky. It is most likely that once again this part of the cartel investigation will be best settled based on the facts of each particular case.
The third concern is the level of discretion and potentially the extra workload that will be incumbent upon the ACCC who, as I mentioned earlier, have been given responsibility for determining which alleged cartel activities to pursue criminally and to forward information on to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. The ACCC has emphasised that the bill provides persons with the capacity to seek authorisation from them if they wish to engage in coordinated activity without legally binding agreements and in circumstances not involving joint production or supply. While this measure allows for those who might engage in activity that is coordinated but not a cartel, it highlights that the bill’s joint venture defences would shift a heavy burden onto the ACCC to conduct an authorisation process for all joint ventures not formed through a contract and not engaged in activities relating to the production and supply of goods and services.
The Senate committee report has also addressed these concerns, indicating that the claim that the bill would give the ACCC too much discretion in determining the pursuit of criminal cartel cases is overstated. The ACCC currently exercises discretion on a range of trade practice related matters which require it to investigate activities and to assess possible breaches of the act based on all the relevant circumstances. Because this bill has been a long time in the making—or at least the consideration of the issues has had a very long gestation—I have taken the time to highlight these three concerns as they all point to the fact that, in the first instance, the success of this bill in bringing criminal cartel activity as a matter of law will be subject to interpretation and action taken by the ACCC. As pointed out in the Senate committee report:
... Treasury emphasised the importance of giving the ACCC flexibility to investigate a matter on civil grounds, but with the option of going down the criminal path where appropriate.
The bill certainly provides this flexibility. The question is whether it provides too much to the point where the business community and the public at large could not be sure what will and what should guide the ACCC in pursuing criminal cartel investigations. In this instance, I welcome the Senate committee’s recommendation that, following the passage of this bill, the ACCC publish guidelines on what is and is not acceptable activity in relation to cartels. I believe that is very important. This requirement should help to address the concerns I have just indicated. It is a recommendation that I think is very germane to the consideration of this bill.
Perhaps of greatest concern is whether we have achieved the right balance—we hear a lot about getting the balance right. Again, I refer to the committee report, which states:
The bill’s undisputed strength is in establishing criminal offences and penalties for cartel conduct and providing the regulator with the flexibility needed to successfully prosecute such cases. Its weakness is this flexibility creates a level of uncertainty.
Clarity and certainty is vital if proposed legislation is to be an effective deterrent against cartel activity—indeed any activity to be the subject of legislation. Without deterring day-to-day business activity there is obvious concern that the bill in its current format is struggling in some areas to meet those requirements. However, trying to get the balance right, the other side to this argument which I believe should prevail and guide us is that this is such a complex area that it can only be investigated and addressed as the law develops on a case-by-case basis.
So, while I think it is fair to say that the legislation might be somewhat woolly, it is a situation that I think requires us to look at the bigger picture. We would not want to see this legislation delayed, particularly as the inherent nature of the many different permutations that can arise between two businesses operating together, or indeed in competition with one another, is such that it could be almost impossible to be able to nail down or define with precision and exact rulings what can be defined as criminal behaviour.
Whilst I certainly have misgivings as to some of the provisions in this legislation that we have under consideration, I do think that as a matter of principle it is important that the opposition signify our support for the bill and also indicate that we hold the view that a hard line must be taken against cartel conduct. Cartel behaviour is nothing less than theft from the Australian consumer. I think this bill has the potential to even the ledger. It is another step to ensure consumers get the best product or service for the best price. Given that cartels may operate across jurisdictions, it is also important and indeed advantageous that the Australian laws are harmonised with those of other major economies. However, such is the nature of the legislation that its successful implementation is very much a work in progress and it will only be established as individual cases come forward and the law is applied. I think it is very important that we all carefully monitor how this law is applied. Under those circumstances, I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (CARTEL CONDUCT AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2009-06-15,"—I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008. This bill delivers on the Prime Minister’s election commitment to the protection of Australian consumers and it represents a long overdue and very specific legislative response to the criminal complexion of cartel behaviours. There are two types of cartel behaviour. A cartel may be broadly defined as an anticompetitive arrangement between two or more businesses. Such arrangements have the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. Alternatively, the arrangement is identified as anticompetitive by way of an exclusionary provision or provisions. These are provisions in an agreement that prevent, restrict or limit the supply of goods or services to, or the acquisition of goods or services from, particular persons or classes of person by any of the parties to the arrangement where those parties are potential competitors or actual competitors.
We have all become familiar with anticompetitive arrangements, particularly price fixing, in recent years due to their exposure and discussion in the media, and I welcome the shining of the light of scrutiny on such secretive and dishonest dealings. Such agreements are to the detriment of all businesses and all consumers. There are of course gradations in cartel conduct. In 1998 the OECD adopted the definition of hardcore cartel conduct as:
An anti-competitive agreement, anti-competitive concerted practice or anti-competitive arrangement by competitors to fix prices, make rigged bids or collusive tenders, establish output restrictions or quotas or share and divide markets by allocating customers, suppliers, territories or lines of commerce.
This definition still applies within the OECD and it is hardcore cartel conduct—we call it serious cartel conduct—that we are here to discuss today in the context of the Trade Practices Act.
The Trade Practices Act was introduced, I am proud to say, by the Whitlam government in 1974. Its intention was then and continues to be the safeguarding and enhancement of Australia’s welfare through the promotion of competition, fair trading and consumer protection. The act encompasses just about all market transactions between suppliers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers and between competitors. It captures anticompetitive conduct, unfair and unconscionable practices, mergers and acquisitions, product safety and labelling, prices, and industry regulation. It remains an outstanding piece of legislation and a tribute to the government that saw its passage through the parliament—that is, and I say it again, the Whitlam Labor government.
After 35 years in operation the act requires amendment to reflect movements and developments in technologies, business practices, markets and economies both locally and globally. The current part IV of the act does not specifically mention the term cartel. It does refer to anticompetitive conduct being conduct which is per se, of itself, regarded as anticompetitive. Such conduct, which includes price fixing and resale price maintenance, is prohibited because it is so likely to be detrimental to economic welfare. Part IV also prohibits other conduct subject to a competition test. So item 2 of schedule 1 of the bill inserts a new definition, that of cartel provision.
Additionally, part IV in its present form does not incorporate criminal sanctions for cartel conduct. Such a state of affairs is unsatisfactory and cannot continue. Indeed, its remediation is long overdue. It was back in April 2003, more than six years ago, that the Trade Practices Act review committee released its review of competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act. This is often referred to as the Dawson report, as the review committee was chaired by eminent jurist Sir Daryl Dawson. The committee and its chair really did not mince words. They did not resile from their responsibilities. They stated, in accordance with an ACCC recommendation:
… there should be criminal sanctions for serious cartel behaviour. … a satisfactory definition of serious cartel behaviour needs to be developed and there needs to be a workable method of combining a clear and certain leniency policy with a criminal regime.
Despite a reasonable amount of sound and fury, the former government’s response to the Dawson report essentially signified nothing. No legislative action was taken. Why this is so is open to speculation, but perhaps I will leave that to others. However, it has been left up to Labor to do the decent thing, and that is what we intend to do.
The purpose of establishing criminal penalties for dishonest collusive conduct of the types I have outlined is threefold. The first is to provide an effective deterrent to engaging in the conduct—a deterrent of more immediate personal effect than the civil remedies now available. As the then Assistant Treasurer recently remarked in the other place:
The … bill includes a maximum 10-year jail term for individuals who partake in cartel conduct. The possibility of criminal sanctions for company executives will increase the deterrent effect for businesses that may otherwise rationalise corporate fines for cartel conduct as the cost of doing such business.
After all, it is difficult to estimate a dollar value for the loss of liberty and the shame that accompanies a criminal conviction and a jail sentence. As the highly respected Professor Allan Fels said, ‘The law must not be blind to the colour of the collar.’ The second purpose of criminal penalties in this context is to make sure that there is fairness and consistency with other types of corporate and economic crime that also attract criminal sanctions—for example, tax evasion and insider trading. The third and final purpose for the establishment of criminal penalties is that such a move will bring Australia into line with international best practice. The United States has had recourse to criminal penalties for cartel conduct since the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act 1890 and it has strengthened its maximum prison term from three to 10 years. In 2003, the UK introduced criminal penalties that could result in an unlimited fine to an individual and/or up to five years in jail. Many other countries—among them Ireland, Germany, Japan, France, Israel and Canada—also provide for fines and imprisonment for crimes of this nature.
I will not go into exhaustive detail about the content of this bill. There are, however, some key features and provisions which are worthy of specific mention. The dishonesty element will be removed and the fault elements under the Criminal Code, being intention, knowledge or belief, will be applied to offences. A parallel system of civil prohibitions will be introduced to deal with serious cartel behaviours. This scheme will comprise the same elements as the criminal offences, but the latter will require proof beyond reasonable doubt. If parallel criminal and civil prosecutions ensue, the civil proceedings will be adjourned until the criminal proceedings are determined and, if the defendant is convicted, the civil proceedings will be discontinued.
The legal tests used to determine whether a provision qualifies as a cartel provision, as defined, have changed. The Telecommunications Interception and Access Act 1979 will be amended to allow the use of telecommunications intercepts in investigations. A joint venture defence will apply in civil and criminal actions if the parties to an agreement are or will be carrying on a joint venture and the cartel provision goes to the purpose of that joint venture. A maximum 10-year term of imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000 for individuals will be established and augmented by the strengthening of sanctions for corporations. The protection of whistleblowers will be ensured and the offer of immunity to the first eligible cartel member to expose an arrangement will be available. In such cases, the ACCC will manage the immunity in consultation with the DPP. These measures are to be applauded.
Anticompetitive behaviours are abhorrent. They are morally reprehensible. The community rejects them. Our government will deal with them decisively. It is in the light of these strictures that I commend the provisions of the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill here this evening.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (CARTEL CONDUCT AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-06-15,"—in reply—I thank Senators Coonan and Wortley for taking part in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008. It was a very useful background of some of the cartel conduct in trade practices history.
For over a decade, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has recognised that hardcore cartels are one of the most serious and harmful forms of anticompetitive conduct. In 1998 the OECD recommended that members ensure that their competition laws halt and deter hardcore cartels. In 2005 the OECD proposed that countries should consider introducing and imposing sanctions against individuals, including criminal sanctions. The introduction of the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008 into the parliament demonstrates this government’s commitment to preventing and deterring serious cartel conduct. The bill brings Australia into line with over 15 OECD nations that provide criminal sanctions for such conduct. The government has listened carefully to the concerns of interested parties in developing the legislation. While the bill is modelled on international proposals, the elements it contains will ensure its effective operation within the Australian context. The government will monitor its operation to ensure that it meets its objectives.
On 4 December 2008, the bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics for inquiry and report. The committee produced its report on 26 February 2009. The committee as a whole recommended that the bill be passed by the Senate. I note that the government has moved additional minor amendments to clarify the meaning of ‘contract’ under the bill. The committee also recommended that, following passage of the bill, the ACCC issue guidelines on those factors that are, in all the circumstances, most likely to lead it to refer a matter to the DPP as a possible criminal offence. I note that the ACCC is awaiting the passage of this legislation to enable it to provide such guidance. I thank members of the committee for their efforts in reporting on this important piece of legislation. In particular, I want to refer to class competition orders, a matter raised by a Senator Xenophon in the minority report. I can state for the record that we are happy to consider this on a future occasion.
The bill demonstrates the government’s ongoing commitment to strengthening laws promoting competition. Strong, lawful competition is a key means of ensuring that consumers get the best product or service for the lowest price possible. The bill delivers on our commitment to move legislation to criminalise serious cartel conduct. The bill delivers for business, consumers and the economy because the sanctions it introduces will meaningfully deter such conduct.
Question agreed to.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-15,"—This evening I rise to make an adjournment speech on two families—the Malou family and the Irwin family. In October last year I had the fortune to meet a lovely Sudanese family through some Labor friends who tirelessly devote every Thursday to tutoring the five children in this family. They are Phil and Dawn Chapel. They started tutoring the children about 18 months ago through the St Vincent’s tutorial program. The members of the Sudanese family are mother Rosa, daughters Rania and Margaret, and brothers Joseph, Robert and Botros Malou.
Digressing slightly, in November 2008 I attended the opening of the Australian Wildlife Hospital, representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, the Hon. Peter Garrett. Steve Irwin converted an old avocado packing shed into the Australian Wildlife Hospital in 2004. The hospital was built in memory of his mother, Lyn Irwin, who was a pioneer in wildlife care and rehabilitation. At the opening, Terri Irwin, her children, Wes Mannion and I unveiled the new Australia Zoo Wildlife Warriors Australian Wildlife Hospital. The new $5 million, state-of-the-art Wildlife Hospital will continue in operation 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year to care for sick, injured and orphaned wildlife. The Australian government generously contributed $2.5 million towards the $5 million facility. The hospital specialises in the care of koalas and sea turtles but currently receives over 5,500 patients of all species each year, the majority of which are birds and reptiles. The hospital provides a vital veterinary service to the hundreds of volunteer wildlife rescuers and carers operating in the region.
Having received an invitation to revisit Australia Zoo, I arranged for the Malou family to visit the zoo with me. This special day was a highlight in December, not only for the Malou family but also for me. It was truly amazing. Wes Mannion, a long-term member of the zoo staff and a lifetime mate of Steve Irwin, met us at the gate. He spent the greater part of the day showing us the highlights of the zoo. We first went to the wombat enclosure and met the marsupials. This was followed by a trip through the snake enclosure. I was interested in hearing Wes’s commentary on the reptiles. He was very conversant with those particular species. Next stop for us was the ‘Crocosseum’. The show there was provided by various attendants, including Terri, Bindi and Robert Irwin, and Wes. It is truly amazing to see their professional delivery of this show. Their introductions were backed up by timely humour, and the crowd was involved from the start to the end of the show.
Having not been to the zoo since visiting some 15 years ago with my own family, I found this visit an excellent opportunity to see first-hand the brilliant achievements of the dedicated Irwins and their staff over this time. After visiting the ‘Crocosseum’ we went and visited various other enclosures. We met a variety of different types of animals. Australia Zoo is one of the biggest employers on the Sunshine Coast, with 629 staff, of whom 92 per cent reside in the local area. Australia Zoo’s philosophy is that if one animal could be saved then an entire species could be saved. Australian Wildlife Warriors are practising that philosophy every day around the world by contributing to the health of our environment and the wellbeing of wildlife. Australia Zoo is their major sponsor, funding all the administrative costs of the charity to ensure that all donations received are contributed towards the conservation and preservation of wildlife and habitat.
The objectives of the zoo are: to protect and enhance the natural environment; to provide information and education to the public and raise awareness of wildlife issues; to undertake biological research; to research, make recommendations on and act for the protection of threatened or endangered species; and to enter into cooperative arrangements with like-minded organisations. Not long after lunch we went to another enclosure where we were fortunate enough to meet the lemurs. For those people who are not aware of this species, they come from Madagascar. They are quite shy animals but with a bit of enticing with some food they were quickly eating out of our hands. Not far from there we went to the enclosure of the southern white rhinos and met one of the rhino boys: Swazi. I was amazed how placid this two-tonne animal was. We were able to handfeed and pat this incredible beast. From there we walked through the tropical bird sanctuary to the kangaroo enclosure, where Botros met his favourite marsupial: the kangaroo. We then travelled to the next location to handfeed three Asian elephants: Siam, Sabu and Bimbo. These huge mammals selectively picked fruit from our hands with their trunks and quickly put it into their mouths, only inches from us.
I would like to reflect on one of the objectives of the Irwins—that is, the Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve. The latest campaign the zoo is involved in concentrates on the Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve. The reserve was acquired by Australia Zoo in July 2007 through the Australian government’s National Reserve System Program. The acquisition of the reserve was an Australian government initiative to honour the work of Australia’s world-leading nature conservationist Steve Irwin. Australia Zoo is managing the reserve entirely for conservation purposes while providing for appropriate sustainable economic and cultural opportunities for traditional owners. The reserve comprises a total area of 135,000 hectares and is situated in the catchment of the Wenlock and Ducie rivers. Some 36 ecosystem types have been confirmed to date, comprising six rainforest types, seven wetland-riverine types, three open forest types and 20 tropical woodland types. This represents outstanding biodiversity.
There are several significant elements to note about the reserve. The reserve features four clusters of relic rainforest. These rainforests are listed on the Australian government’s National Heritage register. A series of perched bauxite springs have been located on the bauxite plateau. These springs represent a possible new and rare ecosystem type—and, along with the relic rainforests, a strong possibility exists that traditional Aboriginal medicinal plants of great pharmaceutical importance survive here. The Wenlock River is one of Australia’s most ecologically important rivers. The lower estuarine sections downstream from the reserve likewise provide crucial habitat for rare and threatened marine and estuarine wildlife, including spear-toothed sharks, dugong and Irrawaddy river dolphins. The Tentpole Creek section of the Wenlock system has the best estuarine crocodile nesting habitat in Queensland.
Reserve initiatives include: ongoing wildlife survey and monitoring work, where some 152 bird, 40 reptile, 14 mammal, 16 amphibian and 44 freshwater fish species have been recorded to date; long-term estuarine crocodile research, where some 15 crocodiles have been fitted with electronic pingers to date; and Arafura file snake research, where six snakes have been fitted with electronic devices and their biology, diving patterns and movements are being researched in Gibson’s Billabong. There has also been freshwater stingray research undertaken. Six rays have been fitted with electronic devices and are being tracked by the same river hydrophones as those used for the crocodiles.
There is currently a threat posed by mining in the area. I am informed that the integrity of the ecological and cultural values of the Steve Irwin Reserve and the long-term potential for economic opportunities for traditional owners are threatened by possible strip mining of bauxite on the western part of the reserve. The subsequent impacts would be irrevocable. They include the lowering of the landscape by three metres or more and the total loss of original biodiversity, including all vegetation, wildlife and the supporting bauxite substrate—which the various ecosystems have taken millennia to evolve and adapt to. The short-term economic benefits of a mine, with a lifespan of approximately 10 to 15 years, are negligible compared with protecting and managing a natural landscape with its intrinsic and in many cases unique natural and cultural values and associated potential long-term economic benefits to the traditional owners from greenhouse gas emission abatement projects and traditional medicine projects. The area of the Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve represents approximately one per cent of the bauxite area on western Cape York but is of exceptionally high conservation significance.
Recently the Queensland Labor government put forward a proposal to have the Wenlock River listed as a wild river under their special wild rivers legislation. The Queensland government have been involved in a broad consultation process and received submissions regarding this proposal. One respected elder from the Wenlock area in North Queensland who I have had the privilege to meet and who supports the Queensland government’s proposal is Mr David Claudie. He informs me that the listing and protection of the Wenlock River under the wild rivers legislation will lead to employment and better management practices for his people and other non-Indigenous people in that area. I hope the commitments, dreams and beliefs that David and the staff of the Australia Zoo aspire to are met with suitable alternatives to protect this truly amazing and unique part of our country.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Malou and Irwin Families</title>,Adjournment,40,1
