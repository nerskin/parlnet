"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2009-11-19,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that, at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting, I shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in my name for eight sitting days after today for the disallowance of the National Health Security (SSBA Standards) Amendment Determination 2009 (No. 1). I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the committee’s correspondence concerning this instrument.
Leave granted.

The correspondence read as follows—


National Health Security (SSBA Standards) Amendment Determination 2009 (No. 1)

13 August 2009

Minister for Health and Ageing

Parliament House
CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the National Health Security (SSBA Standards) Amendment Determination 2009 (No. 1) made under subsection 35(1) of the National Health Security Act 2007.  This instrument removes the requirement for persons handling Tier 1 (highest level biosecurity risk) security-sensitive biological agents (SSBAs) to undergo background checking. 
The Explanatory Statement notes that this is because the necessary supporting legislation has not been enacted and when that legislation is enacted, the Standards will be amended again to require background checks.  The Committee would appreciate your advice as to when the required legislation will be enacted, whether there is a possibility that persons who are employed to handle SSBAs could subsequently be removed from that role as a result of background checks, and why it is not possible to defer the commencement of this scheme until such legislation has been enacted.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 11 September 2009, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Determination.  Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Wortley
Thank you for your letter of 13 August 2009 seeking clarification on matters related to the National Health Security (SSBA Standards) Amendment Determination 2009 (No 1) (the new Determination) that I made under subsection 35(1) of the National Health Security Act 2007 (NHS Act).
I provide the following responses to the matters raised by the Committee.
Legislation that supports the SSBA background checking scheme
My Department is proposing to use AusCheck, an agency within the Attorney‑General’s portfolio, to provide background checking of persons handling Tier 1 security sensitive biological agents (SSBA). To facilitate that function, the AusCheck Amendment Bill 2009 (the AusCheck Bill), which was introduced in the Autumn 2009 sittings, will amend the AusCheck Act 2007 to enable the AusCheck background checking scheme to include purposes related to Australia’s national security.
The AusCheck Bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee (the Senate Committee) for report in June 2009. As the AusCheck Bill was not passed in the Winter sittings, I made the new Determination to omit the requirement for background checking from the SSBA Standards from 1 July 2009. The effect of this Determination is to defer the commencement of background checking until amending legislation is enacted.
In its report on 16 June 2009, the Senate Committee recommended that ‘a clause be inserted into the Bill clarifying that no background checking scheme may be established under either the AusCheck Act nor regulations promulgated under the Act in the absence of another Act of Parliament providing for the establishment of such a scheme.’ Consistent with that recommendation, amendments will be introduced to provide a comprehensive background checking scheme in the principal Act.
The AusCheck Bill will be debated in the Spring sittings and I expect to introduce the NHS Act amendments also in the Spring sittings. Following passage of the AusCheck Bill and the NHS Act amendments, the SSBA background checking scheme will be introduced and include new SSBA Standards, along the lines of the previous Determination, which will require background checking of persons that handle Tier 1 SSBA.
Removal of persons as a result of background checks
Currently Part 3 of the SSBA Standards requires entities to authorise persons to handle Tier 1 SSBA. An authorised person must be trained in the SSBA legislative requirements and not be excluded from handling SSBA under the NHS Act. On commencement of the SSBA background checking scheme, the SSBA Standards will require authorised persons to undergo and clear background checking.
It is possible that a person authorised to handle Tier I SSBA under the current SSBA Standards and who undergoes background checking (when that requirement commences), will not be cleared. Such a person could not continue to be an authorised person to handle Tier 1 SSBA. At the entity’s discretion, such a person could continue to handle Tier 1 SSBA as an ‘approved person’ who is supervised at all times by an authorised person.
Commencement of the scheme
The SSBA Regulatory Scheme commenced on 31 January 2009. The Scheme provides controls on handling SSBA including stringent requirements relating to the notification of the type and location of SSBA in Australia, along with Standards that must be met by entities handling SSBA. The SSBA Standards relate to matters such as the secure handling and movement of SSBA, along with personnel requirements and risk management strategies.
The Scheme will be further strengthened when background checking of personnel is introduced following passage of the supporting legislative amendments.
I trust that this clarifies the matters that the Committee has raised.
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter of 14 September 2009 concerning the National Health Security (SSBA Standards) Amendment Determination 2009 (No. 1) made under subsection 35(1) of the National Health Security Act 2007. This instrument removes the requirement for persons handling Tier 1 security-sensitive biological agents (SSBAs) to undergo background checking.
In your letter, you note the importance of background checks to the operation of the new scheme, and the intention that amendments will be introduced to provide a comprehensive background checking scheme in the principal Act.  The effect of this Determination is to defer the commencement of background checking until that amending legislation is enacted.
The Committee has two broad concerns with such an approach. First, given the significance of background checks, how is it possible to implement a scheme for handling security-sensitive biological agents without first undertaking background checks? Would it not be preferable to implement a complete (rather than an incomplete) scheme?
Secondly, could you please provide some further detail as to the likely consequences for a person currently authorised to handle SSBAs, who subsequently fails to satisfy a background check.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 22 October 2009, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Determination. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Wortley
Thank you for your letter dated 17 August 2009 in which you raise further questions about the proposed background checking scheme for persons handling Tier 1 security-sensitive biological agents (SSBAs).
I provide the following responses to the matters raised by the Committee.
The SSBA Regulatory Scheme
The November 2006 Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Report on the Regulation and Control of Biological Agents noted that there were few controls currently governing the security of biological agents in Australia. The Report found that regulation focussed on safety rather than security and that there was a particular need to regulate the secure storage, possession, use and transport of biological agents in order to minimise the bioterrorist risk.
Part 3 of the National Health Security Act 2007 establishes the SSBA Regulatory Scheme in response to the COAG Report. The Scheme was phased-in over an extended period to enable consultation with stakeholders in the development of operational details, procedures and administrative arrangements. The Scheme is underpinned by the following elements:
establishment of a List of SSBAs;
a National Register that collects information about the nature and location of SSBAs handled by entities/facilities in Australia;
determination of physical, storage, and personnel Standards for entities or facilities handling SSBAs;
National Health Security Regulations 2008 that provide further operational details including reporting; and
an inspection regime.
Many entities which operate the high containment facilities that handle SSBAs and other dangerous pathogens already have pre-employment checks for personnel who work with these agents. Under the SSBA Standards which came into effect on 1 July 2009 entities handling SSBAs must determine and maintain a list of personnel who are authorised to handle SSBAs.
The importance of the proposed background checking scheme is that it will formalise and mandate background checking for all entities that handle Tier 1 SSBAs. Background checking, which will be introduced as a requirement of the SSBA Standards, is one part of the multi layered controls of the Scheme. Given that other important elements of the Scheme have been operational since January 2009, I am confident that when background checking is introduced, an additional layer of control will further enhance the security of the Scheme.
Consequences for authorised persons who fail a background check
You request further detail on the likely consequences for a person who fails a background check. Such a person would not be legally able to handle Tier 1 SSBAs in an unsupervised context. However, at the entity’s discretion, such a person could continue to handle Tier 1 SSBAs, providing they are supervised at all times under line of sight by an authorised person.
I trust this clarifies the matters that the Committee has raised.
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter of 26 October 2009 in which you provide further information in relation to the Committee’s concerns with the National Health Security (SSBA Standards) Amendment Determination 2009 (No. 1).
In your response you advise that many entities already have pre-employment checks for personnel who work with SSBA agents.  The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether those checks are of the same nature as the background checks under the SSBA Scheme.
The Committee would also appreciate further information on the consequences for persons who fail a background check.  You advise that ‘at the entity’s discretion’ a person could continue to work under line of sight supervision. What is not clear is when this discretion might be exercised, and what happens if such supervision is not available.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on these matters as soon as possible but before 13 November 2009 to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Determination.  In the meantime, the Committee has given a notice of motion to disallow the Determination to preserve its ability to consider the instrument while it awaits your response.
Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Wortley
Thank you f/or your letter of 29 October 2009 requesting further information in relation to the National Health Security (SSBA Standards) Amendment Determination 2009 (No. 1) (the Amendment Determination).
As you are aware, this determination removed, for the time being, the requirement for background checking of persons handling Tier I Security Sensitive Biological Agents (SSBAs) or related sensitive information. The Amendment Determination was made as supporting legislation to enable the operation of the background checking scheme for the SSBA Regulatory Scheme has not as yet been enacted. Without this determination, it would not be possible for entities to comply with the SSBA Standards and they would inadvertently be committing an offence under the National Health Security Act 2007 (the NHS Act).
I note that the AusCheck Amendment Bill 2009 is currently being considered by Parliament, and that I will shortly be introducing a bill to amend the NHS Act, that will enable the operation of the background checking scheme for the SSBA Regulatory Scheme. Should these amendments be enacted, I would then intend to issue a determination reinstating the requirement for background checking of persons handling SSBAs or related sensitive information.
Until such time as those amendments are enacted, it remains important for the Amendment Determination to remain in place, so that it is possible for entities to comply with the SSBA Standards and the NHS Act.
In this context, I provide the following information in response to your questions.

Pre-employment checks

The pre-employment checks conducted by entities generally consist of criminal history checks. Should the relevant legislation be passed, the proposed SSBA background checks will assess a person’s criminal history against a set of disqualifying offences for the SSBA Regulatory Scheme, and include an ASIO politically motivated violence check. The proposed SSBA disqualifying offences would be framed to ensure that very serious offences that attract a term of imprisonment of at least 12 months are included. Any such offences would also be detected by pre-employment criminal history checks.

Consequences for people who fail a background check

As previously indicated, a person who fails a background check could only continue to handle Tier I SSBAs as an ‘approved person’ if they are supervised at all times and under line of sight by an authorised person. If such supervision is not available, a person who has failed a background check would be unable to work with SSBAs.
An entity has limited discretion to enable a person who may have failed a background check to handle SSBAs, as the SSBA Standards set requirements on personnel security with the objective that ‘the entity must ensure personnel management systems are in place to implement and manage biosecurity for SSBAs and related sensitive information.’ To achieve that objective, the Standards require that authorised persons have been trained in the requirements of the NHS Act, the NHS Regulations and the Standards. The inspection regime will monitor an entity’s compliance with the SSBA Standards. An entity’s discretion to approve a person to handle or access SSBAs will be considered in the context of the objective of this Standard and other relevant requirements.
These mechanisms will help ensure that the SSBAs continue to be handled securely to support the health and safety of all Australians.
I trust this clarifies the matters that the Committee has raised.

That the Senate—
notes that:
the Senate disallowed the massive reduction in MBS cataract surgery rebates pursued by the Rudd Labor Government, with the objective to have the MBS rebates for cataract surgery maintained at the ‘2008 Regulations’ level,
the Minister for Health and Ageing justified the massive 50 per cent cut to Medicare rebates for cataract surgery by arguing that the procedure was now ‘quicker and easier’ to perform and now took only about 15 minutes instead of the 45 minutes when the procedure was first introduced,
the Minister for Health and Ageing never provided any Australian data to substantiate those assertions, while an AMA survey of 334 ophthalmologists indicated that about 70 per cent of ophthalmologists took between 25 and 40 minutes to perform cataract surgery,
that it is further understood that the procedure band for cataract surgery has not been altered on the National Procedure Banding List, indicating no significant cost/time changes have occurred, and further
the Minister for Health and Ageing has so far failed to acknowledge that MBS rebates for cataract surgery:
have been reduced twice before since they were first introduced, by 30 per cent in 1987 and by 10 per cent in 1996, and
have been indexed by about 2 per cent per annum since 1996, below CPI and below AWE, to take account of productivity improvements;
the Minister for Health and Ageing or her department appear to have made some belated efforts to collect data to identify the average length of time taken to perform cataract surgery; and
orders that there be laid on the table by 12 pm on Friday, 20 November 2009:
any information the Minister for Health and Ageing, her office or the department has received, compiled or commissioned on cataract surgery times in Australia since the Senate successfully disallowed the reduced rebates for cataract surgery on 28 October 2009, and
any information held by the Government in relation to procedure bands for cataract surgery on the National Procedure Banding List since its inception, including the cataract surgery related procedure band information on the most recently updated National Procedure Banding List.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-11-19,"—by leave—I rise to make a short statement. The opposition will not be supporting this motion, for reasons we have outlined previously in this chamber. I reiterate that we have constantly indicated to the government that the number of sitting weeks for this year has been totally inadequate. People set their diaries, their electorate business and their personal commitments around a sitting schedule that is designed to commence at the beginning of the year. We have flagged that the government needs to seriously reconsider the number of sitting weeks next year in this chamber. We cannot continue with this low number of weeks and then allow the government to continually rearrange the hours of sitting on an ad hoc basis. We believe we should have a firm sitting pattern for an entire year, not constant rearrangement. We have probably made the mistake of being too compliant and given the government so many extra hours during sitting weeks this year that they now just take it for granted. We have constantly been saying, no, we will not be extending hours. The government needs to rearrange its program to include a sufficient number of weeks to deal with the legislation that this chamber has to deal with.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,8,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-11-19,"—by leave—I rise to make a short statement. Senator Parry is quite right. I reiterate that I have written twice to the Prime Minister—in September and then in October—pointing out the seriousness of the situation which we now see evolving, and recommending extra sitting weeks be scheduled before and after the session for the Senate. The Prime Minister did not reply. I had a letter from the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, who is not here at the moment, recommending this extension of sitting hours. No proper explanation was given as to why a much earlier rescheduling of the Senate time—which would have been a courtesy to all senators and constituents right across this country—could not be done. Instead, there was a disdainful view from the Prime Minister that the Senate would apparently jump to his offices’ dictates sometime this week or next. I hope that Senator Ludwig will take back to the government the very serious opposition to that form of cavalier treatment of the Senate. If the Prime Minister cannot read a written letter and bother responding to it, then he should read the Hansard. I recommend that the government take a very serious look at what is being said by the opposition, the Greens and other crossbenchers on this matter. It is no good getting up next week and bleating about matters that will not be dealt with because of the schedule. It will be entirely the fault of the government if that happens.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,8,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-11-19,"—by leave—I rise to make a short statement. We have had a very similar debate on this point before. The way it is going at the moment, it looks like we are going to do it daily. Quite clearly the government cannot manage this chamber. The shortfall of hours and days is their doing. The hypocrisy of it is that this government has set sitting days for next year at 50 days—37 per cent fewer than a decade ago—and now you are coming in here, at the last second of the last minute, trying to scramble around for more time. We are nearly babysitting you. You cannot manage your way out of a wet paper bag. You have literally got yourselves into a mess. Quite clearly you had plenty of opportunity to fix this problem. We will have the same problem next year, and you will be doing the same thing in the last few weeks of next year—I bet you. You are not going to learn. So we will not be approving this, and you folks need to seriously consider how you manage this chamber. We nearly have to babysit you in this regard. It is a joke. It is an insult to the Australian public to think that you actually approved 50 sitting days next year—that is, 37 per cent fewer sitting days. I spoke against it before. It is outrageous.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,8,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2009-11-19,"—by leave—The opposition, the minor parties and the Independents, including Senator Fielding, are entitled as always to criticise the government program. However, it has usually been the case—at least when we were in opposition and the opposition were in government—that towards the end of the program it is difficult to identify what bills still need to be dealt with and what the priorities of the government are. So the opposition usually provides assistance to the government by ensuring that we do have extended hours so we can deal with the work. The reality of this place is that, until you provide a focus towards the end of the program to ensure that bills can be passed with proper scrutiny—many of the bills have already been through committees and a range of scrutiny that this place provides—the usual mechanism and the usual courtesy that is provided to the government to ensure that its legislative program is passed is to extend the sitting hours.
There are 20-odd speakers left on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation, which highlights that this opposition is seeking to delay its passage. It is seeking to ensure that the legislation in this place is not dealt with before we finish for the year. That is the clear indication that the opposition and the minor parties have given. However, I will not call for a division on this motion because I do not want to waste any further time in dealing with it. It is clear that the opposition are only on one track and that is to delay.

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2009-11-19,"—I present the report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, Economic challenges facing Papua New Guinea and the islands of the south-west Pacific, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—Do you wish to speak to the report?
—Mr President, the situation is that the report has been divided into two. The first part of the report is being presented this morning and the second part of the report will be presented on 24 December. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In its report on the island states of the south-west Pacific, the committee identified a range of impediments to economic growth in Pacific Island countries. Some of these are inherent structural problems that are beyond the control of these countries—small populations and land mass, a limited range of natural resources, remoteness and susceptibility to natural disasters being among them. These physical and geographical limitations often produce conditions that inhibit the ability of Pacific Island countries to develop their economies. These include little scope to achieve economies of scale, difficulties developing the human capacity necessary to support and sustain a growing economy, a narrow economic base, reliance on a small range of export products and the need to import key strategic products such as energy.
Despite these limitations, the committee found that many Pacific Island countries have the potential to lift economic performance and raise the living standards of their people. Yet a range of factors, largely human, prevent Pacific Island countries from unlocking this potential. Agricultural productivity, which, according to AusAID, has stagnated in the Pacific for the last 45 years, indicates the lack of progress being made by the islands. One of the main obstacles to increased economic develop-ment is inade-quate investment and planning in key economic infrastructure—things like roads, bridges, ports, the supply of energy, potable water, telecommunications, storage facilities, and aviation and shipping facilities.
The committee heard from Qantas in relation to this matter, particularly in relation to aviation activity around the region. Qantas described a situation where the majority of runways have poor markings and are often unfenced, navigation aids are intermittent, aircraft handling equipment is limited and ter-minal facilities do not meet current safety and security requirements. Shipping facilities in the region are inefficient, expensive and slow.
The lack of human capacity is another major impediment to economic development. Although unemployment, particularly among young males, is a major problem in the region, there is a chronic skills shortage across all sectors of the economies in the region. This absence was especially noticeable in relation to sustainable develop-ment; in land, resource, business and financial management; in marketing and trade negotiations; and in building and construction. The reasons for these shortages are largely to be found in an education system that in many parts of the islands, particularly Papua New Guinea, the Solomons, Vanuatu and Nauru is failing children and not providing the vital building blocks for economic and human development—for example, the committee heard that only 53 per cent of children in Papua New Guinea are enrolled in school, and of the children who start school only 45 per cent are expected to complete primary school. In cases where Pacific Islanders attain qualifications, there is the problem of brain drain or the flight of intellectual capital from the region.
The committee also found that economic activity is stifled and people are deterred from investing in many Pacific island countries because they are difficult places to do business. There were numerous examples of this: under-resourced and poorly equipped bureaucracies are unable to deliver essential services; regulatory environments frustrate rather than encourage enterprise; land ownership and limited access to finance and financial services inhibit economic growth; and political instability, law and order concerns and corruption dampen enterprise and discourage investors.
Let me turn to the matter of Australia’s aid to the region. Australia is the main source of aid to the Pacific. Through its extensive aid program, work is being done in agriculture, fisheries, forestry, mining, managing natural disasters, climate change, economic infrastructure, education, health, financial management, governance, law and order, land tenure and financial services. Across these many sectors, Australian funding is being used for research and development, for building and improving infrastructure, and for providing advice, training, education and technical assistance.
The committee recognised the fine work that Australia is doing through its aid programs to help Pacific island countries develop their economies and improve living standards for their people, but it also identified areas where Australia could increase the effectiveness of its assistance. It acknowledged that setting priorities from among the numerous competing needs is a significant and challenging task for the Australian government. Indeed, the OECD peer review of Australia’s development assistance praised AusAID as:
... a highly dynamic organisation working in an increasing number of sectors and trying to be responsive to the needs of partner governments.
But it also noted:
The downside of this positive attitude may be an attempt to do too much, leading to a loss of focus and/or dissipation of energy, thereby ultimately weakening impact.
Thus, one of the major challenges for the Australian government is to set a policy framework that provides a clear focus, one that enables it to target its aid to areas that are likely to provide the best means for Pacific island countries to achieve positive, long-term economic and human development.
In this context, the committee expressed a number of concerns about aid delivery to the Pacific that have direct relevance to Australia’s official development assistance program. The committee was of the view that Australia could do more to, among other things: ensure that aid reaches its intended beneficiaries or those most in need; respond to the urgent call from Pacific island countries to help them meet the challenges of climate change; find more effective ways to ease the burden on Pacific island countries of monitoring and policing activities in their exclusive economic zones and representing their interests in regional and international organisations; ensure that benefits deriving from Australia’s assistance do not fade as projects come to an end and funds and technical assistance are withdrawn; better align Australia’s assistance with the priorities of recipient countries and of other donor countries; make better use of the private sector to help alleviate poverty in the region and boost economic activity; strengthen Australia’s whole-of-government effort by having a more coherent plan and implementation strategy; incorporate the work of states, territories, local governments and NGOs in Australia’s assistance to the region; help improve the quality of statistics available on key economic and human development indicators; and foster a culture of continuous improvement in the delivery of its aid program by making the monitoring and evaluation of projects far more rigorous.
The committee made a number of recommendations addressing these areas. Some called on the government to give greater attention to the specific areas of climate change, tourism and the non-formal education sector; others required specific action in relation to these matters. The overarching recommendations, however, were concerned with improving the overall effectiveness of Australian aid.
To conclude my remarks, on behalf of the committee I thank the staff for the excellent support they gave us in the course of preparing the report and during the lengthy time it took to undertake our inquiries, and as usual I acknowledge the highly professional nature of that support. In contrast, I also note the lack of support and cooperation that the committee received from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. On numerous occasions the committee asked for its support to visit the region and to consult with various individuals who had knowledge and special information that might have been useful to us. Notwithstanding the efforts of the committee to press these inquiries on numerous occasions, we regrettably did not even receive the courtesy of a response.

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2009-11-19,"—I present the report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, Economic challenges facing Papua New Guinea and the islands of the south-west Pacific, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—Do you wish to speak to the report?
—Mr President, the situation is that the report has been divided into two. The first part of the report is being presented this morning and the second part of the report will be presented on 24 December. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In its report on the island states of the south-west Pacific, the committee identified a range of impediments to economic growth in Pacific Island countries. Some of these are inherent structural problems that are beyond the control of these countries—small populations and land mass, a limited range of natural resources, remoteness and susceptibility to natural disasters being among them. These physical and geographical limitations often produce conditions that inhibit the ability of Pacific Island countries to develop their economies. These include little scope to achieve economies of scale, difficulties developing the human capacity necessary to support and sustain a growing economy, a narrow economic base, reliance on a small range of export products and the need to import key strategic products such as energy.
Despite these limitations, the committee found that many Pacific Island countries have the potential to lift economic performance and raise the living standards of their people. Yet a range of factors, largely human, prevent Pacific Island countries from unlocking this potential. Agricultural productivity, which, according to AusAID, has stagnated in the Pacific for the last 45 years, indicates the lack of progress being made by the islands. One of the main obstacles to increased economic develop-ment is inade-quate investment and planning in key economic infrastructure—things like roads, bridges, ports, the supply of energy, potable water, telecommunications, storage facilities, and aviation and shipping facilities.
The committee heard from Qantas in relation to this matter, particularly in relation to aviation activity around the region. Qantas described a situation where the majority of runways have poor markings and are often unfenced, navigation aids are intermittent, aircraft handling equipment is limited and ter-minal facilities do not meet current safety and security requirements. Shipping facilities in the region are inefficient, expensive and slow.
The lack of human capacity is another major impediment to economic development. Although unemployment, particularly among young males, is a major problem in the region, there is a chronic skills shortage across all sectors of the economies in the region. This absence was especially noticeable in relation to sustainable develop-ment; in land, resource, business and financial management; in marketing and trade negotiations; and in building and construction. The reasons for these shortages are largely to be found in an education system that in many parts of the islands, particularly Papua New Guinea, the Solomons, Vanuatu and Nauru is failing children and not providing the vital building blocks for economic and human development—for example, the committee heard that only 53 per cent of children in Papua New Guinea are enrolled in school, and of the children who start school only 45 per cent are expected to complete primary school. In cases where Pacific Islanders attain qualifications, there is the problem of brain drain or the flight of intellectual capital from the region.
The committee also found that economic activity is stifled and people are deterred from investing in many Pacific island countries because they are difficult places to do business. There were numerous examples of this: under-resourced and poorly equipped bureaucracies are unable to deliver essential services; regulatory environments frustrate rather than encourage enterprise; land ownership and limited access to finance and financial services inhibit economic growth; and political instability, law and order concerns and corruption dampen enterprise and discourage investors.
Let me turn to the matter of Australia’s aid to the region. Australia is the main source of aid to the Pacific. Through its extensive aid program, work is being done in agriculture, fisheries, forestry, mining, managing natural disasters, climate change, economic infrastructure, education, health, financial management, governance, law and order, land tenure and financial services. Across these many sectors, Australian funding is being used for research and development, for building and improving infrastructure, and for providing advice, training, education and technical assistance.
The committee recognised the fine work that Australia is doing through its aid programs to help Pacific island countries develop their economies and improve living standards for their people, but it also identified areas where Australia could increase the effectiveness of its assistance. It acknowledged that setting priorities from among the numerous competing needs is a significant and challenging task for the Australian government. Indeed, the OECD peer review of Australia’s development assistance praised AusAID as:
... a highly dynamic organisation working in an increasing number of sectors and trying to be responsive to the needs of partner governments.
But it also noted:
The downside of this positive attitude may be an attempt to do too much, leading to a loss of focus and/or dissipation of energy, thereby ultimately weakening impact.
Thus, one of the major challenges for the Australian government is to set a policy framework that provides a clear focus, one that enables it to target its aid to areas that are likely to provide the best means for Pacific island countries to achieve positive, long-term economic and human development.
In this context, the committee expressed a number of concerns about aid delivery to the Pacific that have direct relevance to Australia’s official development assistance program. The committee was of the view that Australia could do more to, among other things: ensure that aid reaches its intended beneficiaries or those most in need; respond to the urgent call from Pacific island countries to help them meet the challenges of climate change; find more effective ways to ease the burden on Pacific island countries of monitoring and policing activities in their exclusive economic zones and representing their interests in regional and international organisations; ensure that benefits deriving from Australia’s assistance do not fade as projects come to an end and funds and technical assistance are withdrawn; better align Australia’s assistance with the priorities of recipient countries and of other donor countries; make better use of the private sector to help alleviate poverty in the region and boost economic activity; strengthen Australia’s whole-of-government effort by having a more coherent plan and implementation strategy; incorporate the work of states, territories, local governments and NGOs in Australia’s assistance to the region; help improve the quality of statistics available on key economic and human development indicators; and foster a culture of continuous improvement in the delivery of its aid program by making the monitoring and evaluation of projects far more rigorous.
The committee made a number of recommendations addressing these areas. Some called on the government to give greater attention to the specific areas of climate change, tourism and the non-formal education sector; others required specific action in relation to these matters. The overarching recommendations, however, were concerned with improving the overall effectiveness of Australian aid.
To conclude my remarks, on behalf of the committee I thank the staff for the excellent support they gave us in the course of preparing the report and during the lengthy time it took to undertake our inquiries, and as usual I acknowledge the highly professional nature of that support. In contrast, I also note the lack of support and cooperation that the committee received from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. On numerous occasions the committee asked for its support to visit the region and to consult with various individuals who had knowledge and special information that might have been useful to us. Notwithstanding the efforts of the committee to press these inquiries on numerous occasions, we regrettably did not even receive the courtesy of a response. That was an immense frustration to the committee’s activities and in fact I think is a reflection of an appalling state of management of the department’s affairs and an appalling state of cooperation between the committee and the executive. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2009-11-19,"—The Social Security Amendment (National Green Jobs Corps Supplement) Bill 2009 seeks to introduce a training supplement of $14.60 a fortnight to eligible participants in the Green Jobs Corps. The Green Jobs Corps, as you may remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, was announced at the 2009 ALP conference by the Prime Minister. At that conference Mr Rudd promised to deliver 50,000 new green jobs—a very memorable commitment. Yet we now know that, of these 50,000 new green jobs, only 6,000 were actually real jobs. I well remember the television footage of Senator Arbib on Sky, at the national conference, with the Darling Harbour venue in the background, struggling to explain how many of these jobs were new and real. I did actually feel sympathy for Senator Arbib—he is someone I am quite fond of, whom I spar with from time to time—because I suspect that Senator Arbib had this sprung upon him. I know that Senator Arbib would otherwise have been across the detail. It looked very much like something that had been cooked up very quickly in the Prime Minister’s office, and no-one had really quite thought through the details. So I think we all should be understanding of the very difficult and unfair situation that Senator Arbib was put in on that occasion.
The Green Jobs Corps is a six-month work experience program for 18- to 24-year-olds who have been unemployed for more than 12 months. Participants will continue to receive Newstart, youth allowance or a parenting payment. Whilst not a job, work experience is a welcome step in the right direction. Work experience programs such as Work for the Dole, Greencorps and Green Jobs Corps are designed to increase the employability of the unemployed. They do help job seekers to become job ready. They are a pathway to a job, but they are not jobs on their own.
Greencorps, it is important to remember, was an initiative of the former coalition government. And in many respects the Rudd government’s Green Jobs Corps appears very similar to the coalition’s Greencorps. The only differences are in the increased eligibility for older participants and that participants in the program receive income support payments now rather than the old Greencorps allowance. A cynic may even accuse the government of simply rebadging the coalition program. To be fair, Labor has added in the word ‘Jobs’ to the name, but it has not yet defined a pathway between this training and an actual paid job.
Employment for young people in Australia has serious deteriorated since the Rudd government was elected. In the last 12 months alone 108,300 full-time jobs have been lost amongst young Australians. And the rate of unemployment for teenagers who were not in full-time education rose to 18.5 per cent in 2009, up from 12.2 per cent in 2008.
The coalition will not oppose the passage of this bill. However, it is clear that the Rudd government have no strategy to create actual jobs for young Australians. We on this side of the chamber sincerely hope that they find a plan to do just that.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (NATIONAL GREEN JOBS CORPS SUPPLEMENT) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-11-19,"—I thank Senator Fifield for his contribution. I too saw the very impressive performance by Senator Arbib at that national conference but I did not reach the same conclusion that Senator Fifield did. I think there is a serious case of political spin being put by Senator Fifield on Senator Arbib’s contribution to supplement the announcement by the Prime Minister of the National Green Jobs Corps.
The amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 are sought to allow the introduction of the National Green Job Corps supplement of $41.60 per fortnight to participate in the corps for those who receive Newstart Allowance, Youth Allowance (Other) or the Parenting Payment. The supplement of $41.60 per fortnight will be paid in recognition of the additional costs participants may incur due to their participation in the program. It will also act as an incentive for young people to participate. The National Green Jobs Corps with provide 10,000 places over two years for Australians aged 17 to 24 to gain a combination of environmental work experience, skills development and accredited training. This program builds on the broader compact with young Australians by seeking to ensure that young Australians have the skills and experience required to realise their full potential and ensure they are well positioned for the jobs that emerge in the 21st century labour market. The corps will attract young people who may struggle to engage with and remain in educational training and the program will also provide a pathway to employment or further education and training. It provides a pathway to employment and in doing so the corps will help to equip young people with the skills to fill employment opportunities in emerging green and climate change related industries. It will equip young people with the skills to recognise and respond to the challenges of environmental change and will improve our readiness to respond to the impacts of climate change.
This debate, to touch on Senator Fifield’s contribution, takes place at the time of a period in the world of a financial and economic crisis, the worst in 75 years, which has seen unemployment rates increase—not because of the election of a Labor government but because of the world financial and economic crisis, which commenced a year ago—in most comparable countries to Australia, although not Australia I have to say. It has seen unemployment rates increase massively over the last year. Just over a week ago the unemployment rate in the US hit 10.2 per cent—15 or 16 million people are unemployed in the United States. I would stress of course that a year ago there were some who were forecasting that Australia would reach double-digit—one million—unemployed. It is one of the key reasons that they Rudd Labor government took decisive action to implement its stimulus package to cushion the economy from the worst effects of the most significant financial and economic crisis in 75 years. As a consequence, the budget forecast for unemployment—assuming the impact of our stimulus package of course—was 8.5 per cent. The MYEFO released a few weeks ago highlighted the positive effect of the stimulus package and our cushioning against the world financial and economic crisis and recession. Those figures for unemployment were revised down to peak at 6¾ per cent and, as I speak, Australia’s unemployment rate is 5.8 per cent. That is significantly below almost every comparable advanced economy in the world. We have the second-lowest unemployment rate amongst advanced economies and that is testimony to the decisive actions taken by the Rudd Labor government to cushion the Australian economy, to secure businesses and to secure jobs in this country.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2009-11-19,"—The Access to Justice (Civil Litigation Reforms) Amendment Bill 2009 is principally directed to the case management processes of the Federal Court of Australia, with some relatively minor amendments also directed to the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. Case management is the practice whereby judges control the progress of a case through the preliminary stages prior to trial so as to ensure that the parties keep to an appropriate timetable so that the issues in the dispute are narrowed and that unnecessary costs and delays are avoided.
The Access to Justice (Civil Litigation Reforms) Amendment Bill 2009 introduces an overarching purpose test to case management, which is:
… to facilitate the just resolution of disputes:
according to law; and
as quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible.
This is further defined, inter alia, to require ‘the resolution of disputes at a cost that is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the matters in dispute’. Parties to a dispute must conduct the litigation in a way consistent with the overarching purpose, and legal practitioners will be obliged to assist their clients to comply with that duty. Costs orders will be used to compel compliance and they will also be available against lawyers personally in certain circumstances. Other sanctions may include orders for the dismissal of proceedings or limitation of the case a party may wish to present. In addition, there are amendments to curtail appeal rights in respect of interlocutory orders to refer any matter for alternative dispute resolution and to charge the heads of each federal court with responsibility for the effective discharge of the business of the court.
At the time the bill was first introduced, there was a particular concern that it did not sufficiently recognise the tension that can exist between the concepts of efficient case management and the interests of justice. This issue was highlighted by the High Court in its decision in the State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd in 1997. However, the court revisited the issue in Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University on 5 August 2009. That decision recognises that the function of case management is the delivery of justice and provides guidance to lower courts to prevent their processes being distorted and thus frustrating the proper functions of the courts. This bill sits happily with that clarification.
The last time this bill was before the Senate, it was amended in a small number of respects. An amendment was proposed by my colleague Senator Abetz and by Senator Bob Brown to the effect that the Tasmanian District Registry of the Federal Court would be required to include a full-time registrar. It was a matter of some disquiet to the legal profession in Tasmania when the Federal Court abolished the position of district registrar in Hobart and assigned the responsibilities to the district registrar in Melbourne. While the case load of the Hobart registry is obviously not as heavy as those of the registries in the other state capitals, the functions of a registrar are important ones and it is not acceptable to Tasmanian practitioners and unrepresented litigants in that state that those functions should be outsourced to the Melbourne registry of the court.
As my colleague Senator Abetz remarked in October, in the basics of Federal Court administration there should be ‘equity between the states’ and all states should ‘have a full-time registrar’. At Senate estimates, we heard that the abolition of the position represented at the very greatest a saving of about $200,000, which, in terms of the inconvenience to the Tasmanian legal profession and litigants in that state, seems a false economy indeed. Accordingly, I am delighted to note that yesterday in the House of Representatives the government conceded the opposition’s position on this matter, accepting the Senate’s amendment with respect to the position of the Tasmanian registrar by moving its own amendment to this bill. As I understand it, the deputy registrar’s case load will be supplemented by responsibility for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This is a very sensible outcome, and I am delighted that both the government and the Federal Court administration were able to see the force of the position taken by the opposition and, in particular, by my colleague Senator Abetz and his Tasmanian Liberal colleagues in the Senate.
In its amended form, protecting as it does the interests of the state of Tasmania in that particular respect, I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ACCESS TO JUSTICE (CIVIL LITIGATION REFORMS) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,19,1,speech

I made clear yesterday that the management of the Oceanic Viking issue had been the responsibility of the border protection committee. The border protection committee contains the ministers who have direct responsibility for those matters.
I also indicated that there was a series of meetings of ministers and staff who helped to deal with the day-to-day management of the issues. The lead ministers in that regard were Mr Smith, the foreign affairs minister; Mr O’Connor, the Minister for Home Affairs and Customs and border protection; and me, as Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.

That is where the management of these matters lay and that is where the authority of the government came from. Various officials were involved at various stages; various staff attended some of the considerations and advice was sought as appropriate.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-11-19,"—It seems to me that the tactics committee of the Liberal Party are totally bereft of new ideas, because I have been asked this question in various ways probably about 15 times this week. I can say at first I always listen to Senator Feeney’s contributions very closely because they are erudite and generally quite amusing. He has a certain way that I find very amusing. Senator Feeney obviously has correctly described that there was an agreement between the Indonesian government and the Australian government as to how those who disembark from the Oceanic Viking will be treated. That agreement was struck and that agreement was followed. We insisted that those people disembark in Indonesia and we rejected their claims to come to Australia. Those people have accepted the fact that they will disembark in Indonesia and have done so. They have gone into detention, as we agreed with the Indonesian government, and they will have access to UNHCR representatives, who will assess their asylum claims.
Senator Feeney was correctly representing that there was an agreement between the two governments as to how this would occur, because the asylum seekers were on our vessel but were disembarking in Indonesian territory. Obviously Indonesian law must apply when they disembark, so there was an agreement between the two governments. That agreement has been honoured by the Indonesian government and it has been honoured by the Australian government. After some delay the asylum seekers on the Oceanic Viking have decided to disembark and given up their claim to be taken to Australia. That is as it should be. They will be processed according to the UNHCR processes and, following that, those who are found to be refugees will be treated accordingly. Those who are not will be returned. (Time expired)

Of course there are variances in time frames regarding asylum claims all around the world.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-11-19,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
I would specifically like to note the complete incapacity of the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, to be succinct in her answers. Canada has deferred their decision until after Copenhagen. As much as we tried to persuade Minister Wong to come forward with a straight and honest answer, she ducked and dived but never gave a straight answer. We got the usual rendition of calamity as she talked about sea level rises, ocean acidification and inundation. Never once did she explain to us how this massive tax will actually affect it, because we know it will not affect it. This massive tax works in isolation and is nothing but an assault on working families and a revenue raiser for the government because there is no way that this tax in isolation can do anything about the climate. But they are so cunning and shrewd that they worked this little web around the issue. You can see it personified in the way the minister answers the questions—or, more to the point, does not answer the questions.
We know that the United States has also deferred legislation. In fact, the whole world is waiting for Copenhagen, except for Kevin Rudd. He is not waiting. He is on his solo trip to save the world. Why is he doing that? Because he says that he is a world leader. We know at this point in time that Barack Obama must be tossing and turning in his bed thinking, ‘What on earth is Kevin up to?’ We know that Hu Jintao in China must be running around the Communist Party saying: ‘Look, we can’t go any further; we’ve got to wait until Kevin gets somewhere.’ We know that Dmitry Medvedev and Manmohan Singh are, within Russia and India respectively, worried about the position of Australia’s climate change policy. This is the ludicrous proposition that the Australian Labor Party put forward. Who does worry about the position of the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd? There is only one group that is worried about the position of Kevin Rudd—the people of Australia. They are truly worried about the position of Kevin Rudd. I can see it on a petition presented today that was started last week. There are 13,000 signatures on it expressing the view that this process, this ludicrous lemming-like careening over the policy cliff, should be curtailed and stopped.
But what do we have? We have the Copenhagen agreement merely days away and the conceit of this Prime Minister is so great and immense that he refuses to wait a matter of days. He insists on taking Australia on his unilateral crusade. We know what happens to unilateral crusades: you end up getting slaughtered. That is what will happen to the economy of this nation. We are about to do the worst thing we could possibly do to working families, and that is to create an environment where we put them out of work. In all of these illustrious statements about green jobs, we have not seen one example of them. Where are they? Beyond the statement of ‘green job’, where are they? Show me the examples. They do not have any examples. We have nothing more than this rhetorical entourage of calamitous events because they refuse to engage in the debate. That shows the paucity of their claims. The debate is whether their scheme will affect the temperature of the globe. Of course, it will not, but they will not engage in that. In the same evasive manner, they are now refusing to acknowledge the position of Canada and the United States. They are making excuses for every other nation. They have an excuse for why every other nation is appearing to be in a different position from that of Australia. But how do we deal with this? Once they set us up for this massive new tax, what do we do? Who will be the benefactors of this? I might suggest that it will be people close to Treasury who are going to be the benefactors of this.
It is also perplexing at this point of time to see that nothing has been delivered to this parliament by way of an amendment or an examination. There is nothing to see. Is there any conjecture over there? Is there something of concern? Is it possibly the case that modelling is starting to suggest that we might have a bit of a problem here, because the modelling only dealt with Australia working conjointly with other nations in a policy— (Time expired)

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2009-11-19,"—I rise to respond to the motion to take note of the answer on climate change. I must say that in regard to Senator Joyce’s comments about not taking things seriously, I am just amazed. While I have been able to this morning, I have been listening to the rest of the debate, and it is quite amazing to hear what is coming from those on the other side. Climate change is a serious issue and it is having a big impact on Australia and the world. If you want an example of what is happening, look at the latest report that tells us about how our coastal areas and populations are at greatest risk, as are places like Kakadu and the Great Barrier Reef. In my beautiful home state of Tasmania not only the wilderness but also the coastal areas are at risk from climate change. The report is projecting an increase in both the frequency and the severity of natural disasters. How those on the other side can stand up and be such deniers beggars belief.
Climate change will impact on us all. It will impact on individuals, communities, families and businesses. No-one is immune. Those on the other side need to take a very deep breath and actually listen for once to their leader, who is at least not a complete sceptic in regard to the issue. We need to act now. If we do not act now, we will see temperatures throughout Australia rise by five degrees by 2100 compared to 1919 temperatures, and it is expected that bushfires will become more intense and more frequent. When we think about the destruction caused and the lives lost in the Victorian bushfires, it is astounding. Throughout question time we have been hearing about the increasing temperatures in South Australia today, so how those on the other side can act as such sceptics in the whole issue just, as I said, beggars belief. If we do not take action now, then, no, Senator Joyce, the world will not end. But what you are saying is that if nobody else takes action on something then nobody should act to improve things. I think that is a very immature and irresponsible position for any of the opposition or any on the other side to take—that, no matter what, if nobody else has acted we should not start to improve the situation, because we can improve the situation and it is time that those on the other side started thinking very seriously about our doing that.
Other countries around the world are gathering at Copenhagen in December to discuss this real issue. To those on the other side, Copenhagen has become the be-all and end-all of whether we should have this debate or not. They are not debating. They are standing up and giving emotive speeches which suggest that we are saying the world will end. I do not think I have heard any of our speakers say the world is going to end. What people from this side are saying is that it does make a difference and that somebody needs to stand up and take responsibility. If those on the other side cannot help take responsibility for improving the lives of not only Australians but people throughout the world then I doubt that they are in the job for the right reasons. If we have a firm policy, it will maximise our ability to play a constructive role in the negotiations and to reach an agreement with our counterparts. Australia is one of the most resource intensive economies throughout the world and if we can cut emissions, it would make other nations realise that cuts can be made. We need to lead by example and we need to show the rest of the world that we can lead by example. If we do not do that then I think we are failing our obligations not only to the people of Australia but to the people of the rest of the world, and I think that is not an acceptable position for the Labor Party to take.
In fact, we are not acting completely before the rest of the world because the US, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Korea, along with many of the EU countries— (Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2009-11-19,"—What a pivotal moment today is. To think that the Canadians are deferring the introduction or discussion of their cap-and-trade ETS scheme until after the Copenhagen conference. That shows, I must say, a high degree of responsibility and eminent common sense by the Canadian government. If only the Rudd-Wong government could do the same sort of thing in Australia so that we could be sure that whatever is done in Australia is appropriate to the needs of this country. Not only is the Canadian government deferring their scheme; I am told that the leadership of the United States Senate is discussing deferring the Waxman-Markey bill, which is the bill that would introduce a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme in the United States. They are proposing to defer it until after the Copenhagen conference for the very good reason that they, like the Canadians, do not want to be left out on a limb, as would happen to Australia were this government to continue blindly proceeding down the road of introducing this lunatic scheme.
This scheme is going to wreck the Australian economy, cause massive job losses and produce, in fact, almost no reduction in carbon in this country. This scheme, the CPRS, is an absolute fraud. It does not reduce carbon emissions. What happens if you have an emissions intensive industry like a cement factory or something is that, rather than reducing emissions, you go and buy a rainforest in Indonesia or some Third World country and you trade off the emissions from your plant against the carbon capture by that rainforest in another country. It is a total fraud. The Australian people are not stupid. They can see through this sort of nonsense—and they will not just see through it but also feel the pain of it, because unfortunately they are going to have to bear the cost of the tax burden of the CPRS.
This is supposed to be a trading scheme, but unfortunately our major regional trading partners—China, Japan, South Korea and India, who are our top four trading partners—have no intention of introducing an emissions trading scheme. That means, rather than being able to trade off the carbon credit between countries, the Australian taxpayer, if this scheme is introduced, would have to carry the whole burden of what is estimated to be somewhere between $50 billion a year and $87 billion a year in extra taxes. That pain will cause them very much to question the wisdom of the Rudd government in going ahead with this crazy proposal of the CPRS. If we are going to do anything, in my view, we should propose to have a carbon tax, which could be tailored to our needs. It would be easy to administer, it would not involve setting up the huge bureaucracy that the CPRS requires and it would be a great step forward compared to the CPRS.
We just heard a little bit from the last speaker questioning the science of climate change and expressing fear about rising sea levels and the impact of climate change on Australian society. Let’s face it—that is a huge debate. Climate change has been going on for thousands of millions of years. It is part of the natural cyclical history of the world’s atmosphere. I have a feeling that, somehow or other, this whole subject of the greenhouse effect is going to turn out to be another Y2K bug—an enormous fraud. Nothing is going to happen. I read a book recently by Professor Paltridge, who used to be the chief climate scientist of the CSIRO, called The Climate Caper. He says in that book that, in his opinion, there will be as much climate change in the next 50 years as there has been in the last—in other words, very little at all. I do not think we have a lot to worry about.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,23,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2009-11-19,"—It is good to at least have the opposition acknowledging that there are other countries in the world embarking on the process of bringing in emissions trading schemes, because it has been all too common amongst the opposition in the past to just state blandly, and wrongly, that no other major countries are developing such schemes. There are schemes already operating in 31 European countries. The US President, Barack Obama, has confirmed his commitment to a cap-and-trade scheme and the US emissions reduction targets of a return to 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 per cent below 1990 levels by 2050. The US House of Representatives passed the bill and, as we have heard, the Senate committees are currently working on that legislation. The Canadian government, as the minister said, is working to introduce an emissions trading scheme and has committed to developing and implementing a North America wide cap-and-trade system—the same sort of system that Australia is working on. Twenty-seven states and provinces in the US and Canada are also introducing emissions trading schemes.
Japan is already trialling a voluntary emissions trading scheme and has stated its intention to introduce a domestic scheme in 2011-12. New Zealand’s government is amending its existing emissions trading scheme, which will bring it into closer alignment with Australia’s CPRS. Australia and New Zealand have also agreed to explore further the alignment and harmonisation of our respective scheme designs. So there are many, many countries around the world working towards a cap-and-trade emissions scheme—the same scheme that this government has brought through the House of Representatives and that is currently in the Senate.
What is happening at Copenhagen is that the international community are coming together to try and get an effective agreement on the way forward. This is for both developed and developing countries. This is a complex negotiation and a complex matter, because countries are clearly at different stages of advancement and have different abilities to contribute to a reduction in carbon pollution around the world. Australia is taking an active and useful part in this attempt to get an agreement. No-one pretends that Australia is able to bring everyone to the table together by itself, but in contributing in an active and constructive manner we hope to be able to get an agreement on this complex issue around the table at Copenhagen.
It is a complex issue and the Australian gov-ernment is up to developing its strategy in a complex matter, unlike so many people opposite me in the Senate here, who are unable to develop any kind of comprehensive or complex strategy. Their answer is simply no. ‘No, we are not considering this issue at all. Our answer is no. We won’t consider any constructive amendments.’ In many cases, they will not even consider that climate change is a possibility. Their single answer is no.
This Labor government is going to Copenhagen with a constructive, positive strategy to deal with this complex issue around the world. That is what the government is doing. Governments are trying to strike a deal. Governments from around the world are acknowledging that climate change is a problem, that carbon pollution is a problem, and are looking at the best way to strike a deal that enables us to go forward. But most of the opposition senators in this chamber do not want to strike a deal. They do not want to go forward. They do not want to make any advancement in the reduction of carbon pollution. They are just saying a straight no, and that is not good enough for this government. This government will go to Copenhagen and will work with other countries in a cooperative manner.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,23,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2009-11-19,"—Mr Deputy President, it is nice to see you in the chair.
—He’s always in the chair!
—It is—he is the former President of this chamber and I respect him for that, and I respect his position as Deputy President. You may well laugh at that, but on this side we are all laughing at you because this debate on climate change has been going on for years, since the 2007 election. If the effects of the Labor government’s policies on this matter and their rhetoric on this matter were not so serious, it would be really quite funny. We watch the squirming going on on the other side as everything shifts from under them, as the whole debate shifts from under them. The science has shifted from under them, the public view and opinion have totally shifted from under them, and now the world has shifted from under them. In fact, the world has put Armageddon off! Your rhetoric about Armageddon, that the seas are imminently going to swamp the Australian east coast, that the Antarctic is going to melt, that polar bears are going to die and that the Murray River will dry up we are still getting today. Even today, with the big shift in public opinion, we are still getting that from the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Penny Wong.
The world has even walked away from you. No, the Mexican President, I believe, is still sticking by our Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, as both of them scurry around the APEC conference trying to save what they believe to be the Copenhagen agreement. The truth of the matter is, as we heard in question time today, that the Canadian parliament are deferring any scheme to post the Copenhagen meeting. We now hear that the leaders of the United States Senate, the major player in all of this, are deferring their scheme.
Government senators interjecting—
—Do you think I should keep it down? I can be relaxed about this. I am feeling really quite relaxed, more relaxed than I was in 2007.
—Two days in a row!
—By the way, are you as a Victorian senator getting up to represent your state and speaking on this matter at any point? I notice you are not on the speakers list at all. The lack of speakers from the other side is a very important matter. Talk about being gagged, but I will have something to say about that when I have a full 20 minutes to speak. My point is that extremism is still coming from the other side—and it is great to watch them squirm—but the extremists have to explain why every indication is that the rest of the world has put off any scheme. There are no schemes—the other side will have to update their speakers notes. No other country has put in place an emissions trading scheme, least of all the major ones—China, India and the United States. The extremists from the other side now have to explain about the deferral of the major emitting countries. They have to explain the science from their point of view, the courage of so many scientists that are fighting back, as we heard from Senator Eggleston. Leading scientists from the CSIRO have been so long gagged by the other side—I should add leading scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from whence all this idiotic extremism has come.
Do you really think we are going to depend on the New South Wales government report about the sea levels on the eastern seaboard of this country when we have better experts than that? The world’s leading expert on sea levels, Professor Nils-Axel Morner of Stockholm University, tells us that sea levels are not increasing. To put it in less diplomatic language than a professor would, he calls swamping of the Australian eastern seaboard absolute rubbish. The gig is up for this great fake. If you thought the Prime Minister’s claim about being an economic conservative was fake, if you thought his fixing up of the state hospitals was fake, if you even thought his going into a strip club and not seeing a stripper was fake, you ain’t seen nothing yet. This is the greatest hoax ever played on the Australian people and it is fake. What is more, most of you on the other side know this is fake, particularly the New South Wales senators because they have their own state report on this matter. (Time expired)

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE INQUIRY BY THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON ECONOMICS INTO THE CURRENT STATE OF AUSTRALIA’S SPACE SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY SECTOR


November 2009


Background

On 19 March 2008, the Senate referred the following matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics for report no later than October 2008 with an interim report by 23 June 2008:
The current state of Australia’s space science and industry sector, examining options to strengthen and expand Australia’s position in fields that strongly align with space science and industry, giving consideration to any national strategic coordination requirements and taking into account findings and policy options of the National Innovation System Review, with particular reference to:
Australia’s capabilities in space science, industry and education, including:
existing Australian activity of world-class standard, and
areas in which there is currently little or no activity but that are within the technical and intellectual capacity of the country;
arguments for and against expanded Australian activity in space science and industry, including:
an assessment of the risks to Australia’s national interest of Australia’s dependence on foreign-owned and operated satellites,
the potential benefits that could accrue to Australia through further development of our space capability,
economic, social, environmental, national security and other needs that are not being met or are in danger of not being met by Australia’s existing space resources or access to foreign resources,
impediments to strengthening and expanding space science and industry in Australia, including limiting factors relating to spatial information and global positioning systems, including but not limited to ground infrastructures, intergovernmental arrangements, legislative arrangements and government/industry coordination, and
the goals of any strengthening and expansion of Australia’s space capability both in the private sector and across government; and
realistic policy options that facilitate effective solutions to cross-sector technological and organisational challenges, opportunity capture and development imperatives that align with national need and in consideration of existing world-class capability.
The Senate inquiry received eighty-eight submissions and held public hearings in Canberra on 16 May, 29 July and 23 September 2008; in Adelaide on 23 May and 22 June 2008; and in Sydney on 1 August 2008.
The Senate Standing Committee on Economics released its interim report on 23 June 2008. The interim report summarised what the Committee saw as the key questions that needed to be answered to assess in what ways, if any, the Government needs to act to optimise Australia’s capabilities in space science, industry and education; and their contribution to the nation.
The Senate Standing Committee on Economics released its final report on 12 November 2008. The report is called Lost in Space? Setting a new direction for Australia’s space science and industry sector. The six recommendations in the report’s final chapter ‘chart a course towards Australia regaining an important place in global space science and industry by gradually developing a dedicated space agency.’1


Government Response


Recommendation 1

The committee recommends as a first step that the Government give the existing unit within the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research more resources to enable the establishment of an Australian Government Space Information Website. This would provide informa-tion on government programmes and contacts, and links to Australian companies working in the space industry as well as Australian universities offering courses in space science and space engineering.

Response


The Government notes the recommendation.

The Government committed in the 2009-10 Budget $48.6 million to establish the Australian Space Science Program over four years.  The Program contains $40 million for the Australian Space Research Program and $8.6 million for a Space Policy Unit to coordinate and be the central point of contact for Australia’s national and international civil space activities.
The Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research has acquired the domain www.space.gov.au, and through this intends to improve the visibility of the Australian Government Space Portal, including information on the Australian Government’s space related activities and industry capability.

Recommendation 2

The committee notes that Australia is the only OECD country without a national space agency and, as a consequence is missing out on opportunities to engage in this important area of innovation and technology. The committee also notes the comments by the Chief Scientist and the conclusion of the Cutler Report in relation to the importance of the space industry for innovation within Australia. The committee recommends that immediate steps are taken to coordinate our space activities and reduce our over reliance on other countries in the area of space technology.

Response

The Government has established a Space Policy Unit in the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research to coordinate and be the central point of contact for Australia’s national and international civil space activities.  The Space Policy Unit will liaise with Government agencies on space matters and serve as a focal point for the exchange of information and the development of new policy.  The Space Policy Unit will convene, on an as-required basis, a forum of national sec-urity agencies to assess security and intelligence as-pects on civil space matters.  The Department of Defence will continue to have the lead on defence and military space related matters.
The Government is committed to improving Australia’s capacity to independently develop and utilise space technology.  In this regard, the Government is establishing an Australian Space Research Program to support space research, innovation and skills development in areas of national significance.  This program will be managed by the Space Policy Unit.
In its 2009 Defence White Paper, the Government has recognised the importance of being able to protect Australian space-based assets from counter-space technologies and from accidental damage caused by space debris. While the Government noted that we rely on the United States for much of our space advantage, the White Paper identified that we should also seek ways to develop our nascent but growing expertise in space capabilities, including by strengthening Australia’s space situational awareness and mission assurance capability, and developing a career stream for space specialists in the Australian Defence Force.
The Defence White Paper also places a high priority on assured access to high-quality space-based imagery to meet Defence’s needs for mapping, charting, navigation and targeting data. In addition, the Government announced its intention to improve Australia’s intelligence collection capabilities by acquiring a satellite with a remote sensing capability, most likely to be based on a high-resolution, cloud-penetrating, synthetic aperture radar.
The Government considers that Australia derives considerable benefit from arrangements with other countries and commercial bodies that facilitate access to space technology and the data derived from its applications.  Such arrangements will remain an important component of Australia’s space capability.  The Government notes that risk mitigation measures, such as treaty provisions embedding Australian personnel at foreign-owned space tracking stations, are in place to protect Australia’s interests in these arrangements.  The Government will continue to consider, as appropriate, opportunities to improve the efficacy of such arrangements. 

Recommendation 3

The committee notes the wealth of expert, well informed evidence received by the committee. Despite some deviations, the overwhelming majority of witnesses strongly supported the formation of a government unit to coordinate Australian space activities, including those in the private sector. The committee supports this conclusion and notes that there must be a proper balance between industry and government involvement.

Response

The Government notes the recommendation and has established a Space Policy Unit and is establishing an Australian Space Research Program, referred to in the response to Recommendation 2.  These initiatives will contribute to better coordination of civil space activities, including those in the private sector. The Space Policy Unit will consult as appropriate with key industry stakeholders and will secure private sector involvement in the Australian Space Research Program.

Recommendation 4

The committee notes the various models of space agency within the OECD and emerging economies and supports Australia having a space agency. The committee recommends initially establishing a Space Industry Advisory Council comprising industry representatives, government agencies, defence, and academics. The committee recommends that the advisory Council be chaired by the Minister for Innovation Industry Science and Research or his representative.

Response

The Government intends to establish a Space Industry Innovation Council. Membership will draw on the knowledge and expertise of innovation leaders from business, unions, science and research agencies, and government.
The Government will continue to hold the Australian Government Space Forum to facilitate confidential information sharing and coordination across government.
The Space Policy Unit will support the activities of the Space Industry Innovation Council and the Australian Government Space Forum to better coordinate civil space activities, including those in the private sector.

Recommendation 5

As a precursor to the establishment of the space agency the Advisory Council would:
Conduct an audit of Australia’s current space activities within six months of the establishment of the Council;
Analyse the strengths, weaknesses opportunities and threats to Australia’s emerging space industry;
Focus on the key “workhorse” space applications of Earth observation, satellite communications and navigation as the most practical and beneficial initial priorities;
Systematically evaluate the medium/long-term priorities for a space agency including the national benefit of defence related activities, Earth observation, environmental, land management, exploration, national disaster prevention and management, treaty monitoring, e-commerce and telemedicine;
Examine the benefits to Australia of improved international collaboration including membership of the international space groups;
Develop a draft strategic plan for the establishment of a space agency and the most appropriate form of that agency, including public/private funding, budget and staffing priorities; and
Identify critical performance areas such as research, technological development, development of the skill base, effective partnerships, delivery of new services, and financial management.

Response

The Government notes the recommendation and advises that a number of the recommended tasks will be progressed through the new initiatives dedicated to civil space activities.
The Space Industry Innovation Council, referred to in the response to Recommendation 4, will examine Australia’s current civil space activities, risks and strategic priorities with a focus on Earth observation, satellite communications and navigation.
The Space Industry Innovation Council will also consider relevant implications for space science and industry arising from the Defence White Paper and the National Security Science and Innovation Strategy.
The Australian Space Research Program will coordinate and support relevant Australian public and private research and development organisations, and will improve international collaboration by linking Australian organisations with appropriate international space research and education institutions and partners.
The Space Policy Unit will coordinate national policy making and international engagement on civil space issues, ensuring activities including the Australian Space Research Program and the Space Industry Innovation Council, are aligned to appropriate national policies and priorities.

Recommendation 6

The committee recommends that any Australian Space Agency reassess the case for Australia becoming more closely linked to an international space agency.

Response


The Government notes the recommendation.

The Government has established links to several international space agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency, and the Russian Federal Space Agency.  The Government’s relationships with these space agencies have been formalised by bilateral treaties.
Australian and United States agencies, including Airservices Australia and the Federal Aviation Administration, are cooperating on the civil use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and space-based position, navigation and timing (PNT) systems and applications.
Australia, through Geoscience Australia and the Bureau of Meteorology, has cooperative arrangements for earth observation and weather data with key international bodies and foreign agencies, including those from the United States, Europe, Japan, China and India.
In Australia, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) licences satellite communication links (up and down), and facilitates international satellite filings with the International Telecommunication Union.  The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (DBCDE) has primary responsibility for communication treaty matters, including those relating to satellite issues.
The Government will consider further arrangements for engaging with international space organisations following advice from the Space Industry Innovation Council and the Space Policy Unit and will continue to consider approaches to broader national and international coordination and engagement on space matters.

REPORT OF THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON ECONOMICS


MATTERS RELATING TO THE GAS EXPLOSION AT VARANUS ISLAND, WESTERN AUSTRALIA


GOVERNMENT RESPONSE


Introduction

The Australian Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics entitled Matters relating to the gas explosion at Varanus Island, Western Australia.
The Government is committed to the provision of cleaner, adequate, reliable and affordable energy to meet future energy consumption needs and to underpin strong economic growth. It is vital that not only Western Australia, but the nation as a whole has access to secure supplies of energy, including gas.
Ensuring Australia’s energy security is a high priority for the Government and to this end the Government has undertaken a number of initiatives, including the development of a National Energy Security Assessment (NESA) and development of an Energy White Paper, which are part of a comprehensive strategy to meet Australia’s long-term energy needs.
On 26 March 2009, the Hon Martin Ferguson AM MP, Minister for Resources and Energy, released the NESA which identifies the key strategic energy security issues currently facing Australia’s liquid fuels, natural gas and electricity sectors, and those likely to influence energy security in 5 (2013), 10 (2018) and 15 (2023) years.
The Energy White Paper will include a review of the Government’s energy policies and the development of a policy framework through to 2030 to ensure cleaner, adequate, reliable and affordable supplies of energy to support the functioning of the economy and social development. In March 2009, the Government released the Energy White Paper’s Strategic Directions Paper which sets the scene for the development of the Energy White Paper by broadly mapping out its intended scope and identifying some of the specific work being undertaken.
The Government is also committed to ensuring that Australia’s offshore petroleum safety regulation is world’s best practice. On 9 January 2009, the Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments announced a joint independent inquiry into the effectiveness of regulation for upstream petroleum operations, with a focus on the 3 June 2008 gas pipeline rupture at the Apache Energy Ltd operated facilities on Varanus Island.
Following a successful Federal Court challenge by Apache Energy Ltd in May 2009, the Terms of Reference for the Inquiry were altered, with two reports prepared for the Commonwealth on better practice regulation and the role of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA) and improving the interface between NOPSA and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA).
The two Reports, Better practice and the effectiveness of NOPSA (the NOPSA Report) and Marine issues (the Marine Report), were provided to the Hon Martin Ferguson AM MP, the Minister for Resources and Energy in June 2009.  The Minister released the reports at the 9th meeting of the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources on 9 July 2009. The two reports are available on the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism website (www.ret.gov.au).

Recommendation 1

6.11 The Western Australian Government should convene a forum comprised of gas producers, suppliers, power companies, industry groups, media outlets and community representatives to discuss and develop a range of standardised emergency response measures in the event that another gas crisis is experienced in Western Australia.
6.12 The forum should examine initiatives, including but not limited to, providing increased transparency and improved communication during periods of disruption to gas supply. Improved communication from government to the community and industry groups to their members would assist in the dissemination of timely and relevant information to the public and industry throughout Western Australia. In addition an analysis of the feasibility of improved contingency planning by government and the market should be undertaken.
6.13 The forum should also discuss the operation of the Gas Supply Coordination Committee and the Gas Supply Disruption Recovery Committee and whether there are improvements that can be made to the operation of these committees if another gas crisis eventuates. An assessment should be made of the Office of Energy priority schedule for gas supply and, whether, in hindsight, any improvements or modifications should be made to the schedule.

Government Position:

The Australian Government notes recommendation one. The Government also notes that State and Territory governments have constitutional responsibility for planning and coordinating emergency responses within their jurisdictional boundaries.
The Government supports relevant stakeholders working together to ensure that Western Australia’s (WA) emergency response measures are efficient and consistent across the state and federal levels. The Government supports measures to improve transparency and com-munication between relevant stakeholders in a timely manner during periods of disruption to gas supply. A forum comprised of gas producers, suppliers, power companies, industry groups, media outlets and community representatives could be an appropriate way to discuss these issues.
Any review of WA’s emergency management arrangements should consider the emergency management arrangements in other jurisdictions, and take account of the current Ministerial Council of Energy’s review of arrangements for the management of emergencies in the national energy markets. At present, there are separate arrangements in place in the electricity and natural gas supply systems. However, with the creation of a single market operator, the Australian Energy Market Operator, and the convergence of the gas and electricity markets, it is an appropriate time to consider consistent national emergency management arrangements in the future.

Recommendation 2

6.14 The Western Australian Government should conduct an internal analysis of the effectiveness and appropriateness of the legislative framework to deal with periods of energy crisis in Western Australia. Issues such as the government’s capacity to invoke emergency powers in the public interest and the effectiveness of government intervention in a market-based industry should be analysed. In particular the response to emergencies under the Energy Coordination Act 1994 (WA) and the emergencies under the Emergency Management Act 2005 (WA) legislation should be assessed for their appropriateness following the experience of the Varanus Island gas explosion crisis.

Government Position:

The Australian Government notes recommendation two. The Government also notes that State and Territory governments have constitutional responsibility for planning and coordinating emergency responses within their jurisdictional boundaries. This includes the implementation of jurisdictional emergency powers under the Energy Coordination Act 1994 (WA) and the Emergency Management Act 2005 (WA).
The Energy Coordination Act 1994 (WA) is the legislative framework underpinning the planning and coordinating energy supply in WA. The Emergency Management Act 2005 (WA) provides for coordinated management of emergencies in Western Australia. It formalises WA’s ability to mitigate or prevent, prepare for, respond to and recover from incidents of a large scale or catastrophic nature.

Recommendation 3

6.15 The Western Australian Government should conduct, as soon as practicable, the review of gas security announced on 6 August 2008. The review should be conducted in coordination with the Commonwealth’s National Energy Security Assessment currently being conducted by the Commonwealth Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism.

Government position:

On 26 March 2009, the Hon Martin Ferguson AM MP, Minister for Resources and Energy, released the National Energy Security Assessment (NESA) which is an important milestone towards developing a comprehensive strategy to meet Australia’s long-term energy needs. The NESA provides a clear picture of the challenges affecting Australia’s energy security and highlights the opportunities that we may encounter in the future.
The NESA was developed by the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism (RET) in consultation with industry, and Commonwealth, State and Territory government agencies. RET consulted with Western Australian (WA) Government officials and energy industry participants through formal consultation workshops conducted in Perth on 15 August 2008 which provided an opportunity for interested parties to raise their concerns about the WA gas market and other energy security issues.
The Australian Government notes that on 29 January 2009, the Hon Peter Collier MLC, WA Minister for Energy, announced a review to be undertaken by the Gas Supply and Emergency Management Committee, which will identify risks to WA’s supply of gas, including the amount of gas reserves available to the domestic market as well as processing and gas delivery. It will also examine ways to improve the management of energy emergencies.
The WA Office of Energy is conducting an assessment of WA’s gas security which will inform the review. The WA Office of Energy consulted with RET on a draft assessment report with the intention of ensuring that its assessment is consistent with the NESA.

Recommendation 4

6.16 To support increased competition and provide the community with improved information the Western Australian Government should establish a permanent gas bulletin board. Any permanent gas bulletin board should include the provision of information on pipeline capacity and flows to increase the transparency of the gas market in Western Australia. The committee also recommends that the state government explore options to provide the Office of Energy with powers to examine and publish transportation figures from the Dampier Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline and the Goldfields Gas Pipeline.
6.17 The Western Australian Government should actively engage with the alternative energy industry in Western Australia in order to progress energy diversification through increased alternative energy capacity.
6.18 The Western Australian Government should also examine whether the current market-based approach to energy supply is providing sufficient information, openness and competition to Western Australian consumers.

Government Position:

The Australian Government supports the proposal for the Western Australian (WA) Government to establish a permanent gas bulletin board. The establishment of a permanent gas bulletin board would improve transparency and efficiency in the gas market in WA. It would also disseminate information that would help manage gas emergencies. 
The Government considers there would be benefit in WA joining the national gas market Bulletin Board and notes that the Bulletin Board can be expanded to cover non-interconnected pipeline systems operating in WA and the Northern Territory at an incremental cost.
The national gas market Bulletin Board (www.gasbb.com.au), which was launched in July 2008, is a website covering major gas production fields, storage facilities, demand centres and transmission pipelines in South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland and Tasmania.  It serves the purpose of providing transparent, real-time and independent information on the state of the gas market, system constraints and market opportunities and can also help the market respond to gas emergencies.  It will complement a new short-term trading market in gas, expected to start in 2010, which will improve price signals and be of particular advantage during systems constraints and emergencies.
The Government notes the recommendation for the WA Government to explore options to provide the Office of Energy with powers to examine and publish transportation figures from the WA pipelines. The publication of energy and resources statistics should be consistent with the appropriate management of commercial information and other sensitivities.
The Government recognises the role that alternative and renewable energy can play in Australia’s future energy mix, and has a variety of policies including the expansion of the national Renewable Energy Target which will ensure that 20 per cent of Australia’s electricity supply comes from renewable energy by 2020.

Recommendation 5

6.19 The Western Australian Government should commence discussions with energy suppliers on the need to balance the market approach with community and industry needs during a period of gas shortage. In particular, the need for improved transparency and accountability from the gas and energy industry during periods of crisis should be addressed. Given the perception of “price gouging” and unfair contracts it is in the interest of the industry and the government to examine increased transparency and accountability during periods of energy supply crisis.

Government position:

The Australian Government notes recommen-dation five. The Government supports transparency and accountability in the operation of energy markets. As mentioned in its response to recommendation four, the Government believes that the establishment of a permanent Gas Bulletin Board in Western Australia would improve transparency and accountability within the gas industry, particularly in times of supply constraints.

Recommendation 6

6.20 The committee received evidence from several contractors in the south west who were severely affected by the gas shortage. It was reported that Centrelink are limited in the assis-tance they can provide to independent contractors. The Department of Human Services should undertake an investigation of these concerns.

Government position:

The Department of Human Services (DHS) is responsible for coordinating improvements to policy on service delivery and reform across the Human Services agencies (including Centrelink) from a whole-of-government perspective. Centrelink is the Commonwealth’s Service Delivery Agency and it delivers services on behalf of relevant policy departments. Neither Centrelink, nor DHS, determine eligibility requirements for Centrelink payments and Centrelink cannot provide assistance contrary to established eligibility criteria set by policy departments such as the Department of Families Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and the Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) and accompanied by relevant legislation.
In special circumstances the relevant Commonwealth policy agency may relax some of the normal arrangements for income support payments, but claimants would still need to meet the existing eligibility criteria as set out in the Social Security Act 1991 to receive a payment. This was the case in the Varanus Island gas disruption.
DEEWR is responsible for labour market and income support policies and programs for people of working age. DEEWR has mechanisms in place to identify instances of redundancies. In each case, the Department seeks to coordinate advice and assistance to affected workers (permanent and contractors) to help them find alternative employment as quickly as possible. In this case DEEWR, Centrelink and State Government reports indicated that there were a low number of redundancies (less than 50) across the Western Australian (WA) labour market as a result of the Varanus Island gas disruption. DEEWR policy provides that all workers (permanent and contractors) who are made redundant and have had their redundancy confirmed are eligible for immediate access to Job Search Support services. Additionally, some of these workers were entitled to access the Government’s Productivity Places Program which provides training in industries experiencing skills shortages for eligible job seekers.
In some cases, the Government has provided additional employment services to assist employees in areas where expectations of future employment opportunities for workers in an industry are low or where large scale closures may impact on the local labour market. DEEWR considers the existing services for redundant workers adequately met the requirements of the WA labour market at the time of the Varanus Island gas disruption.
DHS with Centrelink have reviewed the circumstances surrounding the service provided to people affected by the Varanus Island gas disruption.  Approximately 100 people contacted Centrelink in the weeks following the explosion to notify that they were financially impacted or had lost their job as a result of this incident.  Approximately 50 per cent of those made some form of claim for assistance. Many of the claims were rejected because the claimants were not eligible under the relevant guidelines or policy instruments.
Centrelink operated in accordance with relevant legislation and policy instructions in delivering Newstart payments on DEEWR’s behalf. There were several reasons claims for Newstart were not paid:

Claimants’ assets disqualified them from payment ;

claimants were still employed although they were not earning their usual income, and therefore did not meet the eligibility criteria for Newstart, as they were considered to be under-employed rather than unemployed (their employer was looking for other work for them to perform rather than making them redundant in the tight employment market in this area; or
claimants were on visas that required their sponsor (usually their current employer) to provide their support when they were unable to work.
Some contact was made by independent contractors who were immediately impacted by the gas explosion and others who were indirectly impacted through flow on effects (e.g. timber carrying contractors).  Contractors who were self employed and lost contracts were, in many cases not eligible for Newstart, as they were not unemployed and hence they did not meet the eligibility criteria for that payment even though they had temporarily lost income.

Coalition Senators’ Dissenting Report


Recommendation

1.67 Coalition Senators believe the implications of these conclusions are of such gravity that the State Government be called upon to establish a Judiciary or other major independent Inquiry to investigate the aforementioned matters.

Government’s Position:

The Australian Government notes this Recommendation. On 9 January 2009, the Commonwealth and Western Australian (WA) Governments jointly announced an independent inquiry into the occupational health and safety and integrity regulation for upstream petroleum operations with a focus on the incident at the facilities operated by Apache Energy Limited on Varanus Island, WA.
A two member expert panel consisting of Mr Kym Bills, the former Executive Director of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, and Mr David Agostini, a former executive of Woodside Petroleum, conducted the inquiry.
Following a successful Federal Court challenge by Apache Energy Ltd in May 2009, the Terms of Reference for the Inquiry were altered, with two reports prepared on better practice regulation and the role of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA) and improving the interface between NOPSA and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA).
The two Reports, Better practice and the effectiveness of NOPSA (the NOPSA Report) and Marine issues (the Marine Report), were provided to Minister Ferguson on 12 June 2009.  The Minister released the reports at the 9th meeting of the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources (MCMPR) on 9 July 2009.
The two reports are available on the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism website (www.ret.gov.au).
The Government is considering the recommendations and findings in the two reports and will respond by the end of November 2009, with a view to introducing appropriate legislation in early 2010.

REPORT BY THE SENATE EMPLOYMENT, WORKPLACE RELATIONS AND EDUCATION COMMITTEE


‘Inquiry into Workforce Challenges in the Transport Industry’


THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT


PREAMBLE

The Australian Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee: Inquiry into Workforce Challenges in the Transport Industry.
The Senate referred this inquiry into workforce challenges in the transport industry to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee on 6 September 2006. The purpose of the inquiry was to:
(a) Address the scope of the problem of labour and skill shortages affecting all sectors of the transport industry and the likely consequences of serious labour shortages;
(b) Review labour supply research undertaken for the transport industry, to canvass the views of industry, consumers and unions in regard to recruitment and employment practices in the industry;
(c) Alert Parliament to the projected labour shortage in the transport industry which will seriously affect the distribution of all goods and most travel services in the next ten years;
(d) Make recommendations on Commonwealth-led coordination of improved training delivery for the sector, and address issues related to employment incentives that are characteristic of the industry.
The committee tabled its report Workforce Challenges in the Transport Industry on 9 August 2007.
The Australian Government agrees with the Committee that an effective transport and logistics industry is critical to building Australia’s future economic wealth. The Australian Government also agrees with the Committee’s findings that a range of workforce challenges are facing Australia’s transport industry, across roads and railways, shipping and aviation.
Over the decade to 2008, Australia recorded strong economic and labour market performance. More recently, however, the global recession has deepened and Australia has experienced slowing growth and rising unemployment. Recent research indicates significant easing in skill shortages, however, skill and labour shortages persist in some occupations and industries and skill shortages can coexist with relatively high levels of occupational unemployment. Against this backdrop, it is important that transport industry employers implement recruitment, training and retention strategies to ensure they have the skilled staff to enable them to provide the critical infrastructure Australia needs. The Government will continue to work closely with the industry to assist it to achieve this objective.
The Australian Government’s response to the recommendations made by the Committee follows.

RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS


Recommendation 1

The committee recommends that industry bodies in each jurisdiction agree to a national branding image for adoption by transport and logistics operators in all sectors of the industry, to be used consistently in promotional activity. The brand should be attractive to both young people and to women, and underpinned by consistent professional workplace standards
Supported
This recommendation reflects the existing agreed approach.
Following the release of the Australian Logistics Industry Strategy (ALIS) in 2002, the Australian Logistics Council (ALC) was established with assistance from the then Department of Transport and Regional Services, to implement the ALIS recommendations and lead the Australian logistics industry in achieving lasting efficiencies and improvements in the sector. The development of a national branding image for the transport and logistics industry has been one of the ALC’s ongoing focus areas. This work continues to be implemented.
During 2006 and 2007, the ALC undertook a project under its Capable People work priority area to research and develop the transport and logistics (T&L) brand. The ALC produced a T&L logo in early 2007 as the official brand of the transport and logistics industry. The development of the logo forms part of a larger strategic agenda which aims to raise public awareness of the industry as a collective group. With the launch of the T&L logo, the ALC developed a brochure, Get into T&L. This brochure is aimed at the youth market and is distributed at Career Expos and other career forums.
Given the constantly evolving environment of the Transport and Logistics industry, the ALC recently sought comments from industry on the impact of the current T&L brand and whether or not the ALC can better display the momentum of the Transport and Logistics industry. The com-ments received were broadly supportive of the existing T&L logo. A few stakeholders suggested the font needs updating and more colour options should be made available. ALC has indicated they would consider updating the industry style guide if there is wider support for these changes.

Recommendation 2a

The committee recommends that transport and logistics industry operators engage with state and territory education authorities to find ways to raise the profile of transport and logistics in school-based career preparation activities, including exploring possibilities for more school-based apprenticeship programs and increasing industry presence at careers expos and similar events.
Supported in principle
Strategies to promote the diverse career opportunities within the transport and logistics industry should be developed in conjunction with existing career and transition services, such as Career Advice Australia (CAA) and include input from the National Industry Career Specialist (NICS) for Transport and Logistics, which is currently contracted to the Transport and Logistics Industry Skills Council (ISC).
CAA is an Australian Government initiative supporting young Australians, aged 13 to 19, to make successful transitions through school and from school to further education, training and work. CAA provides access to career information and advice, meaningful work experience and quality information about opportunities in industries to help young people make informed decisions about their futures.
CAA complements initiatives such as the myfuture website, The Real Game series, Vocational Education and Training (VET) in Schools and a wide range of other career development products and services. Some of these are outlined in further detail at Attachment 1.
The Transport and Logistics ISC which is the NICS for the transport and logistics industry can assist industry and state and territory education authorities to:
develop strategies for promoting transport and logistics careers to young people through the CAA networks;
identify models for regional transport and logistics businesses to become involved in CAA programs designed to improve young people’s understanding of the sector; and
work with regional transport and logistics businesses, Regional Industry Career Advisers (RICAs) and Local Community Partnerships (LCPs) to increase the availability and quality of structured workplace learning opportunities, increase industry engagement in Australian School-based Apprenticeships (ASbAs) and engage local employers in career and transition support programs.

Recommendation 2b

The committee further recommends that industry operators work with state and territory education authorities to increase opportunities for school-based apprenticeships in skills demanded by the industry, with a focus on secondary schools located near major transport hubs.
Supported in principle
The Government encourages the uptake of ASbAs through the provision of incentives for employers and apprentices. Employers are eligible for: commencement payments for ASbAs; rural and regional payments; additional assistance when employing an apprentice with a disability; and payments for the continued employment of ASbAs for 12 consecutive weeks after the student has completed Year 12. Career pathways in transport, distribution and logistics are available at Certificate II through to Diploma and Advanced Diploma levels.
The uptake of ASbAs in transport and logistics is relatively low compared with the overall uptake of ASbAs for all industries. For the twelve months ending 30 June 2008, there were 245 060 Certificate II and Certificate III Australian Apprenticeship commencements across Australia, of which eight per cent were ASbAs. For the same period, there were 20 107 commencements in transport and logistics, only one per cent of which were ASbAs.
Licensing issues pose one of the major barriers to the uptake of ASbAs. The licences required to complete some qualifications e.g. Certificate III in Transport and Distribution (Mobile Crane Operators and Road Transport) are dependent on age and therefore generally exclude school students from completing apprenticeships.

Recommendation 3

The committee recognises that the expansion of the subclass 457 visa to the transport industry is not an appropriate solution to the industry workforce challenges and recommends that this option is not considered by the industry.
Noted
On 15 May 2009, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship introduced a Legislative Instrument which excluded occupations in the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations (ASCO) Major Groups 5 to 7 from the Subclass 457 visa program where they were previously allowed in certain regional areas.
This change effectively precludes all road transport occupations from accessing the Subclass 457 visa program visa the Standard Business Sponsorship pathway.
The ASCO Major Group 5 to 7 caseload has been diverted to the Labour Agreement pathway where the associated risks may be more effectively managed by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in concert with the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations.
While the Labour Agreement framework provides a pathway for recruitment of occupations in ASCO Major Groups 5 to 7, it includes employment and training commitments which are monitored to ensure the recruitment of overseas workers does not result in Australian job losses.

Recommendation 4

The committee recommends that industry-wide strategic planning for training examine concerns that the transport and logistics training regime may not align with broader trades recognition processes in some jurisdictions, possibly to the detriment of transport employees.
The committee further recommends that strategic planning for industry-wide training include:
A review of current traineeship funding practices to ensure the delivery of government trainee funding is directed to new entrant training, and is not disguised using existing workers.
A minimum of 60 per cent of government training funding be directed to new industry entrants, to ensure at least 4500 new entrants are trained each year to meet projected industry demand.
Government funding to be linked to a licensing requirement to ensure new entrants complete their training with an appropriate license to ensure full participation on commencement of employment.
Not supported
Licence regulators often have very narrow standards which provide limited credit transfer into other vocational competencies. Licensing standards are limited in their focus and do not cover the broad occupational skills, competencies and knowledge that are required to participate fully in the workplace.
The Government understands the need for harmonisation of training and licensing requirements. This is currently being addressed in a variety of ways, including through the active involvement of licensing and regulatory bodies in the development of nationally accepted and endorsed competency standards in the training packages, through the development of national occupational health and safety competencies for high risk occupations conducted on behalf of the Australian Safety and Compensation Council and through the work of the Council of Australian Governments.
The Government supports industry-wide strategic planning for training in the transport and logistics industry through the Transport and Logistics ISC. The Transport and Logistics ISC is funded by the Government to develop, maintain and continuously improve nationally recognised and endorsed training packages to meet the needs of the transport and logistics industry sectors. These training packages must be developed in consultation with key stakeholders including industry regulatory and licensing bodies. All training packages incorporate, wherever possible, licensing requirements at a national or state and territory level.
The Government notes the declaration of, and funding for, apprenticeships and traineeships is the responsibility of the state and territory governments.
The Government supports and encourages the uptake and training of apprentices through the Australian Apprenticeship Incentive Program and the Productivity Places Program.
As part of its Skilling Australia for the Future initiative, the Government recognises the importance of nationally endorsed training in assisting job seekers to acquire skills and gain lasting employment and assisting existing workers to update or upgrade their skills.
Through the Productivity Places Program (PPP) the Australian Government is playing an active role in assisting industry to respond to the current economic downturn, build capacity for a future economic recovery, address areas of current and future skills needs, increase workforce participation and drive productivity growth.
The Government has allocated funds for 711 000 new training places over five years to ensure Australians develop the skills that industry needs.  Of these, 319 000 training places will be allocated for job seekers, including 20 000 places for redundant workers.  A further 392 000 places will provide improved qualifications and skills for people who are employed but need to update or upgrade their skills.
At 1 May 2009, 844 Registered Training Organisations had been contracted to deliver 6212 qualifications to job seekers from Certificate II to Diploma level.
Between April 2008 and 30 June 2009 the Australian Government has made available training places to job seekers. As at 18 May 2009, over 109 000 job seekers have enrolled, almost 86 000 have commenced and over 40 000 have completed training. 
Until 30 June 2009 job seeker places are being delivered by the Australian Government. The State and territory governments will deliver the PPP in the future. In November 2008, the Council of Australian Governments negotiated a National Partnership (NP) Agreement for PPP with seven state and territory governments to deliver job seeker and existing worker places from 2009 to 2012. The Victorian Government has negotiated separate arrangements.  The upskilling of existing workers under the PPP has been managed by the states and territories since the inception of the program, initially through a series of pilot projects.
Occupations and qualifications relevant to the transport industry currently attracting Productivity Places funding are outlined at Attachment 2.

Recommendation 5

The committee recommends that an industry-wide training levy be applied to all operators in all sectors of the transport and logistics industry. In determining the amount and method of paying the levy, reference should be made to the varying capacities of different companies and stakeholders to make such a contribution, so that no company or stakeholder is relatively disadvantaged or advantaged.
Not supported
The Australian Government has introduced a range of initiatives which are targeted and flexible in delivering outcomes for both industry and individuals. States and territories received almost $11 billion between 2005 and 2008 for VET including funding for apprenticeships, school-based vocational education and certificate level courses offered through TAFEs and Registered Training Organisations. Almost $5 billion of this funding was provided to states and territories under the 2005-2008 Commonwealth-State Agreement for Skilling Australia’s Workforce. States and territories also committed an additional $11 billion to the VET sector over the same period. Long term objectives for the national VET system are set out in Shaping Our Future, Australia’s National Strategy for Vocational Education and Training 2004-2010, and states and territories are working collaboratively through the Agreement to meet these priorities and position the VET sector to meet the challenges of the future.
The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has agreed to a new National Skills and Workforce Development Agreement which sets out the commitment between the Commonwealth and States to work towards increasing the skill levels of all Australians, including Indigenous Australians. Funding formerly provided to the states and territories under the 2005-2008 Common-wealth-State Agreement for Skilling Australia’s Workforce will now be made under the National Skills and Workforce Development Agreement, with the exception of a component of funding which has been quarantined for the management of the National Training System. The COAG federal financial framework reforms commenced with effect from 1 January 2009.
The Australian Government will continue to support a funding framework for VET which provides flexibility in meeting the needs of all industries across all states and territories. While the government does not support the mandatory establishment of training levies, it does support levies established by industry which strengthen industry investment in training and skills acquisition for workers, particularly where the establishment of such levies is initiated by industries, and employer and employee repre-sentatives.

Recommendation 6

The committee recommends that section 23AG of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 be reviewed, and the meaning of ‘foreign service’ for income tax purposes be clarified so that Australian seafarers are not disadvantaged in their earnings capacity relative to seafarers of other nations when working on foreign-flagged vessels on the high seas.
Subject to further consideration
This issue was also raised during the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government’s Inquiry into Coastal shipping policy and regulation. The Committee’s report Rebuilding Australia’s Coastal Shipping Industry, tabled on 20 October 2008, recommended a package of reforms aimed at revitalising the Australian shipping industry, including
Recommendation 13 (page 73)
The Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee recommended that section 23AG of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 be reviewed, and the meaning of ‘foreign service’ for income tax purposes be clarified so that Australian seafarers are not disadvantaged in their earnings capacity relative to seafarers of other nations when working on foreign-flagged vessels on the high seas.
The Committee concurs and also recommends that the Government review Section 23AG of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 so that Australian seafarers are not disadvantaged in their earnings capacity relative to seafarers of other nations when working on foreign-flagged vessels on the high seas.
The Government will consider this recommendation in the context of developing a whole of government response to the Committee’s recommendations in ‘Rebuilding Australia’s Coastal Shipping Industry’. Section 23AG was recently amended, with effect from 1 July 2009, to limit its former broad scope to income derived only in specific circumstances.

Recommendation 7a

The committee recommends that all jurisdictions ensure legislation is enacted to give effect to the model bill on chain of responsibility approved by Australian Transport Ministers in November 2003; and that all jurisdictions implement procedures to ensure the transport system is operating at optimal safety standards.
Supported
Recommendation 7a reflects agreed national policy.
The national model Road Transport Reform (Compliance and Enforcement) Bill, which was agreed to by the Australian Transport Council (ATC) of Transport Ministers in November 2003, is intended to improve compliance with, and enforcement of, the heavy vehicle laws relating to registration, licensing, mass and loading, speeding and driving hours. It is designed help governments give legislative effect to the chain of responsibility principle.
Following the agreement of ATC to the model Bill, jurisdictions are developing their own legislation to apply the model provisions. The implementation status is as follows:
model provisions implemented in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Victoria;
Tasmania – legislation passed in both houses with implementation expected in the last quarter of 2009; and
Western Australia, Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to implement provisions by the end of 2009.
For the Commonwealth, the Compliance and Enforcement amendments would apply to the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS). However, Commonwealth implementation will need to be addressed in the context of the new Australian Transport Council (ATC) Heavy Vehicle Reform framework. The ATC has recommended the establishment of a national heavy vehicle registration scheme – this would see the closure of the FIRS.

Recommendation 7b

The committee recommends that employers in all sectors of the transport and logistics industry give priority to improving work conditions, including minimum safe rates of pay and paid waiting time, as well as offering shorter or more flexible shifts and any other options as appropriate, as a means of retaining workers and encouraging current license holders to return to the industry.
Noted / Supported
The Government notes the Committee’s recommendation and supports improved working conditions and remuneration in all sectors of the industry. The Government also notes evidence in the report of some employers in the industry implementing incentives other than financial remuneration to attract and retain workers. The Committee’s finding that remuneration and other aspects of working conditions are equally important in providing incentives to attract and retain workers in the industry, is welcome. This is why the Government promotes a strong safety net, including for wages, and is committed to a workplace relations system which supports flexible working arrangements and the provision of parental leave.
The Government notes the recommendation of the Committee for employers to provide improved minimum working conditions. The Fair Work Act 2009 contains provisions to establish an improved safety net through the National Employment Standards (NES) and modern awards. The NES and modern awards will commence operation on 1 January 2010.
The Australian Industrial Relations Commission (the Commission) is currently undertaking the award modernisation process. Modern awards will provide a safety net of terms and conditions for employees, including those in the transport and logistics industry, and will provide an effective floor for collective bargaining. Modern awards will contain an individual flexibility clause and negotiated enterprise agreements will contain provision for individual flexibility arrangements. These provisions will allow an employer and an individual employee to tailor specific arrangements to their needs, but will still guarantee that an employee cannot be made worse off than their collectively negotiated conditions, or the terms of an applicable modern award.
The Government is also considering the October 2008 National Transport Commission Report – Safe Payments, Addressing the Underlying Causes of Unsafe Practices in the Road Transport Industry. The Government is advancing work on a response that examines the most effective means of dealing with this report’s recommendations for employee and owner-drivers, through legislative and other reforms. 
Currently, the Workplace Authority provides advice and support to employers and employees on the flexibilities for agreement making. The Workplace Ombudsman provides advice and assistance on workplace rights and responsibilities, seeks voluntary compliance, investigates complaints, conducts workplace audits and litigates breaches of workplace laws.
The Government’s workplace relations reforms include a new agency – Fair Work Australia to oversee the new industrial relations system. Fair Work Australia will be accessible and will provide fast and effective assistance to employers, employees and their representatives.
The enforcement and education activities of the new workplace relations system will be performed by the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman, which will provide practical information, advice and assistance on workplace issues, undertake inspection and enforcement activities to ensure compliance with workplace laws and promote harmonious and cooperative workplace relations. While the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman will have separate governance arrangements, its day-to-day operations will be practically integrated with the functions of Fair Work Australia to ensure the seamless delivery of services to the public.
The Government has announced that Fair Work Australia and the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman will commence on 1 July 2009.
The Government strongly encourages all sectors of the industry to utilise opportunities provided by the new workplace relations framework to promote a fair, balanced and productive environment. Through working cooperatively with employees in negotiating flexible arrangements, the significant workforce challenges currently facing the industry will be addressed.

Recommendation 8

The committee recommends that the three Commonwealth Government departments with portfolio responsibility for issues related to the transport and logistics industry workforce (the Department of Transport and Regional Services, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and the Department of Education, Science and Training) undertake a strategic policy discussion, developing and implementing a process for better communication and collaborative action on these matters.
The committee recommends that the Department of Transport and Regional Services take a leadership role in convening, motivating and sustaining this discussion.
Supported
Strong lines of communication exist between departments in the consideration of transport and logistics industry workforce issues. As necessary, the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government will convene future meetings of senior officers with the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to strengthen these processes. Ongoing consultation between departments and with industry, and across all levels of government will also continue through other structures such as the Transport and Logistics ISC and the Australian Transport Council.
Under the Skilling Australia for the Future policy, in addition to their original roles of developing and maintaining training packages in line with research and market intelligence, the ISCs are funded by the Australian Government to:
provide integrated industry intelligence and advice to Skills Australia, government and enterprises on workforce development and skills needs;
actively support the development, imple-mentation and continuous improvement of high quality training and workforce development products and services including training packages;
provide independent skills and training advice to enterprises, including matching identified training needs with appropriate training solutions; and
work with enterprises, Employment Service Providers and training providers to ensure that individual and enterprise training needs are matched to appropriate training.
The Transport and Logistics ISC’s Strategic and Operational Plans 2008-11 articulate how the ISC will work with individual industries to provide tailored skills and training, workforce planning assistance and advice. In undertaking these roles, the Transport and Logistics ISC will draw on widespread industry networks and active stakeholder engagement.
In May 2008, the Australian Transport Council of Ministers agreed there was need to improve industry collaboration, facilitation and coordination to identify and explore possible solutions to transport and logistics sector workforce planning and skills gaps. To this end, Ministers agreed to develop a Directional National Transport and Logistics Industry People Strategy - for consideration by Ministers in November 2009 - which will identify possible future actions and leadership responsibilities to address gaps.  The strategy will be complemented by a national forum to support and improve industry and government collaboration in workforce planning and skills provision and identify gaps in addressing workforce issues which require progressing at a national level.

Recommendation 9

The committee recommends that the ALC continue development of the next five-year strategy for the national transport and logistics industry, but extend the overall scope of planning work to focus on the next ten and twenty years as well.
The committee further recommends that planning activities undertaken by the ALC should include representation from transport employee bodies and major transport users including mining companies.
The committee recommends that the ALC also give particular priority to addressing constraints on integrated use of different elements of the transport system, and identifies ways to achieve maximum operating capacity from current and planned infrastructure.
Supported
This recommendation reflects existing agreed arrangements.
Following the finalisation of the ALIS in February 2007, the ALC was asked to develop and steer the implementation of a new industry strategy. In February 2008 the ALC launched the new strategy titled The National Strategy for the Transport and Logistics Freight Industry – Enhancing Australia’s Supply Chains 2008-15.
In developing the new strategy the ALC wrote to key stakeholders in the transport and logistics industry to seek input and held a series of consultation workshops in all states and territories to capture industry views. The ALC also developed a number of future scenarios set around a long term planning framework to the year 2020.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE FINANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFERENCES COMMITTEE REPORT ON MATTERS RELATING TO THE GALLIPOLI PENINSULA

This Government notes that the enquiry addressed contentious, complex and sensitive matters that attracted considerable media and community attention in 2005 and continue to be matters of importance to the Australian public and in Turkey.
The Government acknowledges the commitment of committee members in seeking to ensure that the issues were fully addressed and that all submissions and witnesses were afforded proper consideration.
Turkey has sovereign responsibility for the Gallipoli Peninsula and the historic, cultural and environmental significance of the area to Turkey from antiquity, during the First World War to the present day, and its significance to the countries involved in the Gallipoli campaign.
The Government notes and supports the measures taken by Turkey, including the Long Term Development Plan, approved by the Turkish Parliament, for the Gallipoli Peninsula Historical National Park, its declaration of the area as an International Peace Park, and the heritage listing of the Gallipoli Peninsula under Turkish law as important steps to address the longer term issues of preservation of this area.
Since the publication of the Report, there has been a range of actions that demonstrate the Australian Government’s respect for and commitment to preservation of the Anzac area on the Gallipoli Peninsula.
The Australian Government named Anzac Cove on the inaugural List of Overseas Places of Historic Significance to Australia in August 2007, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act administered by the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts.  The listing was accepted by the Turkish Government.
Recommendations 1 to 4 are concerned with the ongoing issues relating to roadworks, appropriate handling of human remains, and commitment to the conservation and preservation of the Anzac Battlefield area.  The Government shares the Australian public’s concerns over future road works in the Anzac area.  In this regard, the Government continues to work with Turkish authorities towards a resolution of the Anzac Cove road and associated issues.    The Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Veterans’ Affairs continue to monitor and report on the road conditions and works in the Anzac area on the Gallipoli Peninsula.
The Government is mindful that the Gallipoli Peninsula has a long history as a battle site.  This history and the number of deaths in the Gallipoli campaign of 1915 make it inevitable that there will be human remains found in the area.  Responsibility for the policy and procedures for handling human remains found on the Gallipoli Peninsula resides with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) and Turkish authorities.  The CWGC policy and procedures are published on the Department of Veterans’ Affairs website and in departmental publications, and reinforced with tour operators.  The Government considers that existing procedures for reinterment and reporting of any remains found are appropriate and practical and ensure the dignity of  deceased soldiers, allied and Turkish.  The Government will continue to take opportunities to raise awareness of the proper handling of any remains found through its publicly available information.  The Turkish authorities approach to the reinterment of remains is consistent in intent with the CWGC policy and have, during roads works undertaken last November, included an archaeologist from the National Parks in their project oversight team.  This is a significant inclusion and is indicative of the shared concern over the management of this sensitive issue.
The joint historical study, including archaeological aspects, is an important measure for the preservation of the Anzac area.  The purpose of the study is to provide a clear basis for balancing development plans for the Gallipoli Peninsula Historical National Park with the preservation of key sites.  Regrettably, the study stalled until this Government pressed for progress.  The Turkish Government advised on 16 April 2009 that the Canakkale Eighteen March University will be the lead Turkish institution.  The Australian and New Zealand members of the study team met with their Turkish counterparts on 12-13 October 2009 to determine the framework and timeframe for the study.  Outcomes of the meeting are being progressed by the team members with the first field phase subject to timing of permit approval processes.
The Australian representatives, advised to the Turkish Government, are Rear Admiral Simon Harrington AM RAN (Retd), Professor Antonio Sagona and Associate Professor Christopher Mackie from the Centre for Classics and Archaeology, University of Melbourne, and Dr Richard Reid, historian.  New Zealand has nominated Dr Ian McGibbon, historian, as their representative for the study.  This Government expects the study to be undertaken in phases and will report on progressive outcomes.  The Governments of Turkey, Australia and New Zealand would need to agree on the release of any Government-appointed study.
Recommendations 5 to 7 seek to ensure issues relating to Gallipoli, and more broadly, commemorations, are dealt with transparently and in concert with Turkey and New Zealand, while Recommendations 8 and 9 specifically relate to maintaining an open and ongoing dialogue with the Turkish Government.  The Government recognises that there are many diverse interest groups in Australia which have a vested and genuine interest in the preservation of Australian heritage.  The Government will continue to keep these groups informed through public messages. 
Working with the Turkish Government is integral to ensuring our interests are taken into account.  The Australian Government presence in Turkey has been considerably strengthened by the establishment in 2005-06 of the position of Counsellor (Veterans’ Affairs) in the Australian Embassy, Ankara, and the Consulate in Canakkale.  The Counsellor and Consul, under the direction of the Australian Ambassador and the Secretary, Department of Veterans’ Affairs, continue to represent Australia’s interests, at the national and local levels in Turkey, in all matters relating to the Gallipoli Peninsula, including in relation to Anzac Day commemorations, works in and preservation of the Anzac area and recognition of the historical importance of the former battle sites and the remains and artefacts that they contain. 
The Australian Government, through the Australian Embassy in Turkey and Department of Veterans’ Affairs, maintains an ongoing dialogue with Turkish officials on issues affecting the Anzac area.  It continues to work with them on plans and initiatives to preserve the area, as well as ongoing management of the Gallipoli Historical National Park while recognising that Turkey has sovereign responsibility for the Gallipoli Peninsula.  The Australian Embassy has been effective in representing this Government’s strong interest in the area and the commencement of the historical study.  The Government, through its officials, continues to inform and liaise with New Zealand counterparts on these matters.
The Government reports to Parliament through existing arrangements and is satisfied with current Parliamentary scrutiny and reporting of the Veterans’ Affairs portfolio on matters relating to the Gallipoli Peninsula.  These provide for periodic and ad hoc reporting.  Members and Senators have taken the opportunity to visit Turkey, particularly around Anzac Day, and New Zealand and to meet with counterparts in those countries. 
Where appropriate, public statements will be made to inform the public and interested stakeholders on matters pertaining to preservation of the Gallipoli Peninsula.
The Government is satisfied with current Parliamentary scrutiny and reporting of the Veterans’ Affairs portfolio on matters relating to commemorations.  The commemoration of Austudy-ralia’s wartime history, including many commemorative activities, has a long established tradition of political bipartisanship.
The Australian Government has commenced planning for the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign in 2015, with the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs taking the lead in this matter.  In developing proposals for Australian recognition of this seminal period in our nation’s history, there will be broad consultation with a range of government agencies, the ex-service and Defence communities, the education and cultural sectors and the wider community as well as the Turkish and New Zealand Governments.  Measures that aim to further recognise and preserve the Anzac area will be considered as part of this process.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,25,1,speech

Whip/ Selection of Bills Committee member",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,29,2,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2009-11-19,"—I wish to discuss the motion that the Senate take note of the following document: Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority: outlook report 2009. In the Canberra Times on Tuesday this week there was a report that said that the Great Barrier Reef has less than a fifty-fifty chance of surviving until 2050. It is reported that Climate Change Alliance scientists are saying that emissions would have to be reduced by 90 per cent by 2050. Not even the Greens, as extreme as they are, are pitching for that figure. This group of scientists is pitching for a 90 per cent reduction in emissions below the 2000 level. As I say, not even the Greens have pitched their extremism that far. I think they go for 80 per cent—very close. The point is that these scientists have just set up a straw man, claiming without evidence that if the temperature around the Great Barrier Reef was to increase greater than two to three degrees the reef would be burnt and singed, and would not exist after the year 2050.
I bring this extremism to the Senate’s attention because this is one of the icons that the extremists in this climate change debate put up. They have got several icons and I wish to go through them, but this particular pitch and its degree of absurdity ought to be brought to the Senate’s attention. Of course, those scientists believe Australia—to save the Great Barrier Reef—ought to introduce an emissions trading scheme next week, pre-Copenhagen, and that Australia’s own emissions trading scheme, forget the world, will save the Great Barrier Reef.
Not even the world believes that, because the world has put off Armageddon, if you have not noticed. The world leaders in Canada, the United States, APEC and the United Nations group that met in Barcelona have all put off Armageddon and now, as we get closer to Copenhagen, the deal is slipping further. As I say, this is the tactic of discredited scientists just seeking research dollars, United Nations committees just seeking relevance, and politicians—particularly from the other side—just seeking votes. These are the extreme tactics and views.
The Great Barrier Reef is the great icon—there are others such as the Antarctic—that they put up to justify their extreme position on climate change. I should add that these scientists do not even give any credence—as the other side doesn’t—to natural changes in climate. We have not heard about that from the other side. We have not heard them say anything about factoring it in. These scientists have not factored it in to any change that may occur in the Great Barrier Reef. I dare say the Great Barrier Reef has been changing over the last tens of thousands, if not millions, of years. No—the other side, these scientists and half of the scientists in CSIRO do not factor natural climate change into their calculations at all. They put it all down to man-made climate change and the emissions effect.
The Antarctic is the other great icon they put up. Their views are discredited. Our own Curtin University in Western Australia has recognised in undisputed research that the Antarctic is not melting. I notice that has gone off the map. Even the high priestess, Senator Wong, does not use that as a great icon. Another one she does use is the great Murray River, saying that the whole drying up of the Murray River is a great effect of climate change. What a load of rubbish. The Adelaide population has doubled. Usage by the farmers has doubled. It is true that we are in the grip of an exceptional drought but that is because of El Nino. That is the source of the drought. They cannot relate it to man-made climate change. Senator McEwen was in here today talking about bushfires but time will run out before I can rip that particular idiocy apart.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority</title>,Documents,31,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-11-19,"—First of all, I congratulate the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, particularly their chief, Dr Russell Reichelt, and the work that they do continuously to support our Great Barrier Reef. It is a unique destination and icon of Australia, and one that is particularly important to that part of Queensland where I hail from. Tourism from the Great Barrier Reef is enormously beneficial to the economy of North Queensland. As guardians of one of the best reefs in the world, we have a responsibility to the world to look after the reef—and we do it very well.
In view of some of the things that Senator McGauran has just rightly raised, I want to raise some things out of this Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority: outlook report 2009. I am surprised the Greens political party are not here to talk about this. I acknowledge that it is late in the parliamentary week but one would think, given the way they carry on about the Great Barrier Reef, they would be here to talk about this particular report. I refer my Senate colleagues to the executive summary of this report. I will just quote a few things:
The Great Barrier Reef is one of the most diverse and remarkable ecosystems in the world and remains one of the most healthy coral reef ecosystems.
If you listen to Senator Wong or the Greens, you would think that the Great Barrier Reef was about to disappear from this earth. That is not so, according to this very scientific report. I quote from a little further on:
While populations of almost all marine species are intact and there are no records of extinctions, some ecologically important species, such as dugongs, marine turtles, seabirds, black teatfish and some sharks, have declined significantly. Although the declines of loggerhead turtles and dugongs are believed to have halted, there are few examples of increasing populations in species of conservation concern.
That is a big tick to the Howard government, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Australian Institute of Marine Science and to James Cook University for all of their work over the last decade or so.
I will continue quoting from this executive summary:
Corel reef habitats fluctuate naturally depending on changes in environmental conditions, but they are gradually declining, especially inshore, as a result of poor water quality and the compounding effects of climate change. Habitats more remote from human use, such as the continental slope and reefs in the far north are believed to be in very good condition and portions of the lagoon floor are recovering from previous effects of trawling.
So you can see there are positives. The executive summary goes on to say:
The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is considered by many to be a leading example of world’s best practice management.
Now, again, if you would listen to Senator Wong or the Greens political party, you would think that the Barrier Reef was just about dead.
Time is not going to allow me to quote some of the other very important aspects of this executive summary, but I will perhaps just go to the final paragraph:
Further building the resilience of the Great Barrier Reef by improving water quality, reducing the loss of coastal habitats and increasing knowledge about fishing and its effects, will give it the best chance of adapting to and recovering from the serious threats ahead, especially from climate change.
If you look at that carefully, you will see that the Barrier Reef can adapt to climate change providing we do the other things—the managing of water quality, the reduction in the loss of coastal habitats and the increasing of our knowledge about fishing and its effects. I might say it was the Howard government that poured millions and millions of dollars into research to make sure those redeeming effects do happen. Congratulations to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on this outlook report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2009-11-19,"—I rise today to draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that this week is International Brain Tumour Awareness Week. The third Brain Tumour Awareness Week was held between Sunday, 1 November and Saturday, 7 November 2009 in Australia but this week is the International Brain Tumour Awareness Week. I would also like to mention the forthcoming 125th anniversary, on 25 November, of the first documented, modern-day surgery for a glioma.
Without complicating the issue too much, and bearing in mind I am not a doctor, I will just explain that gliomas are brain tumours associated with the three types of glial cells in the brain and they can cause quite a lot of illness and in some cases even be fatal. Glial cells make up the supportive tissue of the brain and, unlike neurons, do not conduct electrical impulses.
If left untreated, any type of glioma may grow and press on other structures within the brain. Pressure on the brain, of course, can be very harmful because it forces the brain against the skull, causing damage to the brain and hampering its ability to function properly. This reduced function can lead to long-lasting brain damage or, as I said, if left untreated can lead to death.
One of the organisations behind the development of International Brain Tumour Awareness Week was the International Brain Tumour Alliance, IBTA, which was established in 2005 and is an organisation that provides support, information and advocacy as well as conducting research into this significant illness. On its website, the IBTA promotes ‘greater collaboration, greater knowledge, greater hope’. That is a slogan that could be used to sum up medical treatment for many illnesses but is especially true in the case of brain tumours. More collaboration is needed to find new and better ways to treat and cure brain tumours, increased knowledge is needed to make the general public aware of the symptoms to look for, and hope is needed for both sufferers and their families.
I have established a parliamentary brain tumour awareness group within parliament. That held its first meeting in August. I established that group because I feel it is an area that needs more publicity and support and also because it is an area that I have personal experience with. In March of 2008, I suddenly became very ill. This was about 12 weeks before I was due to take up my position officially in the Senate following my election in November 2007. I had no real warnings or symptoms that made me worried that I might be ill but it turned out I had two brain tumours in the back section of my head.
Without going into all the gory details, one was the size of a golf ball and it was pressing against my brain stem, blocking the brain fluid from going around in my skull. Without an exit, it was pooling on top of my brain—a circumstance known as hydrocephalus—forcing my brain to expand. I am sure some people could make the comment that that could be quite helpful! It was also increasing the pressure in my skull, which was obviously very dangerous. This caused me, quite out of the blue, to start having quite severe headaches. The other one was on the other side of the skull. It was smaller but still had the same damaging potential as its larger roommate.
I underwent two lots of surgery, five days apart. The first surgery was to have a drain put into my skull to drain the excess fluid, which enabled the second round of surgery to take place. The second surgery was to remove the tumours. When I came round, after what my surgeon described to me as text book surgery, I was told the good news—both of the tumours were benign, and both had been successfully taken out. Within 10 to 12 weeks of surgery I was able to take up my Senate position representing the people of Tasmania.
Here, I would like to reiterate my sincere thanks and admiration for all the staff at the Royal Hobart Hospital for their excellent care and attention to me throughout this ordeal. I still undergo frequent checks to make sure that nothing awful is happening in my head and I get wonderful care and attention every time I am there. But unfortunately not everyone is as lucky as I was. There are more than 120 different types of brain tumours. The three main categories are: primary; benign; and brain metastases, which arise from a cancer elsewhere in the body.
George Harrison had a brain tumour, as did Bob Marley and Ethel Merman. George Gershwin, William Casey and Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein, died from brain tumours. The former Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss, was diagnosed with a brain tumour, and it was subsequently removed without any problems. The highly regarded and respected Professor Chris O’Brien, who was one of Australia’s top cancer surgeons and was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in 2006, died earlier this year. And the list goes on.
The cause of brain tumours is unknown. They strike randomly. They cannot be prevented by lifestyle choices and are impossible to screen and detect early. There is no cure—although you can recover if you manage to undergo successful surgery—and very little in the way of effective treatments. While the treatment for malignant tumours is often surgery, radiation or chemotherapy, depending on the type, location and degree of malignancy, the truth is that you simply cannot treat brain cancer the same way you treat leukaemia or most other forms of cancer. Even benign tumours can be inoperable or can cause death or brain injury as a result of surgery or excess pressure on the brain.
Brain tumours are the only cancer that affects a person’s capacity both physically and mentally. Children with brain tumours—unfortunately, a lot of them do suffer from brain tumours—may suffer from neurological illness, with behavioural and cognitive problems, even if treatment has been effective. According to the Brain Tumour Alliance, paediatric brain tumours are the second most common cause of death in children for all cancers after leukaemia. In countries such as the Unites States, Canada and the United Kingdom, they are now the greatest cause of childhood cancer mortality in the age group zero to 14. This does not represent a growing incidence of brain tumours in children; it shows that the research and advances made in leukaemia treatment have, comparatively, left the insignificant improvements in brain tumour research behind.
Brain tumours are significantly difficult to treat well, even in high-income countries. The last major international breakthrough came in 2000, when researchers identified the usefulness of a certain chemotherapy drug when administered conjointly with radiation therapy and for a period afterwards. Apparently it works really well. That was hailed as the first breakthrough in 30 years. In 2004, 1,609 people in Australia were diagnosed with a malignant primary brain tumour. Sadly, about 300 Australian children are diagnosed with a brain tumour every year. Worldwide, 200,000 people develop a primary malignant brain tumour each year. Many of these people die within 12 months.
Brain Tumour Awareness Week strives to bring light to this silent killer. Compared with other cancers, a relatively high proportion of brain tumour research in Australia is dependent on private charity funding, although $1.13 million out of the National Health and Medical Research Council program of $357 million went towards brain cancer research. People are slowly gaining awareness of brain cancer as the serious illness it is, but its coverage is still poor at best. There is a real need to promote further understanding and acceptance of brain cancer worldwide. Because it cannot be detected early, often the first signs are the symptoms that I explained earlier. By then, for many, it may already be too late. Many people live with knowledge of their inoperable brain tumours for only a few months. For those who have them removed, there is the chance they may grow back malignant. The incidence of brain tumours increased by approximately 10 per cent over the decade 1991 to 2000.
Because brain tumours are usually located at the control centre for thought, emotion and movement, their effects—especially in children—on physical and cognitive abilities can be devastating. Research for paediatric brain tumours cannot simply be taken from research done on adult brain tumours. Paediatric tumours and adult tumours differ in several important ways. Some tumours commonly found in adults do not commonly appear in children, and vice versa. With that in mind, adult brain tumours tend to occur in the cerebral hemispheres, the largest parts of the brain. (Extension of time granted).
There are a number of events taking place through November in Australia in regard to brain tumour awareness. In Brain Tumour Awareness Week, which, as I said, was from 1 to 7 November, lots of newspaper articles on brain tumours were written. Such articles help to bring the issue to the forefront of the layperson’s mind. Patients, caregivers, health professionals and advocates shared stories and helped to raise awareness in a multitude of ways. The Walk 4 Life in Sydney’s Centennial Park, where 335 people walked a total of 1,336 kilometres, raised about $60,000. Nurses held a fundraising barbeque at Westmead Hospital. The Royal Melbourne Hospital held lunchtime lectures for staff. Those are just a few of the events that took place.
I encourage everyone listening to or reading this speech to educate themselves more about brain tumours so that they know the signs to watch out for to protect their own health and also the health of loved ones. Furthermore, I want them to realise that brain tumours can change their lives and the lives of those around them. Together we can promote brain tumour awareness and work towards giving both current and future generations a better chance at beating the challenge that brain tumours present. Thank you again, Senator Parry, for allowing me to speak a bit longer.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>International Brain Tumour Awareness Week</title>,Adjournment,35,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-11-19," asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, upon notice, on 16 June 2009:
With reference to the Minister’s speech at the Auswind 2007 conference and exhibition ‘Future Vision 2020’ in which he outlined ten key measures for addressing climate change, and in particular, point three - lead by example, ‘Here’s a radical notion: a Federal Government putting its money where its mouth is on climate change policy. We will use government’s purchasing power to develop markets for efficient technologies and we will set an objective to power Parliament House and all MP electorate offices with renewable and clean energy’ and given that the current energy contract for Parliament house will expire on 30 June 2009: will the Minister deliver on his promise and negotiate a new energy contract to power Parliament House and electorate offices with renewable and clean energy from 1 July 2009; if not, why not; if so, how will point three be implemented.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,37,1,question
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-11-19,"—The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
Over 170 Australian Government sites in the Australian Capital Territory purchase their electricity through a whole of government contractual arrangement currently managed by the Department of Defence. On 1 July 2009, a new contract came into effect under which the agencies represented purchase a minimum of 10 per cent of all electricity from clean, accredited renewable sources (Greenpower). This amounts to approximately 17,700 megawatt hours per annum.
I understand that the Department of Parliamentary Services will be party to this agreement and continue to procure 25 per cent (its current level) of renewable energy for Parliament House.
The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA), as the department responsible for the Energy Efficiency in Government Operations policy, will continue to provide support to the Department of Parliamentary Services, as it explores opportunities to improve the energy efficiency of Parliament House.
As the request of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, officials from DEWHA have met with the Department of Parliamentary
Services to discuss their strategies for improving energy efficiency at Parliament House, based on consideration of an energy audit undertaken recently for Parliament House.
The procurement of renewable energy (Greenpower) for Senators and Members’ electorate offices is currently being investigated by the Department of Finance and Deregulation.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,37,1,answer
