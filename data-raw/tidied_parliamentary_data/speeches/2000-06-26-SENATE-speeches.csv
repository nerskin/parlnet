"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-06-26,"—The Indirect Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 is quite extensive. It covers many issues relating to the new tax system, but I am not going to go through each individual matter in detail. It contains a range of amendments that the government has delivered that we pushed very hard for, particularly amendments relating to charities, the public education system—public schools—and small winemakers. I want to start by acknowledging that. I also want to mention a couple of issues on which the government has not as yet delivered. Undertakings have been made by government leadership in those areas, and portfolio ministers have not yet completed what was agreed during the last 12 months.
Let us begin by looking at the good news. Over the last year, the Democrats have been pushing very hard to improve the operation of the GST in respect of charities and not-for-profit bodies. In our agreement with the government last year, it was an essential part of the agreement that a Charities Consultative Committee be set up. This was chaired by the deputy commissioner, Rick Matthews, and consisted of representatives of the charitable sector. That committee has been a huge success, in large part because of the work of its members—I should single out the excellent work of our nominee on the committee, Associate Professor Myles McGreggor Lownes—also because of the openness to good argument of the tax officials, led by Mr Matthews, and because the Democrats have kept pushing the needs of this sector in our negotiations with government. Since last June, the government has already agreed to make GST exempt the fundraising ventures of not-for-profit organisations in subentities with incomes of less than $100,000. It has also agreed to broaden GST-free treatment to goods sold for less than 75 per cent of their direct cost and to issue generous rulings on the definition of charities and the tax treatment of things like accommodation, membership fees and journals—to name just a few.
This bill goes even further, containing even more amendments. It includes making GST exempt major one-off fundraising events run by charities, which is something that we first proposed last April. It will allow for more flexible quarterly reporting and the reimbursement of volunteers' expenses. It cleans up compliance costs for tuckshops and allows church groups to eliminate internal transactions for GST purposes. All of these recommendations have come out of the Charities Consultative Committee. Comparing the concessions for charities now available under the GST—as improved by the Democrats' work over the past year—to the treatment of charities by any of the 28 OECD countries with a GST, we really can say that in Australia we will deliver the most generous treatment in terms of zero rating and exemptions. In addition, there are two major new concessions for schools: government schools will now have the same GST-free treatment as charities and private schools, which is something we lobbied very hard for; and equipment leased or hired by schools will be GST free—another one of our key demands. I only hope that the state governments will make it very clear to schools how this entire section of the act is actually going to impact on them. 
The bill also puts into legislation the $46 million rebate scheme for small winemakers, agreed between the Democrats and the government in September last year. This rebate effectively means that small winemakers with a turnover on cellar door or mail-order sales of less than $300,000 will be exempt from the wine equalisation tax—WET—with the 15 per cent state rebate and the 14 per cent federal rebate. That means that WET will not apply to around two-thirds of wineries at all—the small, boutique wineries that are so important to our rural and regional tourism industries. In addition, this bill contains 58 pages of other technical amendments to the GST legislation that have flowed out of the industry consultative process and the ATO, which clarify aspects of the law as it pertains to a wide range of issues.
This is the sixth bill amending the GST act that the Senate has dealt with since July last year. This should not be any surprise to those who have been following the implementation of our new tax system. The GST is a new tax system, and it was inevitable that aspects of its operation would be modified as the Australian Taxation Office came to better understand different types of businesses and different sections of industry. The government has been prepared to keep working through technical issues for many business groups as well as for charities, and that has certainly been a real positive.
I will move on to other issues. The government's plan to offer caravan park operators the choice of input taxing or half of the 5.5 per cent rate of the GST was on the table and in the package before we started our negotiations with the government. In principle, we can, and could at that stage, see the merit of this approach. It will overcome the problems that operators would have had in trying to divide between permanent residents and temporary residents and in trying to determine where tax credits could be claimed and where tax credits could not be claimed. Indeed, the operators themselves were very comfortable with this arrangement.
The big question, though, is: what is the impact in the short term on the permanent residents of caravan parks and boarding houses? Has the right rate been chosen? This was a matter of discussion between the Democrats and the Treasurer and the Prime Minister back in June last year, and this is where we accepted the government's undertaking that specific modelling on the issue would be commissioned. We asked the government to model the specific circumstances of specific types of caravan parks and boarding houses, and the government commissioned a study on boarding houses through the Department of Family and Community Services. This was completed in January. It was sent back to the consultant for some reworking and finalised in March. As Senator Newman has told us during question time on a couple of occasions, it was then sent back to Treasury.
This is where the problems seem to have started because, despite our asking for the study on numerous occasions, it finally surfaced only when Channel 9 released sections of it a week or so ago, which did not impress many of us. It seems that the reason it became lost for so long—and certainly once we had read it—was that it was not that favourable in the short term, particularly for residents in homes where there is little, if any, refurbishment and upgrading. We then announced that the best way to overcome this was to halve the rate, and we believed that this was, on all the modelling, the fairest possible outcome. It was clear that the 5.5 per cent rate was not a good deal in the short term for boarding house residents. Indeed, the model that we suggested was the preferred one of the Caravan and Camping Industry Association, the key industry body. Our option—that is, reducing the rate of 5.5 per cent by half to 2.75 per cent—would have resulted in a one per cent to 1¼ per cent rise in boarding house fees. This compares with the rate found in the report of about four per cent under the government's proposal. The suggestion that the Labor Party made that there should not be a tax option but only input taxing would have meant about a 3.6 per cent increase. If you forced the caravan parks and boarding houses to do it, the option that the Labor Party has offered would have meant at least a 3.6 per cent rise in the short term. Obviously, we could not accept that either. 
Very early in the debate, Senator Cook, on behalf of the ALP, announced that the ALP would be voting down our amendment in this chamber, which left us wanting to get a better result, particularly for those in boarding houses and caravan parks where there were not going to be a lot of write-offs. You have to look right across the spectrum and give a full range of options and opportunities to the operators so that they can choose what will give the best result for those who live permanently in their establishments. Even though our rate delivered a better outcome for residents than Labor's input taxing model, the ALP made it very clear that they would vote down our amendment. With no hope of our amendment getting up in the Senate, at the end of the day the Democrats got another $33 million increase in rent assistance and a guarantee that the ACCC will keep a very tight watch on all operators and that operators will actually be encouraged to get—
—No, it goes a lot further than what the National Party was able to negotiate, because the reporting back process will be to parliament and the emphasis will be not on what is best for the operator but on what will get the best outcome for their residents. That is the key issue here: the outcome has to be for the residents. It is not as good for caravan park and boarding house residents as our first option, but it is a lot better than the position the ALP left us. One other positive about the option that we have negotiated is that this $33 million is not just for those living in boarding houses and caravan parks but for all renters who are eligible for rent assistance, and all of the people who are receiving some form of support payment qualify for rent assistance. It will therefore spread to those renting flats, houses, et cetera. It is one of those issues on which we have an outcome, even if it is not the one we preferred.
I will touch briefly on some of the other discussions where we still have what is best described as unfinished business. In particular, this is in the area of the environment, where I believe there is serious white-anting of our proposals by a number of ministers. They may think that they are white-anting us, but in fact they are white-anting their own government's commitments on issues such as genetically modified foods, the greenhouse trigger and second-hand diesel engines. Unfortunately, quite a list is beginning to grow. They are all in our pending, not yet finalised basket, and we will keep harassing government in whichever ways we can. I say to those ministers: commitments have been given in a number of areas, the issues are not finalised yet and we will be watching with great interest to see the final decision.
In the few minutes I have left, I must touch on the government's advertising campaign. In this area, I think the government has really shot itself in the foot. Obviously, a lot of what is being spent is essential spending. The seminars, the money that is going into the field trips, the web site—although there still seems to be an enormous backlog there—the information packs and a lot of the specific industry targeted assistance are obviously essential, although I note that the ALP seems to have managed to wind it all up into the one basket and talk in very general terms when it criticises one particular series of television ads.
In my view, the spending of $40 million on those television ads has been largely an exercise in wasting money and alienating some of the people who were on the side of tax reform in the first place. I do not know what sort of research and development the government did. I presumed they had better access to focus groups and polling, which would have told them that the community was after specific details and specific information. As difficult to get across in a 20- or 30-second ad as some of that may be, I would suggest that primary school classes set the exercise of selling basic GST information would have managed it in a more acceptable way—with far more detail—than the government have managed it. Hopefully, people will see the last of the Unchain My Heart ads very shortly. I do not think they will be missed. We stayed with tax reform because we thought it was a story worth being involved in. We thought tax reform was essential. We are very disappointed that we have not had a government program of advertising that gets information across to the many people who are still unnecessarily concerned about how the tax system will help them. 
We stayed on the side of tax reform in this debate because we will be seeing more money for schools, hospitals and public transport, et cetera, and we have heard snippets of stories about the additional money that will be raised. The ABN registrations are now running 25 per cent ahead of government forecasts. In other countries where these registrations were well ahead of forecasts—Canada and New Zealand, for example—it led to considerably more money being raised. Indeed, Canada raised 20 per cent more than was forecast, and New Zealand raised 40 per cent more than was forecast. So it has been a worthwhile exercise, and the states will have no excuses for not spending this money where they should: on public services.
The extra $4.6 billion that it seems will be raised represents an awful lot of black economy and grey economy activity being smoked out of the system, with people now being forced to pay tax. According to the Access Economics report from earlier this week, some states are already out spending the expected windfall. Hopefully, everybody will agree that that is a good news story. Reducing the price of Australian exports is a good news story, as is cracking down on tax avoidance. In particular, removing the wholesale sales tax from orange juice and other items where it never should have been in the first place is a good news story, and so are the long-term increases in pensions and allowances. So it is disappointing that so much of this is not being presented.
We do have to ask why, a week from implementation, the government has now picked a fight with oil companies and created more uncertainty and more consternation in the community that the promises will not be kept. It is almost as though some within government have a death wish. Relying on marketing forecasts and Treasury estimates, predictions and modelling on this particular issue, why aren't we standing up and making sure that basic promises are kept? Also, listening to what the government has been saying on tax reform, why is it not undoing many of the misrepresentations and the bleating from the Labor opposition? I do not believe the government has properly countered a lot of the horror stories that have been, in many cases, on the front pages in our media. So many of those could have been countered and clearly explained. So much of what the opposition has been saying about tax reform is deliberately alarmist, negative and incorrect. But its scare campaign was let run by a government that did not seem to be on the front foot on many of these issues.
—Because it wasn't a scare campaign!
—Senator Cook, you say that it is not a scare campaign, but you would like us to believe that the world is about to end next Saturday and that we are somehow guinea pigs in the world. You would like us to believe we are the first country to introduce a tax on services in this way when, in fact, we are one of the last. We are not guinea pigs. We have designed a system that picks up the better features of other systems in the OECD. You would like us to believe that we are all doomed and that it is going to be the end of the world as we know it, and it is utter nonsense. It has been up to the government to counter a lot of those attacks, but the government's effort in doing that has been very poor. Twenty-seven OECD countries have already made this transition, and 23 of them have food either zero rated or taxed with concessions.
In 1985, then Labor Treasurer Paul Keating went in to bat for a broad based consumption tax, but he was eventually completely rolled on the issue. At that stage, I understand he was backed in cabinet by Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans, but the Labor Party never had the bottle to get in and do it and to raise the money the country needs for services. In 1993, for political purposes, Mr Keating decided to dump this basic principle and to oppose a GST. This is where the Labor Party is now: opposing the new tax system purely for political purposes. The deceit in all of this is that the angst the Labor Party has whipped up in sections of the community has been the result of a campaign which it knows is perpetrating a fraud on the Australian people. The past year has seen one of the worst abrogations of responsibility we have ever seen from an opposition party. The opposition should be coming up with new ideas. It should be looking at initiatives. 
—We're not imposing this tax; you are!
 (Senator Chapman)—Order! Senator Cook, you know interjections are disorderly, and I ask you to abide by the standing orders of the Senate.
—I'm being misrepresented.
—You can make a statement at the conclusion of the debate.
—We would hope to see an opposition pushing the envelope in a constructive manner, looking at new ideas and initiatives. Instead, they have come up with no new alternatives, and they talk vaguely about some sort of a roll-back. But, if we leave untaxed the services sector in this country, the fastest growing part of our economy, we cannot provide the essentials, particularly for people on low incomes—the very people Labor have scared the most with the campaign they have been running. They know more services—indeed, 4.2 per cent more services—are used by the top 10 per cent of income earners. Over four times more services are used by the wealthy, the top 10 per cent of income earners, compared with the bottom 10 per cent, and they know it is a con trip to suggest it is unfair to tax services. It has been a shameful performance from a party that do not seem to have any ideas in this area. They are hoping the polls will go up—and they have. Presumably they think they have done a good job undermining the introduction of our new tax system. But, in 12 months time, they will be seen very clearly for what they have done.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-26,"—in reply—I thank all honourable senators for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Indirect Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 and particularly the contribution from Senator Lees which I thought, in most of its content, was spot-on. I know from my own perspective, and on behalf of the Treasurer's and the Assistant Treasurer's offices, that we certainly have not been allowing Labor's misrepresentations and their hollow campaign to go unrebutted. We are certainly working hard to ensure that, wherever we pick up a misrepresentation, we quickly rebut it. 
As Senator Lees would know better than most, Labor set out many months ago to be a one-trick pony when it comes to the Australian political debate—that is, criticise the GST, criticise the GST and do nothing else—by coming up with a misrepresentation or a scare every day. Virtually every time you track down a Labor Party scare on the GST, you will find that it has no basis in fact or truth, that it is a scare, that it is made up and that it does require rebuttal. Much of the Treasurer's time, the Assistant Treasurer's time and my own time has been spent going onto radio programs and talkback programs around this nation trying to rebut the gross misrepresentations put forward by people such as Mr Beazley and Mr Crean. They seem to believe that it is some sort of substitute for a rigorous, intellectual pursuit of new policies to keep kicking the GST in a misguided and misrepresentative way. You need only to go through any of the transcripts of Mr Beazley's or Mr Crean's contributions on this debate on the radio in the past six months to find that they are generally full of gross misrepresentations and distortions. 
Senator Lees will find that ultimately the people of Australia will judge the tax system on how it affects them. We are confident that it will not only improve Australia's economy but also provide a sustainable basis for taxation which will, as Senator Lees has quite properly said, create a substantial increase in the reliability of the tax base, which all goes to the states. It will ensure that the crucial parts of government supplied infrastructure in this nation—education and health in particular but also road funding, which is so crucial to ensuring that Australia is a successful, prosperous and safe nation—will have a source of funding. You will not have the annual charade of premiers coming to Canberra and having to wait in their hotel rooms and have the envelope slipped under the door with the latest offer from the Commonwealth as to how much money they will have each year.  
The states will have a sustainable base of funding from a tax system that is a modern tax system and that replaces the system that Labor stood by for so many years. That is despite the very strong efforts by the younger Treasurer Keating who, as Senator Lees said, put in an enormous effort in the first 18 months of the Labor government, recognising the tax system that he had inherited as a Treasurer in the early 1980s was not sustainable. He used up a lot of his political capital trying to get a consensus of the then Hawke-Keating government to move to a modern tax system. I recommend to anyone who wants to study the development of the new tax system that they carefully read the books—particularly the Keating biography by John Edwards, Keating: the inside story—of that era in Australian politics when Mr Keating spent a lot of time and effort and political capital trying to get a modern tax system. Of course, he was brought down by the troglodytes in the Labor Party—those people who did not want change and who wanted to keep everything the way it was—who saw the golden era of the Labor Party as something that should not be fiddled with and who thought we should be careful about change. Labor was not able to stand behind Mr Keating, who was a reformer, who was someone who wanted to modernise the Australian economy and who was brought down. It was one of the biggest failures in his career and Senator Cook, as a personal friend of Mr Keating's at the time, would know that he was devastated by that defeat. That devastation comes out through reading the transcripts at the time and also in the John Edwards book.
Australians did need a new tax system then. We need one now and, within a few days, we will get one. We will get one in spite of the negativity, the whingeing, the carping, the whining, the undermining and the misrepresentation of the Australian Labor Party. What will happen on 1 July is that the people of Australia will expect more of the Labor Party. They will have a new tax system that has been introduced honestly and openly. We have gone out through advertising and told the Australian people what prices are going to go up and what prices are going to come down. 
It is worth contrasting that with what Labor did after the 1993 election when they campaigned against a GST, campaigned against indirect tax increases and promised tax cuts. What did they do after the election—within weeks? They said, `Look, we're going to increase indirect taxes,' and they went up 20 per cent or 30 per cent in some cases. Labor increased by 10 per cent the taxes on a whole range of necessary day-to-day items in the supermarket, such as toothpaste and toilet paper. As Senator Lees said, the tax on orange juice was increased by 10 per cent; there were increases on a whole range of food items. A whole range of school stationery items—something that people do not know about—was taxed by Labor. Every single item that a kid needs to put in their pencil case when they go to school has a hidden Labor sales tax on it. Labor did not want you to know that other items that are necessities of life were going up. Even when it comes to hardware items, Labor had a 22 per cent tax on a whole range of those things. Mr Dawkins came back after the 1993 election and, with the full support of Senator Cook, who sat in the cabinet room, Labor stuck up all of those taxes. 
Those opposite did not take out ads saying, `Look, by the way, we're putting up the price of wheelbarrows, we're putting up the price of lawn mowers, we're putting up the price of guttering, we're putting up the price of every single hardware item—taps and spouts and everything else you need to build a home,' because they did not compensate you for it. This government is not only compensating people with increases in rental assistance and pension increases and a range of other benefits; we also will be delivering as at 1 July $12 billion worth of personal tax cuts.
In 1993 Labor put up indirect taxes on all of those items I have mentioned: pens, pencils, pencil cases and paper—and computers. Here we are, trying to build a clever country, trying to build a nation that is the most connected on earth, trying to get people onto the Internet, and Labor stuck the tax up on computers and modems by 10 per cent. You did not tell anyone that. You are defending a tax system that puts a 22 per cent tax on computers. So, at the entry gate to the knowledge economy, the information economy, that was the Labor Party's policy. Senator Cook every question time screams and yells and says, `We're not backing the GST, that's not our policy.' He is backing the wholesale sales tax, which is a 22 per cent tax on the knowledge economy. An absolutely stupid policy! 
—That is not our policy.
—We are rolling back that tax, are we? Could we get you on the record there?
—We propose to modify some of those taxes. They will be constantly under review and—
 (Senator Chapman)—Order!
—I'm answering the question.
—This will be a good debate to have. We have a committee stage, and it will be very good for Senator Cook to put down on paper what they were going to do to the 22 per cent tax on computers and modems, because no other Labor spokesman has had the guts to do that. We have just abolished it. On 1 July, that iniquitous, stupid, low brow policy of taxing computers and modems will have gone. It will be out. The tax on all of those items is coming down. The price of computers and modems and all of that equipment will come down from between eight to 15 per cent, the industry tells us. That is a very big blow in favour of building a clever country, a connected society. The Labor Party did not tell people that in 1993, and it did not deliver the tax cuts either.
On 1 July, the people of Australia will be able to see, in stark contrast, the difference between Labor and Liberal. We honestly and fairly and openly brought in a new tax system. We do not underestimate how hard it will be. We do not underestimate the amount of information about it that people need to be provided with. And we do not apologise for having high profile ads like the Unchain my heart TV ads to draw people's attention to all of the different sources of detailed information, either in full-page print ads, in seminars, on hotlines or in all of the other places. If Senator Lees and others think we should increase that information campaign as the days and months roll on, then we will listen very closely to that message because you do need quality information. I do defend those ads because it is very hard to get messages through about what could be seen as turgid sort of information about tax scales, benefits and changes in indirect tax rates. Most marketing people would tell you that you do need some cut-through ads in order to draw people's attention to that information.
So I defend those Unchain my heart TV ads. They were a very small portion of the overall budget. Most of the $430 million-odd, as Senator Lees knows, was spent on seminars, information campaigns, booklets and pamphlets, and the thousands upon thousands of seminars that have been run either by the tax office or by a range of other organisations—including, I believe, the ACTU to inform their members of the changes. So there is a very big difference between the way the government has handled tax reform and the Labor Party has. We will deliver these big tax cuts, which will see people across Australia with a lot more money in their pockets. We will deliver tax cuts on many items and, of course, a new tax on many other items.
—A tax on petrol.
—We have never hidden that. It is not politically popular to go around taxing things that have not been taxed before. That is Politics 101. Your tutor would say, `Look, it's not popular to go and put a new tax on all of these different things.' Even Mr Keating understood that. He knew that the only way you could get that sort of generational change to take place in a policy way and a politically achievable way would be to ensure that the people most at risk from those new taxes were compensated, and in fact overcompensated, to ensure that they did not feel the brunt of them. That is exactly what the government has done. That is what Labor was never able to achieve. I think all Australians will come to learn in their own time that the change was worth the pain. 
But we do not underestimate the benefits to be gained by so many people, after having gone through the transitional pain, in moving from an old tax system, defended by an old out-of-date Labor Party, to the new tax system. I thank all honourable senators who have contributed to this important debate. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—Last Tuesday Senator Brown asked me a question, and I seek leave to incorporate a response in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The response read as follows—
On Tuesday 20 June 2000, (Hansard page: 14322) Senator Brown asked me:
As you will be aware, after the last election some $33 million was disbursed in public funding to political parties, and as a consideration for supply we can expect this will be reduced by $3 million at the next election under the GST. However, the Australian Electoral Commission, acting on Taxation Office advice, is advising political parties that public funding will not be subject to the GST. I ask the Assistant Treasurer: why is that so?
Why is the earlier advice from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Rick Matthews, that public funding is subject to GST being reversed? Secondly, if public funding is not subject to the GST as a consideration for supply, the technical term, I ask: will such similar considerations for supply as public lending rights for authors, and the Dairy Industry Adjustment Program also be exempt from the GST? 
The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
Broadly speaking, a government grant will be taxable if the grant can be regarded as consideration  for a taxable supply by a registered person. Whether a grant is taxable depends on the facts of the  particular case.
With regard to election funding, the Australian Taxation Office has recently provided advice that  public funding for election purposes will not generally be regarded as consideration for a taxable supply. Consequently, the payments will not usually be subject to GST.
The Australian Taxation Office changed its view of the GST treatment of these payments after obtaining further information and consulting with the Australian Electoral Commission.
I am also advised that payments under the Dairy Industry Adjustment Program are not subject to GST.
However, with regard to payments for public lending rights to authors, I am advised that if an author is registered, the payment will generally be taxable if it is regarded as consideration for a taxable supply, but the author will be entitled to input tax credits on acquisitions that relate to carrying on his or her business. The GST treatment of payments for public lending rights also depends on the facts of the case.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Political Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-06-26,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the report entitled The 1998 federal election: report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 1998 federal election and matters related thereto together with minutes of proceedings. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This is the first report of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters in this parliament, and it addresses the 1998 federal election. I will very briefly discuss two matters that the report focused on: firstly, the regulation of the internal structure, administration and dispute resolution processes of political parties; and, secondly, problems for the electoral process arising from section 44 of the Constitution. It was suggested during committee hearings that the Electoral Act should be amended to allow for greater oversight of the internal constitutional arrangements of political parties. That is for two principal reasons. The first reason is that political parties receive public funding, and the argument is therefore that parties should lend themselves to greater scrutiny because the taxpayers foot the bill. The second reason is that political parties are now subject to much greater scrutiny in the courts.
In this environment, you might argue that it would be appropriate to provide a more comprehensive legal regime relating to membership, the preselection process and the method of amending party constitutions. The committee debated this at great length. At present, courts restrain themselves from implying terms and provisions into party constitutions. Judges simply interpret party constitutions and do no more. So long as those rules are being fairly applied, irrespective of what they are, that is sufficient. They do not adjudicate on the wisdom or fairness of the rules themselves. There is not as yet, although it may be developing, a common-law set of party rules. In those circumstances, the committee focused on recommending a clarification of the definition of a `member of a political party'. 
My last point relates to the question of section 44, particularly section 44(iv), of the Commonwealth Constitution. This subsection disqualifies certain people from being chosen, or sitting, as members of either house of parliament—specifically, those who `hold any office of profit under the Crown'. This particular provision had some impact on me. I was forced to resign from my previous occupation 10 months before taking up my seat here principally because no unequivocal legal advice could be given. I would have been disqualified under section 44 of the Constitution. I raise this for good public policy reasons.
—Yes—conflict of interest!
—Thank you, Senator Carr. I raise it because the status of public servants and people employed by universities and other public instrumentalities is quite uncertain under the law at the moment. I appreciate that provisions are made in the Public Service Act and so forth for people to resign and then to come back, but those provisions are not universal, and there is still an enormous amount of uncertainty. It is a pity that public employees may be dissuaded from entering political life on the basis of this great uncertainty.
With respect to section 44, the committee did make one significant recommendation. The committee recommended a referendum to nullify the most prominent consequence of section 44, and that is the potential for disqualification from elected office of those holding dual citizenship, by virtue of section 44(i). Honourable senators will remember the case of Mrs Heather Hill, senator-elect for One Nation. That case was decided by the Court of Disputed Returns in July last year, and the committee has recommended that the rule be changed such that, in future, as soon as someone nominates, that disqualification will no longer apply. 
I would like to thank the Australian Electoral Commission and the members of the community who contributed to this review. I would also like to thank our Chairman, Mr Gary Nairn, and our Deputy Chairman, Mr Laurie Ferguson. The committee acted with a generous spirit throughout the inquiry and it was a great joy to participate in the inquiry. I thank all members for their assistance and I also thank the secretariat.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-06-26,"—I wish to speak to the motion before the Senate. The opposition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters identified nine recommendations of the joint standing committee's report entitled The 1998 federal election: report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 1998 federal election and matters related thereto that the opposition does not support. Let me deal very quickly with those recommendations.
Firstly, I will deal with recommendations Nos 3 and 36. There was a time when the motto at the AEC and the motto governing electoral laws was `easy to enrol and easy to vote'. It seems that the coalition government really want to put a stop to that. The coalition want to make it harder for people to enrol; they want to make it harder for people who need assistance on polling day to have and cast a secret vote. Recommendation No. 3 of the committee proposed that electoral rolls close on the day the writ is issued and, for existing electors updating address details, the rolls for an election close at 6 p.m. on the third day after the issue of the writ.
When the government recently proposed these fundamentally undemocratic measures they were—quite rightly, in my view—rejected by the Senate. The Senate was concerned with the potential for disenfranchising thousands of voters at each election by the early closure of the rolls. Closing the rolls as soon as an election is called will potentially disenfranchise about 80,000 new enrollees at each election—mostly young Australians and new Australian citizens. Further, evidence given by the Australian Electoral Commission to the committee shows that a majority of the 320,000 people who notified a change of address did so at the last available opportunity. The restriction on enrolment recommended by the committee would massively distort the electoral rolls of this country. It would lead to a totally unacceptable situation where more than 200,000 voters were enrolled at a non-current address. When the Senate last considered this particular measure, I acknowledge that the Democrats spoke strongly against the early closure of the rolls. I hope that the Democrats will continue to take a principled position on this issue, though I am concerned that on a number of occasions they seem to be swayed by poor government argumentation in this chamber—the GST being one well-known recent example. 
Recommendation No. 36 provides that the Commonwealth Electoral Act be amended to explicitly prevent scrutineers from providing assisted votes. This recommendation comes from a Northern Territory CLP beat-up. No credible evidence was presented to say that the current system was not working. Currently, the elector decides who will assist them. That is a very practical way of dealing with assisted voting. It is fair and it preserves the secrecy of an individual's vote. It does not compromise an elector's rights, nor does it in any way compromise the proper functioning of polling booths, nor does it compromise the integrity of the electoral process. I would point out that the Australian Electoral Commission's submission to the committee stated:
The AEC is of the view that the current federal legislation relating to assisted voting is operating properly as the parliament intended and should be left unamended. 
Opposition members of the Joint Standing Committee agree with that assessment by the AEC. The act allows an individual elector a say about who is to assist them in voting. Appropriately, the elector is able to choose somebody that they trust. The opposition believe that individual electors should not be limited in choosing who may assist them to cast a formal vote, should they need assistance in the polling booth. The majority of places where assisted voting occurs are small, relatively isolated communities where presiding officers or polling officials in the booth are known to electors. The advantage of a voter's friend is that an elector has someone they nominate and they are comfortable with assisting them to vote. If an elector wants a scrutineer to assist them to vote formally, then the opposition believe such a request is certainly no impediment at all to the democratic process.
I will briefly turn to recommendation No. 11 of the report, which deals with the electoral roll being accessible on the Internet for name and address search purposes and a CD-ROM of the roll being provided to public libraries without Internet access. It is worth noting here that the AEC is going to circulate an Internet issues paper soon. I think it is appropriate that we proceed very cautiously with any integration of the electoral roll and the Internet. We all know about the recent controversy surrounding the illegal release of electoral roll information by the AEC to the Taxation Office and the proposed illegal use of that information by the tax office to mail out a prime ministerial letter with GST propaganda, which was of great concern to the opposition. I think there was also a very significant degree of public disquiet about that. We believe recommendation No. 11 should be deferred until the AEC reports on the operations of sections 81 to 92 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and also reports on the issues arising from the recent illegal release of electoral roll information. The opposition will be closely examining the privacy implications that arise from the AEC Internet issues paper when we see it.
Recommendations Nos 45 and 46 both propose to increase from $1,500 to $3,000 the threshold for disclosing and reporting donations. Opposition committee members oppose both these recommendations. We say that increasing these donation thresholds has absolutely no policy merit at all. It will only diminish the transparency of the disclosure laws and allow further donations to parties and to candidates to go undisclosed. It is of concern to the opposition that the joint standing committee is supporting such a recommendation so soon after the tabling of the AEC's funding and disclosure report from the 1998 federal election. I commend the debate on this particular issue in the Senate during the sitting last week, particularly the contribution made by opposition senators. 
The AEC's report on funding and disclosure raised a number of specific concerns about the fundraising activities of the Liberal Party's associated entity, the cutely named Greenfields Foundation, and its exploitation of the disclosure rules and disclosure provisions of the act. The AEC recommended closure of the loophole that allowed a body such as Greenfields to prosper, because there is no way of tracing the real source of funds to political parties if that sort of scam is allowed to continue. Directly relevant to this recommendation, the AEC report also noted that `the only practical deterrent to donation splitting is to maintain a low disclosure threshold.' The opposition also opposed recommendations Nos 17, 27 and 39 of the report.
We do await draft legislation that might arise from matters covered by the JSCM report. As we did recently at the committee stage of the previous electoral legislation, we will be arguing for accessible and transparent electoral laws. We will be opposing any measures that weaken the integrity or the fairness of Australia's electoral laws.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-26,"—As one of the two Democrat senators on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I also rise to speak to this important report and commend it in its entirety as a worthwhile resource and document in itself as well as obviously setting out the position and views of the opposition and Democrat members of the committee on a range of different issues. I would probably start by urging the government to consider this report promptly, along with the AEC report to which Senator Faulkner just referred, and to act and respond very quickly.
The Prime Minister is on record a couple of times now as saying that the next federal election will be at the end of next year, presumably meaning sometime in the second half of the year. I think it is quite important that any proposed changes to the laws under which that election will be held are made clearly and well and truly in advance. People will then be clear about what the rules are and, in particular, the AEC, being the body that oversees the election, will have time to adapt and make any changes that may be required as a consequence of changes to the law. Unfortunately, on a few occasions in previous years, we have had changes to the act going through very shortly before an election has been held. This obviously has put the Electoral Commission, in particular, in a very difficult position. Also, it has made it more difficult to get information out to the public about any changes that may have been made that are important to them. Certainly, my initial response or comment on this report is to urge the government to respond quickly and to bring forward legislation quickly so that the issues can be considered by the Senate—not just issues raised in this report but also those raised in the Australian Electoral Commission funding and disclosure report which was debated at some length in this chamber last Thursday.
Both my colleague Senator Murray and I have put in a minority report of 20-odd pages. We have focused our attention not so much on indicating which recommendations in the majority report we do or do not agree with but more on putting forward additional suggestions on the part of the Democrats, some of which I believe are important and do need emphasising. The issue of access to the roll is one that is quite topical in terms of both inappropriate access and use of the roll, as planned by the government just recently, and issues such as whether or not to enable the roll, in some form or another, to be accessed through the Net are also important. I think that issues relating to the use of the Internet as part of our electoral process need further consideration and discussion. 
But, if we are looking at the fundamental principle of trying to make our electoral system as accessible as possible, as user friendly as possible, particularly to younger people, who most statistics indicate are less likely to be enrolled in or engaged with our political system, we do need to explore options for the use of the Internet. Obviously, as part of that, we have to ensure that security is adequately addressed and that privacy implications are adequately addressed. The Democrats certainly would not support any changes that did not meet those core criteria. But, as long as those core criteria are met, we can look at and consider issues such as accessing the roll through the Net in the not too distant future—I believe it already can be done through the Net in New Zealand—and also issues such as voting through the Net. I think that is a little further down the track but, nonetheless, it is an issue that I think we need to start exploring now.
The Democrat members on the committee have outlined our views in terms of caretaker conventions for government advertising and our views that general government advertising conventions be legislated. This is obviously relevant in terms of the recent advertising campaign for the tax package, the infamous Joe Cocker advertisements. Clearly, it was an unjustifiable and inappropriate use of taxpayers' funds to attempt to sell a tax package in that way—and those advertisements certainly do not do that in any effective way.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—That is a clear-cut position of the Democrats, all Democrats. Whether or not we supported the tax package, we certainly did not support those particular advertisements. It is also relevant in terms of the advertising campaign before the last federal election, again on the GST and related tax proposals. That again all Democrats are on record as strongly opposing. I think the important issue is that it is one thing to go around saying that an advertising campaign is disgraceful and appalling but another to put in place legislative mechanisms to prevent such a misuse of taxpayers' funds occurring in the future. Certainly the Democrats have tried to address that in our comments.
Then there are issues that the Democrats have spoken about many times in this chamber and, indeed, in the chamber in Old Parliament House—even back to the days of Senator Michael Macklin, my predecessor from Queensland—in terms of reform of how-to-vote card laws and truth in political advertising, a change that was made by the Senate and the parliament once but was then repealed before we had a chance to test it in an election. That issue is something that the Democrats have campaigned on long and hard for many years, and we continue to highlight it here.
Other aspects around funding and disclosure are considered at some length. My colleague Senator Murray has moved amendments to legislation on this, as well as on registration of political parties and party constitutions, a number of times and will continue to do so. I note that the fairly mild recommendation in the majority report on this is one which Labor members of the committee have indicated their opposition to. I think that is a bit unfortunate. The main body of the report has a recommendation that the definition of a member of a political party be expanded to include a few very benign requirements such as: they have actually paid a membership fee, they remain a valid member and have been formally accepted as a member according to the party's rules, and they are not a member of more than one party at the same time. That is relevant because to be a registered political party and to be able to run as a candidate for a political party at a federal election, you have to be registered under the law as set out in the act and administered by the AEC.
At the moment, we have quite a large number of political parties registered that I think any objective observer would acknowledge are not genuine political parties. The extreme outcome of this is what we saw in the New South Wales state election and the upper house ballot paper where a huge number of parties were clearly front parties and not genuine parties. People had been listed as members of those parties without them even being aware that that was case; they had signed a petition and their names were now being put forward to the State Electoral Commission as indication of their membership of a party. Those sorts of practices are clearly fraudulent and mislead people about the validity of a political party. The Democrats strongly support putting in place mechanisms to prevent that sort of activity. I am a bit surprised that opposition members do not support that. Indeed, we believe that it should go further than what is recommended in the report, which we have outlined in our minority report. When you look at the requirements in place to govern the operation of companies and even the operation of incorporated associations and compare them to political parties that receive significant amounts of public funding—something the Democrats do support—then we believe it is appropriate that a body potentially able to receive significant amounts of public funding should at least have some minimum standards that they have to address to be recognised as a political party and therefore be eligible to represent themselves as such and receive funding as such in an election. That is an area that we certainly hope the government gives proper consideration to and looks at taking on board. 
I would like to thank the secretariat and the other members of the committee. It was a fairly long process. We travelled to many parts of the country. Indeed, the hearings that were conducted in the Northern Territory, Alice Springs and in the fairly remote area of Maningrida were a real eye-opener to me in terms of the different challenges that face both the Electoral Commission and us as legislators in trying to ensure that we have an electoral system that enables all people to participate wherever possible and to actually have a say in who gets to represent them in this place and who gets to be part of both the government and the parliament. It is crucial that we have as user-friendly an electoral system as possible for people from all parts of the community. That should be a focus of any proposed changes to electoral law and in any consideration and review of them. I think this report does that fairly comprehensively. It does not go as far in some directions as the Democrats would like and it does go down a few paths that we have some concerns about, but obviously we will have to wait and see what the government comes back with in terms of proposed amendments to the legislation, in responses to the recommendation contained here and in the AEC's report. We will consider those when they are raised.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Electoral Matters Committee </title>,Committees,15,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-06-26,"—I simply rise to indicate that as a member of a parliamentary party one is not disadvantaged when it comes to the electoral process. I have not had the opportunity of reading the report—and this may have been discussed in the report itself—but I agree entirely with what the last speaker, Senator Bartlett, said. It appeared at least to be a blot on the system if that system allowed mushroom political parties to operate as front organisations for either other political parties or other organisations and to do so without the need to have either a formal structure such as a constitution, rules, membership fees and so on or a member of a political party elected. I am thinking of when I am next due to stand in—
—In 2012?
—No, it is not 2012. I will probably have been here 29 years when that occasion comes about. One needs to be forward looking and one would be concerned if the legislation were amended so as to disadvantage a member of this parliament recontesting the seat. Those of you who were about during the discussions on the electoral legislation some time ago—and I happened to be a member of the committee at that stage—will recall that the list system of voting was vigorously opposed by some members of parliament.
The list system of voting is suitable for the major parties and, to a certain extent, the substantial minor parties, such as the Democrats. One thought was that the list system of voting was not an open system where the electors were able to pick and choose between candidates like, for example, the Tasmanian Hare-Clark system. Nevertheless, the parliament did vote to endorse the list system of voting and incorporate that in the legislation. That means that if you did not have access to that list system of voting, you would be on the second part of the ballot paper and stand very little chance of being elected. I put to the Senate that, when the government are looking at any amendments, they might spare a thought for parliamentary party—I was going to say `privileges'—equal status.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-06-26,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the report entitled The 1998 federal election: report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 1998 federal election and matters related thereto together with minutes of proceedings. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This is the first report of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters in this parliament, and it addresses the 1998 federal election. I will very briefly discuss two matters that the report focused on: firstly, the regulation of the internal structure, administration and dispute resolution processes of political parties; and, secondly, problems for the electoral process arising from section 44 of the Constitution. It was suggested during committee hearings that the Electoral Act should be amended to allow for greater oversight of the internal constitutional arrangements of political parties. That is for two principal reasons. The first reason is that political parties receive public funding, and the argument is therefore that parties should lend themselves to greater scrutiny because the taxpayers foot the bill. The second reason is that political parties are now subject to much greater scrutiny in the courts.
In this environment, you might argue that it would be appropriate to provide a more comprehensive legal regime relating to membership, the preselection process and the method of amending party constitutions. The committee debated this at great length. At present, courts restrain themselves from implying terms and provisions into party constitutions. Judges simply interpret party constitutions and do no more. So long as those rules are being fairly applied, irrespective of what they are, that is sufficient. They do not adjudicate on the wisdom or fairness of the rules themselves. There is not as yet, although it may be developing, a common-law set of party rules. In those circumstances, the committee focused on recommending a clarification of the definition of a `member of a political party'. 
My last point relates to the question of section 44, particularly section 44(iv), of the Commonwealth Constitution. This subsection disqualifies certain people from being chosen, or sitting, as members of either house of parliament—specifically, those who `hold any office of profit under the Crown'. This particular provision had some impact on me. I was forced to resign from my previous occupation 10 months before taking up my seat here principally because no unequivocal legal advice could be given. I would have been disqualified under section 44 of the Constitution. I raise this for good public policy reasons.
—Yes—conflict of interest!
—Thank you, Senator Carr. I raise it because the status of public servants and people employed by universities and other public instrumentalities is quite uncertain under the law at the moment. I appreciate that provisions are made in the Public Service Act and so forth for people to resign and then to come back, but those provisions are not universal, and there is still an enormous amount of uncertainty. It is a pity that public employees may be dissuaded from entering political life on the basis of this great uncertainty.
With respect to section 44, the committee did make one significant recommendation. The committee recommended a referendum to nullify the most prominent consequence of section 44, and that is the potential for disqualification from elected office of those holding dual citizenship, by virtue of section 44(i). Honourable senators will remember the case of Mrs Heather Hill, senator-elect for One Nation. That case was decided by the Court of Disputed Returns in July last year, and the committee has recommended that the rule be changed such that, in future, as soon as someone nominates, that disqualification will no longer apply. 
I would like to thank the Australian Electoral Commission and the members of the community who contributed to this review. I would also like to thank our Chairman, Mr Gary Nairn, and our Deputy Chairman, Mr Laurie Ferguson. The committee acted with a generous spirit throughout the inquiry and it was a great joy to participate in the inquiry. I thank all members for their assistance and I also thank the secretariat.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-06-26,"—I wish to speak to the motion before the Senate. The opposition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters identified nine recommendations of the joint standing committee's report entitled The 1998 federal election: report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 1998 federal election and matters related thereto that the opposition does not support. Let me deal very quickly with those recommendations.
Firstly, I will deal with recommendations Nos 3 and 36. There was a time when the motto at the AEC and the motto governing electoral laws was `easy to enrol and easy to vote'. It seems that the coalition government really want to put a stop to that. The coalition want to make it harder for people to enrol; they want to make it harder for people who need assistance on polling day to have and cast a secret vote. Recommendation No. 3 of the committee proposed that electoral rolls close on the day the writ is issued and, for existing electors updating address details, the rolls for an election close at 6 p.m. on the third day after the issue of the writ.
When the government recently proposed these fundamentally undemocratic measures they were—quite rightly, in my view—rejected by the Senate. The Senate was concerned with the potential for disenfranchising thousands of voters at each election by the early closure of the rolls. Closing the rolls as soon as an election is called will potentially disenfranchise about 80,000 new enrollees at each election—mostly young Australians and new Australian citizens. Further, evidence given by the Australian Electoral Commission to the committee shows that a majority of the 320,000 people who notified a change of address did so at the last available opportunity. The restriction on enrolment recommended by the committee would massively distort the electoral rolls of this country. It would lead to a totally unacceptable situation where more than 200,000 voters were enrolled at a non-current address. When the Senate last considered this particular measure, I acknowledge that the Democrats spoke strongly against the early closure of the rolls. I hope that the Democrats will continue to take a principled position on this issue, though I am concerned that on a number of occasions they seem to be swayed by poor government argumentation in this chamber—the GST being one well-known recent example. 
Recommendation No. 36 provides that the Commonwealth Electoral Act be amended to explicitly prevent scrutineers from providing assisted votes. This recommendation comes from a Northern Territory CLP beat-up. No credible evidence was presented to say that the current system was not working. Currently, the elector decides who will assist them. That is a very practical way of dealing with assisted voting. It is fair and it preserves the secrecy of an individual's vote. It does not compromise an elector's rights, nor does it in any way compromise the proper functioning of polling booths, nor does it compromise the integrity of the electoral process. I would point out that the Australian Electoral Commission's submission to the committee stated:
The AEC is of the view that the current federal legislation relating to assisted voting is operating properly as the parliament intended and should be left unamended. 
Opposition members of the Joint Standing Committee agree with that assessment by the AEC. The act allows an individual elector a say about who is to assist them in voting. Appropriately, the elector is able to choose somebody that they trust. The opposition believe that individual electors should not be limited in choosing who may assist them to cast a formal vote, should they need assistance in the polling booth. The majority of places where assisted voting occurs are small, relatively isolated communities where presiding officers or polling officials in the booth are known to electors. The advantage of a voter's friend is that an elector has someone they nominate and they are comfortable with assisting them to vote. If an elector wants a scrutineer to assist them to vote formally, then the opposition believe such a request is certainly no impediment at all to the democratic process.
I will briefly turn to recommendation No. 11 of the report, which deals with the electoral roll being accessible on the Internet for name and address search purposes and a CD-ROM of the roll being provided to public libraries without Internet access. It is worth noting here that the AEC is going to circulate an Internet issues paper soon.

The opposition will be closely examining the privacy implications that arise from the AEC Internet issues paper when we see it.
Recommendations Nos 45 and 46 both propose to increase from $1,500 to $3,000 the threshold for disclosing and reporting donations. Opposition committee members oppose both these recommendations. We say that increasing these donation thresholds has absolutely no policy merit at all. It will only diminish the transparency of the disclosure laws and allow further donations to parties and to candidates to go undisclosed.

That issue is something that the Democrats have campaigned on long and hard for many years, and we continue to highlight it here.
Other aspects around funding and disclosure are considered at some length. My colleague Senator Murray has moved amendments to legislation on this, as well as on registration of political parties and party constitutions, a number of times and will continue to do so. I note that the fairly mild recommendation in the majority report on this is one which Labor members of the committee have indicated their opposition to. I think that is a bit unfortunate. The main body of the report has a recommendation that the definition of a member of a political party be expanded to include a few very benign requirements such as: they have actually paid a membership fee, they remain a valid member and have been formally accepted as a member according to the party's rules, and they are not a member of more than one party at the same time.

Those sorts of practices are clearly fraudulent and mislead people about the validity of a political party. The Democrats strongly support putting in place mechanisms to prevent that sort of activity. I am a bit surprised that opposition members do not support that. Indeed, we believe that it should go further than what is recommended in the report, which we have outlined in our minority report. When you look at the requirements in place to govern the operation of companies and even the operation of incorporated associations and compare them to political parties that receive significant amounts of public funding—something the Democrats do support—then we believe it is appropriate that a body potentially able to receive significant amounts of public funding should at least have some minimum standards that they have to address to be recognised as a political party and therefore be eligible to represent themselves as such and receive funding as such in an election. That is an area that we certainly hope the government gives proper consideration to and looks at taking on board. 
I would like to thank the secretariat and the other members of the committee. It was a fairly long process. We travelled to many parts of the country. Indeed, the hearings that were conducted in the Northern Territory, Alice Springs and in the fairly remote area of Maningrida were a real eye-opener to me in terms of the different challenges that face both the Electoral Commission and us as legislators in trying to ensure that we have an electoral system that enables all people to participate wherever possible and to actually have a say in who gets to represent them in this place and who gets to be part of both the government and the parliament. It is crucial that we have as user-friendly an electoral system as possible for people from all parts of the community. That should be a focus of any proposed changes to electoral law and in any consideration and review of them. I think this report does that fairly comprehensively. It does not go as far in some directions as the Democrats would like and it does go down a few paths that we have some concerns about, but obviously we will have to wait and see what the government comes back with in terms of proposed amendments to the legislation, in responses to the recommendation contained here and in the AEC's report. We will consider those when they are raised.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,15,2
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-06-26,"—I simply rise to indicate that as a member of a parliamentary party one is not disadvantaged when it comes to the electoral process. I have not had the opportunity of reading the report—and this may have been discussed in the report itself—but I agree entirely with what the last speaker, Senator Bartlett, said. It appeared at least to be a blot on the system if that system allowed mushroom political parties to operate as front organisations for either other political parties or other organisations and to do so without the need to have either a formal structure such as a constitution, rules, membership fees and so on or a member of a political party elected. I am thinking of when I am next due to stand in—
—In 2012?
—No, it is not 2012. I will probably have been here 29 years when that occasion comes about. One needs to be forward looking and one would be concerned if the legislation were amended so as to disadvantage a member of this parliament recontesting the seat. Those of you who were about during the discussions on the electoral legislation some time ago—and I happened to be a member of the committee at that stage—will recall that the list system of voting was vigorously opposed by some members of parliament.
The list system of voting is suitable for the major parties and, to a certain extent, the substantial minor parties, such as the Democrats. One thought was that the list system of voting was not an open system where the electors were able to pick and choose between candidates like, for example, the Tasmanian Hare-Clark system. Nevertheless, the parliament did vote to endorse the list system of voting and incorporate that in the legislation. That means that if you did not have access to that list system of voting, you would be on the second part of the ballot paper and stand very little chance of being elected. I put to the Senate that, when the government are looking at any amendments, they might spare a thought for parliamentary party—I was going to say `privileges'—equal status.

"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2000-06-26,"by leave—I table the report of the Parliamentary Delegation to Tanzania from 22 April to 27 April 2000 and the 103rd Inter-Parliamentary Conference, held in Amman from 30 April to 6 May 2000. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The 103rd IPU Conference debated and discussed a range of topics, including achieving peace, stability and development, dialogue among civilisations and cultures, and the Australian proposed agenda item on people smuggling.
All members of the delegation played an active role throughout the entire conference, participating in all facets of the conference agenda. I would like to take the opportunity to thank all members of the delegation, particularly the leader, Speaker Andrew, for their companionship and friendship throughout the conference and bilateral visit. The adviser to the delegation at the IPU conference from the department of foreign affairs, Mr Jonathan Brown, was of enormous assistance to the delegation. His good humour was also appreciated. On behalf of the delegation, I acknowledge the assistance of the delegation secretary, Peter Keele, and thank him for his companionship, as well. I am firmly of the view that the report would have been further enhanced if the photograph of Mr Keele and Her Royal Highness Queen Noor had been placed on its cover! It is a very famous photograph.
Once again, the Australian delegation played a major role at the IPU conference and was instrumental in helping to formulate two of the three major resolutions adopted by the conference. In particular, our delegation was successful in having its proposal calling for international action and cooperation to combat people smuggling accepted as the conference supplementary item. Our proposal was combined with an Arab nation's proposal on refugees initiated by Algeria. The tragic event in Dover, England last week where 58 people being smuggled into Britain were found dead in a container again highlighted the need for international action and cooperation to stop this horrendous and evil trade.
The drafting committee, chaired by a colleague from South Africa, adopted balanced, principled and non-discriminatory proposals in the refugee draft resolution. However, and perhaps not surprisingly for a conference held in the Middle East, regional interests later came into play. The draft resolution was amended during the deliberations of the first committee meeting to include reference to one, and one only, group of refugees. The amendment highlighted the plight of Palestinian refugees and, in so doing, reduced in importance the millions of refugees in other parts of the world, including those from countries in the region. This was of patent expediency to delegates from countries that produce refugees and also to a British delegate who was on a personal crusade.
The delegation from Bosnia and Herzegovina expressed regret that the resolution contained no reference to refugees and displaced people in south-east Europe. Australia echoed this view in suggesting that the consensus resolution of the drafting committee would have been a more preferable and more helpful way of expressing support for efforts to seek a just settlement to the refugee problem in the Middle East, a matter that Australia is strongly committed to as part of a just, secure and comprehensive peace settlement.
Australia participated on two drafting committees: I was on the committee dealing with the refugee and people smuggling item, and the member for Fairfax, Alex Somlyay, chaired the drafting committee dealing with peace, stability and development. The member for Prospect, Janice Crosio, was elected to the Coordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians and was also elected as a substitute member on the Middle East Questions Committee. The delegation leader, Speaker Neil Andrew, acted as one of the vice-presidents of the conference and chaired part of the general debate on the political, economic and social situation in the world. 
As at previous conferences, the delegation held meetings with the Speaker of the Indonesian parliament as well as with representatives of the Indonesian IPU group and the Yugoslav IPU group. The matter of East Timor and refugees was discussed with the Indonesians, and we took the opportunity, when talking to the Yugoslav delegation, to acknowledge and express gratitude for the release from custody of the Australian aid workers and their Yugoslav adviser.
Turning now to the bilateral visit to Tanzania, I would like to make a few brief comments. The parliamentary delegation's visit to Tanzania coincided with Easter and Anzac Day. We commemorated Anzac Day at a dawn service at the Commonwealth war graves in Dar es Salaam, together with representatives from New Zealand, Turkey, Canada, Britain, India, Pakistan, France and South Africa. The official program for the bilateral visit included meetings with the President of Tanzania, Mr Mkapa, the Speaker of the parliament, Mr Msekwa, and a number of parliamentarians from both the government and opposition. These meetings enabled the delegation to discuss a range of issues, including the strength of the bilateral relationship between our two countries, the progress of economic reforms in Tanzania, the opening up of the economy and foreign investment, the plight of refugees on the borders with Burundi and Rwanda, the political tensions in Zanzibar, constitutional and parliamentary reform and the readiness to accept a fully operational multiparty system, and the scope to direct more funds into areas such as health and education. The discussions were both frank and informative, leaving the delegation with a very clear impression that Tanzania, although still very poor, is making steady progress and is prepared to undertake the necessary reforms to lift the country out of poverty.
Of particular interest to the delegation was the opportunity to see at first hand the impact of Australian investment in Tanzania and the expenditure of Australian aid money. The delegation visited an Australian run gold mine at Nzega, 700 kilometres north-west of Dar es Salaam. The mine is owned and operated by Resolute Ltd of Western Australia. The company is not only providing employment opportunities for people in the region but also undertaking a very comprehensive community development program. The delegation was given the honour of attending and officially opening both a primary and a secondary school in the district. Resolute Ltd has funded both schools. The company has set a very worthwhile benchmark for other foreign investors. Helping with the economic and social development of the country is a very innovative and community minded approach.  
The Golden Pride Mine is an open-cut operation, producing around 180,000 ounces of gold per annum.  The company is taking great care to revegetate the land around the site and has put in place world best practice to deal with its waste and by-products. This is one overseas Australian mining operation that all Australians can take great pride in. In the report, we record the Speaker's praise for the individual role of Mr Grant Pierce, a man of enormous energy and enthusiasm. Mr Pierce, the Operations Manager, is the driving force behind many of the community projects that make the Golden Pride Mine an excellent example of how a foreign owned company can operate and, at the same time, contribute to the local community.
I also mention Ms Louise Cameron from Perth, Western Australia, who took up a teaching position at the Isanga Primary School under the Australian Volunteers International Program. The drive and commitment of Ms Cameron and other Australian volunteers who work in the area is something to behold and it leaves one feeling very proud to be an Australian. The Subiaco Primary School in WA is also a sponsor of the Isanga Primary School, and its parents and children have donated teaching aids and materials that have been of enormous assistance to the children of Tanzania.
AusAID has a small but nonetheless beneficial role to play in a number of key areas of Tanzania. The delegation attended a very enthusiastic and entertaining opening of a water and sanitation project, which is managed by Plan International in the Kibaha district. It is not very often that one gets the opportunity to witness the Speaker of the Australian parliament opening a toilet, and the significance of that event was not lost on the delegation. It was a very memorable day, and it proved once again that targeted projects such as these directly benefit thousands of people through the delivery of year round, safe and clean drinking water and proper sanitation systems. The delegation concluded its visit with a typical African experience when it was hosted to an overnight stay at a game park at Mikumi.  
During the delegation's visit we delivered a letter inviting the Prime Minister of Tanzania to become a patron of the recently formed Dar es Salaam chapter of the Australian Tanzanian Business Council. The business council has its headquarters in Perth. 
All up, it was a very informative and rewarding visit. It had been many years since an Australian parliamentary delegation had made a visit to Tanzania. It was evident that much progress has been made and that Australian investment, which amounts to around $600 million, is playing a leading role in a number of sectors.  This investment has been made possible by the continued strong relationship between both countries. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,2000-06-26,"—On behalf of Senator George Campbell, I present the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee on its inquiry into the mechanism for providing accountability to the Senate in relation to government contracts, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report and to incorporate the tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The statement read as follows—
The level of information available to the Parliament and to the public about government contracting has not kept pace with the increased rate of contracting out, particularly in the outsourcing of many functions previously performed by government agencies.  
General business notice of motion no. 489 standing in the name of Senator Andrew Murray proposes a means of achieving greater transparency of government contracting. This is to be achieved by the posting on agency web sites of lists of contracts entered into, indicating whether they contain confidentiality clauses and, if so, the reason for them; together with the independent verification by the Auditor-General of those confidentiality claims. The motion, if successful, would become a Senate order which also required ministers to table letters in the Senate chamber on a six-monthly basis to indicate compliance with the order.
In previous reports on the subject of government contracting, the committee has supported the general principle that information be made public unless there are good grounds for withholding it. Put simply, there can be no accountability if there is no information. There appears to be broad support for this notion, but whether the Murray motion is the way to achieve it is what the committee was required by the Senate to investigate. 
The committee invited submissions from all portfolios and from other interested persons and held a public hearing on 12 May to elicit the views of agencies which it believed would be affected significantly by the successful passage of the motion. Several potential difficulties were raised with the motion: the very low level of the threshold; the retrospective application; the number and size of the contracts concerned; the potential cost; and the partial duplication with other publicly available information. The committee therefore canvassed briefly various alternatives to the motion but decided that it was not in a position to reach definitive conclusions at this stage. 
At the committee's public hearing on 12 May 2000 the Australian National Audit Office offered to conduct a performance audit on the use of confidential contract provisions. The offer was followed by a more detailed listing of the audit as a high priority in the draft audit program currently under consideration by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.  That audit should serve to flesh out many of the issues considered by the committee in this inquiry. In the circumstances, therefore, the committee has decided to await the audit outcome and to report again on Senator Murray's motion, on the basis of the further information arising from the audit.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-06-26,"—Thank you, Madam Chairman. As you said, we are dealing with the amendment moved by the opposition in respect of caravan park rents, hostel rents et cetera. We posed a number of questions to the minister before we started question time and we have not had any response to those questions. We have been trying to solve the mystery of who actually won the $33 million in increased compensation—whether it was the Democrats or whether it was the National Party. There seem to be two claims.
—It wasn't the National Party.
—I do not think it was the National Party either, Senator Conroy. I think the Democrats probably did the deal. The National Party sort of trundled along after the event, which is very interesting because I read an interview conducted with National Party member Mr Bob Katter about the National Party's position, and he made some interesting comments. Again I note that the National Party is not represented here in the chamber this afternoon. It would be useful if we could get a National Party senator to come to the chamber and respond to some of these matters, to throw some light on where the National Party are at on the issues that affect the people that they try to represent. I think Mr Katter made it fairly clear when he was asked about the caravan park rents and the $33 million. The presenter put to him the question:
There's thirty-three million dollars worth of extra compensation built in there, but certainly the National Party conference last week—and Larry Anthony, as the local member—was of a view that the GST should just come off caravan park permanent rentals. In a sense, the Nationals have lost out every which way on that issue, haven't they?
Mr Katter, in responding, said: 
Well, you know, we are often told that if we, you know, make it a National Party versus Liberal Party, we'll get nothing. Well, I mean, Larry's tried for nine, ten, twelve months. He went behind closed doors. And, at some point in time you've got to go public.
Now, I've gone public on the cost of living. Now, I've given the government three months, I have raised it in the party room, I've raised it in the joint party room, I've raised it with the Prime Minister, I've raised it with the Treasurer, I've raised it with every single person of power in the country, and the net result of it has been that I have got nothing at all, in spite of a promise.
I would like the National Party to come in here and say what the promise was, because this government made a number of promises to the public of Australia before the last election and we have yet to find one that has been adhered to. As I said, we have not got a National Party senator in the chamber, but it would be helpful if Senator Boswell or indeed Senator McGauran would throw some light on the subject.
In question time earlier today I happened to notice that Senator Ellison was holding up the booklet of information that they have been providing. This is the booklet that was mailed out. I think there were eight or 10 million of them. Senator Ellison held it up and referred to all the great information and the explanation of the GST that it contains. But if you look at this booklet—I do not know what the cost of it was—on every second page there is an ad which has just got a picture of a big, broken chain. Rather than a broken chain, it should be a broken promise. That is the reality. I notice that the Assistant Treasurer is now back in the chamber. As I said at the start, he had some questions put to him, and it would be helpful if he at some stage responded to those questions and informed us exactly what has been happening.
There is another point that I have raised; that is, the issue of petrol prices. We know that, despite all the government's commitments, despite all their rhetoric, petrol prices will go up as a result of the GST. I read an article by Phillip Coorey. He puts fairly clearly what has happened and what the government has actually done. He says in part:
Putting aside fluctuating oil prices and other extraneous factors, petrol prices will rise as a result of the GST because the Government skimped out on taking off enough fuel excise to compensate for what the GST would put back on.
I hope the minister is listening to this, because Mr Coorey also says:
Instead of deducting 8c or 9c a litre which would compensate for the 10 per cent GST clawback, only 6.7c was deducted. This was 1.5c a litre short.
That is true, as Senator Cook or Senator Conroy pointed out to the minister earlier with regard to the current price of petrol. Where in this country is a place where you can find petrol under 74c per litre? Nowhere at all. This is despite, as is pointed out by Mr Coorey in his article, many statements that petrol would not rise. In Mr Coorey's article, Mr Fahey, who was given the task of releasing the petrol price scheme while the Treasurer was off in Paris, is quoted as saying:
... the scheme meant prices “need not rise” as a result of the scheme.
The article goes on to say:
On Friday Mr Howard said it “might” rise.
Further, the article quoted Mr Fahey as saying:
“What we said was that as a result of reducing the excise when the GST came in the price of petrol need not rise. We didn't say we'd reduce it at the pump, we said that it need not rise,” he said.
The article went on to say:
That's not what he told Sky TV on April 2.
“What I've guaranteed—
this is the Prime Minister—
is that the price of petrol will not rise as a result of the GST,” he said.
That is a very clear, fundamental statement, and yet we know for a fact that this promise will not be kept.
We have seen the government make various claims about rents per se and how they will increase. There is an ACCC booklet put out which says that rents per se should not increase by more than two per cent. In fact, two per cent was at the higher end of the scale. That is rents across the board. As I said earlier, because of their financial circumstances a lot of people find themselves having to live in caravan park accommodation—or, indeed, in hostels. In Tasmania, where I come from, in Launceston for example, there are a lot of people who live in hostel accommodation simply because that is all they can afford. They live there—and the fact is they are very well looked after in many cases—but they cannot afford these types of increases in the cost of their accommodation. Why should they be discriminated against, Minister? Why should those people be discriminated against? Why is it the case that if someone rents a penthouse in the Lakeside property just across Lake Burley Griffin here in Canberra it does not have any effect on their rent—the GST has no effect whatsoever—but those people who can least afford it you are prepared to discriminate against? It is just an outrageous situation. 
The poor old National Party, Mr Larry Anthony and others—and their senators are still not in the chamber—have been trying to claim, almost like they won Tattslotto, that they won the $33 million in extra compensation. What a joke! It was not them who actually won it anyway; the Democrats apparently delivered it. Senator Lees is here, and she laid claim to it earlier. We have heard Senator Bartlett say that when they were speaking with the Treasurer the Nationals were not in the room—which would not be unusual for them because they are not in the room here either much. Certainly I would be very keen to see one of the National Party senators come into this place and tell us what their position is, why they are allowing this discrimination to occur.
The minister, as I said, had a few questions put to him earlier. Perhaps he can answer the question: when did the Nationals negotiate with the Treasurer or the Prime Minister—that is, when did the Democrats knock on the door? How long was it after they signed off on a deal before they actually saw any reports that the deal was not what the government said it was and they had to go running back and look for a half-baked solution, which is really no solution at all, for those people who can least afford it? I look forward to hearing what the minister has to say in respect of those questions. That might throw a little more light on the issue. Of course, it would be very useful if the National Party could come in here and explain their position as well.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-26,"—We are dealing with a Labor Party amendment to remove GST from rents in respect of caravan parks and boarding houses. There is one important question that I would like an answer to—and I know the minister is discussing matters with the Democrats, so hopefully his advisers will take a note of this and I will get a response—and that is: what is the total GST revenue raised from the application of the GST to rents in respect of caravan parks and boarding houses? I have not actually seen a figure, and I would be interested to know the total of the millions of dollars raised from this sector. How much GST is raised from that sector—I am talking about long-term residents; I am not talking about tourists who visit caravan parks, or boarding houses, for that matter—is an important question.
People who live in caravan parks and boarding houses are, regrettably, persons who in our society are in many cases on low incomes—a negligible private income, either because they are not employed in many cases or because they are retired. These are people who are hardest hit by the GST generally and the GST in this sector particularly. So I would like to see what the revenue collection in this sector is. If the response is, `We don't have those revenue figures,' I would be very surprised, frankly, given the intense political debate that we have had in recent months about this issue. I would be surprised if we cannot be given a specific figure for revenue raised in this sector.
We had the announcement last week of the latest deal between the Democrats and the government in respect of rental assistance being increased from seven per cent to 10 per cent. That is a grand total—depending on circumstances—of 16c a day. That does not go a long way to offsetting the GST impact on rents for people who are in receipt of rental assistance. It is not a big increase and it does not go anywhere to help those people in Australia—and there must be millions of them. Again, I put this question to the minister and his advisers: what is the total amount of GST revenue to be collected from rents in this country? There must be a figure available. It must be hundreds of millions of dollars of GST revenue that is to be collected from persons who are renting. The number of people in this country who would be renting, again, must be between one million and two million people. So I would be interested to see those figures. 
On the deal we have been presented with, there was some discussion earlier, and I did notice that Senator Bartlett quite rightly made the claim—I think he used these words—that quite obviously the increase in rental assistance was as a result of Democrat negotiations with the government. He did not know whether or not the National Party had discussed the matter with the government. What we do know, of course, is that up until last Thursday—Senator Lees, when you announced the deal—the National Party had been singularly unsuccessful in pressing this issue.
In fact Mr Malcolm Farr, the chief political reporter for the Daily Telegraph, reported that, when the caravan issue was discussed in cabinet, the ministers' objective was not to change the tax regime but to rescue the National Party leader, John Anderson, from discontent within his party. The poor old National Party did not get anywhere on this issue. As with so many issues, the National Party got nowhere on this issue. It was not until the Democrats interceded that any action took place. We have to remember that it was the Democrats who agreed to the GST package in the first place. This matter should have been dealt with last year. We have had a lot of concern and worry—and there will be ongoing concern and worry experienced by people in caravan parks and boarding houses and by renters in general—about the impact of the GST on their particular circumstances. The Democrats missed the ball last year on this issue. They did seek some sort of inquiry. There was that secret report. It was kept secret by Senator Newman, Senator Kemp and the Treasurer, who refused month after month, request after request, to release the report. It was no wonder they kept it secret because it showed that the rental increase as a result of the GST was going to be double the one publicly announced in the government's pre-election propaganda document.
There is a significant difference between the claims of the so-called new tax system in respect of rent increases and the study that was ultimately leaked and then had to be released. That report, which was kept secret for so long, finally emerged as a result of the pressure from my colleagues, particularly the shadow minister in the other place, Mr Swan, who has pursued this issue vigorously for many months. Of course, then the Democrats suddenly discovered the issue. They showed the same sort of behaviour in respect of the excise on beer. The Democrats showed absolutely no interest in the commitment by the Prime Minister that the increase in beer prices would not be more than 1.9 per cent. They showed no interest in this issue right up until last month—again after months of work by a number of my colleagues in this place—and finally the Prime Minister's promise at election time was shown to be false and grossly misleading. But I do note the appeal by my colleague Senator Murphy: where are the National Party? Where are Senator McGauran and Senator Boswell? They have been conspicuous not only by their silence on this issue but also by their absence from the chamber.
Come in here, Senator McGauran and Senator Boswell, and tell us what you have done for caravan park residents and boarding house residents, because we do not believe that you have done anything. It is the same story on petrol prices and the same story on beer prices—the National Party are a total failure. They fail to represent their constituents in rural and regional Australia. They just get rolled by the Liberal Party every time there is a major policy debate. The National Party were silly enough to agree to a new tax that will increase the price of a vast range of goods and services by a greater amount in rural and regional areas than in the city. It must do, because the base prices of most goods and services in rural and regional Australia are higher than in places like Sydney and Melbourne. Yet the National Party are silly enough to agree to this new tax and they are silly enough to agree to an increase in petrol prices. The National Party are just a total failure. We would like to see them in here and we would like to see them explain themselves. 
I referred earlier to the recent criticisms of the National Party and their failure to carry any clout in the coalition. I am not going to quote from any of my Labor colleagues; I am going to quote from the National Party's so-called coalition colleague, the Liberal Party. Last week, Mr Hawker, the Liberal member for Wannon, said, `I can see no reason on the horizon for people to vote National.' This is one of Senator McGauran's own colleagues in Victoria, one of his so-called coalition colleagues. Mr Hawker went on to say, `I think at some stage the National Party has to draw the line and decide to either merge with the Liberal Party or become a rump.' Come on down, Senator McGauran; come in here and explain why your so-called coalition colleagues are criticising the National Party.
There was also a comment from Sharman Stone, a Liberal Party MP who holds the federal seat of Murray. She won that seat at the last election, incidentally; she won it off the National Party, who had held it for 47 years. But who had previously held the seat of Murray? None other than the former leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr McEwen. They used to call him Black Jack because he was seen as a fairly decisive negotiator when it came to terms within the coalition. He would turn over in his grave if he knew today that—
—A great protectionist.
—He was a great protectionist, that is right, and a great leader of the National Party who was constantly able to demand and receive from the coalition partner, the Liberal Party, a good deal for rural and regional Australia. But this seat, held by the National Party for 47 years, has now gone to the Liberal Party. Anyway, Mrs Stone said that she:
... called for the abandonment of an agreement between the Coalition that prevented Liberal Party members from challenging sitting National Party MPs. “I have no problem with giving voters a choice,” Mrs Stone said ... One Liberal source said moves by the Nationals to abandon the Coalition in Victoria could cost the party its one Senate representative.
And who might that be? Senator McGauran. He is a nice bloke. I personally get on well with Senator McGauran—an urbane sort of chap, intellectual, well educated—
—Intellectual?
—Sorry, I do not want to go too far, but—here he is! Senator McGauran has entered the chamber. I was just saying, he is a decent bloke—
—You had me there, Senator Sherry.
—He is a very decent bloke. He is well educated. He has got that urbane, intellectual background that is so commonplace in the National Party these days.
—I mean that as a compliment, Senator McGauran. What worries me is that we look back at people like Mr Sinclair, Mr Hunt, Mr Anthony Senior—not junior, senior—and old Black Jack McEwen. They were dynamic representatives of the interests of rural and regional Australia. I know you agree, Senator McGauran. You are nodding. But what has happened, Senator McGauran, to the old National Party? I mean, you cannot win a trick. I would be interested to see if you respond in this debate. Here is your chance to exercise some independence, flex some muscle and vote for a Labor amendment which gets rid of the GST for caravan park residents.
—As if!
—Senator McGauran very arrogantly says, `As if!' That is his challenge. You are going to find, Senator McGauran, that when you are voting every day and every night in support of the Liberal Party, through thick and thin—whether it be on this issue, the privatisation of Telstra, investment in roads, the GST or petrol prices—you are not voting in the interests of people in rural and regional Australia. It is often contrary to the interests of the people who live in rural and regional Australia. According to the Liberal Party in Victoria, Senator McGauran, if the coalition deal finishes then you are gone. That is from Liberal Party sources. We would be keen to see you rise in your place and defend the appalling decisions that have been made that have hurt people in rural and regional Australia. We would be keen to see you rise, Senator McGauran, and try and flex some muscle and speak on behalf of the National Party, not the coalition or the Liberal Party. Why be an apologist for the Liberal Party all the time? They can defend themselves; I will give them that. They have got their own particular policy position and they can defend it themselves. But why not defend the interests of people in rural and regional Australia? Why not be a National Party and defend the people you supposedly represent?

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—I have heard a lot of rambling speeches in my time, but that must surely take the cake. It is well known that I always listen carefully to what senators say. I listen to some senators more carefully than others, I have to admit, Senator Murphy. I have never heard such a rambling lot of speeches. I know it is the Labor Party line: see if you can stir up Senator McGauran and see if you can stir up Senator Boswell. You are not succeeding in stirring them up, I would have to say. If that was the object of—
Opposition senators interjecting—
 (Senator George Campbell)—Order! I will protect you, Minister. Just keep going.
—Will you protect me? I am greatly indebted to you for that. You will have noticed that I listened in absolute silence while Senator Murphy spoke.
—I noticed you were wandering around the chamber in absolute silence.
—Yes, I was wandering around the chamber trying to see if there was any way I could get out of earshot of Senator Murphy. But it was not possible in this chamber; the acoustics are too good, I regret to say.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—There weren't very many questions, to be quite frank. There was an incredible amount of rambling. Let me take up just one of the questions which was raised: the implication that, somehow, this government and the National Party have shown no concern for rural Australia. What absolute nonsense! In fact, much of this tax package was driven by farming interests, particularly the need to cut down on transport costs and provide—
—I think I will have to rely on your protection again, Mr Temporary Chairman.
—Order, Senator Murphy! 
—I know that the truth sometimes causes you distress, Senator Murphy, so let me give you some of the facts of the case. Your chatting on does not alter the fact that one of the key measures is the very significant reduction in diesel costs, and a debate on the issue of diesel costs is coming up. This is a very significant measure, it is a very important measure and it is one that tackles the issue of the very high costs for rural transport that the government were left with. There is no argument, Senator, that when your party was in government there were constant increases in the diesel excise. I do not think there is any argument about that. There was no compensation for rural Australia, and we have to address those issues. Equally, Senator Cook, who occasionally makes some sense on trade issues—that is my fifth most famous quote, Senator: `occasionally makes some sense on trade issues' and notice the qualification there—
—It is so qualified it is meaningless.
—Seeing you are looking for good quotes about yourself, I thought I might give you one. The export sector is clearly a big winner. A lot of our exports come from rural and regional Australia. These are very good and important measures. I am amazed that you can come in and speak as though there were some unchallenged view that nothing had been done. A huge amount has been done for rural and regional Australia not only in the ANTS package but also through a range of other government policies. It is quite appropriate for me to mention that the National Party always plays an important role. We are a coalition government. We work well and we consult. Your concern is, of course, that— 
—That's not what Bob Katter said on Meet the Press.
—People are entitled to their views. I can always pick out—well, I do not want to speak about Mark Latham—
—I do not think there is much point. You know what politics is like: individuals have particular views. Mr Katter may have a particular view; Mr Latham may have a particular view. I do not think our throwing this across the chamber advances the debate hugely. The government are always happy to give credit where it is due to our coalition partners, and we have provided together an extremely strong and effective government for this country. I think both of us take great pride in this matter.
—So did they win the $33 million or did the Democrats get it?
—Senator, I do think you are showing excessive enthusiasm. Could you just restrain yourself? We will not be accepting this amendment moved by the Labor Party for a variety of reasons, but let me just note one of the reasons. My understanding of the report so assiduously referred to by the Labor Party is that, if we adopted this amendment, it would be to the long-term detriment of people in boarding houses. I do not know whether you have read the report closely but, if you are looking at it, it states the estimated percentage increases in rents. These figures are in the report, and there has been some discussion of them. For boarding houses, the concessional GST for the short term is four per cent and for the long term it is 1.5 per cent. You are leaving us with the input taxed position for boarding houses. Let me state what that is: the short term is 3.6 per cent, the long term is 3.1 per cent.
As you quoted this model, as you have stressed how important this model is and as you obviously accept those figures, the advice I have received is that it shows that you are likely to be making people in boarding houses worse off as a result of this amendment. The concessional GST delivers a better outcome. I do not know whether you have read this report, Senator Murphy. I do not know whether Senator Cook has read this report carefully. I will not mention names of advisers, but I certainly hope that your advisers have read this carefully. That is the advice that I received. What an astonishing thing that, after all the debate we have had, the Labor Party moves an amendment which can lead to a detrimental outcome. I do not know, Senator Murphy, whether you can explain that. I do not want to put that question to you because we will just get another diatribe from you, but I draw that to your attention.
—Why don't you tell me why the National Party—
—It is an astonishing thing. I put that on the record. Maybe in the days, weeks and months to come, when we look at what the Labor Party attempted to do, it will no longer seem very surprising. It does seem very surprising now. The concessional GST delivers 1.5 per cent in the long term whereas the input taxing delivers 3.1 per cent. In other words, by removing this option, you are producing an adverse result presumably for many people who would have been able to make use of the concessional rate. It is a very strange policy, and I suspect it is policy making on the run. Let me also bring up one of the issues that was raised, as Senator Lees is in the chamber. There was a relentless discussion about who negotiated what with whom and what the role of the National Party was—
—Well, what was it?
—On private negotiations, the short answer is that it is none of your business, actually.
—Who went through the door first?
—You have always been welcome at negotiations on important taxation matters, but the Labor Party never come through the door. We saw an exercise in spleen aimed at the Democrats. It is true that we do not always agree with the Democrats. In fact, on some issues, there will be some quite profound differences. We come from different political traditions and we have a different political base, but I will say this about the Democrats: they are prepared to consult and talk. It is not always that we can achieve a result, but on occasion we can achieve an effective result and an outcome. Senator, you have greater numbers in this chamber, but the fact of the matter is that on so many parts of the tax package the Labor Party were missing in action, MIA. Now you are standing up and talking to me about the GST. If I have said it once, I have said it 100 times: as the Treasurer has indicated, the Labor Party say this GST is so bad that they are planning to keep it. What an absolutely astonishing position after all this debate. 
—It will take a while to sort your mess out.
—I agree that the Labor Party has indicated that there will be a roll-back. If you roll back something, you have to roll forward something else to pay for it. If you roll back on clothing, that is $1.5 billion. That is a huge amount of money. How do you find that sort of money? The truth of the matter is that you have to raise taxes somewhere. I think that is how the debate will come out. I think the historical record will show that the Labor Party's role in tax reform was—to put it as politely as I can—a very unedifying spectacle. You and Senator Sherry venting your spleen at the Democrats has not added to any credit. While I am on that, from time to time there is a debate about what people can say in this chamber, and I am not one to shy away from robust debate. In fact, I have probably said a few robust things myself in my time.
—I have been known to encourage it.
—Senator George Campbell has been known to encourage this—or, indeed, to provoke it. But an unfortunate comment was made about a Mr Murphy by Senator Cook.
—That was by me.
—That is what I said. You are Senator Cook, and that is what I said. It was an unfortunate comment. You could not care less; I understand that, Senator. But, for the record, it does not reflect credit on you to have spoken like that. It is one thing to talk about people who can defend themselves in this chamber. Some pretty tough things have been said about me, and I have responded in kind. But it is a different matter to use that sort of language about someone who is outside the chamber, someone who has a very high standing. It is one thing for Senator Conroy to spray his spleen around. It is another thing for a former senior minister to be doing that. I know I have tickled your conscience, and I know you are now mortified, Senator Cook. But I say for the record that it was not an appropriate way to carry on.
A number of other issues were raised. One was the extra assistance to, and the monitoring of, long-term caravan park and boarding house residents. As the Treasurer has stated, the government will ask the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to put in place an audit program to ensure that the pricing structures of caravan parks and boarding houses do not result in increased margins that capture the increased rent assistance. That is an important measure which, it is my understanding, was discussed with the Democrats. That should provide the sorts of assurances that a number of senators were seeking as part of their more serious contributions.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-26,"—The minister's contribution to the debate thus far leaves some questions hanging. I want to pursue those questions. Firstly, since the government are spending $430 million to publicise and educate—and I use those words derisively—the community about the GST, why wasn't some of this money spent on caravan parks? Why is it now necessary to go around to the caravan parks and explain how the GST operates there? Wasn't that in the initial budget? Secondly, what you have lauded as the special role of the ACCC is their role anyway, isn't it? That is what you expect them to do. What is so special about their doing this here? Are you saying that there are insufficient ACCC staff to do it as a normal, routine matter and, therefore, they require staff supplementation? Or, if it is not routine and if there is no staff supplementation, what is the announcement about?",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—The government are asking the ACCC to put in place an audit program to ensure that the pricing structures of caravan parks and boarding houses do not result in increased margins. It is perfectly appropriate that the government do that, given the particular concerns that people had, and we make no apology for that. In view of the way the debate has progressed and as part of the agreement that we have, it is important to make sure that we do put that audit program in place. The government will ask the ACCC to do that. ",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-26,—Are extra resources being given to the ACCC to do this?,SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—If the ACCC feels it does not have the resources to do the work it is being asked to do, it can always come back to the government and provide further advice.
—Are you saying that there are no extra resources in this particular case?
—I have answered that question.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-26,"—So there are no extra resources in this particular case. Minister, will you confirm that you are increasing the maximum rate of rent assistance in the deal that you have for compensation with the Australian Democrats? It does not appear to be a deal with the Nats, despite their press release. Is that what this supplementation is about? Will you confirm the fact that, for a single social security recipient with no children, the deal is worth 16c extra per day and that, for a single person sharing the rent, the deal is worth just an extra 11c per day? Is that true?",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—Senator, you can work out all the figures you like, but $33 million is being paid in additional rent assistance to low income earners. I would have thought that was a significant figure. You can do all the calculations you like, but that is a significant amount of money in anyone's language.
—It's probably of interest to people who might get it to know how much they might get.
—I am just pointing out to you, Senator, that that is the amount of money. The increase in the maximum rate of rent assistance, as the Treasurer indicated in his press release, will be increased by another three per cent to make a total increase of 10 per cent, with effect from 1 July. There is a 10 per cent increase—it was seven per cent. With other pensions and benefits, there is an up-front increase of four per cent and a guaranteed real increase of two per cent. In this case, there will be a 10 per cent increase in the maximum rate of rent assistance, and that will total $33 million. You can argue your point, but that is a significant amount of money, and it will address some of the concerns which were raised.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-26,"—This is one of those issues where you have a percentage increase in the tax—the GST is a percentage tax—but the compensation is a flat amount. Are you committing the government to adjusting the $33 million over time, when as inflation passes through the value of the percentage goes up in real dollar terms but the lump sum compensation remains the same? Are you committing the government over time to make adjustments in the future or are you not?",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,—I am committing the government to do what it said it would do. Any government in the future can always review these matters. But the commitment I give to the chamber is an important one and should not be minimised. It is a $33 million commitment; it is not a trivial commitment at all. We think that it is an important initiative that was announced by the Treasurer.,SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-26,"—So there is no com-mit-ment down the track that the value of this so-called compensation will not erode and there is no commitment from the government to correct it if it does, meaning that people will be worse off over time—that is the point of it. Since you have answered the question that way, that is the only conclusion I can draw. Only social security recipients receiving the max-imum rate of rent assistance will receive the increase. For those social security recipients who do not receive the maximum rate, this deal does not give them an extra cent, does it? ",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—Yes, the advice I have received is that it applies only to those receiving maximum assistance.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-26,"—And those who are not on the maximum rate get nothing? That is the implication of your answer. 
—I see you have put your hands in the air as if you have given up. Is that an indication that I am right? 
—You are so rarely right, you should not bet on it.
—I see. I take it that I am right there. So this deal over time will not pro-vide compensation, it will erode in value and only those on the maximum rate get the benefit of the deal. This is not a good deal, is it, for those living in caravan parks? It is some compensation but it is not a good deal in the sense that it does not answer all of their problems.
Minister, you said that the amendment before us is counterproductive to people in caravan parks, or words to that effect, and made some allusion that, if the history of this debate is written, the ALP will be seen to have—I suppose `failed' was the word you were searching for—failed people in this position. That is, of course, not the case. People would be better off without the GST, and we have opposed the GST. This situation arises as a consequence of the GST being imposed. I just draw your attention to an article on the front page of today's Mercury newspaper headed `Rich get most in GST: study'. The article starts by saying:
The richest 20% of Australians stand to gain most from the GST, while hundreds of thousands of battlers will be worse off, new research shows. 
An Australian Council of  Social Service report, to be released today, predicts a massive jump in inequality after July 1, as high-income earners pull further ahead of the rest.
It goes on to report Michael Raper, the President of ACOSS. But we knew this, didn't we, right from the beginning? This is the reason for Labor opposing the GST. So it is not right to make the allegation about this amendment, and I commend it to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—One of the issues that people would be worried about is the inability of the Labor Party to give any guarantees or assurances on the assistance that we are providing. The Labor Party have been asked on many occasions to guarantee the tax cuts as part of their policy, and they will not. The reason for that is very clear: the Labor Party intend to roll back those big tax cuts that we are providing to the Australian people. 
If Senator Cook thinks this package favours the rich, we shall look forward to Labor's alternative tax plans. We do not accept that analysis. We think this is a very fair package, which we think improves significantly the equity of the tax system. If he thinks it favours the rich, we will look with great interest at the proposed tax changes that Labor will be making. Charitably, I think the Labor Party tax policy at the last election was a disaster for it. I am getting support from an unusual source. 
—Getting derision from an unusual source. 
—No, Senator Cook, you were not looking. I was getting some unusual support from an unusual quarter. 
—If you are looking at those two guys, I can assure you it was mirth and derision.
—The record does not need to be ex post facto corrected by you. The fact is Labor went to the last election with a disastrous tax policy and that is one of the reasons you are languishing over on that side of the chamber. I have no doubt, from the way you are talking at the moment, Senator Cook, that that will happen again.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-26,"—This is my final question for the moment as I see a colleague of mine is trying to beat me to the call. Minister, you have referred to the report conducted by Econtech and you have drawn my attention to it. So far as I am aware, the government have never tabled this report. It is relied on selectively by the government to be quoted when it suits their case, but it has never been put in the public domain so that it can be properly analysed. Will you now table both the first report and the final document submitted to the government by Econtech so that they become public documents and the issue you are referring to can then be properly analysed? Will you table both reports? ",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—Senator, I am not proposing to table reports. It seems to me that people have obtained copies of the reports. If the Treasurer wants to table this report in the parliament, he will table it. I will put your request to him.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-06-26,"—I have one question. Minister, you were asked earlier about the revenue that is likely to be derived from the GST on caravan parks and hostel rents. Do you have any figures on that? Maybe the Democrats might be able to inform us, with regard to their negotiations, as to whether or not they addressed the question for CPI adjustments in respect of the $33 million new compensation package.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—Senator, I do not have any figures on the revenue side.
—Have they been done?
—I am not sure. I will make inquiries.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Cook's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—I move government amendment No. 1 on sheet EF218:
(1)	Schedule 11, page 70 (after line 33), after item 10, insert:
10A  After subsection 69-10(1)
Insert:
	(1A)	However, this section does not apply in relation to the acquisition or importation of:
	(a)	a commercial vehicle that is not designed for the principal purpose of carrying passengers; or
	(b)	a motor home or campervan.
This amendment will ensure that this limit does not apply to motorhomes. The GST as an aide-memoire limits the amount of input tax credits that can be claimed for luxury cars subject to the luxury car tax. Campervans and vehicles not designed for the principal purpose of carrying passengers will not be subject to the luxury car tax. I think there has been some concern in the wider community—certainly amongst various groups involved with the production of campervans—that campervans are not really a luxury car at all, and the government is moving an amendment to deal with this problem. 
I should note, however, that the normal phasing in rules for claiming input tax credit in relation to these vehicles will still apply for the years ending 30 June 2001 and 30 June 2002. As I said, this matter was causing some concern and the government has decided to deal with this problem. I urge the chamber to support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-26,"—So that I can be clear, this is government amendment No. 1 on sheet EF218 relating to input tax credits on cars?
 (Senator George Campbell)—That is correct.
—And this is one of the amendments contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated today? 
—Correct.
—Apart from what is in the explanatory memorandum—once again, Minister, no offence—the mumbled explanation you have just given of this amendment hardly amounts to something that throws a great deal of light upon what the government are intending to do here and why they were moved to do it. Would you revisit, for the sake of the record, where you saw the imperfections in the present drafting, why it is that you chose to amend it now and, preferably, who made the representations?",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—Senator, I think the question is whether or not a campervan or a motorhome could be defined as a luxury vehicle. There were arguments that, as defined in the original bill, their price—certainly the price of some of them—came within that ambit. What we have done here is to make a distinction—in other words, they are not being regarded as a luxury vehicle; they are different. I will seek further advice on this.
As I said, the GST limits the amount of input tax credits that can be claimed on luxury cars subject to the luxury car tax. The motor vans and caravans will be dealt with in another amendment that is coming through. There was a question asked in the Senate recently—by Senator Hutchins, if I remember rightly—regarding the phasing in of input tax credits. The basic rule is that you do not get an input tax credit in the first year, in the second year you can claim 50 per cent and in the third year you can claim all your input tax credits. That is what we meant by the term `phasing in' of input tax credit. This amendment is related to the other government amendment on the program relating to luxury cars.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-26,"—As I understand the minister's explanation, this covers wholly designed and manufactured campervans—the Winnebagos that we see on the road from time to time—and other commercial vehicles made up to become campervans or motorhomes that would be valued in excess of $55,000 and qualify for ordinary definition as a luxury car.
I am looking at the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated in respect of this item. Point 4 says:
The financial impact of this measure is minimal as not all vehicles to be excluded from the LCT by new item 16F would have been caught by section 69-10. Additionally, the full financial impact of this measure will not occur until the year commencing 1 July 2002 after the phasing in period for claiming input tax credits for motor vehicles has expired.
My concern, a concern I pursued with you last week on another matter—if it was not you, it was the parliamentary secretary representing you in the chamber at the time—is the words in the explanatory memorandum `the financial impact of this measure is minimal'. Can the government quantify what it means by `minimal'? Is there some figure you can give us? I do not mean necessarily a precise figure but some indication of what you mean by `minimal'.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—The best I can say is that, in lieu of any other advice, `minimal' means exactly what it says—minimal. In the sweep of government, it is not significant. If we could put a precise figure on it, I guess we would put a precise figure on it. The advice that I have received from my very eminent advisers is that it is minimal, and minimal means minimal. I am sorry, but I cannot go any further. ",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-26,"—Let me use the example I used the other day. When my dentist leans over me with a pair of surgical pliers, he says, `This won't hurt a bit,' and I often find that it hurts quite a lot. When the government says that it is minimal or minor, what does it mean by that? Does it mean it is minor compared with the gross national product of Australia, and therefore it might be several billions of dollars but still minor compared with the total? Words like `minimal' or `minor' or `not significant' are words that I am curious about. How much do you regard as minimal? This is, after all, a sweeping tax which will impose new costs and charges on many people. We, at least in this chamber, should pursue some transparency about the real costs. While you are chewing on answering that question, Minister, the explanatory memorandum says at point 2:
The financial impact of the measure relating to campervans and motor homes is less than $5 million for the 2000-2001 financial year. The measure relating to non-passenger vehicles has no financial impact as these vehicles were never intended to be covered by the LCT.

If I went through the bills that you had brought before this chamber and looked at the EMs which you have guided through here, there may well be a number of EMs where the word `minimal' was used. If I had asked you what you meant by `minimal', I suspect you would have responded in a similar way to me. We are not talking about a share of GDP but of the overall cost of a particular measure. I do not know whether I can give you any further precision on that. I am not trying to resist your question or be difficult, but I think it is a fairly standard procedure by governments. If I was so minded to go through EMs and look at the many bills that you piloted through this chamber—not that I would do the research, Senator Cook, so you will not have to face that embarrassment—some of them may well have had tax implications and may well have used the word `minimal'. Therefore, I would respond in a like way to you. As I said, the costs of this measure are not substantial or significant.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—I move government request 5 on sheet EF216:
(5)	Schedule 11, page 72 (after line 4), after item 11, insert:
11AA  At the end of section 84-15
Add:
	(2)	If the transfer is a transfer of the services of an employee, this section does not apply to the transfer to the extent that any payments that:
	(a)	are made from the *enterprise in Australia to the enterprise outside Australia; and
	(b)	relate to the transfer;
would be *withholding payments if they were payments from the enterprise in Australia to the employee.
My understanding is that this relates to offshore supplies other than goods or real property. The government is introducing this amendment to remove the GST reverse charge on amounts paid to an overseas branch for the services of an expatriate employee. The reverse charge will be removed from the payment to the extent of the amount that would have been subject to a PAYG withholding if it had been paid to a worker in Australia by an Australian employer. The request provides consistency with salaries paid by domestic financial supply providers to their employees—that is, no GST is payable on salaries. The amendment will benefit foreign owned financial supply providers by reducing compliance costs. The reverse charges are applied to examples where it becomes a great incentive to locate services offshore. Therefore, we have a reverse charge arrangement. I think this particular issue comes out when, for example, an employee is posted to Australia from an overseas branch, and the salary he is paid as an Australian employee would not be subject to GST. The reverse charge arrangement may well be seen to have that effect. As a result, we are moving to rectify this issue, which was brought to our attention by a number of financial service providers who have branches overseas.

Repeal the section.
This is the opposition amendment for gambling. The chamber is familiar with this amendment. The chamber is familiar with the hypocrisy of the government over this amendment. It is, in many respects, a sad thing that we are required to move it yet again. We move it on this occasion because the substantive debate in this bill is for residents of caravan parks and boarding houses. I think it is important to contrast the different treatment the government are offering those residents, for whom they are providing a package of $33 million in compensation. For those residents who are single with one dependent child, that is 16c a day. For two single people, that is 11c per day. If you are on the maximum rate, you get that amount. If you are on less than the maximum rate as a social welfare beneficiary, you do not. The amount in the case of caravan park and boarding house residents is a flat cash amount. We recognise that the tax is a percentage. The value of the compensation will erode with time. The masterful negotiators in the Australian Democrats have not recognised that, so there is no in-built mechanism to correct the time erosion of the value of the compensation. The government do not seem to care and nor do the Democrats or, it seems in this case, the National Party, who have trumpeted that they, not the Democrats, have succeeded in achieving these changes.  
Contrast that to the high rollers in casinos: they are compensated for excessive losses by casino operators and can have those losses written off as part of their tax advantages. Clearly this is a government for the rich. This is a government for the privileged. This is a government that is not concerned at all that the gap between wealth and poverty in Australia is opening more widely. Because of the dismissive terms that the minister has used to squash the report that I referred to earlier in the Hobart Mercury—a front-page report of a survey that ACOSS have been principally responsible for which shows that, once again, the effect of this tax is to widen the disparities between wealthy Australians and ordinary Australians—it is important that this chamber again has the opportunity to do something positive to set the record straight. Support for this amendment would be one of those things that it could do.
In addressing the amendment, I want to go back to some of the remarks made earlier today. One of the remarks was made in a speech on the second reading by Senator Lees. It said that the unanticipated revenue gains were calculated at several billion dollars and that those unanticipated revenue gains were most likely due to the impact of the goods and services tax on the black economy. In short, the advantage of this tax, according to the advocates of it, is that it will ensure that transactions that were untaxed in the past—opportunities to avoid taxation—will be reduced and that there will be a windfall gain to revenue. That may be the explanation for the extra funds that are coming forward.
It is an issue that is entirely problematic. I draw attention to a report that I have previously referred to in the Economist magazine. Two years ago they ran a table of the size of the black economy in a number of OECD countries. Australia, with its existing tax system, was in the bottom quartile of OECD countries in terms of the size of the black economy. All of the countries above Australia that had bigger black economies as a per capita proportion were economies which had a goods and services tax. The simple proposition, often so fraudulently put, that a goods and services tax means an end to the black economy was not exhibited in any empirical way by that survey. In fact, a conclusion you could come to from that survey is that the propensity for an increase in the size of the black economy accompanies a goods and services tax or a tax of that sort.
Has there been any serious work on whether the black economy will yield over a greater tax revenue than otherwise? No, there has not. In estimates, I have pursued this matter assiduously, particularly at the last estimates, only to be met with a brick wall of government assertion and no study or analysis. In publicising the so-called advantages of this tax, this is an issue which is dwelt on by its advocates quite strongly. It is one of those things that is lent on as a positive argument. Well, that ought to change from last Friday, 23rd, when the Business Review Weekly, the magazine that has been, in the past, an editorialising supporter of this tax, carried as its front page cover story `The Black Economy' with the subtitle `Will it grow under the GST?' One has only to turn to the inside story on the black economy, which has the heading `Why GST is good news for the black economy' to see that this is a fraudulent attempt by the government and by the Australian Democrats to say that somehow the GST will stamp out tax avoidance in the black economy. It will not. The article is an article that I commend to the government and to the Australian Democrats because this is something that we will be drawing to the attention of the Australian community, as we have in the past. 
The black economy prospers under a GST. It just means that the type of tax avoidance and the types of activities in the black economy are different from those in a non-GST economy. It does not mean to say that avoidance is less and it does mean to say that it can often be the case that avoidance is more. Indeed, to revert to the point, in OECD economies where there is a GST, the level of the black economy is bigger than in the Australian economy, where there is not a GST. Let me go to some of the points made here by the magazine. I quote from the article:
Overseas experience and research shows that when a goods and services tax (GST), value added tax or other form of tax on consumption is imposed, there is usually a short-term reduction in tax evasion and then the black economy returns to its previous level. In some cases, tax evasion increases. The governments and tax officials of Canada, New Zealand and several European countries that have consumption taxes are working furiously to combat expanding black economies. New Zealand has had a consumption tax for 14 years. Christchurch accountant, Leon Hendron, who had been working with business on GST since its introduction, recently published a book for Australian business called Survive the GST. In the book's introduction, Hendron says:
GST is an easy tax to avoid, evade or defraud. The ATO, the Australian Taxation Office, will be handing out refund cheques like Santa Claus.
He goes on to talk about the evasions of the black economy. In this article is a table headed `Not taxed, not touched'. It refers to types of tax evasion activity that will not be picked up or that will be only lightly affected by the GST. It has a ranking order that I do not have time to go through in great detail, but let me touch on some of the elements of it. First, with regard to criminal activities such as drug dealing and prostitution, the effect of the new tax system is none. Second, for moonlighting, which involves underreporting or failure to report income from a second job, the effect of the GST is none. Third, for profit, where businesses understate the size of their payroll et cetera, there will be some effect, it concedes; and it goes on to talk about how that effect can be tabulated. The overstating of expenditure, particularly business expenditure, is their fourth point, and the effect of the GST is small. Fifth are welfare benefits: for workers who receive unemployment benefits or other forms of social security but who hold jobs that should preclude them from the benefits, the effect is none. Sixth is failure to declare interest, and the effect is none. Seventh is barter, the exchange of goods and services between one professional or another, and the effect is none. And so it goes on.
My point in referring to this in support of the amendment is that the degree of hypocrisy here is breathtaking, and there is a double dealing element in terms of the $430 million propaganda and political point-scoring campaign that the government has funded. Let us get this right. The GST, of itself, does not automatically mean that the black economy is diminished. While it might be that, come election time next year, there will be a short-term reduction in the black economy, it is only a transition as the black economy finds new shape and new ways of avoiding the tax. Most tax advisers will tell you that it is the size of the tax that leads to the level of avoidance and not the nature of the tax, because the nature of the tax means that people will find ways around it and eventually they do. There is enough experience in the world, particularly in those OECD countries in the Economist table that I referred to, to guide Australian tax professionals to make a career out of finding ways of avoiding tax for wealthy clients.
Not only do we have the situation where high rollers—people who bet in excess of $¾ million on the turn of the dice—can have an advantage by virtue of having, if they lose, some of their losses refunded to them by the casino operators and then those casino operators being able to write that off as an expense under the tax, but we also have an end to this canard, at least as far as the Business Review Weekly is concerned—which is quite a reputable magazine in the business sector—that there will be a reduction of the black economy by virtue of this tax. There will not be, and it is not likely that there will be, and the table of areas that I have referred to point to that quite conclusively.
It may well be that, as Senator Lees has said, there will be more revenue harvested from this tax than the government has previously said. What we can be sure of is that if there is a little bit out of the black economy it will not last long; it will be overtaken as the black economy expands again. Therefore, it is an illusory gain—a short-term, one-off windfall—rather than any long-term structural repair to the system. Essentially, those with enough wealth in Australia to have discretionary income in order to spend it to find ways of avoiding tax will be able to do so again. This waving of, `Peace in our time. We've got a breakthrough on the black economy,' is not true. The disgusting hypocrisy of the three-party coalition—the Libs, the Nationals and the Democrats—on the high-rollers tax is what this amendment again highlights. I commend it to the chamber.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—We will not be supporting this amendment. We have had this debate tirelessly. Senator Cook seems to think that every other day he can move the amendment again. I think the arguments that were run against this amendment last time apply equally today. The government's amendment last year in relation to gambling gave no monetary benefit to casinos or casino patrons and made no distinction between kinds of gamblers.
In relation to the black economy, I think Senator Cook may have to eat some humble pie in a number of years time on this issue. He asserts it has no effect. In fact, I think he goes further: he asserts the black economy will grow. I assert that Senator Cook is dead wrong, and I expect Senator Cook will have the opportunity to eat some humble pie. We believe that we will garner an extra $3.5 billion over three years from the black economy; in part, of course, because of the comprehensive new tax system, including the Australian business number and the pay-as-you-go system. We believe that in many ways we are striking into new territory here. In those particular areas I do not think other countries have gone as far as Australia has gone. We expect that this will have an impact on the black economy. We have made forecasts in our papers that it will be, as I said, some $3.5 billion over three years.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-06-26,"—This amendment that has been moved by Senator Cook is, in part, about making the tax system a bit more equitable; not doing as the government, the Democrats and the National Party have done, making it less equitable for those who can least afford it. As was pointed out earlier by Senator Cook with regard to the Mercury report about the rich getting most from the GST, they certainly will. It has been the practice of this government and the Democrats to allow that to occur. In relation to the high-roller amendment that the government moved, I would be interested to hear from Senator Lees how the Democrats can justify allowing that sort of approach to be taken on the one hand when, on the other hand, the people affected by caravan park rents and hostel rents get a meagre $33 million extra compensation. As has been pointed out, some get 16c a day, some might get 11c, but the government is unable to respond with regard to which people might get what. I think that further highlights the whole process that the government has been going through.
I am pleased that Senator McGauran is back in here again for the second time today. Senator McGauran might want to get up on behalf of the National Party and speak about their position. Take the muzzle off. Don't let the Liberals keep the muzzle on the National Party. Take it off, get up and have something to say and defend your position, Senator McGauran. Senator McGauran might be able to tell us whether they got through the door before the Democrats did in respect of the $33 million on the one hand.
—We did.
—I take that interjection. Senator McGauran says they did. That is very interesting. I note the wry smile on Senator Lees's face. She obviously does not agree with Senator McGauran on that point. I refer again to one of Senator McGauran's colleagues, Mr Katter, and his interview on Meet the Press on Sunday morning when he had a proposition put to him by the interviewer, Ross Gittins. Mr Gittins said:
Mr Katter, there's been a lot of scaremongering about the GST but John Howard says no one will be worse off. And, he's right in saying that there are very big income tax cuts that a lot of people haven't really registered on. 
As has been pointed out many times—I want to deal with the tax cuts for a minute—50 per cent of those tax cuts go to the top 20 per cent of income earners. That is the very thing that the Australian Council of Social Services is pointing out. That is why they are saying that the bottom 80 per cent will be worse off. What did Mr Katter say to that? He said:
The political reaction for owner-operated business to having an enormously increased workload is very serious political stuff, indeed, point one. Point two, I made the point earlier on, that my old state electorate has a twenty-three per cent higher cost of living than Brisbane. So, I mean, clearly we're going to be paying greater ... now, I didn't ask—I mean, people accuse me of being unreasonable—I didn't ask for a change. All I asked for was an inquiry.
This is representative of the National Party stance within this coalition government, which includes the Democrats. It shows how they are really seen. Mr Katter goes on to say:
Now, I have been three months going backwards and forwards to every single person of power in Australia, all of the corridors of power that avail me—the party room, the joint party room—I have raised these issues. I have had absolutely no movement in spite of an undertaking on this. Now, if anyone thinks that myself, or elements of the National Party ... and the Queensland National Party only agreed to the GST on this basis.
We have seen reports, which I have watched with interest, about the National President and, I think, New South Wales President of the National Party, Mrs Helen Dickie, with regard to what the GST is doing and what the National Party's relevance to all of this is, and it is a not unsurprising big fat zero. Senator McGauran ought to come in here—as he is at the moment—and stand up and be counted. Why did Senator McGauran and the National Party support the high-roller amendment that allowed a situation where, as Senator Cook pointed out, you can lose, say, $1 million and the casino can choose to give you half of it back or $100,000 of it back and you would have no tax liability, yet the poor old bottom 80 per cent of income earners, those on social security benefits and the like, you whack as hard as you possibly can, and then you run around and say, `Well, perhaps we need to compensate them a bit more'? I would suggest to you that, if you want an equitable taxation regime, then you ought to consider very seriously the circumstances that you have brought upon those people.
—You've just been wound up.
—You ought to wind up, Senator McGauran, and actually defend the people that you represent. This amendment is well worth while supporting. It would bring about a more equitable position in respect of the tax system that we currently have.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-06-26,"—I was just rising to do that very thing and to go back to the issue that we are actually talking about, which is the high-roller amendment. This chamber has rejected this twice already, and nothing has changed since the Labor Party tried this on originally. It is a highly misleading claim, a very emotive issue obviously that they got a good run out of and are trying to get another run out of.
I will not stop there, because I think we do need to look at how the lobbying on this was done. Instead of coming before the committee, instead of putting it out in public, it was done behind closed doors, which inevitably makes one suspicious, when the committee process which is there is not used. It is Labor's first big hit on the GST—and they obviously got great encouragement from that scare campaign because they have been going on about this issue and others ever since—but it is misleading.
Again, the Democrats will not be supporting this amendment. We are not talking about any benefit whatsoever to Crown Casino or to any individual player out there who is known as a high roller. What the Democrats are arguing for is consistency in tax law. If a casino is refunding part of its margin to gamblers, then it has reduced its margins, and on gambling supplies only the margin is taxable. I am not arguing that they should give money back. That is something that is over to the casino. In fact, I think it is quite obscene, both the amount some people gamble and the amount they get back. But the issue is that it is the margins that are taxable. This is the approach taken by the New South Wales government, by your government in Victoria, Senator, by the Tasmanian government and by the Queensland state government. It is the way the system works. All we are arguing for is consistency in calculating the taxes on gambling. So it is the tax on margins that we are debating, and it should stay the way people do it—that is, the principle is that basically the eventual margin, whatever it is, is what is taxed. 
Another issue—and I will be brief—is the whole question of rent assistance. You have got the bottom and the top rate both indexed through the CPI to the threshold, so I cannot quite see where Senator Cook is getting his figures from on that. Indeed, we are looking at five—if not eight—per cent indexed above inflation for the rent assistance. So it will go up as it has always done.

This is another related amendment. It relates to the meaning of a luxury car. We dealt in part with this a little earlier on. The government is also amending the luxury car legislation to ensure that motorhomes and campervans are not subject to the luxury car tax. The amendment will also clarify that vehicles not designed for the principal purpose of carrying passengers are not subject to the luxury car tax. Without this amendment it would have been possible, we understand, for a number of commercial vehicles with a load capacity of less than two tonnes to have been subject to the LCT. This could have included vehicles such as street sweepers and drilling rigs. This was not the intention of the luxury car tax.

(1)	Schedule 1, page 12 (after line 28), after item 8, insert:
8AA  Section 195-1 (at the end of the definition of gift-deductible entity)
Add “, provided that the entity is not a political party that is registered under Part XI of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918”.
I move this amendment because I am concerned that there is confusion about the status of political parties vis-a-vis charities in the legislation. We need to make it clear, as this amendment does, that a political party is not a charity under the definition of this legislation. I have, in particular, had some difficulty discovering from the government whether its intention is that public funding of political parties, for example, which comes after elections is a taxable item. We have not been able to determine that until yesterday—or even today—when the Assistant Treasurer, who is with us now, gave an answer to my question of last week in which he makes it clear. He said:
With regard to election funding, the Australian Taxation Office has recently provided advice that public funding for election purposes will not generally be regarded as consideration for a taxable supply and consequently the payments will not usually be subject to GST.
This comes after an earlier Australian Taxation Office opinion that this would be subject to GST. The Assistant Treasurer went on in this letter tabled today to say:
The Australian Taxation Office changed its view of the GST treatment of these payments after obtaining further information and consulting with the Australian Electoral Commission.
I ask the Assistant Treasurer, whose answer this is: what is the further information and what was the consultation which allowed the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation to change his mind 180 degrees on this matter? I want to give the government time during the suspension of the sitting for dinner to consider the matter, and that will expedite the debate. The next sentence in the advice from the Assistant Treasurer—that is, the penultimate paragraph in today's answer to me—is as follows: 
I am also advised that payments under the Dairy Industry Adjustment Program are not subject to the GST.
That advice comes because I pointed out last week that election funding to politicians is very similar to Dairy Industry Adjustment Program funding in that it involves a grant of money or a giving of money to persons in return for them doing something—in our case, in return for us taking up obligations as representatives of the people and, in the case of Dairy Industry Adjustment Program, in terms of certain farmers giving up milking cows.
We have today also obtained a ruling, which is a public ruling, from the tax office on that very matter. It is under the heading `Goods and services tax ruling—goods and services tax: grants of financial assistance'. If you turn to sections 27 and 28 on page 3 of that ruling, you find that, in a European court, Advocate General Jacobs, in regard to a value added tax matter, says that the value added tax does not apply to a farmer who gets a grant to stop growing potatoes. But then in the next paragraph, under the Australian Taxation Office ruling, we find the statement that, notwithstanding that ruling in Europe, in Australia `the relevant grant would be subject to the GST'.
So here we have the situation where a dairy farmer who stops milking cows in return for a grant is not subject to GST but the farmer next door who stops growing potatoes in return for a government grant is subject to GST. After the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I want the Assistant Treasurer to explain to the committee of the whole what the parameters are for making such an absurd conclusion. Is it just the current political situation or is there some logic that escapes me driving these decisions? I think political considerations are driving these considerations. There is no consistency or logic to them whatever. I am going to ask the minister, after the suspension of the sitting for dinner, whether he, with his advisers, could inform the chair about the postal allowance: will that be subject to the GST or will it not? What about politicians' overseas travel allowances, which you do not get unless you travel overseas: will that be subject to the GST or will it not? What about drought assistance? Is that subject to the GST or is it not? What about assistance to companies for overseas investment and assistance given to employees of companies which go bankrupt and leave them without their entitlements, a number of cases of which we have recently seen? Is a Landcare grant subject to the GST or a grant to a community group for administration purposes?
Are grants under the Regional Forest Agreement currently being offered to farmers in Tasmania and elsewhere in consideration that they do not cut trees, because the environment is important and needs to be protected, to be subject to the GST or are they not? Indeed, what about a grant given by a state or federal government to a mining corporation on condition that it carry out limited duties such as exploration? Recently, for example, Renison Bell in Tasmania—as you will know, Mr Temporary Chairman Watson—has been given $4.5 million, as part of an ongoing $18 million program, to continue its activities in western Tasmania based on exploration: will that be subject to the GST or will it not? I think this whole matter requires explanation. I ask the minister if, after the suspension of the sitting for dinner, he could come in not with a 19-page ruling, like this one from the tax office, but with a simple explanation of the contradictions inherent in today's answer that will satisfy the average taxpayer.

I would like to thank you, Senator, on my behalf, but particularly on behalf of all my hardworking staff who forewent dinner to study the matters that you raised. I put that on record and thank my advisers for doing that. Senator Brown has got an interpretation of this which, frankly, I find it very hard to agree with. The matters are not political. There is no political motive behind how these particular grants are classified. Certain rules apply, and that helps us judge the particular status of the grant. Let me go back to square one. A government grant is usually a payment of money, and grants can be subject to GST depending on the registered status of the recipient and the conditions attached to the payment of the grant. If the payment is to a non-registered person or business, there will be no GST implications. If the payment is to a registered business and is not consideration for a supply, it will not be subject to GST. If the payment is to a registered business and is consideration for a supply, it will be subject to GST. Where it is subject to GST—this is important and perhaps goes to the nub of your concerns—there will be no net impact for the recipient where the government grosses up the grant. Since governments will be entitled to claim an input tax credit, there is no incentive for them not to gross up the grant. 
The ATO has released a comprehensive public ruling on government grants, which Senator Brown referred us to, that explains these basic rules in more detail. Senator Brown has asked about a range of specific government grants and, I think, asserted that the rationale for the classification of the various government grants is in some way political. I am not sure whether that was your intention, Senator, but it came through to me that you were suggesting that somehow some political criteria had been applied. This is not correct; let me make that clear. The perception of difference in treatment stems from the application of the law to the facts of the various cases. Senator Brown raised the issue of a number of different payments, and it was not possible in the short period that we had in the dinner break to provide definitive advice in relation to all of them. In fact, definitive advice always comes from the Commissioner of Taxation when he has full knowledge of the facts of the case. However, we note that.
Let me now turn to AEC electoral funding. An example of a grant with no conditions is an AEC electoral funding payment. This payment is made on the basis of the votes received, and the entitlement flows directly from this. There is no supply from the political party to the government, so it is not subject to the GST. I think that would be very well illustrated in your case, Senator: you would not be making a supply to the government in electoral funding. You raised whether there were consultations. The consultations with the AEC were to clarify precisely the nature of the grant. Having clarified that, the final determination was made. Allowances to employees as well as to MPs and senators would be more in the nature of salary type payments, as salary payments are not subject to GST.
I have already tabled advice on dairy adjustments grants, and they are not subject to GST. The grant by the Tasmanian government to a mining company in return for the company undertaking exploration would probably be subject to GST. Again, I would have to say that definitive advice can be obtained only from the Commissioner of Taxation. I also make the point that, if the payment is subject to GST, the government can obtain an input tax credit and can gross up the grant without any loss of revenue. That is an important part: there is an input tax credit claimed, so there is no loss of revenue to the government. Those are the principles on which this was made—not that you, Senator, would take advice from a minister. There may be debates around grants—and I think we have had them—but the idea that a determination is made on a political basis for these things is not correct. That is the advice I have provided to you.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-26,"—I thank the minister, but I want to seek further clarification of what is a very confused situation. I note that the minister did not come back with a clear guideline which anybody in the Australian community could pick up and use to determine what would be GSTed and what would not on the matter of government grants. I ask the minister again: will the federal government gross up all grants that are GSTed so that the recipient of those grants will not be at a loss because of the introduction of this legislation? Also, the minister said that allowances to politicians are like salary payments and therefore will not be GSTed. I put the specific example of the postage allowance. That is nothing like a salary allowance. You cannot get it unless you have spent the money on stamps for an electoral matter. I ask the minister again: is a grant such as the stamp allowance to MPs, which I understand is many thousands of dollars, to be subject to the GST or not? Then I come to the original contradiction of the government saying that, if a dairy farmer stops milking his or her cows and gets a payment, that will not be GSTed but, under the tax ruling that my office has received today, if a potato farmer stops growing potatoes in return for a grant from the government, that will be GSTed. Could you please explain that contradiction? ",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—It is a bit difficult to quote specific cases because the fact of the matter is that we sometimes need more information than you are able to provide. Typically, if a body is uncertain of its position, it makes an inquiry to the Australian Taxation Office, it gets a ruling and the situation is clarified. Let me just deal with the letter allowance paid to an MP. MPs are non-registered people. I understand that there are therefore no GST implications if the allowance is paid to the person, for example, and that is the advice that I have received. Senator Brown, you are listening to me, aren't you? That is if it is paid to the person.
In relation to the various farming grants, we have given you the general rules, but it is not up to a minister to make a definitive ruling on these matters in this chamber. It is a matter for the tax commissioner. I have indicated to you that grants can be subject to the GST depending on the registered status of the recipient and the conditions attached to the payment of the grants. It is on that basis that the commissioner makes the ruling. I do not make a ruling as a minister. It is not a matter for a minister to make a ruling on; it is a matter for the tax commissioner to make a ruling on.
Equally, we have indicated that grants to charities will be grossed up, and I have stated that in previous debates in this chamber. There is no net effect where a grant is made to the particular charity. The grants are not done on a political basis. It is not for the government to decide how a particular grant is made or whether it is subject to the GST or not. It depends on the facts of the case. I have gone through the rules. Senator Brown, I think you were slightly unkind because the fact is that I did go through the rules. Let me make it clear that, if the payment is to a registered business and is a consideration for a supply, it will be subject to the GST. However, where it is subject to the GST, there will be no net impact for the recipient where the government gross up the grant. Since governments will be entitled to an input tax credit, there is no incentive for them not to gross them up. Senator Brown, I draw that to your attention. Charities were worried about this, and that is the way we dealt with it.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-26,"—This is totally unsatisfactory. I asked the minister to give a clear indication as to which grants were going to be subject to the GST and which were not, and he cannot do that. When I come to the case of the dairy farmer as against the potato farmer, I want to know why the Australian Taxation Office says that the potato farmer will be subject to the GST but the minister says that the dairy farmer will not. That is the question I am asking, and that is the question the minister is ducking. I asked the minister before tea and I will ask him again: what happens under the Natural Heritage Trust funding where a farmer foregoes the cutting down of the wood lot at the back of his or her farm in return for a government payment to protect that wood lot because it has conservation value? This is an exactly analogous service being provided in return for a government grant. The question is: will it be GSTed or won't it?
Finally, on this contribution, the minister does not know about and cannot answer my questions on specific cases, although I am quoting tax office rulings, not basing this on any assumptions other than those coming from the government and the tax office. When it comes to the multiplicity of grants going not just to charities but to community organisations, the minister says that we can increase the grants to cover the GST which has to be paid. Will the government, which does not know about each case until it gets a tax office ruling—because the minister said that it is not up to the minister; it is up to the tax commissioner—approach the tax office with regard to every grant after 1 July to get a determination in order to make sure it will not deprive a community group of one-eleventh of the grant it is being given because it will be GSTed on it? ",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—The departments are conducting the research required to determine whether a grant is subject to the GST or not; whether conditions apply to the particular grant. I am quite comfortable with going to the commissioner and listing the ones that you have raised questions on. I am not sure the commissioner has all the information he needs, but if the commissioner feels confident about that, I am very happy to provide you with that information. I am not resisting your questions, but it is a matter for the Commissioner of Taxation.
—These are things you ought to know.
—I do not know whether a particular grant has conditions or not. You might like to tell me whether the grant made to potato growers has conditions attached to it or not. If it has conditions attached then it may well be subject to the GST. If it does not have conditions attached then it may not be subject to the GST. It is a matter of looking at the facts of each case. If there are particular matters on which you would like me to provide advice to you from the commissioner, I will do that. But, in the end, it is a matter for the commissioner to determine on the facts of each particular case.
—If the grant is paid for the purposes of a person leaving the industry—
—If you had been listening, Senator Murphy, you would know that we said that, where a grant is paid without conditions, it is not subject to the GST. Where it is paid with conditions, the GST is applicable. That is the general principle which is applied. I am advised that the tax office has looked at the issue of dairy adjustment grants, and they are not subject to the GST. It is a matter of determining whether a particular grant has conditions attached to it or whether it does not. That is one of the criteria which are used. It is not a matter of being political. Where a grant is paid and the government can claim an input tax credit, a business need not be any worse off. I am not sure that we are debating something of major substance here, nor am I trying to hide anything. But, before I give a view on the various grants that you are talking about, I need to make sure that I have all the facts on them, and you should understand that. It is not me being resistant at all. If you tell me that a particular grant does not have any conditions, we can generally—subject to any other view the commissioner might have—say with some confidence that it would not be subject to the GST. Where a grant has conditions applied to it and it is paid to a registered body, we can say that it will be subject to the GST. That is the general principle. There is no hiding from that. But if you ask me, `Does the potato industry adjustment scheme have a grant?' I would have to see what the scheme is about. Nothing here would cause you any concern about this being of a political nature.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-26,"—The minister is not on top of the tax office rulings. The tax office ruling released today says that there will be a GST where a potato farmer stops growing potatoes in return for a government grant.
—That is a condition.
—But, in answer to my question on notice, the same minister said that, if a dairy farmer stops milking cows and gets a grant in return for doing that, it will not be subject to the GST.
—Are you saying that that is not a condition?
—Yes, Senator Murphy, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman. The minister is saying that not milking cows is not a condition but that not growing potatoes is a condition. The cases are exactly analogous, and we have totally different rulings on them. I want to ask the minister explicitly whether he can give a commitment from the gov-ernment that no grant to community groups or organisations will be lessened bymeans of a GST being levied. The minister said, `No. Where there are grants going to community organisations where the GST applies, the grants will be increased to cover the GST, because the GST will be returned to the government.' On the facts of it, that is logical. I am concerned that there will be community groups who will not get their grants increased by an amount that covers the GST because they do not have the favour of government. I want to make sure that the minister is absolutely right and can be held to a government commitment that there will not be any selectivity in this matter and that, without exception, community groups will not be out of pocket because the GST is levied on grants. ",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—Senator Brown, it is a bit unfair of you to say that the dairy adjustment scheme has one particular ruling and the potato scheme that you refer to has another. The point of the matter is that I would need to seek advice on that. You say that they are inconsistent. I am not sure whether you are quoting from a public ruling or a private ruling. I am not able to make any comment on a private ruling.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-26,"—I have just given the minister the ruling from the tax office, which gives the example of the potato farmer under sections 27 and 28. I just repeat that the GST will be levied in the case of the potato farmer but not in the case of the dairy farmer. The point that is being established here is that I am not being conjecturable outside of existing rulings coming from the tax office. The rulings are not consistent, any more than the tax office's first ruling from the assistant commissioner himself that public funding of elections would be subject to taxation was consistent. That has now been changed to public funding of politicians and political parties not being subject to the GST. I asked the minister before the suspension of the sitting if he would give an explanation as to why that change was made. What was it that the Electoral Commission told the tax office? I would be very pleased if the minister would inform the committee of the reasons for this 180-degree about-turn by the tax office—in light of information we are not acquainted with from the Australian Electoral Commission. ",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—I think you are a bit unkind because I have before me the exact advice that I read. I think Hansard will show that I did respond to your question. This is what I read into the Hansard. I may be wrong but I am 99 per cent sure this is exactly what I said because I have it before me. An example of a grant with no conditions is an AEC electoral funding payment. This payment is made on the basis of votes received, and the entitlement flows directly from this. There is no supply from a political party to the government, so it is not subject to GST. That is what I said. I remember we were discussing whether you had made a supply to the government when you came into this parliament and I think you would agree that you did not. When the government went back and took some information from the AEC, this is the determination that it reached. As an example, let us say that if you put a GST on that, the government would then claim it as an input tax credit, so there would be no net effect. If the government said, `We will put a GST on that,' and they grossed it up by, say, 10 per cent and that was payable, the government would then claim an input tax credit. So there is no net effect one way or the other. I think that is correct. My advisers are nodding, which suggests it probably is correct. 
I am not quite sure of the point you are making—that this is some big deal. It is not a big deal; it is a matter that I certainly have no involvement in. The commissioner does not ask me what my view is in relation to grants paid to political parties. I am sure he determines these things on the facts of the matter. But the point I am making is that, where it is subject to GST, there will be no net impact for the recipient where the government grosses up the grant since governments will be entitled to an input tax credit. There is no incentive for them not to gross it up. I think that answers the question. There is nothing malicious here.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-26,"—Whatever else there may be, there is great confusion by the government and by the tax office. The tax office ruling that the GST would apply on public funding has now become that the GST would not apply. Let me make it straight: there was a three-page ruling from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in January this year that said it would apply. There is now a ruling from the tax office that says it will not apply as far as public funding is concerned. It just shows you that the tax office at least, if not the government, does not have any consistency here.  
Might I point out a common misconception: people do not pay their taxes to the government; they pay their taxes to the parliament for the parliament to determine legislation that will disburse those taxes. While there is no service being given to the government per se through political funding, there is a service being given to the people of Australia. We agree to stand as candidates and to take with that the obligation of becoming representatives in return for political funding. If we are elected, we carry out that obligation; if we are not elected, we have taken that risk and are discharged from that duty. But there is a duty, and that is why we have electoral funding. In many ways, that duty is analogous to the duty of the potato farmer not to grow potatoes when she has made that commitment. I will move on. I would appreciate the minister furnishing further information. I realise that his officers have had just the dinner break to answer these questions. I would have thought the minister would have been on top of the issue. I apologise to the officers and I hope they enjoy dinner later in the evening.
What I want to ask the minister, because it is very germane to this amendment, is: why is it that the bill enables religious organisations, including priests and ministers, to disregard internal transactions within their organisations for GST purposes but does not allow other charities and other non-government organisations to do the same thing? ",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—Other charities can group as well. That is the advice I have received. It is true I am not entirely au fait with the Tasmanian potato adjustment scheme. You have found a chink in my armour. You have spotted that and driven very hard on it. But I am forever thirsting after knowledge, like you, and I will provide you with information on that. It is not a matter of our resisting your questions. In each case there are general principles and those principles are then applied to particular circumstances. It is not a matter for us; it is a matter for the tax office. In relation to the grouping arrangements and the churches, my understanding is that the charities also have grouping provisions. I think this government has bent over backwards to ensure that charities are in every way reasonably assisted to carry out their very important work.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-26,"—I thought it appropriate, having listened to the debate carefully on the amendment at hand, to put on the record the Democrats' position on it and then Senator Brown can continue with his seeking further information from the minister. The amendment itself relates to the definition of a gift deductible entity and seeks to remove political parties from being gift deductible entities. The Democrats do not see a particular reason why this amendment needs to be made. It does not appear to us that the gift deductible entity provisions provide political parties with a particularly huge benefit. Indeed, our federal Treasurer, who is a former university lecturer in taxation, has not been able to find much benefit in the provisions over and above those benefits that are provided to all not-for-profit associations. Political parties might not be everybody's idea of wonderfully cuddly organisations that they want to clasp to their bosoms, nevertheless they are an important part of our democratic process and I am sure no senator here would suggest that we should not have political parties. Political parties are a not-for-profit association and they are also a gift deductible entity under the current provisions and have been for many years. But even so, as I say, there is no particularly huge benefit for political parties here in the Democrats' view with the arrangements as they currently stand because for a gift deductible entity to access GST free treatment the service has to be non-commercial, which means that the good has to be sold for less than 50 per cent of its market value or 75 per cent of its total cost.
I do not know how fundraising is organised with other parties or Senator Brown's party but when the Democrats run a fundraiser we do try to make money on it. Sometimes we fail but that is our aim. That usually means selling goods for more than they cost and usually much more than their market value. Selling for less than cost is not fundraising, it is charity, so it is of little benefit to any political party. The principal fundraising option for political parties is donations and donations are not taxable supplies whether they are to a charity, a gift deductible entity or a not-for-profit organisation or even a for-profit organisation because there is no consideration. Even if there were consideration, some promise or something tangible in return such as attendance at a corporate seminar, it would make no difference to the corporation whether the supplier was taxable or not. It is liable for GST, the corporation claims a GST amount as an input tax credit. If it is not taxable, and it is only not taxable if it is sold for less than 75 per cent of cost or 50 per cent of market value, then it is the same outcome. So we do not see, given that political parties are and have been gift deductible entities for many years, any reason to exclude them in this particular way. It does not provide a major benefit and it just maintains consistency of treatment of non-profit organisations. 
It is worth emphasising in terms of the broader question of public funding that has been considered at some length in this chamber that the Democrats are a strong supporter of public funding. We supported its introduction. Indeed, we were pivotal in its introduction. I think it would not have come into being without the support of the Democrats back in, if I remember rightly, 1983. We believe that is an important component of ensuring or reducing the dependence of political parties on corporate donations and donations more widely. It obviously does not remove that dependence entirely but it provides some measure of preventing a complete dependence on that and some of the dangers that go hand in hand with that. So we have always been strong supporters of public funding as a party and we will continue to take that position. I do not see the value in any sort of approach which undermines or seeks to undermine public funding or suggests in some way or another it is a bad thing. I think it is a good thing, it is an appropriate thing, it is transparent and people can see how much money is provided and can see the formula under which it is provided. From my point of view, whilst it might not be a nice, popular position to take, I would prefer to be defending public funding at every opportunity. The Democrats are concerned at approaches that seek to denigrate public funding and the important role it plays in our electoral system and the electoral process.
In talking to the broader parts of the bill and the other aspects that seek to alleviate some of the issues relating to the new tax treatment and their impact on non-profit organisations, again I would go back to the point I made earlier today: it really does not matter whether one is a supporter of the GST or the new tax system coming in; that decision was made a year ago and the task now is to ensure that it operates in as effective a way as possible and in a way that has minimal impact on the effectiveness of non-profit organisations in particular. That certainly is a strong concern of mine and it was even before the decision was made for the GST to be implemented.
But a number of the changes contained in this broader bill, particularly those relating to not-for-profit and gift deductible entities, have come about as a specific consequence of there being groups such as the Charities Consultative Committee, which was set up basically on the initiative of, and with a strong push from, the Democrats. Many of these positive changes which alleviate the potential impact of the new tax arrangements on not-for-profit organisations have stemmed directly from the Democrats' involvement. I think this is a point worth emphasising: many of the things in the broader bill, many of these changes—indeed, some that Senator Brown quite reasonably has been seeking further clarification on—have occurred as a direct result of the input from that committee, which has fed concerns straight through from the whole wide gamut of organisations that come under that label of `not-for-profit organisations'.
There are a lot of broader anomalies with taxation treatment—not specifically with GST, but with the whole tax system and the way that interacts with not-for-profit organisations, charities and PBIs. The Democrats repeatedly have called for, and drawn attention to the need for, reassessment of how those different organisations fit into those categories. We believe that we need to move forward and reconsider the way we define and treat charities under tax and other laws. It is based on a definition that originated I think some 400 years ago. We are pleased that the government has also—again, as a result of Democrat urgings—agreed to initiate a process to completely review that. That will, I think, bring up a lot of issues, and not just in terms of the specific area of the tax act that we are considering tonight but a whole lot of other areas—fringe benefits tax, tax deductibility for donations, the works. A lot of anomalies exist there at the moment, and the Democrats are pleased that they are on the way to being considered and, hopefully, in the course of time, addressed. 
Whilst it is not a major anomaly in the scheme of things, if the amendment at hand were to be passed, it would generate an anomaly under the existing tax act arrangements. Given that it does not provide any particular extra windfall benefits for political parties but simply enables consistency of treatment, I do not see any reason for it. Political parties are not exempt from the GST under all aspects; it is simply in terms of the section of the act that this amendment relates to. Political party membership fees, for example, are subject to GST. So it is not an issue of political parties seeking some special treatment and exemption from the GST across the board. It is simply a matter of the arrangements being in place to apply uniformly to gift deductible entities.
For that reason, the Democrats do not see any particular benefit in this amendment being passed. While we recognise that it presents some nice opportunities for making a political point, if you like, in terms of actually getting a reasonable policy outcome we are not convinced of the need for it. Hence, we will not be supporting it.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-26,"—Senator Bartlett is totally wrong. If I have ever heard an argument turned on itself, he just gave it. The senator has said that the Democrats do not see any particularly huge benefit to political organisations being classified as charities—which is what we are talking about—so why support the amendment that I have brought forward?
Senator Bartlett—through you, Chair—the fact is that political parties are not charities. There is a dividing line in this legislation between charities and other community organisations such as Little Athletics right through to CWAs and environment groups. Charities get special treatment, but political parties are not charities and should not get that special treatment. Senator Bartlett said, `Well, it doesn't give political parties a particularly huge benefit.' That is all the more reason why we should make sure that we are not voting for legislation which gives our political parties an edge by classifying ourselves essentially as charities when we are not.
This is not just a political point scoring exercise. It is wrong for political parties to be classified as charities to escape, even marginally, an obligation to pay tax that all other community groups have to pay. It is wrong. The Democrats are wrong. The government is wrong. If the Labor Party votes against this amendment—and I hope it will not—it would be wrong too.
Let me add—because this is the right time to do so—that we all have a pecuniary interest in this matter. I am declaring mine at this stage in the debate. I say that because it does make a difference to both our own personal pockets in terms of whether post-election funding is GSTed or not, and it does make a difference to the political entities that we represent as to whether we are classified as charities or not. I reiterate: it is quite wrong for us to be classified as charities when we are not.
I also say to the minister that, within charities, there are particular advantages to religious organisations in the way that they are able to group and avoid the GST as against other charitable organisations. If I am wrong there, I would like the minister to say, `No, there are no different circumstances pertaining to religious organisations in the legislation.'
These are important matters. I am very disappointed that, as a general rule in politics, we do not stand back and be fair and objective about these matters. I feel very strongly about this amendment. I remind the committee that the amendment simply makes sure that, at the end of the definition of `gift-deductibility entity', the following words are added: `provided that the entity is not a political party that is registered under Part XI of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918'. That is so a political party is not seen as a charity. I would just like to ask the minister again if he could make the committee aware—because this is the implication he gave—of any differences in this legislation as far as religious organisations are concerned compared with other non-government organisations? ",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title> In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-26,"—I think there are some special arrangements simply because they have a very different structure, but my understanding is that the arrangements are broadly similar. They may have special structures that do not apply elsewhere, and the tax office has to look at those to see what is fair and reasonable. There are grouping provisions for charities and religious organisations. The advice I have received is that they are broadly similar and just reflect the different nature of the bodies. The other thing that Senator Brown said is that political parties should not be treated as charities. The point I want to make is that they are not. They are classified as tax deductible entities, which they are.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-06-26,"—The government confirmed in the House of Representatives last week that it lacks compassion for, and interest in, the position of employees. The issue of employee entitlements is important, and any sensible measure which will improve the position of employee entitlements should be considered. The government just slammed the amendment proposed the by Labor Party, and supported by the Democrats, as an amendment which would `absolutely cripple corporate Australia', to quote the minister.
The government does not care about improving the position of employee entitlements. The government's Corporations Law Amendment (Employee Entitlements) Bill 2000 does very little to protect employee entitlements. The government has been dragged kicking and screaming to where it is with this bill. When company insolvencies such as Cobar and Woodlawn and others occurred, the Labor Party was here in parliament calling for workers to receive their just and fair entitlements and for those entitlements to be protected. Despite its promises, it was not until National Textiles that this government felt it had to act. Even then, the amendments in this bill have not been backdated. The corporate treachery in that incident will go unchecked. It is no wonder why that is when the Prime Minister's brother is involved. The government's refusal to accept this amendment is about ensuring that its corporate mates can continue restructuring their businesses so as to deny workers their entitlements. However, the government hides behind this obvious truth by saying that the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee is examining the issue of corporate groups and nothing should be done until that committee has reported. 
The amendment that was proposed by the Labor Party and supported by the Democrats is sensible. It is about doing what is just. The amendment provides that a court would only make a contribution order if it is just. The Labor Party and Senator Murray for the Democrats provided cogent arguments previously in the Senate as to why such an amendment is necessary. However, the Labor Party will not let the government lie on this matter and mislead the Australian public. The subject matter of this bill is too important. The Labor Party will not be insisting on its amendments today. The Labor Party is concerned about workers. It is committed to ensuring that employee entitlements are safe. The Labor Party wants this bill to become law as soon as possible so that the little protection it affords to workers can take effect. The Labor Party will not prevent those protections becoming law. 
The Labor Party will not, however, be resting on this issue. Unlike this government, it is an issue upon which the Labor Party will always be vigilant. In estimates I asked the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee when its discussion paper on corporate groups may be finalised. The committee was told that it would be finalised within weeks. Last Monday I received the report of CASAC. I am a little surprised. The report is dated May 2000. Yet in estimates on 31 May 2000 I was told that the report was not yet finalised. I will be seeking an explanation on that date of this report. The Labor Party will be examining that report and will be commenting on it. In particular, I will be examining the report to see how CASAC responds to the situations which the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities and its inquiries into this bill were advised of. I will want to know how CASAC recommends the Corporations Law deals with situations where assets of one business are spread amongst several companies so as to avoid the obligations an employer owes to an employee. I will want to know how CASAC recommends the Corporations Law deals with the sort of corporate skulduggery that took place in the Patricks affair. 
I have only been able to make a cursory examination of the CASAC report. However, my initial reaction is one of disappointment. The CASAC report does not appear to have closely examined the particular situation of employees in corporate insolvencies. Employees should not be the ultimate carrier of business risk. That is changing the nature of the employment contracts. Employees often lack the ability to diversify their income. They rely solely on the wages and the redundancy payments owed to them to live. The position of employee entitlements requires specific and further consideration. I am not satisfied at this point in time by CASAC's conclusion that this bill will remedy the situation facing employees who lose their entitlements in a corporate restructure. It seems a poor rationale for CASAC not to recommend contribution orders by relying on what this bill purports to provide for the protection of employee entitlements. The report does, however, rebut some of the criticisms made by Minister Hockey of the amendment proposed by Labor and supported by the Democrats. New Zealand introduced contribution orders in 1980. Case law on the type of provision proposed in the amendment has been developed in that country, which will provide some guidance to business in Australia on how such a provision works. Some of that case law is discussed in the CASAC report. I urge the minister to read closely pages 159 to 161 of the CASAC report. 
The Labor Party believes the government has overstated the protection to employee entitlements that will be afforded by this bill. That is why the Labor Party moved its amendment. However, the bill does provide some protection and the Labor Party will not delay its implementation. Minister Hockey, in a letter to me, said that concerns about asset stripping are addressed in the bill both in the new offence which prohibits persons from deliberately entering into transactions for the purpose of avoiding payment of employee entitlements and by the expansion of the insolvent trading rules to include uncommercial transactions. Let us put the minister to the test. Let us see how effective those provisions are. Let us see whether the incidence of corporate restructuring, which currently threatens employee entitlements, declines when this bill is passed. Let us hope the minister is correct. The issue of employee entitlements is serious. Employees should not find themselves in a vulnerable position—find their entitlements are lost due to corporate restructures, corporate restructures that are often done without the knowledge of the employees. The Labor Party will continue to monitor the issue of employee entitlements and will be examining ways which enable employees to feel safe, to know that their entitlements are protected. Let us hope the government feels the same way too, especially if this bill does not deliver what the government is promising it will.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-06-26,"—The Australian Democrats will be insisting on these amendments. I am speaking on behalf of the Democrats today and, in particular, Senator Andrew Murray. The amendment to which we refer was moved by my colleague Senator Murray at least twice in the past two years, and both he and I have discussed this issue before in this place. The first time the Democrats moved this amendment was in May 1998, and on that occasion we received the support of the Australian Labor Party. Unfortunately, on that occasion when the House of Representatives rejected the amendment, as it has done today, the Labor Party in the Senate did not bring itself on that occasion to insist on the amendment. I note that Senator Conroy has said that the minister is to be put to the test. We join him in putting that test or challenge to the minister, but I say to Senator Conroy that we are also putting the Labor Party on notice today. We are putting you to the test and we hope that perhaps you will reconsider and join us in insisting on this very important amendment. 
The fundamental difference in the debate today from that that we have had previously is that the Labor Party is responsible for this amendment. You actually initiated this amendment, and we see that as perhaps even more reason that you should insist on the amendment today. So, while I acknowledge in the chamber the work of the Labor Party and certainly the comments made by Senator Conroy in his earlier statements in relation to making related companies liable for the debts of insolvent companies in their group, we think it would be nice if you had a bit more gumption and supported us in this debate in insisting on the amendment. The second time the Australian Democrats moved this amendment was in June 1998, and at that time we did not gain any Labor support, as I recall. So, firstly, the Democrats moved the amendment and the Labor Party on that occasion concurred but would not insist on the amendment. The second time round the Democrats again moved the amendment but the Labor Party did not support the amendment. Now, finally, the Labor Party moved the amendment with support of the Australian Democrats but now is not insisting on it.
I do acknowledge the arguments that were put forward by Senator Conroy on behalf of the Labor Party as to why they are not doing that. Certainly, the Democrats appreciate the Labor Party's concern about delaying the passage of a bill which has some potential to benefit employees. But, after careful consideration, when the Democrats looked through the practical benefits that employees will derive from this bill in its unamended form and compared them with the benefits that employees would gain if the amendment were passed, you can understand why we are taking the stance that we have adopted today, and that is to insist upon the amendment. The debate to which Senator Conroy referred, the debate about the events that transpired during the Patrick dispute, is one that we have had many times in this chamber. I have to say that I like the terminology of `corporate skulduggery'. Senator Conroy, I recognise that that is your copyright.
—I've got a new speechwriter!
—He has got a new speechwriter, he interjects. We have seen some more anti-worker skulduggery in the parliament today and I refer, of course, to Mr Reith's further, open attack on workers in relation to secret ballots, one that the Democrats have firmly and resolutely rejected on a number of occasions. Today, of course, Senator Meg Lees has put out another statement in relation to that anti-worker statement by Reith. But I digress—although it is all related to how workers and employees are treated in this country, especially in a conservative government era. We have had the debate about Patrick, but I state quite confidently on behalf of our party that, if we had had a provision in law like the one that we are currently debating, there would have been far less uncertainty and concern about the ability of Patrick's former employees to recover their entitlements than there was at that time. The labour hire companies to which the employees were transferred would have been related companies, and it would have been open to a judge to make the principal company—the one with the money and the assets—liable for amounts owed to employees. Under the unamended version of this bill, it would have to be argued that one of the intentions of the directors in transferring employees to a labour hire company was to deprive them of their entitlements. But what if the directors were simply to argue that ordinary commercial arrangements were behind their desire to transfer their employees? It is a rhetorical question, but it is one which results in this bill giving only a very small amount of solace to any employees that might find themselves in similar circumstances to those employees of Patrick's. 
I am also aware of the statements that have been made by the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation in the House of Representatives, particularly in relation to this amendment. One of his concerns was that it would take years for the courts to build a body of case law in respect of this amendment. If that were a legitimate reason for not amending laws generally, then obviously we would all spend a lot less time in this chamber. On a daily basis we amend laws which require judicial interpretation to finally settle their meaning. Of course, we do not go around deliberately making ambiguous law, but it will invariably be the case that laws made in this place will be subject to judicial interpretation. So I do not think that any legislator—or any senator, in particular—should shy away from our role in furthering public policy, simply because there may be some matters which the courts will need to resolve. The Democrats have also taken note of the House of Representatives' reasons for not agreeing to this amendment. One of the comments is:
The amendment made to the bill bears little relation to the protection of employee entitlements.
Well, I think it is a good thing that the misleading and deceptive conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act do not apply within this parliament, otherwise Professor Fels would be talking to a few people about that statement. I have already outlined the probable consequences of this amendment in, say, the Patrick circumstances: this bill would allow employees—who are creditors just like other suppliers—to seek the payment of their entitlements from companies related to their employer. If a court thought it just to make an order for contribution, then the employee entitlements would be paid. It is as simple as that. 
To make a statement such as `The amendment ... bears little relation to the protection of employee entitlements' is simply an attempt by this government to play down the significance of what they are doing. This amendment was actually recommended back in 1988 by the Law Reform Commission. Today, it saddens the Australian Democrats that something which has the potential to benefit not just employees but creditors generally has still not been implemented 12 years later. I emphasise that this amendment would benefit not only employees but creditors. I do not mean to generalise too widely, but it is fair to say that, when a corporation becomes insolvent and can afford to return only a couple of cents in each dollar to creditors, large business does not suffer to anywhere near the extent that small business does. Large businesses have the ability to provide for bad debts, in general, and they can write those debts off as the need arises. It is true that large businesses still suffer, but small businesses—particularly ones which are reliant on a small number of larger companies for most of their income—can simply be wiped out if one of their corporate debtors becomes insolvent.
What I am alluding to is that this amendment would significantly benefit not only employees but small businesses in their ability to recover bad debts which may arise out of insolvency. This government preaches a lot about being pro small business, and I hope that small business owners are aware of what the government is doing in relation to this amendment today, just as I am hoping that trade union members and workers are aware of what the Labor Party is doing in this chamber. Again, I acknowledge their reasons for not supporting the amendment, but the Democrats have concluded that those reasons are not good enough, considering the enormous potential benefit that we believe exists if we should pass this amendment today. For that reason, we will be insisting on this amendment. ",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT (EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-26,"—I firstly congratulate the Australian Labor Party for taking what is a sensible decision on this. We made it very clear when this legislation came through the Senate that, if they were to insist on this, it would deprive workers of a significant increase in the protection which they will get once this passes into law. I would say that the Democrats' position on this is a reflection of the fact that Senator Andrew Murray is overseas doing a very important job in Zimbabwe at the moment and that, had Senator Murray been here, he probably would have advised his colleagues to allow this reform through.
—I can't wait for that personal explanation from Senator Murray!
—It would be out of character for Senator Murray to do so, but it would be very much out of character for him to join in the short-sighted political chicanery which is going on in that corner of the Senate while he is away. It is a stunt that the Democrats can pull off only because Labor have decided on this occasion that they want to support the improvement of rights for workers. They have made a sensible decision. I do not want to tempt Senator Conroy to change his mind because I have, for the first time in about 500 days, given him credit for something.
—Why did we insist last time when Senator Murray was in charge of it?
—Because it is a costless decision. You know that if a few senators down in that corner make a decision like that you can then go out and try to get trade unionists to support your party at the expense of the Labor Party. You can go out and create a point of difference between you and the Labor Party. It is a very cheap exercise for you. You know that this legislation will go through. But what Senator Stott Despoja's contribution shows is that she does not understand the amendment that she supported. The reality is that the government's amendment makes it very clear that, for the first time in decades, the activity that is abhorred by this government, clearly abhorred by the opposition in their support for this legislation, of shifting assets so that employees cannot be paid their entitlements is something that is targeted by this legislation but is undermined by the amendment that Senator Stott Despoja and her colleagues are seeking to make. It is in fact undermined. They do not want to believe that. They run this amendment up the mast every time they have an opportunity to do so, but they do not do the homework involved in ensuring that the amendments that they move actually improve the position of employees. The amendment that they have moved—and they are again insisting on—will actually undermine the scheme. It will undermine certainty. It will require decades of court interpretation.
If Senator Stott Despoja takes the time to read the amendment—I am sure she has not, because she could not possibly make the claims for it that she makes if she reads the amendment—if she reads the explanatory memorandum to the bill and if she bothers to read the CASAC report, she will realise that this undermines the position of employees in a way that no senator who purported to support employees' rights would do. The government's legislation will do just that. It flies in the face of years of inaction by previous governments in this area, it is a significant improvement to the Corporations Law in this regard and it builds on the insolvent trading provisions that are already there which make it unlawful for companies who are insolvent to shift assets away from existing entitlements. With those words, I commend my motion.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT (EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-06-26,"—As a senator interjected, Senator Ian Campbell cannot even win graciously, and I am sorry for that. But I do rise on behalf of my absent colleague, because I think Senator Murray will take great offence to the suggestion that not only is he not committed to this amendment but also he is not committed to insisting on this amendment, as he has done before. This has been a matter of discussion over many years in the Democrat party room; at least since 1998 since Senator Murray has been representing our concerns in this portfolio and I have been representing our concerns as the employment spokesperson. Once again I emphasise the fact that the Democrats acknowledge that there is potential for employees under the government's unamended legislation. We acknowledge that, but we think we can go one step better. We are sorry that Senator Ian Campbell's response was bordering on vitriolic and quite blatantly patronising. But again on behalf of my colleague Senator Andrew Murray, who has worked on this issue for a number of years, I point out that he supports very much the insistence on this amendment. I think he would be outraged that the government have tried unsuccessfully to paint him as supporting their position in this circumstance.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-26,"—I will be talking about the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Amendment Bill 2000, and by simply reciting the title of this bill one can see immediately that it is an amendment bill. The original bill arose as a consequence of the slapdash arbitrary arrangement made between the government and the Australian Democrats which gave rise to the GST. Now that legislation has gone through, what do we find? We find that, with just on 2,000 amendments to the GST legislation, the government—one presumes on this occasion, with the consent of the original architects of this legislation, the Australian Democrats—are moving to amend the legislation before it has even had a chance to take effect. Such is the organisation, such is the planning, such is the forethought, such is the preparation and such is the consideration of the government and the Democrats in their rush to the headline that they support the GST that it just so happens they have overlooked a number of quite important and significant elements to their own legislation. But more of that in a moment. I want to spend some time in my speech in the second reading debate to focus on exactly what the problem is between the government and the Democrats on this legislation.
In terms of the legislation itself, this bill proposes to significantly amend the administration and compliance regime for the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme—the initials are offensive to the eye, but they are DAFGS—for on-road transport, agreed as part of the GST deal between the government and the Democrats, as I have said. The amendments not only deal with drafting errors but also contain a significant policy change that represents a further roll-back of the tax package. The background to this legislation is that the Democrats negotiated the current DAFGS with the government as part of the deal to let the GST through. The deal slightly limits grants availability to some vehicles. This was originally proposed to be those vehicles weighing more than 3.5 tonnes. The Democrats, in an earth-shattering amendment, insisted on and got that increased to 4.5 tonnes. Vehicles weighing less than 4.5 tonnes do not qualify. Those weighing between 4.5 and 20 tonnes qualify for travel, except where this is exclusively within an urban area—which is still not defined, I have to say—and those weighing over 20 tonnes qualify completely.
Labor did not oppose the original bill because it constituted compensation for the transport industry which had a GST imposed on it. However, we did point out the inevitable anomalies that will rise wherever the urban conurbation boundaries are drawn. In addition, we criticised the Democrats on environmental grounds for agreeing to a scheme which subsidised diesel use in the cities as long as the journey started outside the conurbation. It has to be said that one of the considerations here was to cut fuel emissions from fossil-fuel burning transport—and it did so to some extent within the city conurbation—but if the journey started outside the conurbation for the urban area, the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil-fuel burning were somehow granted an exemption from pollutive purposes by the Australian Democrats and were allowed to continue. But the conurbations, of course, are artificial boundaries yet to be revealed by the government and they raise a whole range of contradictions and complexities of their own. 
I will go to a general outline of the proposals. As I have said, this bill amends the 1999 bill to achieve significant roll-back and to deal with administrative problems which have arisen before the scheme has even begun. The amendments insert certain entitlement provisions to do at least three things, as the explanatory memorandum says:
·	extend eligibility to primary production businesses and to contractors carrying passengers or goods on behalf of primary production businesses, operating within the metropolitan areas;
·	extend eligibility to buses using alternative fuels operating in metropolitan areas; and
·	extend eligibility to emergency vehicles of over 4.5 tonnes gross vehicle mass operating on public roads in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas ...
The government has approximated the financial impact of this bill to be $17 million for the financial year 2000-01, and it will presumably increase over time.
Let me pause now in my speech in this second reading debate to indicate to the government that, in the committee stages of this legislation, I will be asking for an indication of what the out years costs of this legislation will be. In addition, significant amendments have been made to many provisions to correct errors and anomalies; there is a list of at least six of those. I do not propose to go through those in any detail now. 
I will go back in time by about a year to the occasion when the Australian Democrats and the Prime Minister reached for the headline that the GST would be allowed through. They paid more attention to the spotlight on them, to the whirring of the television cameras and to the their own lines that the GST would now apply in Australia than they did to the detail of their package. What is notorious about this package is that, after the headline `We have agreement' and after the headline `Democrats are in bed with the coalition on the GST', they said, `Oops! One of the things we have to pay attention to is: what is the detail in the scheme we have now agreed to on gas emissions for fossil fuel burning motor vehicles?' and `Can we somehow paper over the differences and the contradictions between us by cobbling together a scheme'—which, by its very nature, is a bit like a drafting committee trying to design a horse and coming up with a camel—`so that we can come to a situation in which we, the Australian Democrats, can pretend'—emphasis on that word `pretend'—`to meet our environmental considerations and appeal to those who back us with an environmental concern?' And, on behalf of the government: `Can we paper over our contradictions with the Australian Democrats and pretend'—emphasis on the word `pretend'—`that we have met the concerns of rural and primary producers in terms of not interfering with their production, while allowing the Democrats face on the environmental concerns?' That was the nature of negotiations. No wonder it took a while to come to a deal on the nature of the legislation. In many respects, it is a chalk and cheese amalgam which does not actually work. That is why it is so confusing, and that is why the government—now that we are four days short of the application of the GST—rush through the Senate a further amendment to the original bill. They never got it right in the first place. That is why it is not surprising it is has taken so long.
Let me illustrate the point I have made by turning now to Bills Digest No. 191 1999-2000 and reading into the Hansard what the author of the examination of this bill has to say about it in his concluding comments. It makes salutary reading and illustrates in more detail the broad points that I have made. Under the heading `Concluding comments', the Bills Digest says: 
As noted, new section 10AC(2) extends eligibility for the grant to buses using alternative fuel while carrying on an `enterprise' irrespective of whether the service is in metropolitan or non-metropolitan areas. Thus commercial bus operators using alternative fuel will benefit while operators using diesel will have an incentive to switch to alternative fuel. This could have environmental benefits in metropolitan areas. While the intention of the legislation seems to be to ensure that private bus operators will be able to claim the grant, the question arises whether `enterprise' also encompasses organisations, such as State transport authorities, that are potentially large users of alternative fuels.
The DAFGS scheme has been criticised as complicated to administer and likely to give rise to unintentional errors and fraudulent claims. The extension of the scheme to incorporate new categories of fuel users will further complicate the scheme's administration.
It is not clear, on economic efficiency grounds, why primary production in metropolitan areas should be subsidised through the DAFGS scheme. Increasing industry assistance, especially when it has no obvious justification and is not subject to independent review, generally runs against the thrust of policy of both major political parties, which is to reduce assistance. While the magnitude of the implicit subsidy may not be great, the extension of the scheme to primary production in metropolitan areas places it in a privileged situation relative to other industries in metropolitan areas, and hence is a move away from a `level playing field'. On the other hand, to exclude primary production in metropolitan areas from eligibility would create an inconsistency in the scheme in that primary production in non-metropolitan areas would be eligible for grants while primary production in metropolitan areas would not be eligible.
In the down-beat language of the authors of the report, that is a scathing criticism of the complications and the loopholes that this legislation opens up. As a consequence of that, while we will not want to vote down this legislation, because it does represent some degree of compensation, we will want to move an amendment to the second reading motion. I understand that the amendment has been circulated in the chamber, so I do not need to waste the time of the chamber by reading it into the Hansard. At the appropriate time, before I regain my seat, I will formally move the amendment that has been circulated that will make a number of important points.
Let me re-emphasise, though, what the problem is with this bill, as outlined in the down-beat, objective analysis of the authors of the Bills Digest. The Bills Digest says:
The ... scheme has been criticised as complicated to administer and likely to give rise to unintentional errors and fraudulent claims.
It just so happens, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, that it is appropriate that you should be in the chair for this because you are rightly regarded in this chamber—and I now pay my respects to you—as an expert in taxation matters and taxation law. I believe you will agree with me that one of the key principles of taxation law is that it should be simple so that people know what their tax obligations are and can simply discharge their obligations in revenue without being confused and without matters being complicated unnecessarily. This legislation confuses and complicates entitlements unnecessarily and fails the basic dictum that it ought to be simple.
The other principle, the other rock upon which taxation law is to be built—and I am sure you will agree with me on this point too, Mr Acting Deputy President—is that it has to be equitable. One of the elements of equitableness is that unintended consequences should not arise and that loopholes for avoidance should be eliminated. Again, in the down-beat language of the authors of the Bills Digest, both are opened up. What is the point of a revenue measure which, it is true, provides some advantage to primary producers but which is capable of being manipulated for the lodgment of fraudulent claims? Why do we do that? What is the point of legislation which has unintended consequences which further complicate the scheme's operation?
It is important to say that the Australian Labor Party does encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and that the Australian Labor Party would like to see the efficient and, I emphasise, economic take-up of other fuel alternatives so that industry can lower its levels of greenhouse gas emissions, which will assist us to meet our Kyoto targets and to provide a clean planet for all who live on it, including the Australians who dwell here. That issue is not in contest here. What is in contest is: is this the way to do it, is this an efficient way to do it and is this a way to do it that does not have fundamental consequences for the legislation? I think it is a ham-fisted, crabwise approach to a serious problem, one which exemplifies and is emblematic of the dilemma that the Democrats were faced with when they rushed to collude with the government to introduce the GST. They wanted the burning issue of the GST to get up no matter what, and they were prepared to crawl over their environmental constituency to get their place in the television spotlight to announce the deal. Did they ever crawl over their environmental constituency! They will run around Australia saying, `This bill is a Democrat achievement. This bill is a monument to the environmental goals of the Australian Democrats.' But that is a big lie. This bill will do virtually nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will not do much at all to provide an incentive for alternative fuels and to encourage people to invest in and develop economic alternatives to current fossil fuels. This bill will not meet the objectives that are set out for it. 
For those reasons, I will shortly move the opposition's second reading amendment. I draw your attention quickly to the circulated document, which has in it the words `with less than two weeks to go before the commencement of the new scheme'. It should say `with less than four days to go before the commencement of the new scheme'. I seek to make that correction. I now move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate condemns the Government for:
	(1)	the uncertainty generated in the transport industry through the introduction of significant new amendments to the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme with less than four days to go before the commencement of the new Scheme;
	(2)	not disclosing the powers for the Commissioner of Taxation to stop, detain and search vehicles prior to the last election; and
	(3)	imposing a complex new layer of administration on transport operators in connection with the Scheme, in addition to the new compliance burden associated with the GST”.
It is a pity that we are going to have a GST at all. The Australian Labor Party stand foursquare and strong in opposing the introduction of the GST. In question time after question time this week and in previous weeks, as we run towards the deadline of midnight Friday, the change of the calendar to 1 July, we have had government spokesmen on the back foot in here during question time trying to pretend that somehow the Australian Labor Party have signed on to the GST. They keep ranting and raving about that as if it were the truth. The most unreliable source of what the Australian Labor Party policy is is the government, and those allegations are of course starkly untrue. They need to say it to reassure themselves, and they need to say it to quell community concern about the GST and pretend that there is somehow an under-the-table consensus between the political majors in this country. There is not. I now emphasise it once again: the Australian Labor Party oppose a GST.
It is also worth remarking that this GST has been so craftily constructed that when Australia crosses the bridge on midnight on 30 June from the current tax system to the GST and the new tax system, the nature of the new system is such that the government has blown up the bridge behind us and made it very difficult to ever get back. When this government criticises the Labor Party about not disclosing what we intend to do with the roll-back, it smugly knows that it has blown up the return route so that you cannot get back easily. The Labor Party have to build a new bridge back to a better tax system, which we propose to do and which we will announce at an appropriate time before the next election. But you cannot go back very easily, so roll-back is a difficult and complicated thing.
We say clearly to the people of Australia: `Vote with us, support us at the next election and we will ameliorate the worst features of this GST and eventually roll it back.' We cannot say exactly how until we get control of the Treasury and see what the nature of the 2001 budget is, the degree of the surplus and what other flexibility we have in the system, but we have a very firm commitment to roll it back. If we carry this bill tonight with the amendment that I have proposed, it will be a commitment which will once again put the spotlight on the perfidy of the deal done with the Australian Democrats.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-06-26,"—It is my pleasure to support Senator Cook's second reading amendment to the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Amendment Bill 2000. As you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, I have a particular interest in this legislation, as I have been following the gyrations that have occurred since the government and the Democrats did their deal last year in relation to the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme. As I recall, we dealt with this late last year. As my colleagues pointed out to the government, we felt there were a number of anomalies that needed to be exposed to make sure that people understood what sort of an administrative nightmare is now about to be imposed on not just the road freight industry but also consumers and suppliers. As I look at this Bills Digest, I am still not all that clear as to whether we have finalised in particular the definition of a `journey'.
When the Democrats and the government made their arrangement for this scheme last year, it was done on the basis that there were two divisions within the country. There were to be non-metropolitan areas and metropolitan areas. In the non-metropolitan areas, all vehicles over 4½ tonnes would be eligible to make an application for this grant. We believe the metropolitan areas were defined more on the political sensitivity of the government's electorates than on any consistent or logical basis. When we had a look at the situation, Senator Conroy was able to outline in the Senate estimates how ridiculous some aspects of the situation were. We still need to have a definition of a journey.
Even with the definition of journeys in the legislation, we will still have a situation where, if a transport company bases itself in Queanbeyan in New South Wales—and this is for vehicles between 4½ tonnes and 20 tonnes—and if it does all its deliveries in or around the Canberra and southern New South Wales region, it will be able to claim the full diesel fuel rebate. However, if that company is based in Fyshwick, as a number of the transport companies are, and if it does its deliveries around the Canberra area—which is in the metropolitan conurbation—it will not attract any diesel fuel rebate at all. So there will be a massive cost advantage to the operator in Queanbeyan as opposed to the ones in Fyshwick. I would suggest that people in Fyshwick will be looking at the leases in that area and moving outside the Canberra conurbation.
The reason for that is that Eden-Monaro is a nice marginal seat, one that will have to be held by the government at the next election. I do not think they will hold it. But that is the reason why those people have been encouraged. However, once the operators and the work force have to move out of the Canberra region into Queanbeyan, they might feel less favourably disposed towards the government and the move that they will have forced on them. Similarly, you have a situation up on the north coast of New South Wales and the south coast of Queensland where the Tweed region does attract the rebate yet the Gold Coast region does not.
—Would there be marginal seats near there?
—We have yet another regional MP that has not stuck up for their constituency: Larry Anthony, the member for Richmond. Poor young Larry is going to have a situation presented to him at the next federal election like the Fyshwick-Queanbeyan conundrum. People up there will not be forgetting him, least of all the caravan park residents. So we still have the difficulty between the metropolitan and the non-metropolitan areas.
—Tell us about Geelong and Ballarat.
—Senator Conroy, you may be more familiar with Ballarat and Geelong than I am. I know they are football teams. But the definitions of conurbations and non-metropolitan areas are still quite clearly inconsistent and are still unfair to a number of operators. But it gets even worse with the definition of journeys in the Bills Digest. We may be able to clear this up in the committee stage. If an operator came from outside a metropolitan area, was less than 20 tonnes and made deliveries—and, indeed, pick-ups—in that metropolitan area and then went back to the non-metropolitan area, I am not sure whether they would be able to make the full application for the rebate. Similarly, if it goes the other way—a person goes from the metropolitan area to the non-metropolitan area but makes a pick-up or delivery before leaving the metropolitan area, does some pick-ups and deliveries outside it and then comes back and does more pick-ups and deliveries—I am not sure whether they will attract the rebate or where and when they will. 
In Senator Cook's amendment, he has mentioned that we are seeking some disclosure of the powers of the Commissioner of Taxation because, as I understand it, that may be where it will end up. But it still may be a situation where you will have people being put in a position where they will be encouraged not to fill out their forms correctly. I think that will be the sad fact. 
I suppose I have been around long enough to know that, when we used to have what was called the road maintenance tax many years ago, people used to say that they were primary producers on the basis that they were carting chooks. But they were carting frozen chooks and avoided paying the road maintenance tax because they deemed themselves as primary producers. I am not sure whether or not that will be the case with this legislation—whether we will find that people carting frozen chooks are primary producers or do you need to have live chooks? Is it the same if you have hanging meat or bacon that has been sealed? This may be cleared up in the committee stage. But from the experience that occurred in the period when we had a road maintenance tax, we used to have a situation where people were encouraged to avoid their taxation liabilities.
Another particular aspect concerning buses has not been addressed. We have a situation where the legislation extends eligibility for the use of alternative fuel to businesses using buses on public roads. That to me does not suggest that we are talking about diesel; it suggests that we are talking about alternative fuels. Most people who have an idea about some of the alternative fuels that have been suggested say that the CNG used on Sydney buses is not regarded as being reliable, and the Australasian Natural Gas Vehicles Council has suggested they believe that only 10 to 15 per cent of buses will ever be able to go on to that form of alternative energy.
This legislation does not clear up the situation with those buses between 4½ and 20 tonnes—bear in mind that about 90 per cent of buses are less than 20 tonnes—where the conurbation and metropolitan/non-metropolitan situation comes in. For instance, where I live out in Western Sydney, a company called Pierce's Bus Co. up in Valley Heights is in the non-metropolitan area; whereas just five or six kilometres east in Penrith another company, Westbus, is on Mulgoa Road, which is in a metropolitan area. So Pierce's will be able to claim the rebate and Westbus will not. But, as far as I understand the definitions in the legislation, it will be worse for a company like Westbus because it will probably find itself missing out on a lot of charter or hire work. For example, with pensioners wanting to go down to Sydney Harbour for the day or school children going on an excursion, the company such as Pierce's in a non-metropolitan area will be able to claim the rebate whereas a company like Westbus will not. Once again, there will be this massive cost disadvantage to metropolitan based vehicles, and in particular public transport in metropolitan areas will be disadvantaged. This is a very difficult thing for the government to overcome. I have been advised that, as a result of their not being eligible for the rebate, on 1 July their costs will go up by 6.6 per cent and they believe that they may have to raise their fares by nine per cent. 
But, as I said, there is no real alternative to diesel. One thing Senator Cook mentioned in his address was that we are trying to look at getting around to the greenhouse emissions. I do not think anything that the government and the Democrats have proposed will at any stage lead us to this alternative fuel situation with ethanol, canola oil or something else—I do not know what else has been proposed. In America at the moment there is a fairly significant debate taking place within the Senate itself. A subcommittee on clean air within the US Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is looking at low sulfur diesel. No matter where that may end up, I might make this point: if we are going to have these cleaner or more efficient diesels, then it is going to cost money. That is the one point about this legislation that is being trumpeted all over the place; yet I have been talking to people in the industry and they do not believe there will be any significant, if any at all, reduction in freight rates. 
Last week the Australian Trucking Association released a report called Ups and downs in trucking costs: quantifying the impact of tax reform and market price movements that was prepared by economic, management and policy consultants, Tasman Asia Pacific. The reason behind the release of this report was to analyse the Bureau of Transport Economics analysis of road and rail freight rates that would come about as a result of the diesel fuel rebate. I have been talking to people in the industry this evening. They have mentioned to me a difficulty that the minister may be able to answer for me in his reply. They are still unsure whether the grant is 16c, 17c or 18c. As late as this evening I have been speaking to senior people and they are still unsure about what the grant is.
As I have said on occasions before, freight costs represent 18 to 23 per cent of what might be the total cost of a good or service. The Tasman Asia Pacific report shows quite conclusively that, if you go from a warehouse in Melbourne to a warehouse in Brisbane, they believe, the increase in the cost of a journey on the ups when the GST comes in will be $531; on the downs there will be a saving of $276. They do not believe that there will be any significant decrease in the cost of transport of goods and, in fact, as I have said on a few occasions before, my colleagues tell me they may even raise their rates by up to 4½ per cent.
I want to make one other point about the costs that will come in shortly: as has not been outlined to a large degree by the government, the National Road Transport Commission met late last year and this year has effectively increased the registration costs for B-doubles and for three- and four-axle articulated trailers. The cost for B-doubles on 1 July in most states will rise by 15 per cent, and by 30 per cent for three- and four-axle articulated trailers. Contrary to the claims by the government that the costs of freight will start to go down, in fact they are going to rise; and they are going to rise on and from 1 July. Mr Acting Deputy President, if I give you a copy of this, you will no doubt recognise immediately the obvious intention by the government to pull the wool over people's eyes about this legislation and its impact on the community.
Another particular impact which I think will be interesting for the government to wriggle out of is the pressure that there will be by the year 2002 to have new trucks as part of, I suppose, a Democrat deal. At the moment Australia has one of the oldest truck fleets in the OECD countries. I think the average age of a vehicle in Australia is 14 years. But I would like to see the Democrats and the government start to tell those single-lorry owner drivers that they are going to be forced or compelled to start to upgrade their vehicles or to purchase new vehicles, because I do not think that those fellows will have the will; I do not think that the money will be there either.
In conclusion, I would say this: in a number of the managed fleets, vehicles are kept for about five to seven years. They do not get replaced overnight. On 1 July, there will not be new trucks on the road that have paid no wholesale sales tax. They will not be there. So people have an expectation that the costs of operating a vehicle are going to go down on 1 July. As I said earlier, the actual registration costs for the articulated vehicles will rise and they will not reduce on 1 July. It will take at least two years for some vehicles to get at least some opportunities for the costs that will come as a result of the wholesale sales tax.
In conclusion, I still see there being an administrative nightmare. I think there will be a lot of pressure put on individual operators. In New Zealand, I understand, about a quarter of small business left the industry, left their jobs, whatever they were doing, as a result of trying to comply with this nightmare. I think that is what will happen and what we will see here when the impact starts to get to the people we represent. I might just conclude on this: I noticed in the paper today that one of the significant events commemorated this week is the anniversary of the commencement of the Battle of Gettysburg on 1 July 1863. I think you will find that this will be John Howard's and the Liberal Party's Gettysburg. The GST will wipe you out and we will be there to give you your requiem. ",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-06-26,"—The Democrats will be supporting this bill with some enthusiasm. It has three main provisions: firstly, the diesel and alternative fuels grants will be extended to the carriage of goods of primary producers on trucks 4½ to 20 tonnes in weight within metropolitan areas and within conurbations. It is not expected that there will be very many primary producers within these boundaries, but there will be some. We judge that it was reasonable to include this small number of primary producers, mostly grape growers, strawberry farmers and the like; and provided the diesel or alternative fuel use was for the carriage of their primary produce, it seemed to us to fit within the broad objectives of our agreement with the government.
The second provision that we are especially pleased about is the extension of the alternative fuels grants to buses. It should be remembered that the reason for the Democrats pushing for grants for the use of alternative cleaner fuels such as natural gas, LPG ethanol and the like was that the diesel excise cut would make these alternative fuels more expensive relative to diesel. The grants were designed to remove any disincentive the diesel excise cuts would have provided for the conversion of buses and trucks to gas.
One of the reasons for promoting this extension of the alternative fuels grant scheme to gas buses in metropolitan areas and conurbations is, firstly, to reduce public transport costs and, secondly, to provide greater incentives for switching over to gas. We did not support the extension of the credit to diesel for obvious reasons. We have made some headway in terms of persuading bus operators to shift across to gas but that task is not complete and, if this extension had been given to diesel, then it would have been another disincentive, if you like, to switch to gas. On that first point, I must say that the Democrats were very disappointed with the announcements of the Victorian and New South Wales state governments recently that public transport in those states would attract an increase in fares of five per cent and 8½ per cent.
As honourable senators will recall, it was our first preference to exempt public transport altogether from the GST. But, as the federal government pointed out, whether or not to absorb the GST on fares ought to be a matter for the states to consider. After all, the states are direct beneficiaries of GST collected on public transport. I would argue that, since the states will get the 10 per cent back in its entirety, the sensible thing to do would have been to absorb the GST and keep fares down—in fact, reduce them, preferably. As anyone knows who has looked at public transport issues, patronage drops when fares go up and, when patronage drops, very often services decline, leading to further drops in patronage. This is a vicious cycle that has led to places like Melbourne having transport systems that are not offering a service that encourages greater use. The decision of the Victorian state government to raise fares is even more ludicrous when we consider that it has an enormous surplus—$600 million this year.
However, this measure will at least make it cheaper for bus companies that have made the very wise decision to use alternative fuels in their buses. The figures differ depending on the kilometres travelled by buses within fleets. However, I know of a bus company in Western Australia that says it currently saves 15 per cent of its fuel costs on the buses in the fleet running on compressed natural gas. This measure will increase that saving possibly by a further 15 per cent.
Ventura Bus Lines in Oakleigh South, Victoria, is one of the bus companies that will benefit. In November this year, that company will be bringing into this country two new ethanol buses to add to its fleet. In fact, Ventura is demonstrating a very strong commitment to the environment and to reducing air pollution. Ventura was one of the bus companies that signed up to the Greenhouse Challenge here in Canberra last week. The ethanol for its buses—my colleague Senator Woodley will be very pleased to hear this—will be sourced from CSR and it will come from sugar cane produced in Sarina, Queensland. So, again, there is not only an advantage with ethanol being used in buses in metropolitan areas but there is a very distinct advantage to the cane growers of Queensland and elsewhere who will benefit from the use of this otherwise waste product being turned into a useable and clean fuel for transport. 
Other bus companies with gas buses are the National Bus Company in Melbourne; TransAdelaide, South Australia, has 160 vehicles; 48 buses run on CNG in Perth; Brisbane City Council has almost one-fifth of its fleet on gas; Sydney Buses will see 150 CNG buses delivered by September; and the New South Wales Transit Authority estimates that, over five years of service and 30 million kilometres of travel, its gas buses have produced a 20 per cent saving on greenhouse gas emissions relative to diesel.
So there are enormous advantages with switching to gas. This bill will provide an economic advantage. But we also know that gas produces very low particle emissions, and NOx values are also low. Diesel engines can only come close to such low emission values with the latest engines and exhaust gas filters or recirculation systems, and for these to work properly they need ultra low sulphur diesel, a fuel which is not even available in this country as yet. The other advantage is the fact that natural gas is indigenous; that is, we take it out of the ground here in Australia in various deposits. This means that we can, with this measure, start to make a difference to the deplorable balance of payments situation in this country. So instead of using diesel fuel, which is mostly imported from overseas, we can use gas which is local. Natural gas also has the advantage of being stable in price, unlike the fluctuations we have seen in petroleum products. Gas buses are also quieter and they are virtually odourless. So that too makes it imperative that we, in our metropolitan areas, see a switch from diesel to gas.
I have spoken at length in this place about the advantages of tighter emission standards—something that Senator Hutchins does not seem to approve of. We have now delivered those as a result of our negotiations with the government. I have also spoken at length about shifting away from our current reliance on diesel fuel to gas. The National Environment Protection Council estimates that 1,062 people die every year from diesel exposure. Also, 1.4 million Australians have asthma, as do one in five children under 12 in this country. We know that air quality is a factor in triggering asthma symptoms. In Brisbane, a study of people living within 150 metres of a transport corridor showed that particle pollution was the likely cause of health problems in the old, the young and those with respiratory or cardiovascular ailments. So this measure will add to the incentives to shift to gas and to shift to a healthier environment.
The ALP has a very strange attitude to this bill. Its second reading amendment wants to condemn the government for `the uncertainty generated in the transport industry through the introduction of new amendments'. I think the Democrats will have a great deal of difficulty supporting such a nonsensical amendment. Why would we condemn the government for putting in place a change that will reward bus companies for improving air pollution and greenhouse emissions? Not likely. The ALP also wants to condemn the government for imposing, as it calls it, `a new layer of administration on transport operators'. Again, bus operators do not have to submit to that new layer of administration. But my guess is that the savings will hugely outweigh any extra layer of administration.
Finally, I was astounded to read the shadow transport minister's speech in the second reading debate today. There, he talks about the severe problems associated with urban congestion and the need to reduce emissions in our cities, but he complains:
The minister might even investigate the tax disadvantage to employers actually supporting employees using public transport as against private vehicles. Having raised that, I say to the transport minister that he can go a lot further than he has on that issue. We have a situation where motor vehicles and car parking receive favourable treatment with respect to fringe benefits tax arrangements. If he is actually concerned about the environment and the issue of greenhouse, then there is more to be done on this front. 
I could not agree more. He continues:
I believe it is a ludicrous situation, given our irrefutable urban congestion issues, that public transport is disadvantaged in respect of tax compared with private vehicle usage.
I was astounded at these remarks because the Labor Party signed off on the business tax package without giving a thought to negotiating an amendment which could have done exactly that. The business tax package was the right vehicle to put into effect this new-found policy of the ALP, but obviously it slipped their mind at the time. It is extraordinarily hypocritical of the ALP to be complaining about the minister not doing this when they had the opportunity themselves, but of course they were in such a hurry to pass the bill, just in case the Democrats might have been in a position to get very considerable gains for the environment through this legislation.
That particular measure was one that we were very confident of winning, and it would have been very high on our list of priorities in that legislation. It was a measure, too, that public transport groups have been arguing for for many years, including the 13 years that the ALP were in government. Anyway, it is good to see that the ALP have at last found their green credentials, even if we are more likely to see them in opposition than in government. Mr Ferguson's comments will be put on file by me, so that we can remind him—should the ALP come to office some time in the future—of the ALP's new commitment to public transport.
The other provision in this bill I want to mention is the extension of the grant for diesel and alternative fuels to emergency vehicles. It is hard to find any argument against giving a break to our emergency vehicles. The CFA run on the smell of an oily rag, as it were, and it makes some sense to give them a cost advantage. Again, I would expect these vehicles to be largely on the fringes of our metropolitan areas and conurbation boundaries.
It is a pity that the ALP feel obliged to criticise the government for this bill and to complain about uncertainty. I would have thought that incremental growth in measures to protect the environment and the health of Australians, including the one in five children under 12 with asthma, was a good thing. If this means legislative change, which is welcomed by those people who are affected by it, then I think we should embrace that change.
Also, I would like make a comment to Senator Hutchins. He reminds us that the average age of our vehicles in this country is 14 years, and he considers that perhaps the owners of those vehicles should not be forced or compelled to upgrade their vehicles. Senator Hutchins, the age of our vehicles in this country is a problem for pollution in our cities. I am afraid that the time has come for us to join the rest of the world in this respect and say to trucking operators that it is no longer acceptable for dirty, black smoke to be belched out of trucks on and on into the future. I remind the ALP that, when they left office, our vehicle fuel standards in diesel tolerated sulphur at something like 10 times the amount of the UK and the US, leaving our emission standards in this country a good five years behind other OECD countries. I hope that Mr Ferguson's remarks rub off on those members in the Senate and persuade them that cleaning up the environment and, in particular, the air in our cities is an important thing to do and something that we really need to find the revenue to pay for.
Debate interrupted. ",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-06-26,"—I rise tonight to speak about one of the most appalling speeches I have ever read by a senator in this chamber in 13 years. Unfortunately, I was in meetings during Senator Conroy's contributions to the debate on Senator Faulkner's motion regarding the Greenfields Foundation last Thursday, otherwise I would have been here to protest at the ugly and, as I saw it, vicious exercise in character assassination directed against a number of individuals, and one in particular, by Senator Conroy during that debate. 
Senator Conroy consistently prostitutes the privilege of parliament for his own unsavoury ends, and I call on his party to pull him into line. On Thursday last week, Senator Conroy came into this chamber on a fairly spurious motion by Senator Faulkner, but instead of debating even that tawdry motion he chose to enter into an attack on an individual under the cowardly cloak of parliamentary privilege. He embarked on an extraordinary collection of innuendoes, allegations and insinuations. I dare him to make those comments outside this chamber, but I know he will not do it, just as he will not repeat any of the other myriad allegations that he makes in this place, just as the Labor Party will not apologise to the Baillieu family and just as the Labor Party never apologised to the late Senator Panizza for the slurs they made on his family.
—What did we say about Senator Panizza?
—You might laugh, but go back through Hansard and look at the slurs that were made about the late Senator Panizza and his family. Senator Conroy uses this chamber like a bully uses a playground. He uses it to intimidate individuals who support anyone other than the Labor Party and as a warning to others who might be interested in making a contribution to the non-Labor parties in this country.
What is the sole contribution of this senator to Australian parliamentary life? He has no policy and no ideas and has made no positive contribution to making this country a better place. Senator Conroy's sole contribution during his parliamentary career has been to descend to levels of political thuggery previously unseen in this chamber. His behaviour constitutes a warning to anyone who might have different beliefs from him: stand up for your ideas and work hard to improve your community, and Senator Conroy will slander your character, your finances and your family.
A particular target of his vitriol was Ron Walker. What is it that Senator Conroy hates the most about Ron Walker? Looking at his speech, he hates the fact that Ron Walker has made a contribution to Victoria. He hates the fact that Ron Walker has brought major events to Victoria that have resulted in thousands of jobs for workers in the state. He hates the fact that Ron Walker has brought growth and development to Victoria and has sought to make Victoria a better place. He hates the fact that Ron Walker contributed through voluntary organisations and that his time and energy as the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, in particular, made Melbourne a better place.
Without a skerrick of evidence, Senator Conroy gives the dignity of the Hansard a tawdry collection of envy driven gossip and innuendos from the gutters of Melbourne. And Senator Conroy was not alone on Thursday. I have to say that I was disappointed that, along with his mentor, the pious defender of proper practice in this place, Senator Ray, the two vicious Victorians conducted a tag team effort of slander and slur. Senator Ray has said over and over in this place that it is a coward's castle and all it takes is a few short steps to courage. That is what Senator Ray has said in here over and over. Well, Senator Ray ought to have taken a few short steps to courage with his little protege. 
—What did Michael Baume do for 10 years in this place? 
—Order!
—Slagged people from one end to the other. 
—Order! Senator Schacht, you can have an opportunity—
—That is what Senator Michael Baume did and you never raised a word against him. 
—Senator Schacht!
—It is just rank hypocrisy you are going on about, Kay.  
—You are persistently and wilfully interjecting and ignoring my calls to order. Senator Schacht, you can speak on the adjournment at an appropriate time. Senator Patterson has the call. 
—Thank you very much, Madam President. Senator Ray has said over and over that it only takes a few short steps to courage. But, no, he put his conscience in his back pocket and joined his protege in an advanced exercise in character assassination. No tactic was too low for the vipers from Victoria. Their speeches were crammed with rhetorical questions leading to outrageous insinuations, with no opportunity for their victims or, in particular, for Ron Walker to respond. Those few short steps to courage have turned out to be very long for Senator Ray. He was not game to repeat his allegations outside the chamber. I challenge both Senator Conroy and Senator Ray to make the allegations they made last Thursday outside of this place. It is all right for them to bring people into disrepute within this chamber, but they are not game enough to do it outside. You would think that after the disastrous backfire with the slurs that were made—
—He can put a statement to the Privileges Committee to correct—
—Senator Schacht, I have called you to order previously. 
—I am just explaining what the standing orders are. 
—The standing orders are to keep quiet when some else is speaking. 
—No, he can go to the Privileges Committee. 
—Order! Senator Patterson.
—I will take that interjection that Senator Schacht made that he should go to the Privileges Committee. You should not have to go to the Privileges Committee. 
—Ron Walker can put his statement to the Privileges Committee. 
—Senator Schacht, I have called you to order already during this debate and I am warning you to maintain silence. You can have the call at the appropriate time. Senator Patterson.
—Madam President, you should not have to go to the Privileges Committee. The Privileges Committee is there for the very extreme circumstances when somebody's name has been taken in vain in this place. It should not happen. It should not have to happen in this place. People should come in here when they have the facts—if they have the facts—and not use innuendo, insinuations and slander. We thought Senator Ray would have learnt from the way in which the slanderous attacks on the Baillieu family backfired. The Labor Party have never come in here and apologised and they have never come in here and apologised to the Panizza family either for what was said in this place.
—What did we say about the Panizza family? 
—Senator Schacht, it is inappropriate for you to keep shouting out as you have been doing during this contribution. You can speak at the appropriate time and answer anything that you feel needs to be answered. 
—Madam President, I rise on a point of order. All I ask is that Senator Patterson inform the Senate, via you, what we actually said about John Panizza. I cannot recollect that we ever said anything about him at all. 
—There is no point of order and now is not the time for you to be shouting out questions.
—It is amazing how people have selective memory. 
—Just remind me. 
—I suggest that Senator Schacht go back and have a look through the Hansard as to what was said. It was an issue that affected Senator Panizza quite seriously and he was quite disturbed about what was said about him. It is particularly stunning that Senator Conroy and Senator Ray chose to make these sorts of comments that they did in the very week when we had six hours of debate in the other chamber about the behaviour in this place and about what can happen to people when their names are taken in vain and what can happen to people when we use this place lightly—when there are personal attacks, vicious personal attacks, on people for their own personal ends. With his speech, Senator Conroy, the ALP senator for Victoria—and I have to say he was slandering a person who has made a major contribution to Victoria—not only demeaned the genuine sentiments of his Labor colleagues in this place last week but also brought disrepute to all senators in this chamber.
