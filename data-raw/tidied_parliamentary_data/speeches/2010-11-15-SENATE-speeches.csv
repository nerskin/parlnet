"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-11-15,"—I rise to speak on the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Weekly Payments) Bill 2010. The coalition supports this bill. The bill will enable the Repatriation Commission and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to establish a class of persons who are homeless or at risk of homelessness who will be eligible to receive their DVA entitlements weekly instead of fortnightly. Eligible veterans can make application to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to be treated under these more beneficial arrangements. The bill ensures that homeless veterans are able to access similarly beneficial arrangements under veterans legislation as is available to other Australian government pensioners.
I do not propose to go through each section of the bill, but there are a number of related matters which I wish to discuss today. Last Thursday a number of Australians at 11 o’clock stopped for a minute’s silence to commemorate the 92nd anniversary of the end of the First World War. It was on that day that 10 new names were added to the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial. They are Sapper Jacob Moerland and Sapper Darren Smith, who were killed in action on 7 June this year; Private Scott Palmer, Private Timothy Aplin and Private Benjamin Chuck, killed in action on 21 June this year; Private Nathan Bewes, killed in action on 9 July this year; Trooper Jason Brown, killed in action on 13 August this year; Private Grant Kirby and Private Tomas Dale, killed in action on 20 August this year; and Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney, killed in action on 24 August this year. Lest we forget the sacrifice of these 10 fine young men, we will remember them not just on 11 November but every day.
But I was disgusted to read in the Herald Sun newspaper in Melbourne that workers at VicRoads did not pause for one minute at 11 o’clock on 11 November. I say this in an apolitical sense because I know that the Premier expressed his outrage at the time, as did the leader of the opposition, but I do want to make further comments about this. I want to talk today about the commentary that was associated with and attached to the VicRoads decision in relation to this matter. They apparently were concerned about causing offence. VicRoads’s statement said that the organisation was ‘conscious of possible different cultural issues’ and did not ‘wish to cause offence to anyone’. Cause offence to whom exactly? To whom are they referring? Only after significant public pressure did VicRoads relent and encourage staff to observe a customary and traditional one minute’s silence for the fallen of all wars at 11 am on the 11th day of the 11th month—a tradition, I might say, that well and truly predates VicRoads.
Disappointingly, the attitude of VicRoads has also been replicated elsewhere. Again the Herald Sun reported, last Friday, that Centrelink staff and customers in Newport ‘failed to observe the minute’s silence’. Further, the paper reported:
At the McDonald’s store on the corner of Victoria Pde and Smith St, Collingwood, burgers and fries took priority.
                   …              …              …
At the Commonwealth Bank branch in Burke Rd, Camberwell, service continued as normal.
                   …              …              …
RMIT University did not mark the 11th hour across its three campuses …
                   …              …              …
RMIT chief operating officer Steve Somogyi said the university respected “the right of its staff and students to mark Remembrance Day in their own way”.
What a complete and utter cop-out—observe it in their own way. Surely one minute’s silence every year is the absolute least that this nation can do to honour those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of our nation, our values and our way of life. I regret that this is the approach taken by some in positions of authority who are probably the same people who want to ban Father Christmas, carols and decorations at Christmas. It is simply political correctness gone mad. Remembrance Day is not a cultural cringe, as some believe. It is the most important of days to commemorate, reflect on and remember the sacrifice of others which has led to the nation we have today. Andrew Bolt in the Herald Sun last Friday wrote:
So far from showing “sensitivity” to its multicultural staff, VicRoads has insulted them. And rather than show “sensitivity” to all cultures, it has disrespected the one that matters most, and that’s where it’s been so irresponsible.
I absolutely and totally endorse those comments. We need to have positive leadership on this important national issue from the Gillard Labor government and it will be wholeheartedly supported by the coalition. Later today I intend writing to the vice-chancellors of Australia’s universities calling on them to mark 11 am on 11 November as a time for one minute’s silence on campus. I will be writing to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs inviting him to join with me in establishing a program which I think should be called ‘Recommitting Australia to Remembrance Day’.
I remember well one of his predecessors, Con Sciacca, who put in place the fantastic Australia Remembers program. I think Con Sciacca played a pivotal role as a former Labor Minister for Veterans’ Affairs—for those listening to this speech who do not know who Con Sciacca is. He was, in my view, pivotal in re-educating another generation of young Australians about the importance of commemorating the sacrifices that others have made for this country. I invite the minister to join with me in establishing this program. I am happy for him to introduce it tomorrow and for him to take ownership of it, but we do need to recommit Australia to Remembrance Day.
Look at those universities, TAFEs and schools and tell me one group of people in this country other than those educational institutions which is better able to organise one minute’s silence for one minute of the year. I call on them to use the rights they have to ensure that, as far as possible, classes cease for that minute and there is that minute’s observation. Would it not be fantastic for this country if at 11 o’clock every bus stopped, every tram stopped, every commuter stopped for a minute to commemorate, as I said before, what is one of our most important days of commemoration?
This brings me to another matter—that is, an issue raised with me last week by a colleague from the other place. In an email distributed last Thursday there is a claim that a veteran had committed suicide as a result of difficulties in claiming his entitlements through the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. This is obviously deeply distressing and very, very worrying. I am aware of allegations made in the past which have linked suicide to slow responses from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs in the processing of claims. Obviously all these allegations have been previously investigated. In light of this email, I ask the Minister for Veterans Affairs to request a thorough investigation of the claims made in the email and, where appropriate, to inform the parliament of the outcome. I have the email and, whilst I do not propose to detail the specifics in this place, I ask that the minister take on board the contents of the email which was, I note, sent to him and that he take action to ensure that the issues raised are dealt with and properly investigated.
As we near the end of a busy year, I draw the Senate’s attention to the plight of the Review of Military Compensation Arrangements. This review was commissioned by the previous Minister for Veterans’ Affairs in 2009. The previous minister appointed a steering committee to manage the review and appointed the secretary of his department to the role of chair. The steering committee includes representatives from the Department of Defence, Treasury, the Department of Finance and Deregulation and the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations as well as an independent academic expert in veterans and compensation law. The review was due for completion in March 2010. The deadline was later extended to the end of this year. We now hear it will be 2011 before the review is completed and recommendations released for comment by the veteran and ex-service community. I raised concerns with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs through Senate estimates about the progress of the review and some of the issues being considered by the review. I am particularly concerned that defence personnel returning from Afghanistan may not be able to access additional compensation for new injuries. I am sure this will horrify many, many senators. This is the result of the offsetting of previous compensation payments under other acts against any new injuries covered by the MRCA legislation.
I am quite sure that when Danna Vale, a previous coalition Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, introduced the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill 2003 in parliament, she did not intend this to happen. In fact, Mrs Vale told the other place when she introduced the bill:
A member who suffers an injury or illness after that date—
that is, 1 July 2004—
will be able to combine prior impairments from the SRCA and VEA—
the Veterans’ Entitlements Act—
with the new arrangements to get the best possible outcome.
I quote from the House of Representatives debates of 4 December 2003, page 23,809. I emphasise the words ‘the best possible outcome’. I hope that the former minister’s words have been used by the review in their deliberations into the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, because they reflect very clearly the intention of this parliament—specifically, the previous coalition government in making provision for injured veterans and ex-service people’s entitlements under the law. I remain concerned, however, that this critical review is being delayed by bureaucratic argument. I have heard from a number of sources that the review’s delay is due to an argument between Finance, Treasury and Workplace Relations wanting to water down provisions of the MRCA to make it more of a civilian workers compensation scheme versus Defence, DVA and the compensation law expert, who, quite rightly, demand that MRCA appropriately reflect the unique nature of military service.
Caught in the middle of all this is the Secretary of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and the chair of the review, Mr Ian Campbell. As well as being secretary of DVA and chairman of the review, Mr Campbell is also Chairman of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, the MRCC, and the President of the Repatriation Commission. He is in the unfortunate, yet deliberate, position of being both the poacher and the gamekeeper in relation to this issue. The MRCC is the independent commission which determines entitlements under the MRCA and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act for compensation for ex-ADF personnel. The commission is responsible for determining how the act is administered and the level of entitlements available to claimants. It is independent of government, and the Minister for Veteran’s Affairs has no legislative authority to override decisions of the commission. So the minister has no role in this; it is truly independent. It has five commissioners, of which Mr Campbell is the chair. Here we have the chair of that commission—the commission which sets the entitlements—also chairing a review of the entitlements provided by the act. When I said before that it is independent, I of course meant it is independent of government. But that is where the independence stops, because where the chair of that commission—the commission which sets the entitlements—is also chairing a review of the entitlements provided by the act, there has to be a clear conflict of interest. There must be.
During the last parliament, the Labor government championed two key reviews, out of some 180 in total, to highlight their so-called ‘reform’ credentials. The first was the Harmer review of pensions. This is a review which has fallen foul of the veteran community because it did not include a number of matters, but it was undertaken by Dr Jeff Harmer, Secretary of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, FaHCSIA. But Dr Harmer is not also the head of Centrelink, the authority which administers payments under the Social Security Act. Dr Harmer’s position of policy making versus policy delivery is clearly defined.
There is also, of course, the Henry taxation review. While much of this review remains shrouded in secrecy, what is clear is that while the author of the review, Treasury secretary Dr Ken Henry, made recommendations on revenue measures, he is not also the Commissioner of Taxation. Dr Henry is not responsible for the administration of his recommendations. It falls to the Commissioner of Taxation to make determinations under the tax act about compliance, not the secretary of the department. So, under the Social Security Act and the tax act, the delineation of the roles of the respective secretary and decision makers is clear. Yet in Veterans’ Affairs, a deliberate conflict of interest has been established by the Labor government. In this case, the secretary is both the decision maker and the reviewer—the poacher and the gamekeeper. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs must be the most conflicted departmental secretary in the entire Public Service in relation to this matter. It is not fair that the secretary of the department has been placed in this position. Something simply has to give.
I am very concerned that the important review of military compensation arrangements presently underway is being bogged down by bureaucratic games. Putting to one side the cost implications of a review such as this, efforts by some on the steering committee to, apparently, make military compensation more comparable with civilian workers compensation are, quite frankly, utterly disgraceful. The unique nature of military service requires that compensation for injuries sustained in the line of duty reflects the uniqueness of that service. But, in the event of a three-all tie on the steering committee, which way does Mr Campbell go? In this position both Mr Campbell and the review he chairs are conflicted. He has been placed in an extraordinary, invidious position by this government, and as a parliament we must ask ourselves whether this is a tenable position in which the executive government has placed the Public Service.
I am fully aware that there is a long tradition and a legislative basis which enables the Secretary of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to also be the President of the Repatriation Commission and Chair of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. But the time has come to ask whether this continues to be the right approach, and I ask the minister to take a closer look at this issue to see whether he has formed a similar view to me.
For the first time since the end of the Vietnam War, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs is faced with a large, younger client cohort. This presents a cultural challenge for the department it has not experienced in four decades. As a parliament, we must ensure that these veterans are looked after properly by the department, that the department is properly resourced to do this and that decision makers are appropriately trained to ensure advice and entitlements are provided accurately. This country cannot afford to treat veterans of conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the same appalling fashion as veterans of Vietnam were treated when they came home. Former Prime Minister John Howard clearly documents this in his memoirs, and I wholeheartedly concur.
The time has come for the Australian parliament to again consider how we treat our veterans. We have to consider whether it is time that the secretary of the department focus solely on delivering services to veterans and their families and that an independent commissioner be appointed to chair the MRCC and the Repatriation Commission. Such a step would enable the secretary of the department to focus on the needs of veterans whilst maintaining the independence of the MRCC and the Repat Commission in determining compensation claims. Cutting the Gordian knot could well be in the long-term best interests of veterans and their families. Mr Campbell is highly respected, and I respect Mr Campbell, but he is conflicted. I ask the minister to have another look at this on the basis of and on the back of the absolutely changed dynamics of this department.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WEEKLY PAYMENTS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-11-15,"—I rise in summation on this very important piece of legislation, especially given my portfolio responsibilities in terms of homelessness. The Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Weekly Payments) Bill 2010 will implement in the repatriation system an important element of the government’s strategy to address homelessness. The bill will enable the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to offer the option of weekly pension payments. This option will be available to those who are homeless or at risk of being homeless and who would benefit from weekly payments. This measure is an important component of the government’s strategy to reduce homelessness. While the measure does not affect the total amount of pension a person can receive, the availability of weekly payments will assist vulnerable clients to better manage their money. This action, in conjunction with other elements of the government’s strategy, can contribute to stabilising and improving the circumstances of those who may be facing homelessness.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-11-15,"—I take this opportunity to state the coalition’s position on these two important bills, the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill 2010. On 12 August 2009, the Attorney-General released a discussion paper on proposed reforms to Australia’s counterterrorism and national security legislation. The majority of the amendments proposed in these bills arise from the recommendations of independent and parliamentary reviews of aspects of the national security regime over the past three years. In particular, these are: the Clarke inquiry into the case of Dr Mohamed Haneef, which reported in November 2008; the report of the inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security into the proscription of terrorist organisations in September 2007; the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security’s report, Review of Security and Counter Terrorism Legislation, in December 2006; as well as the report of the review of sedition laws in Australia by the Australian Law Reform Commission, also in 2006. This bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which reported on 17 June. With the exception of two substantive matters, which I will mention in a moment, the committee recommended that the legislation be passed.
The bill proposes amendments to the legislation in four principal areas: firstly, in relation to treason, sedition and terrorism offences; secondly, in relation to powers to investigate terrorism and serious crime; thirdly, the listing and proscription of terrorist organisations; and, fourthly, the protection of national security information in court proceedings. In relation to the first of those matters, the bill proposes that the offence of treason in the Criminal Code be amended by confining the offence to those who owe allegiance to Australia or have voluntarily placed themselves under Australia’s protection, and clarifying that the offence of assisting the enemy refers to material assistance.
The offence of sedition is proposed to be renamed ‘urging violence’, and includes urging the overthrow of the constitutional government and urging interference with parliamentary elections. These provisions will require an intention that force or violence will be used. The renaming of the offence of sedition—which is, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, an ancient crime in the British criminal law—is not intended by the bill to water down the offence, but merely to contemporise the usage in the descriptors of the matters constituting the offence.
As well, a new offence is proposed, of urging the use of force or violence against a group distinguished by race, religion, nationality, national origin or political opinion. There is a lesser sense if the force does not threaten the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth. The defence of ‘acts done in good faith’ is clarified by making it relevant that acts were done in the context of artistic work, genuine academic or scientific discourse, or in the dissemination of news or current affairs.
The Senate committee recommended that this clarification not contain an element of good faith in itself, and that recommendation has been adopted by the government. In this respect, the opposition is satisfied that the occasionally competing imperatives of protecting freedom of speech—sometimes, freedom of speech vigorously expressed by groups at the margins of society (sometimes, radical groups who are no friends of democracy but whose freedom of speech our democracy nevertheless respects)—on the one hand, and protecting the institutions of the state from direct threat to their integrity or maintenance, on the other hand, has been achieved.
It is proposed to repeal the offences relating to unlawful associations. These are subsumed by the terrorist organisation laws and, therefore, are outmoded.
Amendments to the definition of a terrorist act are proposed to include the United Nations as the target of an act. The definition of harm intended to be caused by a terrorist act is extended to include psychological harm. May I pause there to observe that this is a piece of law reform which has been long in coming. When we think that the word ‘terrorism’ literally means ‘causing terror through the threat or actuality of violence’, terrorism is specifically defined etymologically by reference to a state of mind. The objective terrorists seek to achieve, in the immediate sense, is to cause violence and harm, and sometimes death, to targets. But their broader objective is to cause fear and terror to populations at large, who must live their lives in the constant, gnawing doubt that they, too, may be the victims of a terrorist strike. For that reason, it has always seemed to me that extending the definition of terrorism to include psychological harm is not only appropriate but essential, as it goes to the very state of mind which terrorists seek to create—thereby to disable citizens in the peaceful going about of their ordinary lives.
A new offence of committing a terrorist hoax is proposed to the maximum penalty of imprisonment of 10 years. The offence of advocating the doing of a terrorist act will be amended to provide that the prosecution must establish that there is a substantial risk that it would lead another person to commit a terrorist act. That is not a weakening of the law. It is done to bring it into line with the concept of risk as elsewhere defined in the Criminal Code. As I said earlier, the offence of providing support to terrorist organisations is clarified to mean providing material support.
I turn to the amendments to the Crimes Act dealing with powers to investigate terrorism and serious crime. These arise from recent operational experience, in particular by the Australian Federal Police. The division relating to powers of detention would be separated into two subdivisions to deal with terrorism and non-terrorism offences. In the case of terrorism offences, the maximum length of time that a person can be detained during an investigation period is proposed as seven days. The majority of the Senate committee recommended a three-day limit. The Liberal senators recommended seven days based on evidence from the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission. I am pleased to say the government has seen the wisdom of adopting the stricter approach urged by the Liberal senators. The provisions relating to re-entry under an existing search warrant will be amended to permit re-entry within one hour in normal circumstances and re-entry within 12 hours in an emergency situation. In addition, it is proposed that entry without warrant be permitted in emergency situations when investigating terrorism.
I pause there to say the idea of entry without warrant is a departure from traditional British legal principles, which Australia has always held dear. But there are occasions when entry without warrant is justified, in our view, where there is an immediate and credible threat of terrorist conduct which could take place while the warrant is being sought. I think most people would regard the urgent circumstances in which a suspension of the requirement to obtain a warrant is, in this case, justified. It is proposed that there be a right of appeal both for prosecutors and defendants against bail decisions if there are exceptional circumstances. Minor amendments are proposed to provide full listing and proscription of terrorist organisations if the minister is satisfied of the proscribed matters on reasonable grounds. Listings would be reviewed every three years.
Let me finally turn to the amendments to the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004. The purpose of that act is to protect information from disclosure in federal criminal proceedings and its civil court proceedings where the disclosure would be likely to prejudice Australia’s national security. Once again, this is an exception to orthodox and traditional legal principles; that is, that justice be disposed of transparently in public courts, which is necessitated by the circumstances that in some criminal proceedings arising from terrorism and terrorism related offences it is necessary to keep national security information confidential. I think that exception is a matter of common sense and speaks for itself, although like all exceptions from orthodox legal and constitutional principles it is an exception which we hope is available sparingly. The act has been invoked some 38 times and the experience informs some relatively minor although lengthy amendments principally to clarify that notification must be made to a party’s legal representatives and to streamline the definition of situations in which disclosure will be permitted. In some situations, answers to questions in court may be made in writing.
Despite this being a lengthy bill, there appear to be few proposals that are genuinely controversial or that demonstrably strengthen or weaken the national security laws to any significant degree. Most of the proposals are procedural while others clarify the applicable legal test. In some cases, which I have dwelt upon in this speech, there are departures from existing legal principles which have been forced upon us by the necessitous circumstances arising from a new and uniquely dangerous threat.
I have considered the amendments to the bill circulated by the Greens. These amendments were not recommended by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and I foreshadow, with respect to Senator Ludlam, they do not have the coalition’s support. I should mention that the security briefings that have been provided to me indicate some extremely disturbing emerging threats. This is not the time to open any window of opportunity to enable those threats to be actualised.
Finally, I turn to theParliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill 2010. The establishment of that committee was a proposal of the discussion paper on proposed reforms to counterterrorism and national security legislation. This bill was introduced with the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The proposed committee will replace and extend the functions of the current Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission. The principal extension is the inclusion of the Australian Federal Police under the jurisdiction of this committee. The committee will be asked to examine trends and changes in criminal activities, practices and methods and to report on any desirable changes to the function, structure, powers and procedures of the Australian Crime Commission or the Australian Federal Police. It will also inquire into any question in connection with its functions that is referred to it by either house of the parliament. The coalition does not consider the bill to be controversial. It was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee as a cognate bill with the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and the committee unanimously recommended its passage on 17 June 2010. Both bills, amended following the report of the Senate committee, have the coalition’s support and I commend them to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-11-15,"—If one phrase could sum up where this debate on the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill 2010 finds us today it would have to be ‘missed opportunity’. This process has been turning now for about two years, depending on what you consider the starting point. Senator Brandis said in his speech that nothing in the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill is particularly controversial and that we are not really extending or withdrawing any powers.
I will take issue with Senator Brandis on a couple of matters. I think there are some things in this legislation that are quite striking in their extension of the powers; but perhaps Senator Brandis has got the general gist about right—that this is a proposal to stand still and effectively do nothing. An enormous amount of work has been put in by a lot of people—in the legal community and more broadly—who are very close to these issues, about the gradual descent of Australia into what is effectively a surveillance state. Laws were passed in the heat of the moment after the horrific attacks on 11 September 2001 in the United States, and subsequent attacks, and these laws were not only badly drafted or never even enacted or used; they also clamped down on the rights of Australians to go about their lives, without there being any consequential increase in security or safety, and that case has in fact never been made.
I want to give the Senate one example of how dramatically out of balance the debate has become. Right at the moment on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin—and I know this has been the subject of some local controversy right here in Canberra—a gigantic complex is being built, costing about $585 million, in which we are going to house ASIO. I do not know exactly what it is about this secret agency that led them to believe they needed this enormous complex right in the Parliamentary Triangle on the shore of the lake, that will probably be visible from space, but there you go. The secret agency is coming out of the closet, it is tripling its staff numbers and its budget has increased more than sixfold to $438 million per year. That is ASIO. There is not a single amendment—not a word—in this bill that the government has brought forward. Despite a lot of evidence from people who are very close to these issues we have not touched ASIO’s act. There is not a single amendment in this legislation in response to many of the concerns that were raised over the last couple of years. ASIO’s budget has been multiplied by six and its staffing has been increased threefold. Similar things are happening to ASIS and to the Office of National Assessments so that the national security budget—now totalling about $4 billion—is going on against the backdrop of this process, which has proceeded at a snail’s pace. I will talk in a bit more detail about what it has been like working through this process under the current government and the one directly before it.
At the same time as that extraordinary increase in resources and staffing is going on, we have the office known as the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, which is an office that I have spoken of a couple of times. This is the person who would be assessing whether these laws of terror, every single word of them that are still on the books from the Howard-Ruddock era, are actually necessary or proportionate to the threats that we face—whether or not they make us safer. This is to be a part-time officer, supported by two part-time staff, I believe, out of the Prime Minister’s office.
It took the Senate about a year, I suppose, on the motion of Senator Judith Troeth, to pass a bill, with the support of the Greens—and with several amendments of the Greens—to bring this office into being. That was quashed in the House of Representatives. The government swatted that aside and said that they wanted to do it their own way. They came back with a vastly more feeble bill several months later, and eventually passed it. Six months after the passage of that legislation through this parliament, that officer has still not been appointed. I think that gives us, quite starkly, a very sound idea of where this government’s priorities lie: massive budget increases for the national security estate, the surveillance estate and the agencies that are tasked with protecting our security and our safety. But the officer, the one part-timer, whose job it would be to assess whether these laws are necessary or proportionate or whether they are doing anything at all to make us safer, has not been appointed six months after this legislation was passed through the Senate. That is how asymmetrical and out of balance this debate has become.
When these laws were passed, we do not believe that the right balance was struck between providing for national security, which is one of the most important responsibilities of the government, and the protection of our fundamental human rights, which is one of the other most important responsibilities of the Australian government. The balance was not struck originally and therefore, in this do-nothing bill, the balance is being struck inappropriately as well.
Before we go to question time, I want to put firmly on the record and remind the chamber, as I have done on many occasions before: nonviolence is one of the four core pillars of the Australian Greens policy platform. We strongly oppose the presence of any form of violent extremism within Australia. We are also committed to the principle of democracy and to the civil liberties that accompany a strong democratic system of government. We acknowledge the very real threats—faced by security agencies and by Australians here in this country and also overseas—that violent acts of terrorism pose to us and the damage that such acts claim to have on our democratic institutions and on our civil liberties. It is a very important principle on which the Australian Greens were formed, and we therefore condemn outright any form of violent extremism or violence in the pursuit of political aims—which of course is the reason that we are legislating.
We are opposed to the corrosion of democratic rights and civil liberties not only through violent means but also through nonviolent, or covert, means. We support the fundamental right to oppose government and corporate conduct through peaceful protest and through civil disobedience and therefore do not support any attempt to restrict legitimate political dissent in this country.
We believe that in responding to terrorism we must address the underlying causes of violent extremism by acting in conjunction with neighbouring countries and with the international community. Factors, including poverty and social exclusion, which lead to the vulnerable being susceptible to recruitment from extremist organisations, must be addressed both in Australia and abroad. I will acknowledge that in many instances, particularly on the publication of the white paper, the language had shifted very strongly from the Howard government’s ‘war on everything’ terminology to something that was much more nuanced and did acknowledge some of the underlying causes of the violence that we are seeking to combat. However, we believe that the restriction of fundamental civil liberties in pursuit of eradicating the threat of terrorism can be profoundly counterproductive and that the right balance must be struck between security and the protection of civil liberties and democratic rights that Australia has long desired to uphold. If Australians are prepared to give up fundamental civil liberties and their democratic rights, they will effectively be furthering the goals of the very extremist organisations that we seek to confront.
This legislation has been the subject of a public consultation process, with the release of an exposure draft of the bills in August last year. This is a process that the Australian government supported, and I would say to all government ministers that providing an exposure draft giving the public and the parliament an idea of the government’s intention to legislate is almost always a good idea, and this is a process that we supported. But then you have to hope that the government will listen to what is being proposed when people provide a response to an exposure draft of a bill. So we supported the process as something positive—and it is something that we engage with—as did many people in the legal profession and in civil society, on the understanding that perhaps the government would listen to some of the views that were put forward. Unfortunately, while the process for reviewing Australia’s antiterrorism legislation has improved, the outcome has remained exactly the same.

The discussions through the G20, and other conversations, have indicated that the regional solution to the problem of irregular migration is being appropriately discussed in private with those governments to achieve the policy outcomes that I would have thought the opposition would be subscribing to as well.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-11-15,"—On Wednesday, 27 October, Senator Fierravanti-Wells asked me a question without notice on funding for Lifeline. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.

The answer read as follows—


The Government has committed $18.2m for Lifeline which will fund 3 core activities. It will: build capacity for more calls to be responded to through the 13 11 14 crisis support line; provide a dedicated suicide line at hotspots; and support toll free calls from mobile phones. The breakdown of how the dollars will be apportioned across these three activities is currently being scoped with Lifeline. Funding is for 3 years, commencing in July 2011.


With regard to toll free calls from mobiles—Lifeline has commenced discussions with telecommunication providers and is seeking to be able to commence offering free calls from mobiles, at least through some networks, early next financial year.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2010-11-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to a question without notice asked by Senator Payne today relating to the economy.
In that response the minister referred, amongst other things, to the recently released Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, MYEFO, papers which were released last Tuesday. In fact, as the coalition has been at great pains to point out, what the MYEFO really showed was that Labor’s budget position has deteriorated even as the economy is actually projected to be stronger—quite a ‘stunning’ accomplishment, really, when you think about it. What they have managed to do is to deliver higher deficits, lower surpluses and higher net debt. So what actually should have been going on in this period of time is that so much more should have been done to cut spending and to reduce upward pressure on interest rates, which of course was the tenor of the question I asked the minister. What is clear to us from their actions in relation to these issues is that they simply cannot take the hard decisions. They make a lot of noise and they talk about it quite a lot but, when it comes to the reality, there is no capacity to make the hard decisions that this economy needs.
The fiscal deficit this year, for example, is projected to be $48½ billion. But for the month of September alone the government’s deficit was $13.8 billion, the highest on record. In the first three months of the financial year, Labor’s spending was $9.6 billion higher than for the same period last year, despite the fact that revenue was $1.9 billion lower. And who is paying the price? The price is being paid by Australian homeowners. They are paying the price for Labor’s extravagance through higher interest rates, and that is a pretty simple fact that the government seems incapable of accepting. The net debt relative to the pre-election fiscal outlook has increased by $4.9 billion and is now expected to peak at $94.4 billion in 2011-12.
When you look at government programs and what is actually being done at the moment, like the Building the Education Revolution debacle, they are quite simply inflationary. They are putting pressure on inflation and on interest rates. Just last week the Treasurer of Victoria, Mr Lenders, said that only 20 per cent of BER projects in Victoria were completed, and that means that 60 per cent of the funding has still to be rolled out. So, by their own admission, Labor are continuing to stimulate the economy even after the worst of the global financial crisis has passed. There is a further $6 billion to come in the construction of school halls in response to that quarter of negative growth back in 2008.
They do try and wave it away. They try and dismiss it with a wave of the hand and a waving around of the MYEFO documents. It is actually not quite that simple, though, because we then come to the September quarter CPI, and that shows that Labor’s excessive spending still continues to put pressure on inflation. We see steep rises in power, in water and in rents accounting for most of the increase in CPI. It is not rocket science to work out where that hurts the most: it hurts the most in the average Australian family.
In the September quarter, water and sewerage charges rose by 12.8 per cent, electricity by six per cent, property rates and charges by 6.2 per cent and rents by over one per cent. When you put that all together, though, since the end of 2007—since this government was elected—electricity prices have risen by 35 per cent, gas prices by 24 per cent, water prices by 29 per cent and rents by 15 per cent. Add to that the fact that there have now been seven interest rate rises on Labor’s watch since October 2009. And what do those interest rate rises do? They also increase the cost of building materials, they make badly needed new homes yet more expensive to build—and we are falling ever behind on new home construction—and renters suffer more as landlords, reasonably, try to pass on the higher costs of mortgage interest rates to tenants. Who hurts? The Australian people hurt. Australian families hurt. In November they have had an interest rate rise, and the commentators say that more are expected. So we look to December, to Christmas and to a new year. If the record of this government since the end of 2007 is anything to go by, there will be very little in the Christmas stocking for most Australian families.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2010-11-15,"—I am glad Senator Payne has chosen, of all the questions today, to focus on this particular matter, because there has at least been an attempt at some serious consideration of some of the fiscal issues confronting Australia. However, I need to take a short divergence back to the issue of interest rates, because I think Senator Payne has demonstrated—as indeed have some of the other comments today—a fairly selective consideration of some matters. Under those opposite, official interest rates rose to 6.75 per cent. That is two percentage points higher than rates are today, at 4.75 per cent. A family on a $300,000 mortgage is paying $156 less each month in repayments than when the Liberals were last in government. That is a saving of $1,872 a year.
But, after that one brief point, let me go back to the broader fiscal strategy, because I think that is critical and very important and we should not allow the opposition to try and cherry-pick and make trite points on our attempt to deal with the issues associated with the change in exchange rate and the impact of that on our economy. We have a strategy that will get the budget back to surplus in three years, well before any major advanced economy, and we still have such a strategy. It has been endorsed, again, by the IMF, the OECD, the RBA and international credit rating agencies. We are delivering the fastest positive budget turnaround in over 40 years: fiscal tightening by 4½ per cent of GDP over three years, including 1.3 per cent of GDP this year alone. This is faster than we saw in recoveries from previous downturns and faster than anything we have seen since records have been kept. This reflects—
—You haven’t done it yet. And why is it so big? Because the starting point is so bad. You’re making a virtue of—
—Order! Senator Collins has the call.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I was in fact finding it difficult, from this place in the chamber, to even hear myself think. This reflects the methodological adherence to our strict fiscal rules, and let me cover them. We are keeping real spending growth to two per cent or less a year; that is around half of what we saw in the last four years of the coalition, and it is around half the rate that spending has grown at in the past 40 years. That is exactly why the OECD has described our strategy as ‘bold’, ‘well designed’ and ‘effective’—some of those references in the OECD report that, of course, selective representation was not covering in question time. We have been offsetting every single dollar in new spending. We have delivered $83.6 billion in savings across three budgets.
I was feeling slightly sorry for Senator Joyce earlier today when I was considering the performance of Joe Hockey as current shadow Treasurer.
—Order! Senator Collins, you must refer to members by their proper name.
—Sorry; you are right. I should not have said Joe Hockey or Sloppy Joe; I should have said Mr Hockey.
—Order! You are only compounding the problem.
—I withdraw that comment. But, as the opposition have flip-flopped, for instance, over their view on the Greens bill with respect to banking regulations and when the serious issues arose around those policies, we have stayed the course on serious policy development in terms of how we will deal with banking regulation.
Unfortunately for Senator Joyce, he lost my sympathy today when he was suggesting that the government should respond to answers in question time by the approach of tossing a coin: ‘Pick an answer; you’ve at least got a 50 per cent chance of being right.’ This is someone who was shadow finance minister: ‘Pick—there’s a 50 per cent chance.’ Certainly he had difficulties in mixing up his billions and his millions, but to suggest in serious governance that we should toss a coin is really quite concerning.
But let me go back to some of the more serious matters about our fiscal strategy. At the same time as we have been quite methodical in our adherence to our fiscal rules, the fiscal stimulus is being withdrawn, contrary to the myths being projected from the other side. Far from fuelling growth, the withdrawal of the stimulus will subtract around one percentage point from growth this year, and the remaining investments are in the long-term infrastructure which is absolutely critical to building our productive economic capacity and maintaining our strong economy and economic growth. This, again, is the issue that the opposition forgets. The opposition forgets the economic circumstances we were left in after many years of underinvestment in nation building and infrastructure. But much of that strength has now been returned to the economy, and that is why we were able to ride through the global financial crisis, contrary to suggestions such as those from Senator Macdonald that it is all related to his friend Mr Costello.
We have a comprehensive strategy to build future capacity, which is the best way to contain inflationary pressures over the long term: investing in major rail and road upgrades and the NBN—yes, the NBN is about future capacity, skills and education—and, of course, cutting the company tax rate. Unlike the opposition’s policy about PPL, we are cutting the company tax rate to make businesses more competitive.
These are all the issues that, of course, Senator Payne in her comments did not go to: how critical they are and, certainly, how seriously the Gillard government takes the issues of our fiscal responsibilities and fiscal plans. As I said at the outset, we do have a strategy that will get the budget back to surplus in three years, well before any major advanced economy.
Nothing in MYEFO has changed that. Nothing that Senator Payne referred to has changed that. Nor, indeed, did she acknowledge that our plan has been endorsed once again by the IMF, the OECD, the RBA and the international credit rating agencies. Where on earth the scaremongering from the opposition—without any support or credible sustenance from serious commentators in terms of economic recovery—came from is beyond me. Whether they think that they can continue to just run these lines and say them often enough so that the punters out there will just accept them, it just will not work. (Time expired)

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2010-11-15,"—I too rise to speak on the answers given by Senator Wong at question time today. I will just quote the Treasurer; in July he said:
… we will do everything as we go forward to ensure we minimise those cost-of-living pressures …
In front of me today I have two news articles that have been published since the last rate rise on Melbourne Cup Day: ‘Rate rise compounds woes for cash strapped families’ and ‘Average families struggle to meet costs’.
The Treasurer has said that they will help these families. What evidence do we have? We keep being told that, yes, the budget will come back into surplus in three years time. But the evidence is just not there. Unfortunately, we have this looming dark shadow of the carbon tax as well—the tax that before the election the Prime Minister said would not happen. Now that is coming as well, and that carbon tax will actually compound on these poor families who are struggling to meet the above average costs.
As an indication of how much it costs, because of higher living costs a family on a single average income of $75,000 a year just cannot exist and meet their living costs for basic necessities. There is research that comes from the Weekend West showing that a family of four would need a full-time and a part-time average income to cover the weekly $1,175 cost of necessities. This includes payments for an average-size mortgage, insurances, food, medical cover, car costs, rates and utilities.
These families really are battling and, coming from a rural background—especially in Western Australia where we have a very limited grain harvest and people who are desperate to try to pay their interest rates—these sorts of costs are unfortunately absolutely out of their depth. The frightening part is that a number of people have to use their credit cards to pay for food. They have maxed out their credit card and they are paying for basic day-to-day things such as food, fuel and transport using their credit card, and are not able to clear the expenses they have already made.
Another indicator which applies particularly to contractors and tradespeople is having no financial contingency plan for when there is no income because of an illness or accident. Small businesses in these farming communities are really battling. They are not getting paid, they have to do a seven-day payment to the people they are buying things from and it is all becoming very difficult.
I return to the carbon tax: as far as electricity costs are concerned, where will all of this end? We hear stories about pensioners who are petrified to have their lights on and their heating on, and who are lying in bed covered in blankets trying to keep themselves warm. It really does worry me just how we are going to deal with that issue when it comes up. For the number of social groups who are trying to help these people, the unexpected rate rise last week has generated a huge surge in activity for financial counsellors and the people who supply families with groceries and also help with their repayments when they are not able to make those. Counsellors have a huge job trying to help with debt management arrangements. It is the last resort when people have to go to these people and say, ‘Look, I just can’t cope’. Unfortunately, often it is too late and their possessions are repossessed and their houses are as well.
We really have a problem and I do ask where this government are going and what they are showing to say that they have this in hand, because to date we have not seen any evidence whatsoever of this.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2010-11-15,"—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. It is great to see you here in good health. I have not seen your smiling face for a couple of weeks. Welcome back. I rise to take note of answers given to questions today too, but before I do, if I may, I just want to clarify that it is a very serious issue when we talk about families struggling and, more importantly, when pensioners do it hard. Trust me, we all know how hurtful and distressing that can be. I think it is important that we do clarify one thing for the record. Senator Adams touched on pensioners too scared to turn their heaters on, shivering through the freezing winter, with no help from the Barnett state Liberal government which increased the cost of power by some 47 per cent in Western Australia.
—Your government’s failure.
—I am sorry, Mr Deputy President, for talking while other senators are interjecting. I do take note that Senator Cash from Western Australia jumped to the defence of the Barnett state government’s increase in energy charges of 47 per cent. Senator Adams sat quietly and listened, but Senator Cash is all of a sudden a defendant for higher electricity charges in Western Australia. Senator Cash, well done! The West Australians must be so proud of your stance. Through you, Mr Deputy President, well done, Senator Cash!
It does give me pleasure to talk about the nation-building stimulus package in particular. It was very rewarding to be able to travel through the great state of Western Australia to open up a lot of these Building the Education Revolution projects. Mr Deputy President, as you would be aware $16.2 billion was set aside for Building the Education Revolution. I must say not only do I enjoy going to the openings but so do the Liberal members in Western Australia because they are always pushing their way to the front to get their photos taken even though—I think the record will correct me if I am wrong—I am sure they voted against every stimulus in this chamber when we were putting them through in 2009. When the government was pushing the legislation through not one of them on that side actually came over to this side and voted with the government. They voted against it, so why would they be pushing to get to the photographers to get their photos taken at every opening? That is interesting, but it is all nice; it is all good.
Last week I had the pleasure of attending some four Building the Education Revolution great stories in the federal seat of Hasluck. At Thornlie Primary School they also celebrated their 50th anniversary and I saw the early childhood learning centre that was opened there and the delight of the preschool kiddies that turned up sitting in their uniforms in the new undercover area next to the music and arts centre. It was a fantastic achievement and how thankful not only the P&C, but the teachers, the staff, the parents and the principals of these schools are that the federal government stimulated the economy and kept the employers employing contractors and employees and now they are seeing the reward in their school community with their new education centres. I also had the pleasure of visiting Lesmurdie Primary School. It was the same story. I also went along to Hillside where there was exactly the same story. I am talking about the great work that was done by a very responsible government through the greatest financial challenge that this country and the world faced since the 1930s.
Those on that side have obviously forgotten about it but, mind you, if I had a deputy leader like theirs at the time, the member for Curtin, saying we should just sit on our hands and wait or just look, I would be pretty quiet too. Mind you, I would not have the gall to be pushing my way to the front for a photo opportunity every time one of these buildings is opened, but still they love it, I love it, the parents love it.
The Nobel laureate in economics, Professor Stiglitz, was out here a few months back and he actually commended the Australian government. I think his words were along the lines that it was probably the best economic stimulus that he had seen and thank goodness that the government did move early to create employment opportunities and to put dollars in the pockets of ordinary Australians so that they would get out and stimulate the economy. In all fairness, with no disrespect to the opposition senators over there, I think a recommendation from Professor Stiglitz goes a lot further than pushing your way to the front for a photo opportunity at a school.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2010-11-15,"—Thank you, Mr Deputy President, and may I join Senator Sterle in welcoming you back. In rising to take note of answers you have to hand it to those on the other side of this chamber who really abuse this chamber to try to rewrite history. I would like to remind Senator Sterle of the facts in relation to the stimulus packages of his government and remind him that we actually did support the first stimulus package. Our concern in supporting the second stimulus package was the fact that it was four times the size and introduced before we saw the effect of that first stimulus package and how it would filter through the system. But it does not ever stop Senator Sterle and those on the other side who want to rewrite history according to their own whims and fancies.
Minister Wong stood up and talked about the lack of fiscal responsibility of those on this side of the chamber. I would put to Minister Wong that it is what you do in government that counts. I will be very happy to stand up any day and hold up our record under the Howard-Costello government and demonstrate what fiscal responsibility is all about—unlike what we have seen on your side: this scandalous, extraordinary, flagrant waste of hard earned taxpayers’ money. You on that side have no idea what fiscal responsibility actually means. It is a definition that we are very happy to provide to you. Australians look to their governments for effective and strong management. Your answer to that, as Senator Adams has already raised, is to roll out programs like the BER, which has wasted billions of dollars. There were programs like the insulation pink batts scheme under Garrett. He was sidelined; he was not doing too well. But we still have not fixed it.
—Order! Senator Kroger, you must refer to people in the other place by their proper names.
—Minister Garrett. Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I was getting overwhelmed by the scandalous waste by particular ministers, so I lost my sense of etiquette at the time. My apologies. What needs to be pointed out is that this scandalous waste of money is the very thing that is increasingly putting inflationary pressure on the cost of living. The energy cost that Senator Adams has already raised is but one example. She is absolutely right in saying that the carbon tax that was totally ruled out before the last election and has now been ruled in will actually put upward pressure on electricity prices. All cost of living price rises are a threat.
Now the Prime Minister has formed—to put it in her words—a formal alliance with the Greens so that when they whistle we know that she will be beholden. First up, we have the carbon tax committee, the committee for believers, but there are many, many other policies that they are interested in bringing into this place that will dramatically affect the cost of living and have a significant impact. There are policies such as the introduction of congestion taxes and increasing the tariff on four-wheel drives by 10 per cent. We have already covered the resource super profits tax in this place many times, where they would like to see a 50 per cent tax rate. We have seen the slashing of education support and funding for Catholic and independent schools. There is the abolition of the private health insurance rebate. We are seeing the taxing of family trusts. There is also the review of the GST and the implementation of that. There are many, many policies that directly impact the cost of living, and it is these that we should be very much aware of. The government want to look at changing the taxation system from work based taxes to taxes on natural resources. (Time expired)

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2010-11-15,"—Minister Carr’s disgraceful and completely unprofessional performance in question time today—in fact, it was put to me it was a performance that was unbefitting of a minister of the Crown—shows exactly why the coalition is debating this matter today. Those opposite have absolutely no answers at all to their failed border protection policies. Andrew Bolt, in his online blog on 12 November 2010, posed the following question: is Julia Gillard finished? I have to say, based on Minister Carr’s performance today, perhaps the question being posed by Andrew Bolt should have been: is Minister Carr finished? But the question was in relation to Julia Gillard—and I have to say: if we put that question to Bill Shorten, what do you think Mr Shorten would say?
—Mr President, on a point of order: the senator persists in refusing to name members of the other place by their appropriate titles.
—I apologise, Senator McEwen; I was engaged in another conversation and was not listening as closely as I should have. Senator Cash, you must refer to people in the other place by their proper title.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. If we were to put the question to Minister Shorten, one can only imagine what his answer would be. It would be a resounding, ‘Yes, Ms Gillard, the current Prime Minister from the Australian Labor Party, is finished.’
Let us now look at the question in the context of today’s matter of public importance debate on securing Australia’s borders. Again, without a doubt, the answer to the question has to be a resounding yes because, when it comes to protecting Australia’s borders, Gillard Labor, just like Rudd Labor, has failed the Australian people. This government has shown that in the few short months since it was elected it has absolutely no agenda whatsoever when it comes to protecting Australia’s borders. This is a government that has clearly demonstrated to the Australian people that when it comes to irregular maritime arrivals it lurches from one problem to the next. This is a government that, just like the former Rudd Labor government, has no solution to the mess it created when it chose to roll back, in August 2008, the Howard government’s proven strong border protection policies.
Based on Prime Minister Gillard’s performance to date, the Australian people may well be entitled to ask: ‘Why did the Labor Party axe—or politically execute—former Prime Minister Rudd when Ms Gillard’s policies are worse than the former Labor government’s policies?’ The former Labor government was an absolute disaster when it came to border protection. Now, under Prime Minister Gillard, Australia’s border protection policy is in complete, total and utter tatters. To those on the other side who say, ‘No, no, no, it’s not in tatters; that is the coalition’s scaremongering on the issue of border protection,’ I say let us look at the facts. Let us look at the statistics in relation to irregular maritime arrivals, because the arrival of the latest boat, with 42 people on board, means that more than 9,013 people have arrived unlawfully by boat since the Labor Party changed the coalition’s strong border protection policies. This year alone, more than 5,978 people have arrived unlawfully in Australia. That is a border protection policy that is in absolute tatters.
What is even more interesting is that even the Labor Party did not actually believe that the numbers would be that high. We know this because in the May 2010 budget the government allocated $327.5 million for offshore asylum-seeker management—and here is the crunch—based on an estimated 2,000 irregular maritime arrivals for the 2010-11 financial year. That was an underestimation by any stretch of the word.
Mr Deputy President, do you know how many people have actually arrived in the four short months since this new financial year commenced? It is 2,320. And we know that the numbers will continue to rise. Did the Labor Party reflect that in the MYEFO? No. They are absolutely kidding themselves if they think that their budget forecast of 2,000 irregular maritime arrivals for the 2010-11 period is in any way reflective of the number of irregular maritime arrivals who are actually going to come here.
At the end of the day, it is the Australian people who will suffer because of Labor’s failed border protection policies. It is the mums, it is the dads, it is the taxpayers in Australia that are now going to have to brace themselves for a massive budget blow-out under this Labor government. That is because Labor’s costings do not reflect the true indication of the potential costs because of their immigration failures.
Australian taxpayers should be bracing themselves for a budget blow-out that could potentially be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Despite their continued rhetoric—and we heard it in question time today: ‘We will be bringing the budget back into surplus’—that is an absolute fantasy. Based on just the potential budget blow-out from their immigration failures alone, there is no way that the Gillard Labor government can bring this budget back into surplus in the time frame that is referred to. What is so sad for the Australian people is that moneys that could have been spent by this government on building new hospitals, building new roads, on employing more doctors in rural areas, supporting our troops currently on missions overseas and helping Australian pensioners, will all need to be diverted to pay for the Labor government’s failures when it comes to border protection.
None of these failures need to have occurred. Why? The coalition have proved that it is possible to stop people-smuggling, that it is possible to stop the boats. We did this when we were in government. But this is the prerequisite: as a government you need to have the stomach to make some very, very tough policy decisions and then you need to have the guts to stand by those decisions. And that it is something the Labor government is completely unable to do.
It just gets worse and worse for the Labor government. Recently we have had the decision of the High Court which has absolutely slammed Labor’s processing system and has sunk any remaining credibility whatsoever in relation to Labor’s policies for processing unlawful maritime arrivals. The decision will no doubt open a door and the Australian people will now see a flood of appeals by failed asylum seekers. None of this was budgeted for in the 2010-11 costings. Yet again, this is another catastrophic example of Labor’s complete and utter failure to control Australia’s borders.
Again, the High Court decision need not have happened. Why? The government could have, and should have, considered the coalition’s Nauru option. Unlike the government’s offshore processing regime which is now in complete tatters, the coalition’s offshore processing regime on Nauru remains intact despite the High Court’s decision. The Labor government needs to swallow its pride and pick up the telephone and speak to the President of Nauru and discuss reopening the detention centre there. The coalition can only say it so many times. But the Labor government will not do that. And do you know why, Mr Acting Deputy President? Because the current Labor government—just like the former Labor government—do not have the stomach, they do not have the guts, to take the tough decisions when it comes to protecting Australia’s borders. Only the coalition is prepared to take strong action, tough decisions, implement strong and tough policies and then stand by those policies to ensure that we stop people-smuggling.
If you do not stop people-smuggling you do not stop people’s lives being put at risk. Those on the other side just do not seem to understand this. The coalition wants to stop people-smuggling. The coalition wants to stop people putting their lives at risk. To do that you need to implement tough policy. If Labor are serious about cleaning up the mess that they have created, they will restore the coalition’s tough immigration and border protection policy regime and stop the boats.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2010-11-15,"—Here we are again—Senator Cash in another strident performance. There is no substance. It is all about the rhetoric and the one-liners. I am always intrigued by the coalition and their love affair for the worst aspects of US politics. I suppose Senator Cash will be joining Senator Bernardi’s new Tea Party, his Australian Tea Party that is on about deregulation, no role for government in society and anti-immigration. That is the Tea Party and that is where Senator Cash and Senator Bernardi are coming from.
We have been lectured over the years about the supremacy and flexibility of the US industrial relations system. So what did the coalition give us? They gave us Work Choices. We have been lectured about the rugged individualism that dominates United States society, and that was used to attack collectivism and trade unionism in this country. We have been lectured about the supremacy of the market and the need to minimise or remove government from any role in society. We have been lectured about privatisation of health care, privatisation of education, privatisation of public infrastructure, and we are now been lectured on immigration.
But we have heard little of the historic immigration and refugee policies that assisted the US become a global powerhouse. You do not hear that. They want all the worst aspects of the US system but they do not want to pick up some of the great aspects of the US system. Immigration was welcomed and refugees were supported. Refugees were nurtured and refugees were accepted into the US society, the society that the coalition keep lecturing us about, but they never want to pick up the good aspects of the US society.
This historic set of values is epitomised in the inscription on the Statue of Liberty. I am not sure if any in the coalition actually know about the inscription on the Statue of Liberty. It is a sonnet written by Emma Lazarus in the early 1900s. It is well quoted and I want to quote it again. The poem on the Statute of Liberty reads:
“Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
The coalition have demonstrated that they do not care about fairness, equity and justice when it comes to refugees. The coalition’s record on asylum seekers and refugees is not based on our international obligations or the recognition that many asylum seekers fear for their lives. It is based on promoting fear and discrimination against the most vulnerable, against those who seek to come to this country for safe refuge. There is nothing of the principle that resulted in the United States providing refuge and support for those who fled their native country in fear of their lives.
The coalition do not care about the tired and the poor. The coalition do not care about providing freedom to asylum seekers. There would be no lamp beside the golden door for refugees if the coalition had their way. The coalition would simply fuel the prejudices and the fears of Australians against those who need our help and our support, and nothing could have epitomised that more than the contribution to this debate by Senator Cash, the previous speaker.
Labor has been the party that has taken steps to protect those who seek asylum in this country. In government we have introduced a number of changes to refugee policy including the closure of the disgraceful offshore processing centre in Nauru. It was a disgrace, it was an international shame and it brought nothing but loathing of this country by people who care about refugees. We ended the temporary protection visa system that left refugees in uncertainty and in desperation. We introduced a merit based appointment process for the Refugee Review Tribunal. We abolished the 45-day rule bar on asylum seekers’ access to work rights and basic health care.
We increased the total Refugee and Humanitarian Program from 13,000 places in 2007 to 13,750 currently. We replaced the Howard government’s community care pilot with an ongoing program to support asylum seekers living in the community. There were also some reforms to immigration detention including: the development of New Directions in Detention, an outline of principles for the conduct of immigration detention centres; the abolition of the policy of charging immigration detainees for the cost of their detention; and legislative changes to increase penalties for those convicted of people-smuggling and providing material aid.
Some myths are being perpetrated by the coalition in relation to refugees and asylum seekers. We hear a great deal about illegal boat arrivals, detention centres and border protection. It is all spin. There is no threat to Australia’s borders, no flood of illegals and no influx of boat arrivals. There is a trickle, not a flood. The numbers in Australia are very small. In 2009 there were 2,497 successful visa applications, mostly from families. In Europe there were 286,680 applications, 114 times as many. In North America there were 82,270 applications, 32 times as many. Ten years ago there were twice as many asylum seeker applications as there were last year. All up, there are 20,919 refugees in Australia, a tiny fraction of the worldwide total of 15.2 million and less than one-tenth of one per cent of the Australian population. These are the facts; these are not the scaremongering tactics adopted by the coalition.
They are victims of circumstances outside their control. Refugees who apply for asylum are people who have been forced to flee their homelands. Many faced persecution and imprisonment and some faced death. Most have lost everything they own. They have come here to start a new life because we live in a country which is safe and secure. It is hard for us to imagine what it must be like for many refugees. Sadly, nearly one refugee in two is a child.
Everyone who comes into this country undergoes rigorous Australian government security checks. Those opposite should understand that refugees are fleeing from security threats, not creating new ones. They are not illegals. Refugees have jumped no queues, they have broken no rules and they are not illegals. Since when was fleeing persecution a crime? It is not illegal to seek asylum without a visa.
Ninety per cent of boat arrivals are genuine refugees. That was what happened under the Howard government. The boat arrivals were allowed in. That is the reality because they were genuine refugees. When refugees are granted permanent residency they have exactly the same rights and obligations as the rest of us, like obeying Australian laws and paying Australian taxes.
We have a long and proud history in Australia of helping refugees. Since Federation we have accepted more than 740,000 refugees, many of them hard-working Australians who have made Australia the country it is today, like scientist Dr Karl Kruszelnicki and Westfield founder and FFA head Frank Lowy.
The argument is: why do they come here? Can’t they go somewhere else? That is the position being put from across the floor. The answer is: overwhelmingly, they do. By world standards, very few refugees come to Australia. Other countries get far more asylum applications than we do. Sweden, a country with half our population, gets four times as many asylum applications. North America gets 13 times as many, and Germany gets 28 times more refugees. But the argument from across the floor is that we are being swamped. We are not being swamped. There are 15.2 million refugees worldwide, and we have 20,919. That is a tiny fraction; an equivalent of one-tenth of one per cent of the Australian population.
The argument we hear from across the floor is that they are a security threat. No, they are not. Everyone who comes here is required to undergo a rigorous Australian government security check. These refugees are fleeing persecution. They are fleeing security threats, not creating new ones. Anyone who does pose a security threat is not admitted to this country. We hear the argument that they are breaking the rules. No, they are not. Refugees are not jumping queues. They have broken no rules. When you are running for your life, there is no such thing as an orderly queue. There are no rules. Think about it: would you risk your kids’ lives because you are supposed to wait for a piece of paper? It is not illegal to seek asylum without a visa.
The argument is that they are a drain on the economy. We heard a bit about that from Senator Cash earlier. When a refugee is granted residency, they have the same rights and obligations as everyone else. The Australian economy has been built on the back of immigration. Most people who come here as refugees seeking protection are so grateful that they end up giving back to this country much more than they ever take. We are told that we are splitting at the seams and we cannot take any more. It sometimes seems that way, but this has nothing to do with people who apply for asylum. Every year our population increases by around 300,000. Asylum seekers account for only 2,497. That is less than one per cent.
Then there is the argument that we do not get to decide who comes in and that our borders are now broken. We do decide who comes in: almost everyone who comes here does so by the usual migration channels. Everyone who applies for asylum is individually assessed by the Australian government. Remember: only people who can prove that they are fleeing persecution get a visa.
How fair dinkum are the coalition? We recently had the shameful spectacle of the coalition parading around the country during the August election campaign shouting, ‘Stop the boats,’ as if their bellicosity alone would somehow miraculously stop asylum seekers arriving in this country. According to the best estimates available, as recorded by the Parliamentary Library’s background note on this subject, somewhere between one and four per cent of asylum seekers arrive in Australia by boat. The other 96 to 99 per cent of asylum seekers arrive in somewhat more comfort, aboard Boeing and Airbus jet aircraft operated by the world’s leading airlines. They arrive at our airports with a valid visa, usually a tourist visa, and then apply for asylum at a later date, while living and often working in the community.
So why is it that the coalition cannot be found shouting, ‘Stop the 747s,’ ‘Stop the A380s,’ or ‘Close the airports’? The reason is the coalition are not actually fair dinkum on this issue. They have no interest in a workable policy that meets the test of fairness and humanitarian concern. They are only interested in dehumanising and scapegoating asylum seekers and refugees, and that has characterised the coalition and diminished them for the last decade. Who could forget the refusal of the then immigration minister, Mr Ruddock, to even acknowledge the humanity of a child seeking asylum, whom he referred to as ‘it’—not he, not she, but ‘it’. That epitomises the problems with the coalition and the lack of respect that the coalition have for refugees. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-11-15,"—That speech from Senator Cameron will certainly not go down in history as his finest. The speech from Senator Cameron that will go down in history is the one in which he referred to himself and other backbench members of the Australian Labor Party in this place as ‘zombies’ and ‘people who had a political lobotomy’. Senator Cameron’s speech today has demonstrated that clearly. It is a speech written in the minister’s office—certainly not a speech that Senator Cameron himself believes in and certainly not one that the people he is supposed to represent would believe or support. If Senator Cameron had taken the time to go and talk to people in Western Sydney and people in other parts of New South Wales, the state he represents, he would understand the real issues that are before the Australian people at the moment.
The decision of the Labor Party to open up the borders, its soft approach to border protection, has meant that Labor is running out of places to place the ever-increasing number of illegal immigrants. Their decision to house some of the overflow in the Adelaide Hills in South Australia and at Northam in Western Australia led to howls of protest because nobody from the Gillard government had bothered to let locals know in advance. Talking about Inverbrackie in the Adelaide Hills, I want to refer senators to a very thoughtful article by Alexander Downer in today’s Adelaide Advertiser, where he relates this very interesting scenario put to him by a constituent:
She thought it would be strange there would be the children of serving Australian Defence Force personnel, some of whom are in Afghanistan, at Woodside Primary School with children of boat people from Afghanistan.
As he goes on to say in his article:
The point was simple. How is it that we are sending our young men to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban and young men and women from Afghanistan are paying people smugglers to come here in a method which circumvents our laws?
It is a very interesting point Mr Downer makes. I think people might like to reflect upon it. It also brings the point—and Senator Cameron slightly mentioned this—that we have a very generous refugee immigration system in Australia. We take approximately 13,000 every year, and most of the people that we have taken in are people in refugee camps—not wealthy people who can pay tens of thousands of dollars to people smugglers to bring them into Christmas Island because they know the Labor Party is soft on border protection but genuine refugees in refugee camps who have escaped there with their lives. And, for everyone that we allow in who has come by other methods, some of those people languishing in those horrible refugee camps around the world are prevented from coming in, because they are taking the place of those who would normally be coming in.
I have just returned from a tour of northern defence forces in Darwin and Cairns and I want to take this opportunity to note the important work that the men and women of our Navy and Border Protection Command are performing in these areas, policing our very vast coastline against illegal fishing and immigration, particularly now that, under Labor, the boats continue to come in ever-increasing numbers. Looking at a .50-calibre machine gun made me think of the time when I was able to commission a .50-calibre machine gun on the Oceanic Viking, a vessel that the Howard government had proudly brought into Australia, armed quite substantially, to deter illegal fishing. I was always distressed to find that this boat that was brought by the Australian government to look after our waters insofar as illegal fishing is concerned was being used to house immigrants in Indonesian waters who refused to get off the boat until the Rudd government gave in to their demand—as the immigrants knew the government would, because everybody around the world knows that the Gillard government and, before it, the Rudd government is soft on border protection.
I am also concerned about the fact that Labor is now flying asylum seekers into Scherger Air Force base in Cape York. After stringent denials prior to the election that this was happening—a fact that was exposed by the Hon. Warren Entsch, now the federal member for Leichhardt, but denied by the Labor Party at the time—we now have the extraordinary situation of this Air Force base, which is bare but has accommodation for a couple hundred Air Force personnel if it has to be used, now having nowhere for those Air Force personnel to go. Let’s hope we do not have any sort of incident which requires that base to be activated by the RAAF. If we do, the RAAF pilots and the support crew will have to sleep on the ground. I do not blame the asylum seekers for that; I blame the Gillard government in its duplicity and its mismanagement of this whole situation.
I also raise in this debate an incident where I am conscious of a constituent who is in Australia—I do not want to mention names, because I do not want to prejudice his case as it comes before the authorities. He is in Australia, applied for a visa, thought he had got it but made a mistake, and then set up a very substantial business in Australia which employs 15 people. He will never be a burden on the Australian taxpayer. He is a young, active, go-ahead professional man very keen to employ people and get involved in substantial infrastructure works in North Queensland. He is the sort of immigrant that Australia desperately needs and that we want. When he realised he did not have the right visa, he contacted people and asked what he could do about it. He is now being told that he has to leave Australia and he might get back at some time in the future. I said to him: ‘Perhaps the best thing I could do to you would be to lend you my tinnie so you could go offshore and sail your boat in, because if you could do that, under the way the Labor government runs things, perhaps you would be allowed to stay. You wouldn’t have to leave the country and stand in a queue to hopefully get back and give to Australia your expertise—the sort of skills and technical knowledge Australia desperately needs. We would be able to take advantage of that.’
The Labor government is simply incompetent at handling this issue of immigration and border protection, as they are incompetent at dealing with roof insulation and as they are incompetent at dealing with the economy. The Labor government simply cannot be trusted with any sorts of serious governmental issues. That is why I am so pleased today to be able to participate in this debate to continue highlighting the deficiencies of the Labor government—not to make a political point, not to gain votes but in the hope that at some time some of the zombies in the backbench of the Labor Party that Senator Cameron so well described might get the intestinal fortitude to stand up to their leaders and the Greens, who now seem to run the government, and say: ‘Enough is enough. Let’s do this right. Let’s go back to the way that the Howard government treated these sorts of things. Let’s go back to the way the Howard government had a very generous refugee intake policy but did it properly.’ The sooner the zombies in the backbench of the Labor Party have the intestinal fortitude to get up and tell the Greens and Ms Gillard that that is what is needed, the better off Australia will be, the better off our immigration program will be and the better off will be those people who currently put their lives at risk coming to Australia in leaky boats.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2010-11-15,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance. However, I regret that the coalition have yet again demonstrated their utter inability to take a reasoned and credible approach to this issue. It is an issue of great concern to many Australians, an issue which affects the lives of some of the most vulnerable people on this planet and an issue that has significant implications for how our nation is perceived internationally, particularly by our regional neighbours.
As I have said previously in this place, this is an issue that confronts all developed nations and to which no nation is immune. Senators in this place should be well aware of this fact, but as some on the other side do not appear to have taken note of it, let me repeat the statistics for them. We know that worldwide 380,000 asylum claims were lodged in industrialised countries in 2009. The United States was the single largest recipient of such claims; it received nearly 50,000 and Canada received over 30,000. The European Union received 250,000 asylum claims in 2009, with France receiving over 40,000 of those claims, the UK and Germany about 30,000 claims each and eight other EU countries receiving more than 10,000 claims each. By way of comparison Australia received about 6,000 claims last year, so this number is low by world standards. The overwhelming number of asylum seekers still head towards Europe or North America.
This is a global problem, as you can see, with no easy solution. If there were easy solutions, some of these developed nations would have implemented them and we would not find, as we do, nations around the world wrestling with this problem. Not only is this a problem without easy solutions that confronts all nations; it is a problem that has been around for a considerable time. It is a problem that waxes and wanes depending on civil conflicts around the globe in particular. It was so with Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. For Australia, as for many other developed nations, the situation in Afghanistan has had and continues to have a direct impact on the number of claims for asylum. For example, according to the UNHCR, in 2009 Afghanistan became the main country of origin for asylum seekers in industrialised countries worldwide.
Here in Australia we also saw a surge in boat arrivals. Similarly, the last time Afghanistan was at the top of the global list was in 2001 when there was a surge in boat arrivals under the Howard government. So contrary to the myths perpetuated by the opposition, this is a problem that Australian governments, like other national governments, have struggled with for a long time. Finding permanent, sustainable solutions to this problem is not easy for any government and any honest assessment of the Howard government’s record on this issue would confirm this. But the coalition is not interested in any such assessment. It wants to pretend that there are easy solutions to this problem for its own political purposes. It wants to play on people’s genuine concerns about these issues. It is feeding their fears as it wants to play a knight in shining armour walking in on a white horse to slay the people-smuggling dragons. So we see the opposition advocating a return to Howard government policies which it claims solved the problem.
It is a great story, but it is a fairy story because the Howard government did not have a silver bullet—an instant, permanent, sustainable solution to this problem. Once again the facts speak for themselves. More than 240 boats carrying 13,600 asylum seekers arrived under the Howard government. Boats stopped coming because global circumstances changed. The Taliban regime fell at the end of 2001 and millions of Afghans were able to return home. The Howard government knew this. It knew that the boats had stopped because global circumstances had changed and not because it had discovered a failsafe way of keeping out boats.
How do we know that the government knew this? We know because in 2003 the Howard government started to build a detention centre on Christmas Island that cost $400 million. The Howard government was planning for more boat arrivals and yet despite all this the opposition want to return to the discredited and failed policies of their past. They maintain we can turn the boats back—a very hollow promise. Of the more than 240 boats that arrived under the Howard government, only seven were turned back. No boats were turned back after 2003 and the practical reality is there is nowhere to turn the boats back to. Also, to avoid being turned back, we have seen boats being sabotaged, putting Australian Customs and Border Protection and defence personnel at risk.
In fact, on turning boats back Mr Abbott wants to go one better than the Howard government, because there is Mr Abbott’s ‘boat phone’. Labor will not have a bar of any of this nonsense that would make bad policy even worse. We must support the judgment of the captains of our border patrols. When lives are at risk on the high seas, the last thing our troops need is the interference of Tony Abbott from a desk in Canberra. There is more: the opposition also want to reintroduce the failed temporary protection visa, but the temporary protection visas also did not work; they did not stop the boats and only three per cent of the 11,000 people granted one of John Howard’s temporary protection visas ever left Australia. Still, the list of failed policies that the opposition has put up for retrial goes on.
The opposition also want to return to the Howard government’s go-it-alone approach to offshore processing. I am glad that Mr Abbott at least agrees with Labor on the need for a regional processing centre. But, unlike Mr Abbott, Labor is committed to getting it right by establishing a regional centre with the cooperation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and in a country which is a signatory to the refugees convention. We will not shirk our international obligations and we will ensure that people are treated decently.
As I said, the problem of displaced people is an ongoing global problem, with a strong regional dimension, and it requires solutions that reflect this reality. That is why Labor supports, and is committed to, achieving a regional processing framework. A regional protection framework, including a regional processing centre, is the most effective and sustainable way to remove the incentive for people to undertake dangerous sea voyages. A regional processing centre will serve to deter irregular movement to Australia by sea, dealing a serious blow to the people-smuggling business model.
Minister Bowen has held talks with senior officials of the Malaysian government following positive and constructive meetings in East Timor and Indonesia. President Ramos Horta and Minister Bowen agreed that a high-level task force with Australian and East Timorese government officials would meet to put together a detailed proposal on regional processing, a proposal that both governments would consider early next year under the auspices of the Bali process. The Indonesian foreign minister agreed to make Indonesian officials available to Australia over the coming weeks to further develop the regional protection framework.
What differentiates this government’s approach on border protection and people-smuggling with that of the current opposition is that our commitment to engaging both with our region and the international community is a serious one. What differentiates us is that we do not believe in selling silver bullets or fairytales about simple solutions. We believe in doing the hard work required to find sustainable solutions to this complex, recurring global problem.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-11-15,"—It gives me pleasure to make a brief contribution to this debate this afternoon, given some experience I have had in this area. Firstly, I would like to put on the record some of the commitments of the Gillard Labor government in this area. As you would probably know, in the 2010 budget the government announced $1.2 billion to bolster border security and to encourage a wide range of measures, including eight new border patrol vessels—the Armidales. That complements the $654 million border protection and anti people-smuggling package announced in the 2009 budget. The government also has established a dedicated Border Protection Committee of cabinet to drive the whole-of-government strategy to combat people-smuggling. I acknowledge the opposition’s support of the introduction of the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010, which was recently passed by the parliament.
I also want to remind people that, with regard to the UNHCR, we do have obligations as a nation to accept refugees who are in our waters. The numbers of refugees who have arrived on our shores have really been blown out of all proportion, and there are a number of areas that need to be rectified in terms of understanding what we are talking about. We are not talking overwhelmingly of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers. In fact, numbers in Australia remain very low and that needs to be put into perspective. There were something like 380,000 claims lodged by asylum seekers in industrialised countries in 2009, and, by comparison, our figures show around 6,000 claims last year.
If you look at the opposition’s policy on turning boats back where circumstances permit, you will see that that is a hollow promise, because effectively, since 2003, there have not been any boats that have been turned back. We all know—and it was indicated by the previous speaker, Senator Pratt—that doing that would jeopardise our Australian Defence Force personnel, because all attempts to turn back the boats would result in sabotage, and that would put personnel on Australia’s Customs and Border Protection Service ships at risk. Oddly enough, when I was on the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program in July this year, that very question was posed by an LNP member to one of the members on HMAS Broome. The response given, appropriately, was exactly as I have just said—that, if you start turning boats back, what you will get in return is people sabotaging those boats and putting the personnel on our Armidales at risk.
The other observation I want to make is that Mr Abbott has indicated that he wants to use not a bat phone but a boat phone to have direct contact with captains and make a decision based on risk on the high seas. The last thing we need is to have our troops put in a position of having to speak to Mr Abbott about whether or not the boats should be intercepted. What we experienced in July this year was the interaction of a mock exercise as to how the Armidales interact with particular circumstances. There are procedural processes to follow in terms of direct contact with these boats and whether they are boats with people on them or boats doing illegal fishing. There are correct procedures to follow. That is what we experienced when we were up there in July this year in the Timor Sea. We have a great understanding of the excellent professional work our personnel do in the Australian defence forces, serving on the Armidales.
I want to pay particular acknowledgement to a professional young woman who was the CO of HMAS Broome, Kylie, who performs an amazing job in tough and hard circumstances, being away from home. It somewhat frustrates me that this sort of motion comes to this chamber, where I consider it as being an attack not only on the government but also on our Australian Defence Force personnel who are doing an excellent job up there in the Timor Sea. I think the opposition should think twice before they bring motions like this before this chamber.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2010-11-15,"—Australia and Australians deserve better than this. We have seen grossly incompetent Labor governments for the last 3½ years, but this takes the cake. It was in June of this year that, because by their own statement they had lost their way, this Labor government got rid of a first-term Prime Minister. They, of course, created a record in the number of people coming to our shores by boat. They now have a second record.
But why do we deserve better? In the eight weeks of the Gillard government after the election in August of this year, we have seen absolute incompetence at every point. In foreign relations, we have seen failure in the last few days. On the world stage, they thought our Prime Minister was from Austria. What an embarrassment and what an insult! In the economy, we see the inability of this government to deal with the banks, whose respect they have totally lost. The minerals resource rent tax is in disarray. The stimulus spending is in chaos. If I turn to the environment, all we see is confusion with carbon taxes, committees of the people, changing climate change et cetera. In communication, only yesterday we heard the OECD come out and criticise the NBN; in water, we see a backflip over the Murray-Darling basin; and in border protection we see an absolute abrogation of responsibility by this government.
It is not only Australians who deserve better; it is all of those thousands of refugees who have applied and been accepted legally, who are in refugee camps around the world and who are being overlooked in favour of these people who are jumping the queue. We are a generous country, and those people have every right to feel as cheated as the Australian community does. Just have a look at the incompetence of this government when it comes to border protection. In the budget in May of this year, the estimate was $327 million for refugee management, estimated at 2,000 people for the year. It is already 2,320 in the first four months. If you multiply that out, we are looking at a blow-out of over $800 million for this absolute abrogation of responsibility.
I turn to consultation with the community. In my own home town of Northam, 1,500 single young men are to be housed on the edge of that town in an army barracks that all of us who have spent time there know very well is very cold in the winter and very hot in the summer. It was said to me the other day, ‘Since there are 1,500 Australian soldiers in Afghanistan and 1,500 young men from Afghanistan coming to the Northam Army barracks, why don’t we train the 1,500 Afghans at the Northam Army barracks to the level where they could go back to Afghanistan and do what our soldiers are doing so ours can come home?’
Seven hundred people from that community turned up to a function on 4 November. This is after the minister did not even have the courtesy to attend a meeting or, in fact, have any of his colleagues turn up. Someone derisively said, ‘700 isn’t many.’ It is 10 per cent of the community of Northam. If 35,000 of the 350,000 here in Canberra turned up to a protest, you can bet your life that plenty of government ministers would be there. The figure of 1,500 young men represents a 20 per cent addition to that community. If 70,000 people were dropped into Canberra on the outskirts, you can bet your life that there would be a high level of concern.
I turn also to service provision. Included in the budget, incidentally, $164 million can be found to turn the old Northam Army barracks into something acceptable for these people. On service provision, I asked in this chamber: given the fact that we lost a teenager and a baby at the Northam Hospital only in the last few weeks for lack of a doctor, what were they going to do for medical, nursing and psychological services? They said, ‘No problem; we are going to provide those doctors.’ We have an acute shortage—and I do not think the situation is different in other states and territories—of doctors, nurses and psychs throughout rural Australia, particularly rural Western Australia. I can speak with great experience. I have a niece who is the only psychologist in the town of Karratha, servicing everything from 500 kilometres south to 800 kilometres north, with all the associated problems that she has in that community. Yet she learned the other day through the newspapers that there will be no problem providing psychologists, doctors and nurses, and I have heard the same for Derby. ‘Where are they coming from?’ a nursing sister asked in Northam the other day. It is an insult from this minister and this government that they could not even address the community of Northam.
I turn to the people smugglers. We have the decision of the High Court only the other day. What is that going to add to our budget burden? What is that going to add to the legal system? It is in total and utter disarray. What is the minister going to do? He has not got a clue. There is, of course, a solution—a solution originally paid for by the Australian people—in the matter of Nauru. The centre there could be reopened and staffed with UNHCR people, and there would be a solution. But will this government do that? No, it will not. We have just heard dialogue and discussion with East Timor, Malaysia and Indonesia. Madam Acting Deputy President, let me tell you that, when Prime Minister Gillard visited Malaysia recently to go to Putrajaya and visit the Malaysian government, they could not even send their Prime Minister to speak to our Prime Minister. In terms of relations, what an insult it is that our Prime Minister was met by the Deputy Prime Minister. The Malaysians have no more intention of being involved in a regional solution than East Timor, and if the government were serious then it would pick up the phone and deal with Nauru right now.
We turn again to the question of border protection. Only in Senate estimates in the last two or three weeks did we address questions to the secretary of the department. I asked him how many people leave their country to go to Malaysia or Indonesia with papers, passports and visas. He told me that the answer is that everybody does. I said to him then: how many of these people have their papers and visas when they are processed after being picked up on the boats? He said that practically none did. I said, ‘Then they have a problem, Mr Metcalfe.’ He said, ‘No, they haven’t got a problem; we’ve got a problem.’ I asked why we had a problem. He said, ‘Because we have to establish who they are.’ You would think that the process of ‘no papers, no admission’ would surely be the starting point in this whole exercise. Surely it is incumbent on these people, if they leave their home country with passports and visas, to present themselves and explain why they do not have them. It is the tail wagging the dog.
This Labor government knows the solution. We have the solution from the past. The figures that have been quoted this afternoon need placing into balance: in 2002-03, no boats; the next year, one boat; the next year, zero boats; and the next year, one boat. Remember that, of course, Iraq and Afghanistan were well and truly alive at that time. The solution lies in the government’s hands; Australia deserves far better than this.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-11-15,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
We were told that the Australian Information Commissioner would arbitrate on the release of information which the Labor government wants to keep secret, and which the Senate, or the House of Representatives for that matter, felt needed to be released in the public interest.
When it comes to the mining tax this government have been absolutely desperate to hide every last little detail around it. They have negotiated in secret a deal with the three biggest mining companies, excluding 99 per cent of the mining industry. They have come up with a tax design which is complex, unfair and which gives those three big mining companies an unfair competitive advantage compared to the rest of the industry. Every little bit of detail that comes out about this tax exposes it as an absolute mess.
That is why we understand that the government is desperate to keep information about its mining tax deal secret; it is a dodgy deal which has serious implications for the budget, the economy, jobs and investment in the mining industry, and for states like Western Australia, Queensland and even New South Wales.
The Gillard government promised a new era of openness and transparency. They entered into an agreement with Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott in particular—members in the other place—and into a separate agreement with the Greens. In that agreement there is a particular commitment made by the government that in relation to issues of public interest disclosure where the Senate or House votes on the floor against a decision of a minister, they would be referred to the Australian Information Commissioner, who will arbitrate on the release of relevant documents and report to both houses. The Senate has voted twice now against the decision of a minister, specifically Minister Swan, who has refused to provide information sought by the Senate about the mining tax.
I will just go through a little bit of history: the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, announced the resource super profits tax on 2 May 2010. It was a tax which we were told would raise $12 billion. Of course, because it was a bad tax pursued by the government through a bad process, the political fortunes of the government started to decline immediately and we know what happened after that. The then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, lost his job and the Treasurer, who was responsible for the tax, not only did not lose his job but got a promotion. Julia Gillard was desperate to enter into a deal with the three biggest mining companies, firstly, to get them off her back politically in the lead-up to an election but, secondly, she was also desperate to ensure that she could maintain the very questionable assertion made by the government of an early surplus. In order to be able to do that she needed to be able to preserve a sufficient level of mining tax revenue for her budget. So what happened is that the government manipulated secret mining tax revenue assumptions. They manipulated assumptions on commodity prices, on production volumes, on exchange rate assumptions moving forward and a whole series of other assumptions.
Dr Henry told a Senate committee that up to 100 assumptions and variables were changed in order to ensure that the government could come up with a $10½ billion mining tax revenue estimate. So, when the tax was first announced, it was going to be $12 billion in revenue. Then it was going to be $10½ billion. The changes in assumptions would have meant that the original tax would have raised billion and, since we have had MYEFO, we are now told that because of variations in exchange rate assumptions moving forward the mining tax will raise $7.4 billion. You can see how relevant these assumptions are yet this government has kept them secret.
This has gone through quite a process. A committee of the Senate asked Dr Henry when he appeared before it to provide that information. He was very careful. He did not refuse to provide information because he knew that would trigger the standing order in relation to public interest immunity claims. Instead he referred those questions to the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, for his decision. The Treasurer, Wayne Swan, as soon as there was a request for information from a senate committee if he was of a mind to refuse to provide that information, needed, in accordance with our standing orders, to identify the ground for his refusal and to specify the harm to the public interest that could result from the disclosure of the information or document. None of that was ever done.
In fact, prior to a second hearing with Treasury secretary, Ken Henry, I wrote to the Prime Minister on 12 July. I asked her to lift the gag on Dr Henry to enable him to answer some very basic questions about the impact of the mining tax on the budget, on the economy, on jobs and, of course on investment in the mining industry and on states like Western Australia and Queensland. To this day I have not had a response from the Prime Minister. I wrote to her on 12 July and to this day I have not had a response to that letter from the Prime Minister. How arrogant is this Prime Minister in refusing to provide this information and not even having the courtesy to respond to my correspondence in relation to it?
What happened then is that the Senate passed three orders of the Senate on two occasions. They were broadly around three issues. They were around the issue of assumptions that were used by the government to estimate the revenue from the original mining tax, the RSPT, and from the revised mining tax, the minerals resource rent tax. In a separate order we sought details on the secret negotiations and deal entered into between the government and BHP, Rio and Xstrata. In a third motion we sought information about how much of the mining tax revenue would come from individual states and territories and how much would come from respective commodities.
It is important to note here that Treasury took questions in relation to this on notice on 5 July at a hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy and to this day these questions remain unanswered. Even more concerning is that in its response to the orders in relation to these matters the government has arrogantly completely ignored the questions about where the revenue from the mining tax is supposed to come from. David Parker, who is the executive director of the revenue group in Treasury, has said that Treasury has already assessed how much mining tax revenue is expected to come from each commodity yet so far we have not been provided with that information. He also said that it would not be very difficult to come up with the information in relation to how much of the mining tax revenue would come from Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and so on.
I would also put on record here that the Western Australian Treasury has put forward very transparently its methodology and its assumptions which led it to the conclusion that up to 65 per cent of the revenue from the mining tax would come from Western Australia. That was back in the middle of July 2010. Nobody from Treasury and nobody from this federal Labor government has had any conversations at all with the Western Australian government either to say that it is wrong or to address any of the concerns that were raised in relation to this. There is serious concern in Western Australia that the mining tax is a tax on Western Australia because 98 per cent of iron ore production across Australia comes from WA and most of the revenue will come from WA.
To cut a long story short, this is an arrogant, secretive government which has repeatedly refused to answer questions and which has not taken seriously orders of the Senate. In fact they have taken them so not seriously that they actually refer to them as ‘a motion made by Senator Cormann on 29 September 2010’. It was not a ‘motion made by Senator Cormann’. It was an order of the Senate. I might have moved the motion in the Senate but it is an order of the Senate. Then they gave us two paragraphs of information that is clearly publicly available in the budget papers, which we did not seek, and they refused to address the information that has been sought.
We were told that the Information Commissioner would be able to review this sort of refusal by government to provide information. The Independents and the Greens presumably—and I am sure they did—entered into this agreement with the government in good faith. It was all about the government clinging on to power and convincing the Independents and the Greens to come on board with them. We now hear from the Information Commissioner that he does not actually have the power under his act, under the legislation that governs his operation, to do what the government promised that they would get the Information Commissioner to do. It is an outrage.",SENATE,<title>MINERALS RESOURCE RENT TAX</title>,<title>Order</title>,Miscellaneous,22,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-11-15,"—I would very briefly like to support Senator Cormann in what he has said. It does again highlight the absolute arrogance of this government in dealing with parliament. I rise simply to draw the attention of the chamber to the absence of the Greens in this debate. The Greens went into an arrangement with the Labor Party—into a coalition one might almost say—to keep Ms Gillard in power as Prime Minister, to keep all the Labor front bench in the ministerial leather, so to speak, and the quid pro quo for that was supposedly greater accountability and openness.
As with most things with the Greens, we know that they are not really what they seem to be. They are not an environmental party at all; they are a radical socialist party. With one or two exceptions, most of their current senators are more interested in radical socialism than they are in the environment. But I would have thought that this would be the sort of debate where the Greens would be here in force. In fact, I would have thought that this would be the sort of issue where the Greens would be saying to Ms Gillard, ‘If you want our support in parliament, you have to make sure that this information that is ordered by the Senate is made available.’ So I totally endorse Senator Cormann’s comments, possibly with one exception, and that is that a lot of the mining tax revenue comes from my state of Queensland. But we will not argue over trifling issues. Certainly Senator Cormann is right, and I had hoped that by this time the Greens might have come down into the chamber to also support Senator Cormann in what is a very, very important issue for parliamentary democracy.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-11-15,"—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the response from the Minister for Health and Ageing to the Senate resolution relating to Motor Neurone Disease Global Day.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The document that has been tabled by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, is in response to a Senate motion that was agreed on 21 June this year. That motion was moved by me. I am happy to say that I have a vested interest in this matter, motor neurone disease. My father died of motor neurone disease back in 1985. My family have been involved with motor neurone disease ever since—my mother, Lady Sally Ferrall, in particular, and now my wife, Kate, who is on the committee in Tasmania.
There are many people in Australia who have motor neurone disease or who are affected in some way by this muscle-wasting disease. It is a very, very difficult situation for all those families who are affected. Approximately one person per day dies of motor neurone disease. It is very sad indeed. On average, life expectancy is about three years from diagnosis to the conclusion of one’s life.
The motion that was put and overwhelmingly passed by the Senate on 22 June—for which I am most grateful—came a day after Motor Neurone Disease Global Day, which was 21 June. That is the solstice. That is the time in the year when there is a turning, there is a change, and that is what we are seeking in the motor neurone disease community. We want to see change. We want to see research which will benefit sufferers. We want to identify research for a cure and we want action so that people with MND and their families can be better cared for.
The motion also identified the need for support, not just for research but in other ways, including disability support. I notice in this letter that has just been tabled by Minister Roxon that she has advised that the government have invested $74,000 in a website. They have provided that support to Motor Neurone Disease Australia. Of course I am thankful for that, on behalf of MND Australia, an association which I am close to. At this stage I want to commend Carol Birks, CEO of MND Australia, for her work. I commend her for her leadership there in that role, together with the board of MND Australia. I congratulate them on their advocacy.
But a website is not good enough. That is a small amount of money. The minister does refer to the funding provided for motor neurone disease research, through the National Health and Medical Research Council, of some $5.2 million in 2009-10. There is also $750,000 over the five years from 2006 to 2011. Frankly, that is a piddling amount of money. We could do so much more. The significant boost in 2009-10 is very much appreciated. There is a reference to the $4.9 million being spent on MND medications through the PBS, but that is not out of the ordinary. That is medication that is due to Australians who have a health condition through no fault of their own. I repeat that: through no fault of their own.
What is important is that there appears to be nothing in this letter from the minister that addresses the disability support scheme. That was particularly referred to in the Senate motion. If the minister or her office are listening, perhaps they could further advise the Senate on the disability support arrangements for this particular chronic disease. I know that letters have been written to the minister from the various associations and members around Australia. I want to read from the Senate motion which the minister has responded to in her letter tabled in the Senate today. The Senate motion read:
That the Senate—
(a)   notes that:
(i)   motor neurone disease (MND) Global Day on 21 June 2010 represents an important opportunity to acknowledge those around the world affected by MND,
(ii)   in Australia alone, more than 1 400 people have MND and the disease takes the life of more than 10 Australians every week—
so more than one every day. The motion continued:
(iii)   there is no known cause in 90 per cent of cases, no cure and no effective treatment for MND, and
(iv)   the most pressing need for those affected by MND and their families includes easy and timely access to appropriate care and support, including access to aids, equipment and assistance with basic daily living such as mobility, communication, feeding and breathing to maintain independence and quality of life; and
(b)   calls on the Government to continue its funding for MND research and improving health and disability services for all those affected.
It seems to me that part (iv) of the motion has not been addressed in this letter. I see that Senator McLucas is in the chamber, and I draw this to her attention as well. What is important is:
… access to aids, equipment and assistance with basic daily living such as mobility, communication, feeding and breathing to maintain independence and quality of life …
This is an important issue for people with MND; let me make that very clear. There is an effort on the part of MND associations around Australia and those with MND and their families to say they need support. This need is as a result of people falling through the cracks between the federal provision and the state provision of health care. Obviously, the federal government is doing what it can and then the state government is doing what it can. I recently wrote to the relevant minister in Tasmania—in fact, the Greens member Nick McKim—on behalf of my constituents and I know that many others have as well. I want to put on the record my thanks to Tim Hynes, President of MND Tasmania, for what he is doing to advance the cause. He has a family member who is directly affected and he is taking a leadership role to try and make a difference.
But we need support in terms of aids, equipment and assistance for people with MND. It is very important. In terms of quality of life, I cannot tell you how important this is. It is very, very tough indeed for families who are affected by this disease. I call on the government to address this issue of support and provide assistance with mobility, communication, feeding and breathing to maintain independence and quality of life. I accept that there was a significant increase in research funding last financial year and I hope that that continues in the years ahead.
Before I conclude, I want to say very briefly that it has been an honour to host MND Australia here in Parliament House. It is great to have other federal members of parliament come and support people with MND and their families, and there were many in this past year and, again, last year and the year before that. So it has been an honour to be able to support them and advance the cause. But, clearly, there is a gap between federal and state government assistance in terms of access to appropriate health care.
In conclusion, I say to the minister: I note the letter and I thank you, but it clearly has not addressed part (iv) of the motion in my view. She may need to raise this at COAG or with her state and territory colleagues with responsibilities in the health or community services portfolios. There is still a lot more to be done, and as long as I have breath in my lungs I will do whatever I can to advocate for people with MND and their families all around Australia and all around the globe. I have been president of the association in Tasmania and on the national board, and I want to thank all the volunteers involved in the various associations for their work. It is a fantastic effort, I really thank them for it, and we will do what we can to assist. I thank the Senate.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Motor Neurone Disease</title>,Documents,23,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-11-15,"—I will pick up where I left off right before question time. The National Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 has been subject to a great deal of review by way of a process that the Australian Greens would normally support—that is, an exposure draft that went out quite broadly through the legal fraternity and elsewhere to civil libertarians, people involved in terrorism cases directly and so on. A huge number of submissions were made. Once we saw the exposure draft, we got the idea that the Australian government would eventually move on the appointment of a national security legislation monitor to go through the terrorism laws that have been introduced over a period of five or six years—to just work through the items that were so inappropriate it is embarrassing that they had even made it onto the statute books. They do not deserve the dignity of a review at all by the monitor when that office eventually comes into effect.
I introduced a bill that either simply repealed or made substantial amendments to many of the different laws of terror. That bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. To my great surprise, rather than doing what a government chaired committee would normally do, which is pay it lip service and then just kill it and propose that the bill not go forward, the work that we did was referred back through to the Attorney-General’s Department to be contemplated in parallel with the work that they were doing on the government’s bill. In other words, the committee certainly did not endorse my bill or any of the proposals therein but the work itself was recognised and the proposals that we put forward were recognised because they were simply invisible—as far as we can tell—in the government’s contemplation of these laws of terror.
It is then extraordinary to see out of that process that absolutely none of those ideas were taken up. We cannot find a hint anywhere that any of those ideas were put forward. When we go into the committee stage of the bill—and I warn the chamber now that I fully intend to do that—we will go into a bit more detail of exactly the opportunity that we are missing today. We have been waiting for this for two years. The legal community has been waiting for this for two years. People who have been unnecessarily surveilled and spied upon have been waiting for this for many years and the opportunity is about to be missed.
The review process, I think, has seen the government pass up a very important and perhaps once-in-a-parliament opportunity to ensure that Australia would remain in compliance with our international human rights obligations, because that is a part of what is at stake here. Instead, we have got this half-hearted and quite feeble attempt to ensure a more proportionate response to antiterrorism in Australia which, apart from a number of cases which I will highlight on the way through as being genuine improvements, it quite simply fails to do.
There is no real justification anywhere in the bill, in the explanatory memorandum and in the second reading speech, and I am presuming in the comments that are to come in the committee stage, for the continued existence of many of the extended powers that law enforcement agencies have been granted since 11 September 2001. Maybe that is because no such justification actually exists in many of the circumstances. The Australian Federal Police, for whom many of these provisions have direct relevance, have at no stage made a submission to the consultation either on the exposure draft or when the substantive bill was put to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. We did not hear anything from the AFP. We brought them in and had them give evidence directly, but they did not see fit to make a submission.
The review process, no matter how robust, is completely pointless if the government is then refusing to listen to the advice of the experts that were made, in this case, through 50 submissions to the consultation and 23 submissions on the bills referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. If you have a look at the tenor of that second batch of submissions to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, you will see it is in essence saying, ‘Hang on a second, why didn’t you listen to us the first time? We will resubmit what we told you before, six or eight months ago, because you appear to have not read a word.’ The government there decided to ignore the majority of recommendations put forward by legal experts at both stages of the consultation process. The failure of the government in this way to utilise the process that it established is noted by the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law which stated:
... of the 267 amendments to Australia’s anti-terrorism legislation proposed in the Bill only 66 of these reflect changes made since the Exposure Draft ... most of these 66 changes can be described as technical (as opposed to substantive) changes.
Organisations that have assisted the parliamentary process in Australia’s antiterrorism legislation must be suffering from what we think is submission fatigue and a sense of hopelessness as Australian Lawyers for Human Rights continued calls for reform to Australia’s antiterrorism legislation have fallen upon deaf ears.
I commented at the outset of my speech on the degree to which the government has moved with haste to quadruple or more ASIO’s resourcing, budget and staff while at the same time being strangely unable to fill the position of the Independent National Security Monitor, which was passed by the Senate earlier this year. Madam Acting Deputy President Troeth, partly through your work, in late 2008 the Senate passed such a bill. I find it utterly extraordinary that the government passed this legislation six months ago and has not seen fit to appoint a part-time person to this role. I would be very interested to see if the minister confirms this, but the government does not want the monitor in place until this feeble attempt at law reform has gone through without criticism from somebody who, I believe, is going to have a great deal of standing and a lot of status in these debates as they are to come.
The government has basically held the monitor out of the way so that it cannot critique this lax attempt at law reform we are seeing this afternoon. I have very little doubt that, if we did have a proper look at whether these laws are proportional, we would need to be recommending much deeper changes than we are seeing this afternoon. All we are seeing today with the proposed government bill effectively is the entrenchment and the consolidation of what was put through in the Howard-Ruddock years, which many people, if they knew what was there, would regret. I intend to take a little bit of time this afternoon to make sure that people are aware of what exactly is still on the statute books that the government is refusing to move. We have been long-time campaigners, as have many coalition senators, for the establishment of such an office and it is a travesty that the office does not exist as yet.
In our additional comments to the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee into the bill, we said that this bill should be deferred until such time that the office of the monitor is on its feet and has had time to review the enormous volume of material that exists and the submissions that have been made. We do not think that this legislation should be passed at all, unless of course the minister is able to stand up shortly and say that as soon as the monitor is up and running the government will come back with a full and frank review of the Australian terror laws, because in the meantime we appear to be simply wasting our time and in some cases entrenching laws that should never have been placed on the statute books in the first place.
The Australian people deserve all legislation to be subject to a very high degree of scrutiny, but particularly laws which impact on our fundamental civil and political rights, which this bill indeed does. They include, for example, the presumption of innocence, which is something that we seem happy to dispense with; the right to a fair trial; freedom of expression; the right to privacy; and freedom from arbitrary detention. I will show this afternoon, as this debate proceeds, that every single one of those fundamental legal principles, some of them hundreds of years old, are threatened by laws on the books that the government is either entrenching or refusing to roll back.
Australia does not have a human rights charter. We do not have a human rights act in any form because the government was too weak to even proceed with that when the criticism got too great. So we have no constitutional or legislative protections of human rights or, at least, very limited protections. Sometimes we might throw to examples in the UK or the United States where there is a constitutional bill of rights. We have no such protections in Australia. Many of the protections that we assume exist are just that—assumed or implied. These laws, I think, go quite a long way towards eroding them.
It makes the process of reviewing these laws all the more important, and the contempt with which the government has treated the consultation and the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee process—and I do not use that word ‘contempt’ lightly, but that is what it was—combined with a failure to have established the independent monitor means that we are just ploughing along with bureaucratic inertia and one minister starts to look very much like the other. It is for this reason that we believe that debate on the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, this bill, should be deferred and it should be referred to the National Security Legislation Monitor so that we can at last get an independent idea of whether these laws are proportional, whether they are necessary and whether the freedoms that we are giving up—whether we know it or not—are actually making us any safer. This will ensure that the bill and Australia’s antiterrorism legislation are subject to proper review by an office that is independent of government. We moved, with some assistance from the coalition, some amendments to that monitor bill to make sure that the reporting obligations of that office would be directly to parliament, that they would not be subject of laundering—if I may use that word—through the Prime Minister’s office to make sure that they were politically saleable. So at least there is something there. But in the meantime the government has decided to circumvent even that meagre protection by simply preventing the office from getting on its feet in the first place.
I found Senator Brandis’s comments earlier really quite extraordinary, that the amendments that we have proposed which are entirely reasonable and actually quite moderate would not be acceptable to the coalition simply because they do not match what the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee recommended. What a remarkable abrogation of responsibility. I hope that Senator Brandis is in here some time later during this debate to explain whether he even read the amendments that we proposed.
I will leave the chamber in absolutely no doubt, as we proceed into the committee stage of this debate, as to why we think we are making a grave mistake here. If other parties will not come to the defence of Australians’ civil and political rights, then the Australian Greens certainly will.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2010-11-15,"—I also support Senator Brandis’s comments earlier and I rise to support the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill 2010. In particular I have an interest in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill. This bill will be doing two things: first of all, expanding the role of the current Australian Crime Commission and changing the Australian Crime Commission PJC into the law enforcement PJC, which will then have responsibility for oversight of the Australian Crime Commission and, in addition, the Australian Federal Police.
The Australian Federal Police have not had an opportunity to report directly to a parliamentary committee, as the Australian Crime Commission has. The Australian Federal Police have really had the oversight through the estimates process, as all agencies and government departments do. By the very nature of the work that the Australian Federal Police undertake, to be able to report to a committee that can meet in camera and can take in camera evidence and can discuss things in a far more private way, it means that parliamentary oversight becomes far more effective. If officers, in particular senior officers, of the Australian Federal Police feel more comfortable discussing more sensitive issues with a parliamentary committee, which would be comprised of members of all sides of this parliament and also both houses, I think that will serve the oversight process far better than currently is the case when every single question is asked from a public scrutiny perspective. The public scrutiny perspective will still continue and is essential, but we need to have the additional ability for the Federal Police to be confident in being able to report to a committee and the committee having the confidence of maintaining a tight jurisdiction and oversight of the Australian Federal Police, as we do with the Australian Crime Commission.
I think that when the public elect members to parliament and the oversight of important agencies such as the Australian Federal Police occurs, the public need to know that the committees are bipartisan and have an ability to probe without damaging any operational aspects and without alarming the public in more sensitive areas. That is the role when you are dealing with agencies that have a more difficult and more secret aspect. However, having 10 parliamentarians with the ability to probe in more detail and feel comfortable probing in the format that a committee such as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement will enable, just adds scrutiny in a far better way to the parliamentary oversight process and should give the public more comfort. I am very, very supportive of that aspect of the bills that we are debating today.
As indicated by Senator Brandis earlier today, we will not be supporting the amendments proposed by the Greens. That is the only contribution I wish to make in relation to these bills, Madam Acting Deputy President Troeth, so I will not detain the Senate any further.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-15,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill 2010. As the Attorney-General mentioned in the House of Representatives, after extensive public consultation these bills were passed by the House of Representatives and were considered by the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs before parliament was prorogued on 19 July 2010. The government took the recommendations of that committee into account in reintroducing the bills.
There have been some points raised during the debate that I would like to take this opportunity to respond to. Senator Ludlam suggested that the government prioritise the national security budget and an expansion of agencies such as the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, but has not given similar priority to review, oversight and accountability mechanisms in relation to national security agencies and the legislation that they operate under. The government makes no apologies for ensuring that agencies with responsibilities for national security matters are appropriately resourced. However, the government is equally committed to a balanced approach to national security by ensuring that there are strong and rigorous oversight and accountability mechanisms in place and that our national security laws remain proportionate to the nature of the threat. The government has demonstrated its commitment to a balanced approach to national security in these two bills.
The National Security Legislation Amendment Bill contains amendments that implement the government’s response to recommendations from several independent and bipartisan reviews of Australian national security and counterterrorism legislation. The National Security Legislation Amendment Bill also contains amendments to expand and enhance the mandate of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is a very important independent oversight mechanism for Australia’s security and intelligence agencies. The inspector-general has extensive powers to monitor and inquire into the actions of those agencies and ensure that they act lawfully, with propriety and with respect for human rights. The National Security Legislation Amendment Bill will enable the inspector-general’s inquiries to extend beyond the six security and intelligence agencies within its core functions so that the inspector-general may examine security and intelligence matters in full where those matters concern other Commonwealth agencies in appropriate circumstances.
The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill is yet another demonstration of the government’s commitment to strong oversight and accountability. This bill implements the government’s commitment to having parliamentary oversight of the Australian Federal Police.
Finally, as senators will know, the government has passed legislation to establish the independent National Security Legislation Monitor to review the operation of Australia’s counterterrorism and national security legislation on an annual basis. The monitor will be a person of high standing with a sound understanding of Australia’s counterterrorism and national security legislation. A short list of preferred candidates is currently being actively considered by the Prime Minister and a decision on the appointment of the monitor is expected shortly. These two bills constitute a package of reforms to Australia’s national security and counterterrorism legislation aimed at ensuring our laws are appropriately targeted and accountable in their operation.
I thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for its detailed consideration of the bills. As indicated by the Attorney-General, the government has accepted or accepted in principle three of the committee’s five recommendations. In response to the first recommendation, the explanatory memorandum now clarifies the reasons for including the proposed urging violence offences in chapter 5 of the Criminal Code.
The government has accepted in principle the recommendation to encourage proactive reporting of matters to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement and the Attorney-General has indicated that he is committed to taking appropriate steps to ensure that this occurs. Once established, the committee may wish to actively engage with the agencies and outline the types of matters that the committee would like to be kept apprised of. It is open to the new committee, in accordance with the normal practices and procedures of parliamentary committees, to request regular briefings from the agencies or to make open or specific requests for written submissions from the agencies on matters concerning the performance of the agencies’ functions.
In response to recommendation 3 and in recognition of the importance of ensuring that the rights of suspects are properly preserved while ensuring that the forensic needs of law enforcement officers are met, the government is also committed to giving further consideration to a broader review of the precharge detention regime in due course once there has been further operational use of and experience with the provisions. As the Attorney-General has indicated, the government has not accepted the Senate committee’s recommendation to remove the good faith defence to the urging violence offences nor has it agreed to reduce the proposed cap on specified disregarded time for terrorism investigations under part IC of the Crimes Act. Repealing the good faith defence would remove an explicit legislative confirmation that the urging violence offences do not capture legitimate expression.
Reducing the cap on the period of specified disregarded time in the investigation of terrorism offences has not been accepted on the basis that the government believes that a maximum cap of seven days is reasonable and appropriate. Accepting these two recommendations would dilute the government’s policy objective of ensuring our national security laws are precise, are appropriately tailored and provide our law enforcement and security agencies with the investigative tools they need to counter terrorism.
In conclusion, our government is confident that the reforms contained in both bills deliver strong laws that protect our safety while preserving democratic rights and protecting our freedoms consistent with the principle of the rule of law. I extend the minister’s appreciation to the Senate committee for their report and to the community for their submissions on the bills, which have contributed to the development of a strong and effective package of reforms. I commend the bills to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bills read a second time.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2010-11-15,"—At this late hour I am pleased to come and speak to the Governor-General’s speech. It has been a while since we have taken up this debate. I heard you call Senator Pratt, who is not in the chamber as she did not see fit to finish her address to the chamber, so I will take up the cudgels there. I am not surprised because I, after all this time, re-acquainted myself with the Governor-General’s speech, thinking perhaps that at the time I might have been a bit unfair on the Governor-General’s speech. I thought it was a drab speech at the time. In fact, I thought it was one of the worst speeches I had heard at the time. I am beginning to think Senator Pratt might think so too. It was a very shallow speech. So I re-acquainted myself with the speech, and I was right—it is one of the most shallow, drab speeches ever delivered by a Governor-General. It is directionless. I will read you some gems from the speech.

Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—

—I see Senator Collins is interjecting—still got life even at this late hour. I will read certain parts of that speech to prove my point. By the way, this is just a sideline—I have done some very deep research, which I would like to address the chamber on, on certain matters to do with industrial relations—but I thought it was necessary to point this out. I will read a couple of gems that came out of that Governor-General’s speech because—I do this for a reason—it will epitomise the very direction of the government since that speech. For example:
During this term, the government will pursue plans to reduce the tax burden on the business sector, simplify tax returns for ordinary taxpayers.
They will reduce the tax burden—then the speech goes on to say they are going to introduce a mining tax. I always thought tax reform had more to do with reducing the tax burden on the taxpayer. Their idea of tax reform is to introduce a tax. But then it gets better:
Further deliberations on the nation’s taxation system will be considered at a public forum to be held by mid 2011, which will re-examine the Henry tax review ...
Following that forum, the government will hold a debate on tax reform in the Australian parliament, enabling all senators and members to express their views.
So a forum and a debate will be held. It is the same old rhetoric—same old, same old. Nothing new came out of this address it all. I though—and I see Senator Nash is in the chamber—that we might get something for the rural and regional areas, considering they had to pander to the Independents to win government. So I went to the Governor-General’s address and saw that, under ‘Building Regional Australia’, this is what we got:
Accordingly the government has appointed a new cabinet level minister for regional Australia—
Who, by the way, is Simon Crean. What an offence! They could have put Senator Carr in the position; it would be just as credible. So we have a Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government supported by a whole new bureaucracy, a whole new department, for regional Australia. They go a step further for regional Australia, saying they have set up a House of Representatives committee on regional Australia. We have always had one in the Senate and it has been a very good one.

Senator Nash interjecting—

—Senator Nash, you have been on it. I have been on it myself, for 10 years plus, with Senator Heffernan and the guy who is over in New York—what was his name? I have already forgotten him.
—Senator O’Brien.
—Senator O’Brien, of course, very diligent! That is what we got. That was the Governor-General’s speech. There was nothing but rhetoric going in circles. It epitomises and sets the pattern of this government. Look at today’s agenda. We have got two weeks of parliament. We are not sitting in December at all. It is the first time I have ever known parliament not to sit in December. This is a government that has ground to a halt. Look at today’s agenda. We have got three bills on it, all noncontroversial. Thank goodness for the Greens’ minutiae and petty questions on what is a terrorist organisation. However, it was padded out for the government for hours and hours; if it had not been for that we would be on this discussion a lot earlier. You have got three noncontroversial bills.
I was outside before and I had to rush back in to see what tomorrow will bring. You are reintroducing noncontroversial bills. This side is not even against them. This is your agenda for 2010—you do not have one. This is going to be a long week for the government, and it is going to be a long two weeks if this is what you are putting up.
Nothing much is happening down in the House of Representatives either. You want to take heed of some of your wise counsel—though I do not know whether you would call them that. Former Senator Richardson used to be in this chamber and I remember him well. I was going to say I used to serve with him—well, combat with him—and he was a fearsome warrior. You know that yourself, on your own side. He has killed plenty off on your side. He came out last week and said, ‘Get an agenda.’ Richo was always one for advice. But he is right: get an agenda, Prime Minister Gillard. You have not got one today. This address-in-reply to the Governor-General was not even on the red. I do not think that it has been on the red all week; it has just been sitting in reserve. Certainly it was not in today. You have rushed it in today. Richo said, ‘Get an agenda.’

Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—

—I read the Governor-General’s speech again and there is not much of an agenda there. This is epitomising the whole Gillard government. They have ground to a halt. You have got more advice from the so-called ‘Father of the Labor Party’. He is a great warrior too, Senator John Faulkner. He has lost interest lately, though; he did not even turn up today. I do not know where he was today.
—He did too!
—I never saw him at question time and I was looking for him. I am always interested when Senator Faulkner enters the chamber. But the light has gone off on Senator Faulkner, but nevertheless he says to you—

Senator Carol Brown interjecting—

—Yes, it has gone off on me too. Senator Faulkner offered this advice to you about the Labor Party. He said this about the current government which is no more than a month or two old:
... we are very long on cunning and very short on courage.
That was a very courageous thing for him to say, but how right he is. You have not got an agenda. You have ground to a halt. It is if you are shell-shocked about the election result. You are tired. You are not interested. We saw it at question time with Senator Carr. He was asked a question, a two-to three-minute question—however long this new system runs for—and he sat down after 30 seconds. What do you think the issue was? It happened to be the issue of the day—security, asylum seekers and border security. He is the spokesman in this chamber for it and he sat down after 30 seconds, unable to even waffle through the question. He is tired. He is shell-shocked. He is not interested. He is unbriefed.
Listen to your own. If you do not want to listen to the former Senator Richardson—and I would not blame you—or Senator Faulkner, listen to an up-and-comer within your own ranks, Senator Cameron. He is calling you zombies. He has said that you have all had lobotomies. I have kept his quote, do not worry about that.
—You cannot find it now.
—No, I can find Senator Cameron’s quote, for sure. I cannot believe he had the courage to do it.
—Have a look at page 1 of the Notice Paper.
—I have looked. I have got the red. In all my time I have never seen such a shallow agenda on a Monday with only two weeks of parliament left. God, I remember the last two weeks when the question used to be: would we still be here at Christmas time? We would be pumping through the reforms—the sale of Telstra, the VSU legislation—it was one bill after another. You might not have liked it but we had an agenda.
I will tell you what Senator Cameron said—do not distract me, because this has to go down in the Hansard. Dougie said—
 (Senator Moore)—Senator, that is not the appropriate way to address Senator Cameron.

Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—

—Senator Cameron said that we were the rabble? It has turned out that you are the rabble. Dougie has worked out that you are the rabble. He says:
‘They are stifled in the caucus, they are stifled in the public’—
God, you cannot even speak frankly to the public, according to Senator Cameron—
Cameron said of Labor’s MPs, ‘and so people see the Labor Party having no values and no vision on a whole range of issues and I think that must change ...
It seems to be like having a political lobotomy.’
They are ‘zombies’, he said. You could not be more frank than that. I make this observation because it is only Monday of a two-week sitting. I have got to make my calls early these days and my call is this: if this drift goes on much longer—and I am only talking about until Christmas time—those polls are going to lock in. You are about the only government that has never enjoyed a honeymoon. Every government in history since Federation has enjoyed a honeymoon. You have never even had a honeymoon under this Prime Minister, and she is now collapsing in the polls. Your primary vote now is getting to very dangerous levels and if it still holds till Christmas, I will make this call now: you are gone. You will be having an election this time next year.
What is more, the Prime Minister—with all those polls around personalities and the capabilities of the leadership—is now starting to slump. That was always something you could hang onto under Kevin Rudd as compared to the opposition leader, or Julia Gillard as compared to the opposition leader. But now that has fallen. Now that is slumping in the polls. And if that is not turned around by Christmas, and you have not got much time to act, then I say that that is going to lock in and the public are not going to be turned around by any of your false rhetoric.
You have a Prime Minister who is a giggling gertie in this country and on her overseas trips. That is all I ever see. She has become an embarrassment with all of the giggling that goes on. There is nothing statesmanlike about the Prime Minister at all. She has become a total embarrassment. I only make those points as a sideline to the real address I want to make.
Whilst I berate and point out to you—no worse than your own side, by the way: Senator Faulkner, Senator Cameron or former Senator Richardson, who is really laying it out for you—there is one policy you will introduce that concerns me greatly as a Victorian senator. I have no doubt you will introduce a policy at some point in this term to strip and effectively abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. As a Victorian senator I am very concerned about this because the building and construction industry is one of the largest industries in Victoria. It drives Victoria. Of course, it was the epicentre of the Cole royal commission into the corruption and the illegalities of this industry. It basically all came out of Victoria.
—That’s rubbish.
—‘Rubbish’ says Senator Collins.
—You need to go back and look at the Cole report.
—I have looked at the Cole report, and I have plenty of it here. I happened to have this land on my desk recently. The man your side axed, the head of the commission, Mr John Lloyd—
—Another Howard political appointment.
—No. This was a man with royal commission powers. He was totally independent.
—We know the powers he was given.
—You have just shown your colours, and you are a Victorian too. You know only too well the goings-on, the culture and the illegalities that the royal commission found in Victoria. I am going to run out of time, but Mr Lloyd, the former Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, said in his last annual report, which has just been handed down:
The performance outlined in this report demonstrates that unlawful conduct continues. This is especially so in Victoria. Victoria is responsible for 61 per cent of legal proceedings commenced during 2009-10. Similarly, Victoria represents 40 per cent of investigations and 68 per cent of compulsory examinations. Also, Western Australia continues to be overrepresented in ABCC data.
It is unclear exactly why this situation persists. The construction unions and some contractors appear committed to continue unlawful practices and possibly regard prosecution by the ABCC as an acceptable business risk.
                         …                   …                   …
The attainment of the outcomes is a credit to ABCC staff. They are professional and dedicated. Some encounter abuse, taunts, being photographed and physical provocation when going about their work. On occasions this has involved assaults, matters that are and will continue to be reported to the Police.
And he expressed his appreciation of the police.
So Victoria, I repeat, was the epicentre of the Cole royal commission and it still is after so many years of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Yet, as a payback to the union for their $64 million in the 2007 campaign and less obviously in the 2010 campaign, for the money they give the Labor Party and for the outright control that they have of the Labor Party not just at a national conventions, which we know is up to 50 per cent of the vote, but in the preselections of all of those on the other side—every single one of them belongs to a union; it is compulsory—this legislation will make its way back to this chamber and will, with the support of the Greens, be in danger of passing the Senate.
This concerns me greatly. It concerns me not just because of the lawlessness and not just because of the knock-on costs to households, small businesses and small and large developers. It has a productivity effect over the whole economy, not just in Victoria. Enough evidence came out of the Senate inquiry into this in 2009 and from independent sources such as the Bureau of Statistics and other economic data. I will refer to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics from September 2009. It states that, over the seven years that the commission has been operating, there has been a 10 per cent increase in the industry productivity. Even the weekly wages in the industry have increased because of productivity, because the strike numbers are down, because the corruption is down, because the payoffs are down and because work is being finished on time or ahead of time in some cases. Because of the watchdog with teeth watching over this industry these have been the knock-on effects.
It is such a large industry that if costs start to blow out because of lawlessness, because of strikes, because of slow work days and because of increases, you will get a CPI increase. The economic data shows that the CPI has been positively affected. It is some 1.2 per cent lower than it would have been had the watchdog not been on the prowl.
With only a minute or so to go, I signal my deep concern that post July this legislation will be rushed through the parliament as a payback to the unions. It will have devastating effects on my state of Victoria in the building and construction industry. It will return all of the intimidation, lawlessness, the crime and the corruption. We have already got it at a certain level. Without the watchdog it will explode. We already have the Mick Gattos wandering around. He even has to be careful. We have even got the sycophants to the Mick Gattos from the larger companies.
This is not just about unions, but predominantly it is about the corruption and the lawlessness of the unions. There is a lot corruption and lawlessness by some of the big construction companies too. There are a lot of them that hire the Mick Gattos of this world. There are a lot of them that allow the criminality onto their sites. As John Lloyd rightly said, they seem to think it is a legitimate risk. We have to take that legitimate risk away from them for the sake of the public.
So I alert the Senate to this. I condemn the Labor Party. Someone from the other side should just stand up and condemn this legislation and this policy that will be coming up, I am sure, after July.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,28,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-11-15,"—That is quite an extraordinary act to follow for an address-in-reply—you really will be missed, Senator McGauran. The Governor-General’s speech, which this debate addresses and which was some time ago now, I found quite fascinating. It is only my second experience of an address-in-reply in my brief time here, being halfway through the term. I listened to the speech quite intently, partly because it is an expression of what the government is most proud of and because it is an indication of the agenda they are setting for the next couple of years. But I was also listening most acutely to hear what was not in the speech—what the government is doing, what its agenda is and what legislation it pursues that did not make its way into the speech—because I think that will probably tell us a little about what the government is up to that it is not proud of.
So, considering the kind of day that I have had, I am probably going to focus somewhat on the negative. But isn’t it interesting that there was nothing in the speech on the proposal for mandatory filtering of the internet? There was nothing in it on what we witnessed this afternoon, the entrenchment and furthering of the laws of terror. There was nothing in it on data retention, the Attorney-General’s proposal to start logging all the material and traces that people leave behind in web traffic and email and so on. But, most strikingly, there was nothing in the speech, nothing that any of the relevant ministers had sought to put forward, about how we were about to outsource our foreign policy to uranium-mining companies for the short-term interests of the nuclear industry here and overseas.
Australia is on the verge potentially—if people around the country have bulldozers driven over them in the next couple of months and years—of becoming the No. 1 uranium provider in the world. We will be selling uranium at that stage to most of the world’s nuclear weapons states, including places—obviously, most recently, such as Russia and China—with rather a queasy proliferation record. We will be the No. 1 uranium provider, providing jobs, providing tax and royalty revenues and providing the boost to the economy that the government never ceases to spruik. Why wasn’t that in the speech? Is that not something the government is proud of? I found that rather curious.
For the amount of time that Minister Martin Ferguson spends enabling and furthering the interests of this industry, you would have thought he would have managed to get a mention into the Governor-General’s speech—something about how proud the government is that it is taking this step towards becoming the world’s supplier of uranium to nuclear weapons states. But there was not a peep.
There was nothing in there about how the Australian government is pursuing the Howard agenda of a radioactive waste dump in the Northern Territory. It was an issue that played very heavily in the federal election campaign. Certainly in Melbourne it played its part in the huge swing we saw against the minister, the member for Batman, Martin Ferguson. I can tell those folk who did not manage to visit the NT during the election campaign, as I was fortunate enough to do, that in the NT it was in the top three or four issues that were debated. There was nothing in the speech about that. Nor was there anything about the Northern Territory intervention, which is dramatically unpopular in the NT.
There was nothing in there about our support for the United States nuclear weapons umbrella or the fact that Australia, while far from being a de facto nuclear weapons state ourselves, relies on security assurances from our alliance with the United States. Unlike New Zealand, which managed to kick free that prop decades ago, Australia still relies on the United States government’s ability to provoke Armageddon at any particular time and annihilate cities at the throw of a switch for our so-called security. There was nothing about that.
Speaking of outsourcing our foreign policy to multinational uranium-mining companies, it is important to mention the agreement that the Prime Minister announced recently about uranium sales to Russia. This has been coming for some time. Shortly after I arrived here I took my place on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which published a document on uranium sales to Russia. It was not merely a majority report; it was a unanimous report, I believe. It pointed out that certain criteria would need to be observed before any such sales could be contemplated. The government has chosen to simply sidestep that—set it to one side, ignore that risk—in the cause of increasing uranium exports to Russia, for which there was no apparent mention that I could discern in the speech. Perhaps this is something that the Australian government is not so proud of. There were not multiple press releases put out. It was not an announcement that was heralded. It was dropped at a very odd day, very late in the day, too late for the newspapers and so on.
I would like to go back briefly and identify some of the issues that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties put into the public domain and put forward for the government to consider, just in case there is that small moment or that small pause for hesitation for the Australian government to contemplate whether doing this to our foreign policy is a good idea. And it is a foreign policy issue, not a mining or a resources issue. When you get into the uranium business, you are engaging in foreign policy whether you like it or not, and you are engaging in a very old and very nasty story that is now three generations old about what happens to this material when it leaves Darwin.
There are 32 nuclear power reactors now operating in Russia. Twenty-three of those were constructed prior to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Russian generators are generally licensed for 30 years, but 12 of the current reactors have been operating for more than 30 years. Late in 2000, plans were announced by Russian authorities for lifetime extensions of these 12 first-generation reactors. So the extension period is now envisaged at between 15 and 25 years. So currently operating in Russia are an early generation of nuclear reactors that were designed and built before the Chernobyl explosion and that will be operating for a period of up to 40 or 50 years—that is, longer than most of the operators who will be running the plant have been alive.
By the late 1990s Russian authorities were exporting nuclear reactors and related technology to China and India. India, of course, is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In August this year Russia announced that it would begin the start-up of Iran’s only nuclear power plant. Uranium fuel shipped by Russia into Iran began use at the Bushehr reactor on 21 August despite the fact that Iran refuses to sign up to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which would make it subject to international monitoring of its atomic safety standards. That is looking at the state of Russia’s peaceful nuclear sector.
The foreign minister will need to stand up here every now and again in this building, as he has done in the past, on the announcement of some kind of grievous breach of international protocol by the Iranian government in starting up this plant or operating uranium centrifuges in apparent contravention of international obligations. The foreign minister will say: ‘Actually, folks, Iran is a grave threat to international security. You don’t mess around when it comes to nuclear weapons.’ But we are potentially about to start, at the behest of Rio Tinto, BHP and their allies in the uranium mining sector, large-scale exports of this bomb fuel to the Russian government.
We have contemplated the state of Russia’s peaceful nuclear sector. The Institute for Political and Military Analysis, which is a Moscow based non-government research organisation, reports that Russia has 3,100 nuclear warheads. The US Department of State claimed in April 2009 that the correct figure is around 3,909. Russia also has a large but unknown number of tactical nuclear weapons. Russia is actively producing and developing new nuclear weapons, manufacturing Topol-M, or SS-27, intercontinental ballistic missiles since 1997. That puts them in direct and fundamental breach of their obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to stand these things down and dismantle them once and for all, but the Australian government seems to think it is appropriate that we start shipping this material to them nonetheless. So the very real security and proliferation concerns of uranium deals with Russia were spelled out, in my view, forensically by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties late in 2008. It was a committee that urged the Australian government not to undertake this same sale. The government has blindly dismissed these warnings. It is an example of short-term profits taking precedence over long-term health and security interests. There is cross-border and internal aggression from the Russian government, there is an ongoing abuse of power and corrosion of democracy in that country, there is persecution and assassination of journalists and critics, including with radioactive material, there is alleged election rigging, there is an ageing nuclear power sector and there is a vast and growing nuclear arsenal. All of these things make a compelling case against uranium sales to Russia, which was probably why it was neglected and did not find its way into the Governor-General’s speech.
Even if we forget the past, as supporters of the deal announced by the Prime Minister at the G20 conference exist, we cannot ignore the future. This is the kind of really blind self-interest at the behest of the uranium mining sector that mars us as a country. It is not enough for the Australian government to step back and say, ‘If we don’t sell this material then other people will’, because quite frankly that is the defence of the heroin dealer. If this trade is bad and toxic and the Labor Party has struggled with this issue for decades then under no circumstances should we condone it on the grounds that if we do not sell this material somebody else will. That is not good enough. I look forward in the next address-in-reply speech to being able to comment on the Governor-General’s acknowledgement that uranium mining is in the process of being phased out in Australia and that this carcinogenic and obsolete trade has no place in a modern and sustainable Australia of which all of us wish to be proud.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,28,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2010-11-15,"—I would like today, in this 43rd parliament, to reply to Her Excellency’s address and discuss some of the aspects of the Governor-General’s speech. But firstly I would like to congratulate all the newly elected and returned senators and members, especially those on this side of the chamber. For each elected and returned member or senator, each term brings the wonderful honour of representing the constituencies that have elected them. It is also a profound responsibility to uphold the interests of the constituency and all Australians in this great parliament. To those who sat in the 42nd parliament and were unsuccessful in re-election, I offer my deepest commiseration, as each of us can respect the demanding nature of this place and each of us can value the individual contributions made in the desire to make the lives of Australians better no matter the ideology or side that we sit on.
I would also like to take the time to congratulate my South Australian colleagues on a successful campaign which saw a positive swing towards the Labor Party on a two-party-preferred basis. The sitting members of parliament achieved some amazing swings for the Labor Party, none more so than Kingston member Amanda Rishworth, who achieved a 9½ per cent swing, the largest to the Labor Party in this election. I would also like to congratulate Mr Nick Champion, the member for Wakefield, on his substantial swing, and Annabel Digance’s hard fought campaign in Boothby, which made it Australia’s third most marginal seat.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2010-11-15,"—Tonight I rise to speak on two very important health issues that are close to my heart. I am speaking about brain tumours and mental health and, in particular, the link between the two. I know I have spoken on both issues in this place previously, but I really believe it is important that the community be educated about these health issues, and I am pleased to be able to do my part to help raise awareness. Brain Tumour Alliance Australia, or BTAA, and beyondblue are two organisations that play an important role in educating the community and also in supporting people who suffer from brain tumours and mental health issues, respectively. These organisations have joined together to raise awareness about the link between brain tumours and mental health. They have been supported by a number of medical professionals, including associate Professor Jane Turner, Dr Eng Siew-Koh and Dr Ally Rooney.
On 28 October I was pleased to host the two organisations at Parliament House in Canberra and launch their joint project, a fact sheet titled ‘Brain tumours, depression and anxiety disorders’. The six-page fact sheet includes information about what brain tumours are, the symptoms and treatment, and advice on managing resulting mental health conditions. There is also advice for carers so that they can stay in the best possible health to ensure that they can provide much-needed support for their loved one. Contact details for a variety of support organisations are also included. There were about 40 people present at the launch, including senators; members; staff; members of the press gallery; and people from the broader community, many of whom have had brain tumours of varying degrees and types.
The CEO of beyondblue, Ms Leonie Young, travelled to Canberra for the launch. Ms Young said:
Being aware of the early signs of depression and anxiety means those who may be affected can get the right treatment. We know that brain tumours increase the risk of depression and anxiety, but people who are well informed about their illness are more able to make decisions and get help early.
This launch also doubled as the launch of International Brain Tumour Awareness Week. I was honoured to be able to represent the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Nicola Roxon MP, who was unfortunately unable to attend due to other parliamentary commitments. There were other speakers at the launch, and they included Mr Matthew Pitt, Chairman of BTAA and a brain tumour survivor; as I mentioned, Ms Leonie Young, CEO of beyondblue; Ms Sarah Mamalai who is also a brain tumour survivor and has suffered from a mental health condition as a result; Ms Tracey Kristiansen, a carer and fundraiser; and Ms Mary Anne Rosier, who has lost two siblings to brain tumours. Mr Denis Strangman, Secretary of BTAA and Chair of the International Brain Tumour Alliance, was the MC for the event.
Listening to all the speakers tell their stories was a very moving experience. Sarah Mamalai is in her 30s, married with two children and was diagnosed three years ago. She has had two brain surgeries and has had chemotherapy as well as radiation treatment. She has also suffered emotionally and this resulted in a suicide attempt which she acknowledges was fortunately not completed. Despite all this, with the support of her husband, Oscar, and the love of her two young children, Sarah is now thriving. She has even walked the Kokoda Track. Sarah is full of determination and genuinely believes laughter is the best medicine. Sarah spoke very frankly about her personal experience and it was obviously very hard for her to do this. Her speech had a great impact on the audience and what a message she sent.
Mary Anne Rosier spoke of the heartbreak of losing two siblings to brain tumours. She also talked about her surprise at the link between brain tumours and depression and anxiety disorders. Mary Anne spoke of her review of literature on the subject of the link between brain tumours and mental health. She told us the most respected papers put incidences at between 25 and 38 per cent of patients. Caregiver Tracey Kristiansen spoke about caring for her husband who has a brain tumour and also her fundraising efforts. On the pamphlet that we launched, Matthew Pitt stated:
This resource will allow people to recognise the symptoms of depression and anxiety. It will allow them to understand that anxiety and depression are common in people living with a brain tumour, and effective treatment options are available.
We urgently need to find a cure for brain tumours. We also need to find extra support for people living with the disease and for their carers. One of BTAA’s key functions is preparing and distributing information material to patients and their carers and we see this resource as vital for people living with brain tumours and their carers.
Denis Strangman told the meeting that the launch was the most important brain tumour related event to have occurred in federal parliament since May 2004. This was when a bipartisan resolution in the House of Representatives brought attention to the needs of brain tumour patients.
I take this opportunity to sincerely thank all of the speakers for their involvement and also to acknowledge that speaking on such emotional and personal issues is obviously not easy. They all did a wonderful job and I am sure I speak for everyone who was present when I say that we all admired their courage. I also thank the members and senators and their staff who supported this event by attending and, in the case of many senators and members, by wearing the grey awareness ribbons circulated by BTAA. That show of support meant so much to the representatives in the building on the day.
I also acknowledge the strong commitment the Gillard Labor government is making to fighting illness and cancers, including brain tumours. The government considers research into brain tumours and depression—which are linked—as vitally important to the quality of life, health and wellbeing of people affected by these illnesses, their carers and families. In 2006, 1,402 new cases of brain cancer were diagnosed in Australia, representing just over one per cent of all cancers. Brain tumours often affect people's mental health, including through depression and anxiety disorders. Of course, a diagnosis of cancer does not just affect the person diagnosed but affects the family, caregivers and friends.
The work of beyondblue is a significant component of the Gillard government’s commitment to improve the lives of people with mental illness. Over the next four years the government will provide $36.8 million for beyondblue, the national depression initiative, to continue and build upon its great work. The Brain Tumour Alliance Australia provides an important role in representing the brain tumour community from the viewpoint of the patient, the family and the caregiver. The government, through Cancer Australia, is supporting research, clinical trials and cancer support networks to improve outcomes of those affected by brain cancers. Our commitment to fight cancer is clear.
In conclusion, I thank once again all the people who spoke at the launch. As I said, it is not easy for any of those people to stand up and lay their lives open like that. I also thank BTAA and beyondblue for all the hard work that they do to raise awareness and to support people when that support is absolutely critical. I encourage everyone to visit their websites www.beyondblue.org.au and www.btaa.org.au and to spend some time learning about these illnesses.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Health</title>,Adjournment,29,1,speech
