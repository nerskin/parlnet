"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"—This legislation empowers the government to privatise the remaining government shareholding in Telstra. It empowers the government to ensure that Telstra becomes a fully privatised company and ceases to have any government ownership. It also entails a number of other provisions, which I will make comments on later in my contribution. But, at the outset, let me make one thing plain: the Labor Party is absolutely opposed to the privatisation of Telstra and will fight this legislation tooth and nail in the parliament, both in the House and in the Senate.
It is worth reminding the Australian people that there is only one political party that is represented in this parliament that has stood steadfast in its opposition to the privatisation of Telstra. The government want to privatise it. The National Party have cravenly buckled to pressure from the Liberal Party, have abandoned their rural constituents and are going to support the privatisation of Telstra. The various minor parties, such as the Greens, the Democrats and One Nation, have all had the wobbles on the issue at various times in the past year or two. The only party that have consistently opposed the sale of Telstra are the Labor Party, and we will continue to oppose this legislation.
We do so for some pretty fundamental reasons. Our starting point in this debate is that telecommunications services are essential services. All Australians need telecommunications services, particularly the traditional telephone, in order to function and participate in our society as equal citizens. They need them for work, for staying in touch with loved ones, for recreation and for safety. Telecommunications services are essential services. In that context, Telstra is still, in spite of the fantasies of some of the people who run it, largely a public utility and, indeed, it is a public utility which is still predominately a monopoly, because it presides over a natural monopoly asset: the fixed line network. Telstra delivers essential services to all Australians. It is still predominantly a public utility. It is a monopoly in most respects and, for those reasons in particular, the Labor Party continue to support government ownership of Telstra.
A privatised Telstra would be a giant private monopoly, too powerful for any government to effectively regulate, that would dictate policy on regulatory issues and would seek to exploit its monopoly power both in telecommunications and in other sectors. Equally significantly, such a privatised giant would inevitably focus on the most lucrative markets in the major cities, following the dollars as its private shareholders would inevitably dictate, at the expense of less lucrative markets in regional Australia and of lower income earners. A privatised Telstra would be a giant private monopoly that would leave town faster than the banks. It would denude country Australians of the opportunity for equal access to services, which they are entitled to and which they seek relative to Australians living in the cities.
Under the Howard government, we have been able to get some indication of what Telstra will be like if it is privatised. If you look at the recent track records of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, and the Prime Minister with regard to the control of Telstra, we can see in gory detail precisely what a Telstra in private hands is going to look like. In the past four years, capital investment by Telstra has dropped from $4.5 billion to $3.2 billion and it is going to drop further. Similarly, staffing in Telstra has plummeted. Over the same period, from 1999-2000 to 2002-03, jobs in Telstra have dropped from 50,761 to 37,627, and more job cuts are planned. These jobs are predominantly those of people working out in the field: maintaining and fixing the network, upgrading the network, installing lines—doing all the traditional work that is required to deliver telecommunications services to people. They are not predominantly the people in offices and the people managing the organisation; they are the people who are hands-on and directly involved in delivering services. 
Over that period, Telstra has managed to lose somewhere in the vicinity of $2½ billion in investments in Asia—for example, by owning a Hong Kong mobile phone company. What business the taxpayers have in owning a mobile phone company in Hong Kong is, of course, an interesting question. The very unfortunate thing is that Telstra has not learnt its lesson from these investments. It does have some defence in that every major telecommunications company in the world was following the dotcom and the expand-globally fads in the late nineties but, unlike others, it has not learnt its lesson. So it is still pouring money into investments in Hong Kong and other places when experience should have taught it that this is simply a route to disaster and is totally incompatible with its responsibilities to Australians, to Australian taxpayers and to its majority owners—the Australian people.
I will round out this broad picture of telecommunications services under the Howard government and what Telstra will look like as a privatised entity by mentioning that, over that time, line rental fees—the price the average Australian pays for the privilege of having a telephone in their home—have skyrocketed. Three and a bit years ago, the price for getting a phone in your home—that is, just for the privilege of having a telephone there, without including a single cent for a call—was $11.65 per month. That figure is now between $23.50 and $26.50 a month. In the next year or two it will rise to over $30 per month. Within the space of four or five years, the price for the privilege of having a telephone in your home, before you pay for a single telephone call, is going to soar to well over $400 a year. That is where telecommunications services and supply are heading under the Howard government. That is where a privatised Telstra will take telecommunications services in the future.
Also over this period, Telstra has sought to expand its influence to other sectors, particularly the media, by attempting to buy the Nine Network. Again, we might well ask what business the taxpayer has owning a commercial media organisation—although, if recent suggestions are any guide, the government does have some ambition of turning the ABC into a commercial media organisation by introducing paid advertising. Nonetheless, my assertion—and I am sure it is the assertion of all members on this side of the parliament—is that Telstra, as a publicly owned organisation, has absolutely no business owning a commercial media organisation. There is no role for the public sector in owning a mainstream commercial television network such as Channel 9.
What has been occurring is very straightforward and simple: a reduced service, a poorer network and more problems, particularly in regional Australia. I get letters and emails from people all around the country literally every day complaining about these matters. There are fewer people doing the work, there is less investment and there are higher prices for line rental fees in particular. The money has not been given back in reduced call costs, contrary to the government's propaganda. In the first five months of the new line rental fees in the latter part of last year, Telstra reaped an extra $124 million from those increases. It returned a measly $43 million in reductions in call costs. So much for the theory that Telstra will take with one hand and give with the other! The end result is that over $80 million has been taken straight out of consumers' pockets for delivering precisely the same services and products that were previously being delivered. 
Also during this period, we have seen Telstra get into the influence peddling game. It has supplied plasma TVs worth $15,000 for free, for months of use, to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston. The CEO of Telstra, Dr Switkowski, addressed the Liberal Party fundraiser for the Treasurer. It has also been revealed that, if Dr Switkowski is dismissed for poor performance, as well as his $2.5 million salary and any other entitlements he has, he will be given an additional bonus of $1 million-plus as he walks out the door after being dismissed. That is a pretty good incentive for failure. This is all part of the picture of what a privatised Telstra is going to look like. The Howard government is privatising Telstra from within. It is allowing the company to be run and administered as it were already privately owned.
I did say that Telstra is still predominantly a monopoly. The minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts sneered at that suggestion a little while ago. The facts support my assertion. Roughly 95 per cent of the profits made in telecommunications in Australia today are made by Telstra. Telstra constitutes over two-thirds of the entire industry. That looks pretty much like a monopoly to me. Telstra exerts enormous power in telecommunications and its reach is universal. That monopoly power must be constrained, because most of it is a natural monopoly which is one of the traditional bases for public ownership in our system of government.
Telstra's prices for its basic products have been going up, its performance has been deteriorating, its service in the network is deteriorating, jobs are being slashed, investment is being slashed and it is losing huge amounts of money in Asia and, while all of these things have been occurring, in the most critical area of new technology for Australia and the Australian economy—namely, broadband—Telstra is letting Australia go backwards. We are now 19th in the OECD in terms of the number of broadband connections in households. We are way behind equivalent nations like Canada. We are 19th because Telstra has been dragging the chain. Why? Because it is under virtually no pressure from its majority owner, the Australian government, to push hard to get broadband out to all Australians. It is so dominant in the marketplace that it is not under much competitive pressure within the market to do it, either. Because Telstra controls Foxtel, the main potential source of competition in broadband, it is able to protect itself from unwanted competition and ensure that its existing products, like ISDN, can be milked for all the revenue they can provide, even though they are outdated and do not deliver the kinds of speeds that Australians, and Australian small businesses in particular, will increasingly need.
This is not just a niche issue. It is a fundamentally important issue for the development of regional Australia. If communications access is equal in quality and extent in a location outside the major cities when compared with access within the major cities, the huge differential in land and rental prices will mean that many parts of regional Australia will have a tremendous economic advantage. They will be very attractive for many kinds of small and medium sized businesses, which could locate themselves in those areas. But the crucial thing is communications access. 
I recently addressed a forum in Caboolture, where a small business person was talking about his experiences and his inability to get broadband services. He was regretting the fact that he had established in Caboolture, because of the fact that he could not get access to broadband, even though establishing his business in that area was good for that part of regional Queensland, outside the greater Brisbane area, and obviously very important in delivering jobs to a growth area in regional Australia.
There are many other examples of this problem. I met with the Wanneroo council in northern Perth a little while ago. They were lamenting the fact that Telstra refuses to provide ADSL broadband to most of the exchanges in their area. They are worried that a dormitory suburb will emerge, because enormous growth is occurring in their area, and that there will be very few jobs and people will commute en masse to Perth rather than work in jobs in the local area. In their view—quite correctly, I think—it is crucial to the development of that area that broadband is available so that small- and medium-sized businesses can have access to high-quality telecommunications services that will enable them to become established there rather than in the centre of Perth. So, once again, under the control of the Howard government Telstra is failing. Telstra is failing to deliver broadband at the level that Australians are entitled to. We are falling behind the rest of the world in what is an absolutely crucial part of Australia's future economic development.
While all this is occurring, other sectors of the telecommunications scene are also languishing, particularly services in regional Australia. Everywhere I go in regional Australia, I get complaints about mobile service standards and coverage and Internet drop-outs. These are issues that the Estens inquiry—which was run by a personal friend of the Deputy Prime Minister and a member of the National Party and which was a total whitewash—conveniently chose to ignore in its recommendations to the government on regional telecommunications services. The picture in regional Australia is dramatically different from the view that the government would have you believe. According to the government everything is fine, everything is up to scratch, there are no serious problems and it is now appropriate that Telstra be privately owned. The reality out there is actually the direct opposite of what the government says.
Over this period, contrary to its obligations to the Australian community, Telstra has been outsourcing information technology responsibilities increasingly to workers in India and has plans to ultimately outsource its entire information technology activities to India, bit by bit. It is imposing requirements on some of the Australian based contractors that effectively are forcing them to outsource their activities to India. If Telstra is a private company, it is perfectly entitled to do that. It is not a decision that I would welcome; nonetheless, in a globalised environment many private companies are sourcing their activities in various parts of the world. That is a reality that we all have to live with. We have to hope that in some respects it is a two-way process and that Australia is also providing activities for companies in countries outside our own. But in this case, Telstra is a government organisation that is at the very heart of the information technology sector in Australia. If it is allowed to proceed in outsourcing all of its information technology provision activities, that will gut the information technology sector in Australia. It will remove a huge proportion of the job opportunities and the skills development opportunities that people rely on. 
Finally, I will turn to the question of the Telstra share price. The interests of the Telstra shareholders do matter; they are important. They are protected by law. The opposition respects and upholds those interests. Under the Howard government, many Telstra shareholders have taken a bath. Primarily, the reason they have gone backwards goes back to the delusions of the government and of the board and management of Telstra: that Telstra could be a growth stock, that it could be the world's biggest dotcom and that all of the exciting new things unfolding in the world of information technology would be a giant wave that Telstra could surf to double-digit growth performance. Of course, reality has set in, and the end result has been that the Telstra share price has plummeted. Fortunately, it has now started to recover a little; nonetheless, it is way down from its peak. The answer for the future is for Telstra to understand that it is still essentially a public utility and it has predominantly utility characteristics. If it focuses on delivering a good dividend to its shareholders then its share price will stabilise at a reasonable level and it will become a worthwhile investment for all Australians who wish to invest in shares.
It is clear where the privatisation of Telstra will lead, based on this picture of Telstra and telecommunications under the Howard government and based on the privatisation by stealth that has been occurring in recent years. There will be higher prices—just as we have seen with line rentals over the last year. This will particularly affect people in regional Australia and people on lower incomes. There will be poorer services. The assets will increasingly be sweated by the new owners. They will not have much interest in investing more capital to upgrade the standard of the network, to improve the level of service or to employ more technicians to ensure that people in regional Australia get decent services. We will see more monopoly behaviour, more gaming of the competition regime and more efforts to win profits by keeping competition at bay rather than genuinely improving and competing. We will see Telstra buying up media assets to extend into other sectors the monopoly power that Telstra enjoys and ultimately seeking to completely dominate the information and technology sectors in Australia. We will see a tardy, slow, patchy and inadequate roll-out of broadband—the crucial arteries of future economic success for Australia. We will be lagging behind the rest of the world even more than we already are. The net financial outcome for the government that will occur from all of this will be negative. Added to the impact in telecommunications terms, we will also see a net negative outcome financially for the government, which I will turn to in a minute.
One of the extraordinary things about this debate is how miniscule and threadbare the government's arguments in favour of privatisation are. Senator Alston contributed a piece to one of the newspapers recently and advanced only four points in favour of privatisation. I will deal with them in turn. The first point was that the government has a conflict of interest in both regulating telecommunications and owning Telstra. Even within the communications portfolio—leaving aside any other areas of government activity—there are existing examples of this which the government appears not to worry about. The government regulates broadcasting and it has broadcasters—the ABC and SBS—which effectively compete with commercial broadcasters. SBS competes for advertising and, if the government gets it is way, the ABC will too. But apparently that is not a problem there. The government also owns Australia Post and apparently does not intend to privatise it, yet it regulates postal services and 85 per cent of Australia Post's revenue comes from fully contestable, fully competitive activities. Apparently the conflict of interest between owning and regulating does not matter in those areas. The second argument is that the government should not run businesses. The government runs a lot of things that can be described as businesses, such as Australia Post, but in this instance that is an argument for privatising Telstra. 
The government's third argument is that we have a much more market oriented telecommunications environment, that there is not really any need for the government to own Telstra any more and that regulations are the issue, not ownership. The answer to that is: if we cannot regulate properly now, what hope have we got of regulating when there is a giant private monopoly as the dominant player in the field, able to exert enormous influence within Australia's public life and political system?
Finally, and perhaps most ludicrously, the government claims that we have a fully competitive telecommunications market: everything is okay and there is no need for public ownership because the market is now genuinely competitive. In support of this claim the government points out that there are now 89 licensed telecommunications carriers in Australia. Superficially that sounds very impressive: we have 89 businesses to choose from. What they fail to point out is that of those 89 there is one that makes 95 per cent of the profits and is well over two-thirds of the entire industry. They also fail to point out that, for the vast bulk of consumers, the effective range of choice in telecommunications provider is a fair bit smaller than 89 and, particularly for people outside the major cities, in many instances the choice is Telstra or no-one.
Labor's position on these issues and on the future of Telstra is very clear. Not only do we oppose the privatisation of Telstra, we will return Telstra to its core responsibilities of delivering high-quality telecommunications services accessible for all Australians regardless of where they live or what their income level is and diminish Telstra's involvement in speculative foreign ventures and investments in sectors such as the media. We will intensify the focus on the delivery of broadband services to ensure that Australia is leading the world in high-quality telecommunications access for our businesses as a crucial platform for Australian exporters and Australian businesses generally to be able to advance our economy, deliver jobs and deliver advanced services for all Australians.
We will ensure that Telstra is more strictly regulated and that there is a clear internal separation between Telstra's activities as the wholesaler, owner and manager of the network and its activities as a seller of telephone calls and communications capacity, so that we have a clear and genuinely competitive environment and a genuine level playing field between Telstra and its competitors as they use Telstra's network. Finally, we will be introducing strengthened protections for telecommunications consumers in a range of areas that apply not only to Telstra but also to its competitors. Under Labor, Telstra will be a carrier, not a broadcaster; Telstra will be a builder, not a speculator.
Looking at the specifics of the legislation it is worth noting a number of points that are causes for concern. The legislation removes various reporting obligations that currently apply to Telstra with respect to financial data once the government ownership goes below 15 per cent. It removes the ministerial power of direction, which although it has never been used does constitute a very significant constraint on the part of the government—the majority owner on behalf of the Australian people—on how Telstra conducts its activities. It removes Telstra from the scope of the freedom of information legislation. 
Intriguingly, the legislation empowers the government to, rather than sell its own shares in Telstra, create what are called `sale scheme hybrid securities' against the shares in Telstra and to sell those securities. We are fascinated by the underlying plan behind this provision—which did not appear in the previous two Telstra sale bills—and what the government's strategy is going to be. If it is open and transparent and designed to maximise the return to the taxpayer then, although we oppose the bill full-stop, we do not criticise this particular point. But the government has to come clean about what its intentions are in essentially empowering itself not to sell its shares but to sell securities that are backed by those shares. My suspicion is that the government wants to use that to play the market and potentially use its market power to maximise its return at the expense of ordinary shareholders.
The government also proposes to empower the ACA and the minister to impose licence conditions with respect to telecommunications in regional Australia and provide for five-yearly reviews of telecommunications in regional Australia. This is attached with the government's response to the Estens inquiry, where it proposes to spend the giant sum—in telecommunications terms—of $180 million over four years for telecommunications in regional Australia! That is $45 million a year. That sounds like quite a bit of money, and in some respects it is, but when you compare it with Telstra's total capital expenditure on telecommunications in Australia of over $3 billion a year you get some idea of how trivial this particular tokenistic payment actually is. It shows the contempt that the government and the Liberal Party hold the National Party in. It shows how pathetic and weak the National Party has been in standing up for its constituents in regional Australia.
The sale will cost a huge amount of money to the taxpayer. The government previously estimated that each tranche of the sale would cost $218 million in fees to lawyers, investment bankers and accountants. On top of that, eventually—probably fairly quickly, depending on the price at which the shares or the securities are sold—the value of the reduction in public debt that will flow from the sale proceeds being used to pay off debt, in particular the loss of interest payment obligations, will be seriously outweighed by the loss of dividends that the government currently receives from Telstra. As well as being bad public policy, bad competition policy, bad for the market, bad for consumers and bad for people in regional Australia, the sale of Telstra is also particularly bad for the government's budget.
That pretty much sums it up. This proposal is being pursued by blind ideological zealotry on the part of the Howard government. It takes no account of the realities of telecommunications. It takes no account of the circumstances in telecommunications markets throughout Australia. It takes no account of the realities of telecommunications services for people in country Australia. It does not make sense for the public finances in Australia. It does not make sense for the delivery of telecommunications services. It does not make sense for genuine competition in Australia. It does not make sense for consumers and consumer choice in Australia. It is driven by an ideological obsession that has been overwhelmingly rejected by the Australian people, time and time again. Every opinion poll I have seen shows that only 10 to 20 per cent of Australians support the sale of Telstra. I note that one of the government's backbenchers, the member for Hume, recently ran a poll in his constituency and found that 96 per cent of his constituents are opposed to the sale. Similar figures have been found by the members for Calare and New England in similar processes of consultation with their electorates. 
In regional Australia you can hardly find anybody who supports the sale of Telstra, yet members of the National Party—the once proud upholder of the interests of people in country Australia, a party that was prepared to stand up to the Liberal Party in the past—have cravenly come into this parliament, packed their cards, gone home and said, `We will accept the privatisation of Telstra.' As people who have a proud history of standing up for the interests of people in country Australia, they should hang their heads in shame. They are now led by quasi Liberals—by old `Gucci Gumboots', the Deputy Prime Minister. They are people who no longer can claim to represent the interests of country Australia. If there is one issue that country Australia is virtually unanimous on it is maintaining Telstra in government ownership to ensure that all Australians, no matter where they live, can continue to enjoy high quality telecommunications services.
Labor have been the only party to stand firm on this issue. We will not sell Telstra. We remain committed to opposing this legislation. We will oppose it all the way through the parliamentary process. I urge the minor parties in the Senate—the Greens, the Democrats, the Independents and One Nation—to join us and to give voice to the overwhelming view of the Australian people that Telstra should not be sold. If democracy means anything in this country, Telstra should remain in public ownership. It is still predominantly a public utility, it is still essentially a monopoly, it completely dominates the sector and it needs to remain in government ownership to ensure that all Australians continue to enjoy access to essential telecommunications services into the future.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2003-08-14,"—It is particularly interesting to follow the member for Melbourne and to listen to someone who, outside this parliament, would masquerade as an economic rationalist but who, inside this parliament, gave a speech worthy of Karl Marx or Leon Trotsky in terms of returning to the Das Kapital days of the good socialist period. What we have today is clear evidence of an ideologically retro party. They talk about the ideological obsession of this government when in fact the member for Melbourne shows his own ideological obsession. The obsession that he shows against the privatisation of Telstra is not borne out in the rigour of going through the factors involved in this issue.
One of the big points that the member for Melbourne made was about staff numbers. He said that there is clear evidence that unless you have a status quo in the numbers in a corporation it is inappropriate, anti-Australian and not how mates behave. This is modern corporate life. Every corporation around the world looks at the number of their staff and at their need for an effective return on investment. With the use of technology, staff are often made redundant. It is a natural order; it happens in government owned enterprises and it happens in the private sector. To use that as the basis on which to oppose privatisation is not borne out by the current economic reality.
The member for Melbourne talked about Telstra shareholders and our need to look after them. If there is one group of people whom we should be looking out for in particular it is the shareholders. The editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald of 5 May 2002 said:
Telstra will never be a growth stock while half government-owned.
If you are looking for growth in the stock, you free it of government controls and enable it to operate as an effective private sector telco instead of it being under the constraints of government ownership. There is also criticism of how much the government would get. If it were not for the Labor Party's opposition in the Senate and in this House, on privatisation we would have secured a price which would have been far above what it is today. The loss to the government in terms of what we could do with those funds is clearly the responsibility of those who sit opposite. I believe that the shareholders would emphatically endorse the need for Telstra to be privatised to maximise the returns on the shares that they hold. 
On the trade joint standing committee's visit to eastern Europe it was amazing to go to countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia and look at what is happening in respect of privatisation in those countries. They are awash with privatisation. They have first-hand experience of centrally planned economies. The restriction in their economic growth and the low per capita income that they have experienced compared with those of the rest of western Europe have illustrated to them the need to move as fast as they can to privatise. That has been the experience across the board and it is borne out in their growth rates. The average growth rate in those countries is 3½ per cent. They have experienced the old socialist model that the member for Melbourne would hold out as the great panacea whereby the government holds everything. They have found the vibrancy in today's modern economy—a fully privatised organisation which is competitive with other private sector organisations. 
To think that in 2003 we are debating the privatisation of Telstra—it shows that members opposite have a long way to go. Let us look at the sheer hypocrisy of the track record of the Labor Party. When they were in government, if they had continued to uphold the principles of Karl Marx we would have understood. But when they were in government they put together Qantas and Australian Airlines and privatised it. They privatised the Commonwealth Bank—at that stage the largest bank in this country. 
Without any explanation, all the arguments I heard the member for Melbourne outline today could equally be applied to the Commonwealth Bank. This side of the House supported the proposal of those opposite. The Commonwealth Bank is stronger today, it has a strong share price and it continues to provide an effective service for the people of Australia—and it was privatised by the members opposite. It is hypocrisy to oppose privatisation in opposition simply because you think it is a populist line. It is for the benefit of people in the country. You whip up the fear and tell them that they are going to pay far more for their phone connections. If you whip it along enough, you will be able to get their support and you will get back to those grand, glory days when you occupied this side of the chamber. So the second point I wanted to make referred to the hypocrisy of the opposition.
The third factor I want to raise is the need for the organisation to be flexible. Instead of having government regulations across the board, the flexibility of a private telco in the marketplace is obvious. Commentators state that you need a private sector organisation with flexibility.
—The member for New England knows what an inflexible organisation is. When I was a minister in the New South Wales parliament, I was responsible for the railways. You can compare private sector run railways with the railways in New South Wales that were run by the government. The member for New England was one of the people who were constantly complaining about how inflexible government run organisations were. I am sure we will hear from the member for New England all about how it is great to have government run organisations. However, when he had the chance, he was most critical of government run organisations because of all the things they did and because they did not respond to the marketplace. Of course, in many cases he is right. 
In terms of the use of funds, is it appropriate for government funds to be held up in ownership of a telco such as Telstra, or is it appropriate to reduce our debt and use those funds on hospitals, schools, roads, airports, social security payments, provision of carers—the whole gamut, across the board? The government could do a range of things with those funds. They could be directed to desalinisation of our waterways or the provision of infrastructure, which is so appropriate. We want to see how we can use these funds better instead of their being involved in propping up ownership of Telstra.
There is also the question of improving services. If we have a problem in terms of the provision of services, you can put in a community service obligation—a CSO. I recall that in relation to transport in New South Wales there were CSOs where the government provided assistance to the bus operators or others in the private sector to run services which may not have been profitable but which the government considered appropriate. We still have the ability to do that. We can still have community service obligations.
We must also consider competition. If there were only one provider in the marketplace, fine; however, there is a range of competition in the marketplace. Those companies are well able to compete effectively with Telstra, and they have shown their capacity to do that. Competition in the marketplace provides cheaper prices, efficiency and greater service to the community. That is what we are all about. We are not about a hegemony of monopoly which is just strangling service and provision. From experience, I know how long you had to wait to get a phone connected when I was growing up during my parents' generation. You could wait months for those types of services. Costs were high, including the cost of ringing overseas. However, competition is magnificent in this country now. We are not talking about monopolies in Tasmania; we are talking about real competition.
This government is prepared to put it on the line and take measures which we believe are in the interests of the people of Australia. It is very easy to run the cheap populist line. I am sure we are about to hear the populist line from the member for New England. However, if you were genuine about the long-term interests of telecommunications in this country, if you were about competition and about looking after people in the country and in the city and providing a range of choice, lower prices and more competition, you would support this bill.
It is also particularly interesting to see what the media has said about the issue. Terry McCrann put the argument succinctly in his column in the Daily Telegraph. He said:
Institutional disciplines don't work. The only way to really keep Telstra honest is to expose it to the pressures and retribution of the market, and the legal rights of its customers.
He went on to say:
A fully privatised Telstra would be directly and much more effectively answerable to its customers ... at the moment it's a classic example of all power and no responsibility.
Let us also consider what commentators from some of the large organisations have to say. ABN AMRO is one of the world's leading banks. It stated: 
... without privatisation Telstra would continue to have funding constraints because while the government remained a large shareholder it would not easily be able to raise equity funds for investment.
That factor needs to be brought home. It involves the ability to raise funds in the marketplace, and it relates to a privatised Telstra's ability to outline its plans for expansion to the marketplace: the areas it wants to develop, the increased and enhanced services—
—The Asian market.
—It is possible that it may go into the Asian market. The marketplace will determine whether or not that is an appropriate investment.
—The member for Bass may claim that she has a better understanding than the investors at ABN AMRO, UBS Warburg or wherever. However, they are not going to put their funds into an area that they consider to be inappropriate. 
If you consider that some of the investments have been inappropriate in the past, in a fully privatised organisation it is a tough regime: you perform or you do not get the funds. It is quite clear. Of course, that will mean increased competition but it will also mean improved services. The private banking sector is saying that, if you want more funds for investment, this is the way to do it. You do not invest where there are government constraints or where there is a hybrid organisation which is half a government organisation—which is subject to all the constraints—and half private. What you need is a fully flexible, market driven organisation with the ability to go to the financial markets, outline its plans and say: `These are our plans for expansion. We are required to meet community service obligations, for which the government will provide the funding, but these are our plans.' The financial markets will respond accordingly. In terms of a vibrant market, the editorial in the Sun-Herald on 5 May 2002 commented:
Telstra will never be a growth stock while ... government-owned.
It is clear that that is the case.
Who are those who oppose this legislation actually in favour of? Is it about those in rural areas or in the cities who want lower prices? No. Is it about those who want better services and flexibility of services? Absolutely not. Is it about providing greater returns for the shareholders of Telstra? The answer is no.
—We know the member for Bass has a special relationship with the newspaper in her area but the Sun-Herald, in my area, said to shareholders that, if they wanted adequate returns, Telstra would have to be privatised. Never mind the Karl Marx ideology those on the other side come into this House with; they go along to the big corporate luncheons at the merchant banks and say: `That is all very well. We have to say that because Telstra is a popular issue out there. But really we agree with you. If we get into government we will do wonderful things in terms of privatising. Really we are economic rationalists.'
This is where the rubber hits the road. This is where the ideology of the Labor Party can be seen so strongly. I ask those who want to make out that they are independent, yet who follow the populist line: are you in favour of a flexible, privatised, market driven economy or are you still bound up in the old days of socialism? Are you in fact looking back to the glory days that the central Europeans abandoned with great relish? They said: `We are going to move on from centrally planned economies where the government decides everything. We have seen the disasters of this approach. We want a market driven, privatised economy which can deliver benefits.' The result is that they have had incredible investment in those countries. The Czech Republic, for example, has had some $52 billion worth of new investment in the last 10 years. That is remarkable and it sends a signal that they want to be an open economy and want to be market driven. 
The privatisation of Telstra will be very effective for the Australian community. Firstly, it is going to increase the effectiveness and profitability of the organisation, which I believe everyone in this House should be in favour of. Secondly, it has no impact on the regulation of essential facilities, which is what we would all be in favour of. Thirdly, it has no impact on other markets and it will generate greater product and value.
We on this side of the House stand for providing greater services, more effective services and more market driven services that reflect the needs of the community and that will respond effectively. We also believe in services that will provide lower prices. Regrettably, those on the other side are still tied up with the ideology of the past. People I come into contact with in my electorate are concerned about ensuring they continue to have an effective service. We on this side of the House can guarantee it. Secondly, they want to be assured that the government will not interfere with it unnecessarily. We can assure them of that. But when the opposition had their chance in government to put in place their ideology, what did they do? They privatised Qantas and they privatised the Commonwealth Bank. Of course, it is a different position when they are in opposition. They simply say: `It was a different story. The Commonwealth Bank was different because it had competition.' Telstra certainly has competition. The Commonwealth Bank was the largest bank and we on this side supported it. The hypocrisy on the other side knows no bounds.
This is a great piece of legislation. The funds that would be raised can be used effectively. Those on the other side are always talking about all the great projects they want to put in place, such as the desalinisation program, the Murray River et cetera. This is a way of providing significant funds instead of having them tied up in areas, such as Telstra, which are not providing the benefit. In Telstra we can have an effective, market driven organisation. Let us support this bill and get on with providing decent telecommunications in this country.",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"—The debate on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 is one of the most important debates that will be had in this parliament this year. It is not just a debate about whether to sell a national icon; it is a debate about what sort of country we want to be: one in which our institutions benefit all of us or benefit just the lucky few. It is a debate about whether we believe that the money that Australians have put into Telstra over generations was an investment in the nation's future and should continue to be invested in its future, or whether it was just a cost to the budget. It is a debate about whether every Australian, no matter where they live or how much they earn, should have access to a phone, a fax and the Internet. It is a debate about whether the government is prepared to listen to the Australian people or to arrogantly ignore them.
The Australian people overwhelmingly do not want Telstra sold. It is not just our opinion in the Labor Party; it is the opinion also of members of the government's own backbench. Yesterday, the member for Hume, Alby Schultz, said that 96 per cent of his constituents who had returned questionnaires to his office were against the sale but that arrogant ministers in his government would not listen to them. We heard Alby Schultz in a doorstop interview yesterday saying that the government was trying to silence him. He said that the ministers were only interested in using the funds from the sale of Telstra to pork-barrel their way back to power. That is not acting in the Australian interest, and the member for Hume has the courage and decency to acknowledge that. Why? It is because he has gone out and listened to his constituents and he has brought those views back here. The government has to listen to those views rather than just pursue its mindless objective. 
The only people in Australia who want Telstra sold are 29 government ministers who want to get their hands on the proceeds of the sale but who, amongst themselves, are divided as to what those proceeds should be used to do: to improve services or to pay off the debt. Also there are a few bankers, consultants and executive fat cats who may stand to make a killing from the sale. They are the only ones who want Telstra sold. Ordinary Australians know instinctively that they will not benefit, and that is why they are against the sale. The government will pay a mighty electoral price if it continues with this plan to sell out the people of Australia. In this debate today three things are clear: selling Telstra is bad for the bush, selling Telstra is bad for the nation and selling Telstra is bad for the budget. Only Labor will keep Telstra for all Australians.
The central question in this debate is whether ownership matters. The central contention of those opposite is that ownership does not matter. They believe that we can achieve, through regulation and government handouts, the same outcomes more efficiently than ownership delivers. It is simply not true. Labor believes that a majority public-owned Telstra is the best means to deliver the latest in accessible and affordable telecommunications services to all Australians, regardless of where they live. The government has repeatedly told Australians that it will not sell Telstra until it is `fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians, including maintaining the improvements to existing services'. If that is the test, it is not met. Australians know, having witnessed the Besley and Estens inquiries whitewash on regional telecommunications services, that the government is deluding itself that it can be so fully satisfied. 
Before the last election, the Prime Minister told the faithful at New England, on 5 November 2001:
... we believe that people in the bush are entitled to the sort of services from Telstra as their city counterparts.
Where is that comparison now? Hundreds of regional Australians wrote to the Estens committee complaining of poor regional telecommunications services, poor mobile phone coverage, faulty telephone lines, poor broadband coverage, inadequate dial-up Internet data speeds and constant Internet line drop-out. The rosy picture of regional telecommunications services painted by the Estens inquiry was a sham and in complete contradiction to the hundreds of submissions to the inquiry. Ask the member for Hume, who has gone out and questioned people again.
Even in many urban areas Telstra's services are totally inadequate. As I discovered first-hand in recent trips up north, in towns and cities in Queensland—in your area, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay—this year three out of 10 faults were not repaired within the one day required by law. And yet the government has the gall and temerity to say services are up to scratch. Many areas of our cities simply cannot access the latest in broadband Internet technology because Telstra-installed pair gains systems mean that ADSL is unavailable.  
Country Australians know one thing instinctively: if Telstra is sold, Telstra will leave their town faster than the banks. Outer metropolitan Australia is just starting to hear the same call. This government will sell Telstra regardless of the standards of regional telecommunications, which is completely contrary to what it was saying when it went to the last election. We have seen an example this week of `truth overboard' by the Prime Minister in relation to ethanol and whether he had meetings. This is a Prime Minister whose words simply cannot be believed. He went to the last election promising that there would not be a sale until services had been improved, but he intends to persist with that sale. We will oppose it.
The government will sell Telstra, as I said, regardless of the standards of regional telecommunications and, despite promising to do so, the government has provided no mechanism to future-proof Telstra services. The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 actually provides for the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts or the Australian Communications Authority to make licence conditions requiring Telstra to maintain a local presence in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. Those are fine words and it is an essential concept, but there is no definition in the legislation as to what this means and no guarantee that that presence will in fact be guaranteed. 
The bill also requires regular reviews of regional telecommunications every five years by an expert committee appointed by the minister. We have already seen a few examples of those expert committees under the Howard government. You can see the future ones!
—It will be Estens again.
—Exactly; they will be as `independent' as the Besley and Estens inquiries—one was chaired by a man who believed the banks were a model for services in the bush, and the other was chaired by a National Party member and a mate of the Deputy Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has even appointed the member for Hinkler to chair an interim inquiry to ensure that Telstra's services are up to scratch before the full privatisation of Telstra proceeds—a safe choice for the Prime Minister because the member for Hinkler voted for the full privatisation of Telstra in 1998. The fact is that this government will appoint the committee it wants to produce the report it wants. Nobody can take this approach seriously.
As soon as Telstra is sold, the political incentive to impose tough regulations on Telstra's service delivery will dissipate. Blanket regulation of this type can quickly become grossly inefficient. There will be no more Telstra billions to spend on improving the network. That can only mean one thing—without an increase in taxes, there will be no money to fund future telecommunications services. So what is it: higher taxes or lower services? That is what Australians are being asked to decide on the basis of this government's proposals.
Despite the hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars being poured into the company by the government through the social bonus spending, Telstra's investment in its network has fallen from a peak of $4.7 billion in 1999-2000 to an estimated $3.2 billion in 2002-03. Over the same period full-time staff numbers have fallen from 50,700 to an estimated 37,600. Many of those employees cut were involved directly in customer service and network maintenance activities in regional Australia. That is happening with Telstra 51 per cent owned by the government. Imagine what it will be doing if all of it is sold, and under John Howard Australia is getting a taste of how Telstra will behave if it is allowed to be fully privatised. 
Telstra is abandoning its broader responsibilities to the Australian community but still exploiting the competitive commercial advantages it derives from its background of monopoly public ownership. Because of the Howard government's obsession with privatisation, Telstra is failing to fulfil its broader obligations of national development and social inclusion. But at the same time that Telstra is reducing network investment, it is charging you more just to own a phone. Line rental increases have more than doubled, from $11.65 a month just a few years ago to as much as $23.50 to $26.50 a month today. That is a doubling! And despite government claims that these changes have just constituted `rebalancing', Telstra is pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue because of the government's flawed price control regime. These deficiencies have been compounded of course by inappropriate corporate behaviour, such as loaning free $12,000 plasma televisions to the Prime Minister and the minister for communications. Then of course there is the signing-off of chief executive Ziggy Switkowski's $1 million-plus golden handshake if he is sacked, while the same government comes into this House and argues for no more security of entitlement to ordinary workers and that the eight weeks under the legislation is sufficient for them. What sort of double standard is that?
Telstra is not only vital to an equitable society; it is also vital to our national economic success. Connecting the nation is fundamental to future productivity increases and for increased opportunity for all Australians. It is the great infrastructure challenge that this nation faces. More affordable access to the latest telecommunications services for all Australians wherever they live—that is an objective we must commit to and strive for. It is necessary on a number of fronts. Firstly, because telecommunications is a major embedded cost for businesses today. Small business has identified the cost of telecommunications as its third highest concern, behind only tax and tax compliance costs. Also, more affordable access is a precondition for the emergence of vital new industries. It generates significant savings and efficiencies for existing businesses. More affordable access can also enable our families to access the latest in education, health, government and commercial services, no matter where they live. It can deliver the latest high-speed education services to our children living in remote locations. It can help put services back, where they have been taken away. More affordable access improves both efficiency and equity. It is essential to our opportunity and prosperity.
Telecommunications is now about more than just the standard telephone connection. It is about getting the nation connected to the information economy. The policy debate in Australia under this government continues to be excessively narrow, focusing simply on whether the telecommunications company should be sold or not. It has come at the expense of the more important issues of service, competition and access. Telstra has been allowed to milk its monopoly position at the expense of families and businesses. Mobile phones, text messages and Internet fees have all gone up. Some schools have had their Internet charge increased by up to 1,000 per cent. The poor service problems in regional and rural Australia persist. Over the past two years Australia has fallen from 13th to 19th in the OECD table of broadband access. For us to succeed as a nation, we need to be a leader in that field. Inadequate competition, not majority public ownership, is causing these problems. Telstra still occupies 75 per cent of the telecommunications market and earns over 90 per cent of its profits. The regulatory regime is simply not working. Privatising more of Telstra will not solve it, and I defy the proponents of full privatisation to prove otherwise. 
The other point I want to make is this: selling Telstra is bad for the budget. The government deliberately and falsely inflated the Telstra sale price in the budget papers to try and hide that fact. The lie was only exposed by Labor through Senate estimates. The government valued Telstra at $5.25 a share, when the department advised them that $4.75—approximately the current market price—was the fair valuation. The government's own budget statements make clear that the budget is prepared on the GFS accounting standard. The GFS accounting standard explicitly requires that all assets and liabilities should be valued at their current market value. In falsely valuing Telstra, the government have breached proper accounting standards.
Even at $5.25 a share, the full privatisation of Telstra simply does not make sense. When we went to the last election, the government valued Telstra at almost $5.50 a share. During the campaign, the Treasurer specifically adopted economic analysis from Econtech that showed the sale was worth nothing to the budget—that was the government's analysis. Our analysis, done by Access Economics, confirmed that the sale would cost the budget $600 million over the forward estimates. If Telstra was a poor bet at $5.50 before the election, it cannot be a good bet fiscally even at the nominal and falsely budgeted $5.25. As the shadow minister for finance has pointed out, the dividend expectations for Telstra have risen since that time. Accordingly, market based projections of future dividend earnings, prepared by Macquarie and UBS Warburg, have indicated the full privatisation of Telstra will cost the budget at least $1.7 billion over the forward estimates.
This budget black hole comes before any account is made of the cost of any social bonus to appease regional Australia, the need to offer shares at a discount and with instalment receipts to attract small investments, the impact of early debt retirement, and the payment of the Commonwealth's superannuation liability to Telstra. The full privatisation of Telstra is fiscally irresponsible. The fact that the government is persisting with it shows its underlying ideological intent and its lack of understanding of good economic management. On simple economic grounds there is no justification for its privatisation. Telstra protects Australians from serious market failures in the provision of telecommunication services, and it promotes social inclusion.
Labor has proposed a four-point reform strategy designed to bring Telstra back to its primary role and maximise the benefits of telecommunications competition. First, Telstra will be asked to focus on its core responsibilities to the Australian community: better and more affordable communications for all. Second, Telstra will be asked to improve access to affordable broadband services for all Australians to help drive the next wave of economic reform. Third, Labor will improve competition and bring down prices to consumers by forcing Telstra to separate its wholesale and retail activities. Finally, Labor will protect consumers through stronger and fairer protection from sharp practices by telecommunications companies and through the price control regime. Labor believes in public ownership of Telstra because telecommunications services are essential services. Labor is opposed to the further sale of Telstra. The government's intention is bad for the bush, bad for the nation and bad for the budget. It is legislation that must be rejected.

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2003-08-14,"—I rise in the House today to support the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003, a bill which will affect many of my constituents in the Kalgoorlie electorate. There will be some people who will remain opposed to the further sale of Telstra, no matter what advantages may be gained from that sale. Some will be opposed to it simply because it means making a tough decision; others will be opposed because it means change, and people hate change. I hate change, but when I realise it is for the common good it is time to consider what those changes really mean for the people of real Australia.
The environment in which my constituents survive in the Kalgoorlie electorate, about a third of the Australian continent, is isolated, challenging and often inhospitable, even more so for those who do not know it. Communications and other services are vital to one's existence in such conditions, and I understand my constituents' reluctance to jump in headfirst at the proposed further sale of Telstra. Many of them used to have well-established banking services in town and vividly remember when there was a Commonwealth Bank just up the road. Then Labor, against its promise to the contrary, sold the Commonwealth Bank, and all those services in the bush disappeared almost overnight. The banks moved out because regional Australia was not considered big enough business. With that sour taste lingering in their mouths, they may well believe, understandably, that telecommunications services in the bush will disappear just as dramatically with the sale of Telstra.
What is the difference between Labor's sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the Howard government's bill for the full privatisation of Telstra? The answer is future-proofing. When Labor sold the Commonwealth Bank, it made no provision to protect banking in the bush. Regional Australians were left out in the cold and the result was devastating for rural communities that lost not only jobs but banking facilities and services, often the core of a township's viability. With Telstra, the Howard government have made sure there are safeguards to protect those living in the bush. We have legislated for the future-proofing of telecommunications across rural and remote Australia. These are the safeguards that the federal government have set up, regardless of who owns Telstra.
Changes in Telstra's ownership status will not affect the government's ability to protect the interests of my constituents in the bush. Ownership does not determine the level of service. My government legislates for services to be delivered in the bush, whether they own shares in Telstra or not. There is no relationship between the ownership of Telstra and the creation of services in the bush. The further sale of Telstra is a well-considered and researched decision backed up by future-proofing policies set in legislative concrete. The Howard government will not proceed with the further sale of Telstra until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are established which will deliver adequate telecommunications services to all Australians, including ongoing improvements to and maintenance of existing services.
Across all the 33 shires in the seat of Kalgoorlie, the major issues of dissent in regional telecommunications centre on mobile phone telephony costs, availability and services. While those in the cities sit back with their whiz-bang gadgetry available in all manner of mobile phones these days, the agreed position of real Australians in my electorate is the need for affordable, reliable mobile communications. Let us remember it was this government, not Telstra, which introduced a rebate scheme—$1,000 or half the price of the handset—enabling really remote people to have access to mobile phone telephony via satellite. 
Under its Networking the Nation program, the Commonwealth used funds from the part-sale of Telstra for a $3 million Western Australian Satellite Mobile Phone Scheme, designed to partially subsidise satellite mobile phone handsets. The program will directly benefit those living in remote regions of my electorate, where terrestrial services are not feasible. In addition to substantial handset subsidies on offer, those people can now access iridium satellite technology at competitive prices. For $88 a month and 43c for 30 seconds, my constituents can make phone calls around the world. It was at the insistence of the Commonwealth government that this service was provided; it had nothing to do with the ownership of Telstra. Now, thanks to that rebate scheme, truly remote station people with a `sat phone', if they get into strife, have an emergency service equal to the best in the world. This is quite apart from the convenience of day-to-day mobile telephony.
For people in my electorate who may be concerned about the safeguarding of future services in regional areas, I can respond to them by saying that we have set in place protective minimum standards and industry obligations, and they are laid down by law. I have correspondence from the shires of Murchison, Upper Gascoyne and Exmouth that detail concerns over current delays in connecting fixed-line services, repairing faults, and the provision of services. With future-proofing, we can address those concerns.
My government has already initiated the customer service guarantee, the CSG, which requires that all telephone companies meet specified time frames in the provision of services. If they do not, they are required by law to financially compensate their customers. The CSG is fixed by legislation and applies to all telephone companies in Australia, regardless of their ownership. The universal service obligation, the USO, guarantees all Australians, whether living in the city or in the bush, access to basic telephone services. The USO is also fixed by legislation and Telstra must fulfil its obligations regardless of ownership.
The network reliability framework, the NRF, was established by my government to monitor the reliability of telephone services provided by Telstra. The NRF is fixed in place by regulations and Telstra's obligations apply, regardless of ownership. This is a vital provision for those living in the bush, where reliability of telecommunications over great distances is of paramount importance. Those concerned about the ongoing provision of the priority assistance service should be aware that it is a condition of Telstra's telecommunications carrier licence; the government requires Telstra to provide a special priority assistance service to people with life-threatening medical conditions. Telstra must fulfil these obligations regardless of ownership.
And the future-proofing continues. As part of its response to the Regional Telecommunications Inquiry, or Estens inquiry, the Commonwealth government will legislate to require at law that current and future governments conduct regular, independent reviews into the adequacy of communications services in the bush. There will be an obligation for governments to respond to any recommendations made in the review, and this process applies regardless of the ownership of Telstra. Such a future-proofing provision ensures that regional services in the bush will not be just forgotten and pushed to one side after Telstra is fully privatised. Quite the opposite. Such legislation is a safeguard for the ongoing improvement of regional telecommunications in Australia. 
For the same reason, the Howard government will impose a licence condition on Telstra, requiring it to maintain an ongoing local presence in regional, rural and remote Australia. This licence condition will ensure that the benefits of Telstra Country Wide are locked in place into the future. Telstra will be obligated to maintain this local presence regardless of any future change in the ownership of Telstra.
It is a fact that regional telecommunications services in Australia have improved since the Howard government introduced a number of initiatives to foster enhancements and competition in the industry. Under the Extended Zones Program, the Commonwealth government has already committed $150 million from the proceeds of the second partial sale of Telstra to improve services to the 38,000 Australians who had never had access to untimed local telephone calls or Internet connections at the untimed local call rate.
On the subject of mobile telephony, a particular concern for my constituents is the extension of CDMA mobile phone coverage across sections of regional highways in the electorate. The Commonwealth government has committed $19 million to improve CDMA coverage to segments of 34 regional highways by June 2004. This includes extended coverage of 73 kilometres along Western Australia's Highway 1, north of Geraldton, near Monkey Mia, and a further 45 kilometres south-west of Port Hedland. As of last New Year's Eve, with improved services directed by the federal government, I could use my CDMA phone all the way from Perth to Kalgoorlie uninterrupted—that is some 600 kilometres. What we need are more services like that.
We need to further extend CDMA mobile coverage across the vast Kalgoorlie electorate. Projects like Wireless North aim to provide continuous mobile phone services from Geraldton to Port Hedland, with additional coverage to Broome. The Great Northern Highway, from Wubin to Port Hedland, is currently lacking in continuous mobile phone coverage, and there is no mobile communication service east of Norseman, despite the traffic rates on the Eyre Highway. These are expensive projects. They will well serve anyone living in or travelling through these areas, but they are expensive. Regardless of who owns Telstra, Telstra will provide services where there is seen to be a commercial viability. The only reason services go where such provision is not commercially viable is because the government—my government—drives them there through legislation. As a result of the Howard government's introduction of full competition in 1997, there are now 89 separate, licensed phone companies in Australia, 40 per cent of which offer services in regional Australia.
The partial sale of Telstra has already allowed infrastructure systems to be improved. The sale of the remaining 50.1 per cent component will allow the federal government to further develop infrastructure across Australia and make a further push to extend mobile telecommunications services into the bush. As Australians, we pride ourselves on our technological ability and advancement. Here we have an opportunity to take the next step, to really set about improving communications in rural and remote areas by developing infrastructure—infrastructure built by the generation of funds from the further sale of Telstra. The part sale of Telstra has had proven benefit for the communications industry in the past; this further sale can go a long way to completing the necessary groundwork for a truly competitive and effective service for regional Australians. But, first, we need to get the monkey off Telstra's back. 
Under current arrangements, Telstra has the odds stacked against it in the global telecommunications market. Unlike its competitors, Telstra is unable to issue shares for capital-raising purposes and is unable to compete in the open market for international finance. The Telstra bill 2003 is part of a package that delivers on the government's election commitments to ensure that Australia's telecommunications system combines the best elements of competition and service. The Commonwealth government is committed to improving the delivery of advanced communications services across Australia. For this, the role of a competitive, innovative private sector will be paramount. A fully privatised Telstra will become a truly competitive player in the telecommunications arena internationally. Even here, Telstra has been future-proofed. For those concerned about Telstra being swallowed by an international conglomerate, the government's policy on foreign ownership of Telstra remains unchanged: Telstra will continue to remain an Australian owned and operated corporation. The maximum foreign ownership will remain at 35 per cent. The maximum individual foreign ownership will remain at five per cent.
Government ownership certainly does not help with across-the-board competitiveness. It was not so many decades ago that all the bush had to offer was peddle radio. Back then, we had a wholly government owned PMG. When there was no competition in the Australian telecommunications market, PMG employed specialised gangs, including ladder holders and billy boilers, with government jobs for life. As a result, their workers were held second only to Main Roads workers as the most lazy and inefficient in the nation. We have come a long way since then. Under an independent Telstra, we will not have the cosiness and camouflage of a government owned corporation that allows cost-shifting and investment decisions to be made in a non-transparent environment. Instead, transparency will be the order of the day, and hardworking backbenchers who know their electorate will identify where services are lacking and, through doing their job well, ensure those services are improved and maintained at an acceptable level.
The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 resolves the current conflict of interest created by the government's majority stakehold in Telstra. The necessity to gain passage of this legislation is not for the immediate but for the eventual. We need to allow time for Telstra share prices to improve; time for the market to realise the strength and value of an unfettered Telstra. Only then will the further sale of Telstra return an acceptable level of capital. We have to wait, because for too long the share price of Telstra has been affected by the burden of government ownership. This legislation provides an opportunity, in time, for Australians to further invest in Telstra and allows government to focus on regulating the telecommunications industry. The Telstra bill supports maintenance of service quality and protection of consumer rights, regardless of Telstra's ownership. The government's legislation on future-proofing Telstra ensures that people in regional areas continue to share equitably in the benefits of advances in technologies.
`Future-proofing' is not just a throwaway phrase of Canberra-speak; it is a specific term of reference in the Estens inquiry and is a key to the safeguarding of services for regional Australians. Equitable, affordable access to broadband services is the next critical step in the future-proofing of Australian telecommunications. More than just an information highway, broadband will revolutionise communications, research and business options. Broadband services are high-speed data services, allowing users instant access to the Internet and other data sources 24 hours a day at speeds at least 10 times faster than a typical dial-up modem. 
Broadband also facilitates the use of complex web sites such as those used by farmers when monitoring real-time market prices and allows businesses to increase efficiency, reduce costs and overcome distance. Esperance is an area keen to take advantage of high-speed data download and, with the latest packaging of BigPond ISDN, businesses within 15 kilometres of exchanges in the south-east and other parts of the electorate will be able to process data at 128 kilobytes per second. Broadband is a key piece of infrastructure for the 21st century, in the same way that roads and railways were the foundations of industry for earlier generations.
The Howard government's commitment to the national broadband strategy is another step in the future-proofing of regional Australia's communications needs. We have the means to ensure telecommunications companies commit to improving services in a nationally and internationally competitive market. We can legislate for better communications services in the bush. We can fund the development of essential infrastructure and ensure that this infrastructure is protected by legislation. We can ensure that ongoing services and upgrades in the bush are protected by legislation. We can future-proof Telstra. And we can do all of this, regardless of who owns Telstra.
Services in regional and remote areas are dictated by concerned government, which is lobbied by concerned backbenchers who must present and highlight the concerns of constituents. Those living in my electorate of Kalgoorlie have specific telecommunications concerns and priorities. These are reasonable concerns based on business requirements, safety factors and the very human need to defeat isolation, overcome separation and be able to communicate with each other. To this end, they want extended mobile phone coverage; they want fast, reliable Internet services; they want a guarantee they will not be disadvantaged because of distance; and they want an assurance that infrastructure, services and competitive pricing will not only continue into the future but be enhanced in keeping with technological developments in less remote parts of the nation.
In short, people in the bush just want a fair go. They want to know they will not miss out on the new technologies introduced into metropolitan environments. There will always be a disparity between the city and the bush when it comes to landline services, but there is no reason why the bush should not get the very best telecommunications Australia has to offer. It is up to me to ensure that my government delivers them and, as a member elected by the Prime Minister to his Telstra task force, I am in a good position to do so. I commend the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 to the House.",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"—I must start by commenting on the contribution earlier today by the member for Cook. The member for Cook, with his reds under the beds contribution, has failed to understand exactly what we are doing here and how important this debate is. This is one of the most important debates that the House is going to have. It goes to the future—to the government's ability to provide infrastructure to our nation to ensure that our regions have the same services that our cities have.
On a number of occasions we have heard ministers and members opposite in this House saying that somehow Telstra is okay because, back in the olden days, it was a lot worse. We had Minister Tuckey, in an MPI last session, saying, `It's okay that Telstra doesn't provide some services because, after all, once upon a time we didn't have any phones.' We then had the member for Cook talking about some childhood memory of when his parents—and I think this might have been a little while ago—had to wait a few months in order to get their phone on. We just had the previous speaker talking about the days of pedal radio. I am not quite sure what planet these people are on. The fact that once upon a time we did not have a service is not an excuse for not having an appropriate service when we can have it, when the technology exists and when other nations are providing it. 
Since this bill was introduced into the House, the prospect of full privatisation of Telstra has created more than just a feeling of unease and trepidation for many people living in regional and rural Australia. Since the decision to sell off parts of Telstra was taken the concern has been to create a state that the government likes to label `half pregnant', but it is a half pregnancy the government refuse to take responsibility for. Many people living in my electorate of Bass are rightly frightened about what a privatised Telstra will mean for them in accessing telecommunications services. There are towns that are only a stone's throw from Launceston—one of Australia's larger regional cities—that do not have access to basic telecommunications services. I know the minister at the table, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, has recently visited George Town in my electorate.
—They have got phones in George Town.
—He may have noted that he did not get mobile coverage down to George Town, and that is the largest town.
—Yes, I did. I was doing radio interviews.
—I am pretty sure that you would have had to stop to get clarity, Minister. I am happy to drive down there with you one day and see if you can get mobile coverage the entire way. We will sort it out then. Yesterday, the Prime Minister said:
Telecommunications services in the bush are mostly up to scratch.
The Prime Minister was in Tasmania just the other weekend and he obviously was not listening to the community there either. It is no wonder they do not hold any House of Representatives seats in Tasmania, as he was urging them to do. The reality is that, until they listen to the people of Tasmania, they are not going to hold any seats in Tasmania. A fully privatised, profit only focused Telstra will mean that this situation is only going to get much worse. When the government no longer have ministerial power of direction over Telstra, they will refuse to act in the national interest. They will lose that ministerial direction capacity as soon as our stake falls below 50.1 per cent. Without government control, Telstra will no longer be interested in its responsibility to provide services to all Australians. We know that a fully privatised Telstra will not continue to provide services to small towns where it is not making a profit—where there is no bang for its buck. By letting Telstra off the fully public hook through the so-called `half-pregnant' part privatisation—there are far too many p's in that sentence—the government have given Telstra a green light to abandon the regions. I ask the minister—I am sure he can—to help me identify where the Nimbin flashing red light is.
I will not stand by and see my constituents disadvantaged in this way. I will not stand by and allow shareholder profits to be put before the provision of access to basic services in our community. The market value of the Commonwealth's equity in Telstra is currently around $30 billion. That is a nice little earner for a government that is quaestuary and obsessed with selling off Australia's infrastructure. A government that is interested in profit over policy is not a government that is acting for the public good. The full privatisation of Telstra will ensure the delivery of the greatest profits to the shareholders, which will undoubtedly be beneficial to the telecommunications infrastructure in capital cities, but I can guarantee that it is going to do nothing about maintaining services or infrastructure in regional and rural Australia. 
The government has proved once again it is two-faced and I remain unconvinced of any goodwill that will ensure all Australians are able to access appropriate telecommunications services. Despite this government's assurances that it will not sell Telstra `until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate telecommunications services to all Australians, including maintaining the improvements to existing services', it is a government that has been hell-bent on putting in place all measures necessary to speed up the process of privatisation. Labor will not support this bill and believe that public ownership of Telstra is the only way to ensure that essential services are not eliminated in regional areas. We are already seeing Telstra abandon its responsibilities to the Australian public, and we are already getting a taste of how Telstra plans to exploit the Australian people if is allowed to become the most powerful Australian company—a company that will potentially become the Australian version of Microsoft; a company that has plans already to move into new markets, such as media and information.
If we allow this to happen there will be even less chance that Telstra will focus on its core responsibility, that being the provision of telecommunications services to Australians. In addition to this, there is the matter of inappropriate corporate behaviour, which has been well publicised. This behaviour saw our Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and our Prime Minister provided with free plasma TVs. Apparently they were given the free plasma TVs to enable them to look at the technology and what the barriers might be to having people sign up and buy plasma TVs. The barrier is $12,000; it is the cost, the one thing that the minister and the Prime Minister did not have to experience while they sat back and watched the sport. Then there are the assurances offered to CEO Ziggy Switkowski that he would receive a $1 million-plus golden handshake if he is sacked. What an inducement to do your job well! Stuff up Telstra and we will give you all your entitlements, and a nice little earner as well—a nice little bonus. I wonder if Minister Abbott is going to ensure that that offer is made to all workers, that the next piece of workplace relations legislation he brings up says that all workers are going to get those entitlements. I really doubt it.
The full privatisation of Telstra will destroy any opportunity for people living in rural and regional Australia to keep up with telecommunications developments both now and in the future. The future-proofing arrangements for regional telecommunications services that have been built into this bill offer no guarantee of any reasonable future levels of service. These provisions are at the discretion of the minister and Australian communications services. If there can be no guarantee of reasonable levels of service at the moment, what hope does regional Australia have of securing reasonable levels of service once Telstra has been sold off?
In the electorate of Bass, Telstra has already shown how it plans to conduct a fully privatised business. In recent times there has been an attitude throughout Telstra in Tasmania that money should not be spent fixing an infrastructure that soon may not be necessary. That attitude is supported by the reduction of the capital expenditure budget over the last three years. It has gone from $5 billion in 2001-02 to $3.5 billion last year and it has again fallen in this financial year to below $3 billion. From this, it is not hard to presume that Tasmania's share of the projected lowered funding allocations from this budget would have to be very much reduced and far from the amount needed to address the shortfalls of the infrastructure. These reductions have meant that Telstra has become very good at implementing bandaid solutions to hold together a copper network that is in serious decay. The network of cables is known to have many faulty pairs and cables, which give rise to noisy circuits and unreliable service. In fact, these faults jeopardise the reliability and security of the telephone network. 
The use of the system of pair gains in Tasmania is now prolific. This system was basically meant to be an interim stopgap measure to provide additional telephone services by allowing the provision of more than one telephone service over a single or, in some cases, several pairs of wires. In some areas, up to six homes or businesses are running all of their telecommunications services off one phone line. This means that homes and businesses are running their phone, fax, Internet and other telecommunications services off the same lines as up to six other homes or businesses. There are severe limitations on access to services when the pair gain system is used. For example, there are problems with congestion—if the line is busy, there is no service for other users of the line and there is no dial tone.
Another example of how the network is in a state of decay is the endless list of exchange cables throughout Tasmania which connect a telephone exchange to a distribution point that are grossly overloaded and outdated. Telstra's means of addressing these exchange issues is to install new pair gain systems or some other stopgap means, because there is no scope to introduce new cable capacity. Despite the inferior level of service on this system, services are not discounted by Telstra or compensated for in any other way.
In another example of how Telstra has been providing services in regional Australia, I know of two cases in Tasmania where Telstra cables are running through properties and preventing the landowners from developing their land. You would think that such an important part of the network would actually be properly mapped so that there was knowledge about where the cables were, but that is not the case. In both of these cases, there was nothing to indicate that there were Telstra cables anywhere on the properties. These cables were only discovered after development work had started. In both of these cases, the landowner has been informed that they are financially responsible for any damage done to the cables.
In yet another example of why a privatised Telstra would not be beneficial for Australia, already there has been a plain case of misuse of resources. I am referring to a recent poll conducted by Telstra in which customers were phoned and asked an incredibly important question: which celebrity would they be most upset to miss a call from? They cannot provide services to the regions or spend money doing up the cable network, but they can waste time ringing people with ridiculous questions.
If this is the level of priority given to the provision of regional services now, I am not filled with great hope that the priority of services would get any better if Telstra were fully privatised. Through offering shabby service like this, Telstra is betraying not only its customers but also its majority shareholders, and it is abandoning its responsibilities to Australians. If Telstra is treating its customers and shareholders in this manner now, what would its level of betrayal be if it were to become the most powerful company in Australia? 
The government may claim naively that it can continue to pass national laws on telecommunications matters that will control this most powerful company in Australia. But already we have seen that powerful national companies become international companies and begin to manage their business at a level that is above the law. You have only to look at the way business is conducted in most multinational companies to see how this would happen. The full sale of Telstra may not have an impact on the parliament's power to pass laws directed at regulating telecommunications matters, but that does not mean that these powers would have any impact on how a fully privatised Telstra would manage its business.
The government does not really believe that Telstra would have any interest in maintaining services in unprofitable regional areas when it can concentrate its services and increase profit by sustaining services to the cities, thereby keeping the shareholders happy. I am opposed to the further sale of Telstra because I believe that a fully privatised Telstra would have no interest in maintaining existing voice framework services or providing new data framework services to regional Australians. I also believe that it would have no interest in continuing to roll out new services, such as broadband, in regional areas. In many communities there is no access to broadband services. With a fully privatised Telstra, there is unlikely to ever be access to broadband services.
If Telstra is fully privatised, it has plans to branch out to new fields, including information technology and media. This will no doubt be to the detriment of the Telstra customers who are already dealing with a deteriorating network that is being run by a declining work force. I am aware of one instance where Telstra management in Perth, Western Australia—and I know that you will be interested in this, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, as it is very close to your own home—sacked a group of workers one Friday. The employees came into work one day and were told, `You're all sacked—see you later.' At the same time, the management summonsed, by SMS, another group of employees based in a regional area near Perth to come in and cover the shift of those workers who were not actually needed anymore. What sort of management practice is this? How can this type of action be that of an organisation that is ready to be run as a large corporation?
Telstra has already put its toe in the water in the area of investment in foreign markets and it has failed. Its losses on investments in Asia have been to the tune of $2.5 billion, and it continues to lose billions of dollars overseas through cuts to network investments and core staffing levels. It has also failed in its roll-out and the level of take-up of broadband services. Australia's broadband take-up rate is pretty low in comparison with other countries. We are 19th in the OECD. This is because Telstra has shown indifference and has failed to educate the public on the benefits of broadband. Its neglect of advertising of the Launceston broadband project and its subsequent comments on the future of broadband only act as further proof of this. Also, the take-up rate is lagging behind much of the developed world because of the lack of competition that might motivate Telstra.
If we allow Telstra to become a fully privatised monopoly, any competition would find it even more difficult to compete on a level playing field. In terms of success in new markets, what guarantees are there that a fully privatised Telstra will be any more successful through branching out into different markets? What guarantees are there that a fully privatised Telstra, with its focus on different markets, will be able to provide any sort of up-to-date telecommunications network? Telstra needs to look at the improvements that are needed to its services before it thinks about moving on. Telstra needs to look at how it can become an effective partner with all Australians, including regional Australians, before it begins to think about how it can then provide services to those regions. The divide between city and country is getting bigger and regional Australia continues to fall behind the bigger cities. If Telstra sells out on the country, this divide will get bigger and there will be no possibility for regional Australia ever to catch up. Telstra must remain in majority government ownership to ensure that it acts in the national interest and not just in shareholders' interests. I have asked the government if they are aware of any private companies that currently put the interests of regional Australia before delivering profits to shareholders. As yet, I have had no response on that. 
The only consumer protection in place is the customer service guarantee, which Telstra already exploits. There is a loophole in that guarantee that allows Telstra to self-declare an exemption from the regulatory regime. The loophole allows Telstra to not have to fix faulty phones or install new services within the prescribed time frames, without any compensation to customers. The loophole even has a name: the mass service disruption notice. The Australian Communications Authority, as the regulator, is supposed to oversee that loophole, but as it reports to the same minister as Telstra it becomes yet another toothless tiger in regulation.
A fully privatised Telstra would have its regional and rural services regulated through the proposed regional telecommunications independent review committee, which I understand is supposed to review the adequacy of telecommunications services in regional areas. The reports from that committee, which would be assisted in its function by the Australian Communications Authority, would then be tabled in parliament. From what I can see, that would probably be very time consuming and ineffective and, while it was happening, customers would still be waiting for their services to be connected and their phones to be fixed. If Telstra is privatised, they will simply have to wait longer.
The faults I have mentioned do not even begin to include technician identified faults, which are not recorded on these lists and sometimes go years without being resolved. The problems with the Telstra network are many and critical. These problems are the result of underinvestment by Telstra in network maintenance and repair, and of reprehensible job cuts that have been pursued in order to generate revenue growth and to increase the share price. These problems are significant and are the result of massive problems with the basic infrastructure. These problems are going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to fix over many years. I do not see this type of spending high on the list of priorities for a privatised Telstra.
Telstra is currently engaged in undertaking massive job cuts in order to push up the share price. These job cuts mean that almost 3,000 communication technicians lost their jobs last financial year and another 3,000 jobs are planned to go this year. The member for Cook identified this and said that it is just modern corporate management. Perhaps I can help him to understand the implications of such modern corporate management by doing a bit of basic maths. One technician does about four fault repairs or new installations each working day. This means that across Australia there will be 12,000 fewer faults and installations being done each day and 60,000 fewer each week. That is three million fewer each year. How can Telstra manage these cuts when it is already well behind in its response to fixing faults and installing new services? How can Telstra deny that these cuts, the poor focus on service and its poor record in regional Australia are not all about fattening up Telstra for full privatisation? 
Labor will not rest on this issue and remains committed to ensuring access to basic telecommunications services for all Australians, regardless of where they live. Labor remains committed to ensuring that Telstra remains in public ownership. Labor will not and cannot allow Telstra to neglect regional Australians and Australians on low incomes. It cannot allow Telstra to go the way of the banks and shut up shop if it is not making a profit. We cannot stand by and watch services diminish any further in regional Australia. If Telstra is fully privatised there is nothing the government can do to prevent that from happening.
It must also be pointed out that Labor is not alone in its opposition to this bill. The member for New England held a press conference and released the results of a survey he conducted in his electorate. The member found that 98 per cent of the respondents in his electorate are opposed to the government's full sale of Telstra. Despite Minister Alston's belief that the survey is bogus, the government cannot ignore those sorts of figures. They are figures that are no doubt representative of many other electorates around the country.
—You can't believe what you just said.
—Minister, you can laugh as much as you like. The reality is that you continue to laugh and ignore the needs of rural Australia at your own peril. The member for New England is not the only one opposed to the bill. One of the government's own members has already spoken out against the full privatisation of Telstra and the impact it would be likely to have on his constituents. The member for Hume, who has always been a very vocal member, recently advised that he might abstain when the House finally votes on this bill, because he cannot desert the needs of his constituents in regional Australia. He said that he was dismayed at the standards of service that regional Australia receives from Telstra. In return for his honesty, the member for Hume says he has been subjected to intimidation and shunned by his colleagues for speaking out. I therefore urge the member for Hume to do the right thing by his constituents and not only abstain from voting but vote against this bill. I urge him to vote with his conscience and according to the needs of his electorate. This bill is bad for Australia. The privatisation of Telstra is bad for Australia. Labor will vote against it and will continue to oppose cuts to regional services.",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2003-08-14,"—In response to the member for Bass: yes, go ahead and vote against the bill. It will underline the continuing irrelevance of the Australian Labor Party and the continuing lack of foresight it has in working in the national interest. The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 comes to the parliament after the government has faced two elections on the issue of the full privatisation of Telstra. In 1998 and 2001, the issue of full privatisation was fully explored through the election process. What was the result? The government was elected. The member for Bass can say that surveys show that 98 per cent of people are opposed to full privatisation. You can ask all sorts of questions that will produce that result, but the key question is what does the electorate say at an election? The electorate approved the government's policy. Get out of the way and let the government get on with what the electorate wants. The electorate wants to see the full privatisation of Telstra. 
I am distressed at the amount of deliberate misinformation that I have heard in this debate already. A moment ago the member for Bass talked about 3,000 job cuts this year. Do you know why that is happening? Because the technology is getting better and more reliable. It works; it never breaks down. You cannot have people sitting there when there is no job to do. The second thing that you avoid telling the parliament and the people of Australia is that Telstra now use contractors to do that installation work. They do not have their own work force, but the people are still employed in the telecommunications industry. You go out there and ask all the phone providers what is happening to jobs growth in the industry. They will tell you that there is a huge growth in jobs in the industry. There are no job cuts in the telecommunications industry; there is growth in the telecommunications industry.
I come to the parliament with a view, and a long-held view at that, that governments should not be in business. The reason is that there is a long history of entities that governments have tried to run as businesses that have failed on efficiency grounds. They have failed on grounds of being more costly in providing goods and services than when the marketplace provides them. I do not think anyone could logically argue a case that a government can run a business better than the market can run a business. On that basis, the government should not run Telstra as a business. Telstra should be run by the private sector—that is what this bill is about. There may be other reasons the opposition could argue that the government should keep Telstra in government ownership, but the fact that it is a business competing against business is not one of them.
What has been the experience overseas? Which telco in the United States does the United States government own and run? The answer is: none. Which telco in Britain does the British government own and operate? The answer is: none. And so it is across most of the world. Governments have gotten out of owning their own telcos, and they have gotten out of owning them for very good reasons. Is Australia going to stay as a backwater and stay in the dinosaur age by continuing to own its telco?
—That's Labor's plan.
—That is correct, Minister. I have been trying to understand Labor's opposition to the sale of the remaining portion of Telstra. I can tell you that Labor's opposition cannot be about jobs, because although Telstra has fallen in employment from about 97,000 jobs down to 37,000 that has been under government ownership and under the policy of the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party by its actions when it was last in government mandated that Telstra would lose jobs, and a very significant number of jobs. So Labor's opposition cannot be about jobs.
Is Labor's opposition about the loss of services in the bush? Well, Telstra has a licence, as do other carriers. Attached to that licence are legal obligations. If Telstra were to wind back services that are mandated by its licence, it would not have a licence. Does anybody seriously believe that Telstra would wind back its obligations in regional Australia against the requirements under its licence and put its licence in danger? That is a foolish suggestion—that situation simply would not happen. Among the legal obligations are the universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee and the network reliability framework. The coalition has recently announced it will legally require Telstra to permanently maintain the Telstra Country Wide local presence. 
Telstra Country Wide's presence has been the greatest thing in regional Australia that we have seen in many years. In River Quays in Palmer Street, South Townsville, Telstra proudly has the biggest Telstra Country Wide sign you could ever see, saying to the people of Townsville: `We're here.' I want to pay tribute to Owen Taylor and his team in Townsville. They are so focused—110 per cent—on customer service that my electorate office no longer gets any complaints about Telstra services. Not a single person has rung up to say, `I couldn't get my phone fixed.' Not a single person has rung up to say they have difficulty in getting a number. Telstra Country Wide is providing a magnificent service to regional Australia and will continue to do so—and it will continue to do so under government licence conditions. Incidentally, I worked with the Telstra Country Wide people in Townsville in relation to mobile phone coverage on Magnetic Island, and they were first-class; they saw the need and did the design. On Friday week I will be with Owen Taylor launching the new complete mobile phone service—both CDMA and GSM—on Magnetic Island, which is a great result.
I ask myself, `Is Labor's opposition to do with good public telecommunications policy?' What is Labor's track record on that? Remember when Labor decided that its policy would be to close the analog mobile phone network, and the disruption that that caused? That is the kind of policy that the Australian Labor Party implements in relation to telecommunications—very bad policy indeed. Did we hear the Leader of the Opposition say quite blatantly today that it is the ALP's plan to split up Telstra anyway? What kind of public policy is that? Labor's opposition cannot be about good public telecommunications policy, because Labor does not have any.
Labor's opposition cannot be about financial benefit to Australia. Those who are listening to this broadcast, and the people of Australia, should know and understand that the ALP opposition have already cost Australians $30 billion by opposing the full sale of Telstra. Just imagine how much we could have done for the people of Australia with another $30 billion—what we could have done in our own electorates; the extra services that could have been provided. The Labor Party have denied the Australian public access to those kinds of dollars.
Labor's opposition cannot be about keeping the telco in government control. Labor's only rationale for keeping Telstra publicly owned is that somehow it gives the government a greater ability to tell Telstra what to do. Wrong, wrong, wrong! It is a complete fallacy. By law, since 1991 Telstra has been required to operate on a purely commercial basis. The government cannot tell Telstra to do anything other than to operate on a purely commercial basis. All the rules and regulations governing Telstra and the wider industry are totally unrelated to who owns Telstra. 
So what is this about? It cannot be about all the issues that I have mentioned. The answer is found in Labor's track record of saying no to the government on every major national policy issue. Labor opposed budget savings. Labor opposes reforms to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Do you know what that means? By opposing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Labor denies to the poorest people in this country access to the latest medicines. That is what Labor has done. It has said to the poorest people in this country, `You're not going to have access to the latest medicines because we're not going to pass the government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme legislation, but people who are very wealthy and well-off can afford to pay for the latest medicines.' How unfair is that? 
Labor has opposed reforms to the disability support pension in a very significant way. Remember its opposition to the unfair dismissal laws, which stopped small business employing many more people. Remember Labor's famous opposition to waterfront reform. We all know now what the result of the government's persistence was on that issue, how efficient the Australian waterfront is now and how that has benefited our farmers and exporters. Labor opposes the government's policy on compulsory union fees. It effectively does that to make people who do not support the Australian Labor Party pay part of their union fee as a contribution towards the Australian Labor Party. Labor opposes secret ballots for protected industrial action. 
Labor opposed literacy and numeracy testing, because it was a captive of the unions. Look at what has happened since that testing has been introduced, how the various states and the school system have understood where their deficiencies are and how they might correct them for the sake of our kids. But Labor opposed literacy and numeracy testing. Labor opposes youth wages. It opposes cracking down on welfare cheats. It opposes a two-year waiting period for migrant social security. It opposes government initiatives on national security. It opposes private health incentives. What would happen if private health incentives were withdrawn? The public hospital system would just not cope. The key issue is Labor's total opposition to tax reform. Remember the benefits that tax reform brought to this country when the government persisted in doing what was right in the national interest. 
There is a long list of `oppose for opposing's sake'. The hallmark of the Howard government is to tackle the hard issues in the national interest, to stick to and stand by its convictions, to argue its case to the Australian people and to explain why its policies are in the interests of the Australian people. But all that the government faces in doing that—this bill is a typical example—is an opposition that just says no to everything. That is not a responsible opposition. A responsible opposition should argue why it is concerned and what might be done about it, not just say a blanket no. The Howard government understands that not every decision it takes will be universally popular—and there have been some of those in the past 12 months—but if you operate a government on the basis of what the opinion polls are saying, you are not a fair dinkum government. However, the government is committed to tackling the tough issues that will set up Australia's future. Until Labor stops shirking the national interest and playing politics with every issue, it is unfit for government.
Selling the remaining government shareholding in Telstra is in Australia's national interest—it is in the interests of Telstra, its 1.8 million shareholders, the wider telecommunications industry and, most importantly, the Australian people. Selling the government's remaining stake in Telstra will finally pay off the massive debt that was left as a legacy of the last Labor government, and that will keep interest rates low for Australian home buyers and small businesses. The sale will allow Telstra to realise its full potential as Australia's competitor in the global telecommunications market and it will remove the conflict of interest that currently exists where the government is not only the regulator but also the shareholder of the largest telco.
However, the real question to ask on this subject is not `what happens if we do sell Telstra?' but `what happens if we don't sell Telstra?' There is great risk and uncertainty attached to not selling Telstra. While it is easy for the Labor Party to sit on the sidelines and snipe at the Government, it must explain why it needs to keep a conflict of interest and why Telstra, as Australia's largest company in one of the most competitive global markets, should be forced to operate with one hand tied behind its back. Why is it? Labor has to explain why every Australian taxpayer should be forcibly exposed to the volatile share market? I have already indicated that Labor's opposition to selling Telstra has already cost the Australian people $30 billion. It has to explain why Australians should be saddled with the remaining $32 billion of government debt left by Labor and be forced to pay interest on that debt every year at the expense of better services. 
The real keys to better telecommunications are competition, which drives new services and lower prices, and regulation, which provides safeguards. Since the Howard government introduced full competition in 1997, the number of phone companies in Australia has increased from three to 89. As we all know, phone calls are now significantly cheaper across all services. 
There are, of course, some very significant consumer safeguards for all Australians, and I want to remind the House of those. There is the Trade Practices Act, administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and we have the state and territory fair trading acts. We also have the universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee, the national relay service, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, the national reliability framework and interim services requirements. We also have the untimed local call obligation, price control arrangements for Telstra, priority assistance arrangements, the digital data service obligation, an independent regulator—the Australian Communications Authority—and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is also watching. Each of those safeguards applies regardless of whether the ownership of Telstra remains as it is or whether it is in full public ownership.
There is some concern in the community about foreign ownership. The government has committed that Telstra will continue to remain as an Australian owned and controlled corporation, irrespective of whether the government has a shareholding in it or not. The government has given a commitment not to amend the current statutory limits on foreign ownership of Telstra. Under these arrangements, Telstra is subject to ownership restrictions that limit total foreign ownership in the company to 35 per cent of its listed capital and the maximum holding of any individual foreign entity at five per cent. These limits on foreign ownership are intended to prevent foreigners from exerting undue influence in the operations of the company.
The Telstra Corporation Act also requires that Telstra's head office, base of operations and place of incorporation remain in Australia and that Telstra's chairperson and a majority of its directors are Australian citizens. These provisions continue to apply irrespective of the ownership structure of the company. Government ownership adds nothing to Australian telecommunications other than uncertainty. Before too long, this uncertainty will need to be lifted. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2003-08-14,"—Country Australians know the only reason they have gained improved communications in recent years is due to their effective protests, much of them channelled through my office and more recently through the offices of my fellow Independents. They know how many people are still at the end of lines that cannot deliver anything vaguely resembling adequate Internet speed. They know there are many lines that are still substandard, despite the government's spin on the recent Estens report and despite the rhetoric of future-proofing the bush.  
They do not want to give up the right to continue to lobby members of parliament and to ensure that their telecommunications carrier remains publicly controlled and is held to account. They know the other players in the telecommunications market are quite happy to pick the eyes out of the profitable bits of the market and damn the rest. They know a fully privatised Telstra would be obliged to do exactly the same for its private shareholders.
At a time when you would think Telstra would be flat out rectifying some appalling shortcomings in its country infrastructure and network, despite recent improvements in some other areas, there is outdated cabling, poor lines and exchanges and new cabling left lying on fences and across paddocks with no plans to repair the damage. While all this is happening, it is reducing the work force of the very personnel who can do this work. These workers are members of what are called fix and fit teams—and fix and fit is exactly what is needed in the Telstra network. Where the network is regarded as adequate, I am reliably informed that parts of it are literally hanging on by glue. This glue is the Seal the CAN debacle, where a special weatherproofing sealant was used several years ago to patch up broken cabling. The problem is the chemical in the sealant has been eating into the plastic of the original line and has caused major problems, something you would think fix and fit crews were best placed to try and correct. Some of the cabling has, in the words of one informant, been `shot to ribbons'.
While Telstra spent $11 million on corporate entertainment last year and $73 million over the past five years, these fix and fit staff are being retrenched under highly dubious assessment processes. Despite the fact fix and fit staff work up to 60 hours a month overtime, despite the fact leave is regularly cancelled, despite the fact there is not enough staff to service the backlog in work, eight jobs are to go in the Cowra, Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow area.
There is a smell around these retrenchment procedures. People with almost 30 years service are being marked down on skills while people without relevant licences are receiving higher marks. The assessment process by a team leader is not independent, nor is any review of what is called a `two-up'—the next highest in the pecking order. The process seems clearly like a kangaroo court, designed to create a compliant work force that will not complain about deficiencies in the installation, repair and maintenance program.
The evidence used to downgrade employees is highly subjective and in some cases quite erroneous. One worker has been downgraded for failing to properly care for a Telstra vehicle by putting improper fuel in it. A manually marked petrol card receipt shows the petrol was incorrectly written into the leaded as opposed to the correct unleaded section of the docket. The Telstra employee was downgraded and faces retrenchment, despite the fact it is an impossibility to fill any vehicle from the wrong pump at a modern service station.
Not only are Telstra workers being unfairly targeted in this pre-sale slimming exercise; so too the people of rural Australia will be dudded and the network will inevitably deteriorate, not improve—that is under the current regime, not under a privatised arrangement. One Telstra employee told me that any review, any inquiry, any up-to-scratch assessment, is simply a snapshot in time with no guarantee of anything. There has been a $1.5 billion reduction in investment over the past three years and a slashing of staff from 50,000 to 37,000. Line rentals are increasing at a rate of knots, and there is pressure from other telephony companies to pull out of their universal service obligation contribution, despite the fact none of the other players contributes anywhere near enough for cross-subsidising rural services. 
Privatisation is quite simply rejected by rural Australians. The only future-proofing they want is proof their telco stays in their control, responsible to them through their parliamentary representatives. They know anything else will leave them disconnected—if not immediately then surely as their prices go up in a privatised environment and their services are not repaired or installed. 
If it is obvious to customers and Telstra ground staff that the fix and fit regime is not working effectively now—that it is being cut to bare bones and increasingly outsourced to remote contractors—what will be the scenario after privatisation? Future-proofing, up-to-scratch, community service guarantees and bandwidth strategies are rightly regarded as so much political jargon, even by many of those in my electorate who might currently have adequate services—for example, within the Orange city limits. They know, however, that there are no plans to upgrade the Clifton Grove exchange on the outskirts of the city, where professionals and business owners expect faster Internet connection and dream of broadband. They do not expect to be told that an expensive satellite option is the only answer.
Rural Australians are very angry about the government's determination to privatise Telstra in the face of overwhelming opposition. Last year the three Independents in this House conducted surveys of their electorates, resulting in an overwhelming rejection of further privatisation. My colleague the member for New England has repeated that survey—with something like 6,500 returns, to date—with identical results. About 96 to 98 per cent of my electorate and the member for New England's electorate say an absolute and categorical no to full privatisation. Interestingly, I understand that similar figures are coming from a survey being conducted by the member for Hume.
The PM said yesterday that we have more or less got things up to scratch. He might think it is up to scratch as far as the merchant bankers and brokers are concerned. They stand to make a multimillion dollar killing—$218 million per year, for three years—on any sale. But `up to scratch' is a sick joke in the bush. Let me read part of a submission from 10 constituents from Gilgandra in the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate of Gwydir. They sent it to the Estens inquiry with a copy to me. They said:
Up to scratch—the terminology—shows almost total disrespect for the intelligence of the Australian public. We agree Telstra should not be partially owned by the public 50.1 per cent and privately 49.9 per cent. Telstra must be 100 per cent Australian owned.
To sell government assets, especially Telstra, is bowing to the dictates of powerful commercially organised international controllers at the expense of the Australian public, who not only oppose the sale but from whose purse parliamentarians' salaries are paid.
Let me tell you about Denis Englebert of Neville, south of Bathurst, who wrote to me. He described how his phone went dead and he phoned Telstra from the nearby village the next day. He was told, after a 20-minute wait, the problem was with his equipment in the house and to go home and unplug the phone, leave it for 20 minutes, then plug it back in. It did not work. He drove back to the village, called Telstra, waited another 20 minutes and was told on Friday the problem would be fixed in two days time. On the Saturday, there was still no phone. The family had stayed home all day Friday and no-one turned up, despite Telstra saying the phone had been checked. Apparently, no-one had answered. Anyway, a promise was made that the job would be completed by the following Monday. It was—by a technician who came all the way from Cowra and informed the Engleberts that he had only got the job that day and could not believe the family had been without a phone for 6½ days. So much for fix and fit. Mr Englebert is a pensioner and carer with a disabled wife. Mobile phones do not work in his area, which is not far south of Bathurst. Mr Englebert said in his concluding remarks: 
A phone breaks down and Telstra, with all its you-beaut technology, locating equipment and computerised gear, takes 6½ days to put a joiner on a thin piece of cable wire.
Ian Gorman from Canning, a government held electorate in Western Australia, wrote to me because he was so frustrated at the lack of response from his own local members. He tells me that Telstra connected his phone line to the exchange via RIM technology which significantly downgraded the service. He is restricted to very low modem Internet speeds and this hook-up means he cannot connect to ADSL to improve the situation. This is part of Telstra's divide and multiply fix-it. Using pair gains—or, in this case, RIM technology—simply enables more services on the same system. But it does not improve reliability or speed where the Internet is concerned; it diminishes it. If Mr Gorman, in suburban Perth, wants a reliable Internet connection he is asked to subscribe to a satellite option worth $800, which he cannot afford.
Reg Chandler from Canberra is about to move to a small farm near Bathurst, in my electorate. One night recently he was stranded by a car breakdown on the Woodstock-Lyndhurst road not far from Cowra—it is certainly not the end of the earth. He walked for half an hour before he found a mobile connection. He eventually got to his farm just outside Bathurst, where he had to walk to the top of a hill to get mobile coverage. This is the Telstra service so fondly described by National Party members as now up to scratch or almost up to scratch.
The ALP can also bear part of the blame for this by setting the wheels in motion for the switch-off of the analog frequency, which readily covered CDMA black spots like the one Mr Chandler experienced. Black spots continue to exist at Hill End and other places, despite the rollout of CDMA. It is not an adequate and comprehensive replacement for analog by any stretch of the imagination.
Near Orange, on the side of Mt Canobolas, a constituent was told that he is on the end of an old copper line and there are no plans for upgrade. While discussing the issue with the Telstra worker, the technician made a mobile call and it dropped out—12 kilometres from Orange post office. This gentleman also questions why we do not retain the infrastructure in public hands, rent it to other providers on a competitive basis and provide flat rates across the network. The danger from privatisation, as he and many others see it, is the possibility of timed local calls. The outcome would be the same as charging for postage on the basis of the distance a parcel or letter travels.
Let me share with the House the experience of Guy Fitzhardinge of Mandurama, which lies between Blayney and Cowra and is not far south of Orange. He has two unreliable phone lines which drop out during thunderstorms, or about once a month for no apparent reason. This problem has existed for 34 years. He has been asked to plug and unplug his phone—like bashing the side of your TV set to make it work. That is the only suggestion that can be thought of.
Mr Fitzhardinge says the fault has never been at the house, as he has been told it is, but in the line—the old copper cabling that runs to his house. He has to walk about a kilometre to get very patchy mobile coverage just to report this fault when it happens. He is a farmer and a businessman and it impacts on him and on his elderly mother, who lives nearby. Telstra says the cost of servicing those customers—and a couple more on that line—would be half a million dollars. 
That begs the question: what fully privatised company would carry out such infrastructure improvements for so little return on capital outlay when financial and not social dividends are the demand of private shareholders? Secondly, how can the government possibly argue that the recently announced $181 million of rural capital upgrade in response to the Estens report will go anywhere near meeting the infrastructure upgrade requirements? One constituent told me the $181 million could well be spent in the central west of New South Wales alone, and I do not disagree—instance that example of the half a million dollars for a couple of kilometres of replacement line in just one tiny pocket of the central west. 
Incidentally, the minister's claim that the future-proofing guarantee for Telstra to maintain a local presence is some sort of major policy initiative is treated as a joke by country people. They remember the Telecom local presence, right down to district depots, where the local linesman in Molong knew exactly where the lines were and how to fix them quickly, and the people knew where he lived too. Telstra Country Wide, while welcome, is a pale imitation of the former Telecom country presence, trying as it is to restore the lost Telecom local network knowledge, quite apart from the network itself. Telstra Country Wide is actually less than country people once had in terms of face-to-face service.
This is not, as the minister and the Deputy PM would have it, future-proofing; it is simply catch-up policy. The Fitzhardinge example alone shows that, irrespective of this $181 million, the national network, if privatised now, will be a mix of the information superhighway for a fortunate few, a barely adequate sealed road with Internet speed around 30 for some others, and a potholed gravel road for many more at the end of old copper lines, with laughable Internet speed on lines with constant drop-out and split services using pair gain and other patchwork technologies. In a rural market where true competition cannot work because of the lack of critical consumer mass, it is absolutely imperative that the public, through the government of the day, retains control of the virtual monopoly Telstra enjoys over the Internet business and the network. 
I could go on with a litany of complaints and concerns about phone and Internet services from within and far beyond my electorate. My office has been a lightning rod for the concerns of country people all over Australia in the face of a lack of interest from most government members, it seems. I cannot believe the previous speaker's contention that there is a completely happy electorate in North Queensland and there are no complaints. Perhaps they are not coming through to his office. I am fielding complaints on a regular basis and have done for seven years. They have diminished somewhat in recent times through the channelling of them to Telstra Country Wide, which has been set up and deals with them. I have a very good working relationship with Telstra Country Wide and I am entirely sympathetic to its budget frustrations and the challenge it faces. But, when it is said there are no calls coming into offices, it really makes me question where those people are going, because you cannot say those faults do not continue to exist.
The full privatisation of Telstra has been stitched up in the party room since the first raft of Telstra was sold with the support of government members in this place. It was a nebulous comment from Senator Ron Boswell that set the apparent benchmark for the adequacy of Telstra services. It was called `up to scratch'. What the hell did that mean? It was probably something to do with back scratching but absolutely nothing to do with the adequacy of rural and regional, and in many cases urban, phone services. This is not a bill about a sale; it is a bill about a sell-out of the Australian people. It is about an estimated $30 billion injection of revenue but the forgoing of much more than that over the years ahead from the dividends of Telstra—a telco that has the capacity to match any telco in the world. We stand to lose $3.5 billion in public dividends over the first four years after any sale. That is why the market here and overseas is so keen to get hold of it. 
As we consider international telcos, let us put to rest the myth that we are the last developed country to hang on to majority public ownership. Let me list, yet again, countries with significant public ownerships and their percentages: Austria, 75 per cent; Belgium, 50 per cent; Czech Republic, 51 per cent; Finland, 53 per cent; France, 61 per cent; Germany, 43 per cent; Greece, 51 per cent; Iceland Telecom, 100 per cent; Japan, 65 per cent; Korea, 58.9 per cent; Luxembourg, 100 per cent; Netherlands, 43.25 per cent; Norway, 79 per cent; Poland, 35 per cent; Sweden, 70.6 per cent; Switzerland, 65½ per cent; and Turkey, 100 per cent. There is a sample of those backward nations of the world who, along with Australia, have not accepted the virtue of the market, and eventually foreign investors, controlling their telecommunications networks.
Our unique geographic character in this country, with 90 per cent of the market occupying just 15 per cent of the continent's landmass, is the most compelling reason why, of all countries, Australia should retain public control of its dominant telecommunications provider. We should absolutely ensure a level playing field for telebusiness consumers in the bush into the future, with the government of the day in absolute control of service delivery. The Prime Minister has told this place that any government cannot bind a future government to any guarantee of future services. He said that in an answer to the member for New England. That says it all.
This legislation is not only about a short-term $30 billion revenue windfall; it is about opening up our economy to the international market. It is a sister bill to the cross-media ownership relaxation bill held up by the Senate. It is about the free trade agenda with its demands from the US for no public ownership of key services. It is an agenda that is totally rejected by my constituents, by over 90 per cent of rural Australians and, I believe, by a majority of urban dwellers. 
Australians also reject that a fully privatised Telstra is in the best economic interests of this country. They regard the current ownership arrangements as a true public-private partnership, but they also want proper corporate governance in relation to Telstra. If this government were to cynically line up this bill along with the media bill in a list of rejected legislation to be considered by a joint sitting of parliament after any double dissolution, it would have absolutely no mandate to do so. If, even more cynically, it tried to enable a joint sitting after any normal election, that referendum would be rejected with or without opposition support, because the cynicism of the major parties, with their dwindling support, would quickly become obvious. I would certainly be doing everything in my control to spell out that cynicism. The one referendum the government will not put is one on the sale of Telstra.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2003-08-14,"—I have listened to the so-called `independent' member for Calare's speech to this parliament on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 and it was interesting to hear of the numerous examples that he cited about how Telstra was experiencing service difficulties or how Telstra customers were having difficulties obtaining mobile phone reception or in having handsets repaired. I was intrigued because the member made no mention of the fact that these same problems also existed when Telstra was 100 per cent publicly owned. The litany of examples about how customers were experiencing difficulties makes absolutely no difference whatsoever to service delivery. The fact is that there will always be examples of how people are adversely affected by poorly performing telecommunications equipment. No-one steps into this chamber claiming that a fully privatised Telstra will solve every single example of telecommunications difficulty that exists. No-one stands before anyone in this chamber and claims that a 100 per cent privatised Telstra will no longer pose any problems in terms of mobile phone reception or telephones not working properly. But what we do contend, what those on this side of the chamber put forward, is that a privatised Telstra will not have an impact on service delivery. There are some that would go further, and they would say that it will not have an impact in a negative sense but may very possibly—in fact more than likely—have an impact in a positive sense. 
Competition in the telecommunications industry has benefits that flow to all consumers. When Telstra started to become privatised and the first tranche was sold and the second tranche was sold and we opened up the marketplace to competition, consumers benefited extraordinarily. The ease with which we use Telstra services these days in terms of MessageBank, conference calls and call-waiting is not only a consequence of technological innovations; it is also a consequence of adoption of this innovation by Telstra, adoption demanded in the marketplace, adoption that is required if Telstra is going to continue to be an effective supplier in the marketplace, a supplier that customers will want to use.
In essence, the Labor Party and other members opposed to the privatisation of Telstra oppose it on one of two grounds. The first is a philosophical opposition to privatisation of a utility such as this. They will come into the chamber and say, `We believe it should be 100 per cent owned in the public domain.' Whilst I do not agree with that proposition, I certainly think it holds more weight than the view of those that come and argue the second limb, which is to say that they are not too concerned by a Telstra that is half owned by the private sector as long as the private sector only owns the minority. To me this half-pregnant Telstra would have to be the most absurd proposition of all. So let those on the opposition benches who believe that Telstra should remain in public ownership put forward their case for it to remain so. Let them put forward their philosophy and their reasons and their rationale as to why the government should buy back 49.9 per cent of Telstra. But to come in here and argue that Telstra should remain 50.1 per cent owned by the government is spurious in the extreme. The main reason it is spurious is that those arguing that point of view are blind to the consequences affecting not only Telstra as a company but consumers of Telstra services and the shareholders that have 49.9 per cent of Telstra. They hamstring Telstra. A half-pregnant Telstra is a Telstra that is bad on all fronts—and it is not just me and those on the government side that say this; it is also former members of the Labor Party. Gary Johns, a former Labor minister, recently wrote on the sale of Telstra:
The failure to sell Telstra will create the worst possible economic and social outcome. An inefficient Telstra burdened by increasing Community Service Obligations, a poor return with millions of dissatisfied shareholder-voters, a declining return to government and a weak international competitor with no capacity to raise capital from its principal shareholder. 
It does not take more than a basic understanding of economics to understand how a former Labor minister is absolutely correct when he says that a half-pregnant Telstra, a half-privatised Telstra, is a policy on a hiding to nothing. In terms of the community service obligations—or what we term the universal service obligation, the USO—there is nothing at law that prevents government from imposing a USO on a fully privatised Telstra, nothing at all. There is nothing at law that prevents the government of the day from dictating to a fully privatised Telstra that it must comply with certain service standards. Those people that come into this chamber and argue that Australians are opposed to the sale of Telstra, asserting that Australians believe service delivery will go down, provide absolutely no justification as to why. We can legislate, we can mandate, service delivery. We can say to a fully privatised Telstra, `It is this government's decision to compel you, through legislation, to provide these minimum standards.' We do it all the time with other industries and there is no reason we cannot do it with the telecommunications industry. So the member for Calare and other opposition members who come into this chamber and highlight difficulties that consumers experience are doing nothing except engaging in a scaremongering campaign. They play the worst kind of politics because they play opportunistic politics.
It is the same thing that we see from the Labor Party when the Leader of the Opposition comes into this chamber and speaks about how he is opposed to the sale of Telstra. It is base politics of the most populist type. It ignores the real question that needs to be asked: why can't the government mandate minimum service requirements for a fully privatised Telstra? The answer is that it can and it will under the Howard government. It will still require minimum service levels that all Australians can be satisfied with, without the ensuing difficulties that currently flow to those who are shareholders in Telstra—for example, difficulties that mean Telstra is unable to increase its equity. If Telstra wanted to purchase a new company—say, Telstra identifies a particular technology that it believes would be good to roll out to the community generally and it wishes to acquire that company—it would need to do so on the basis of effectively paying cash for that company. It would not be possible for Telstra to issue equity to that company because to do so would mean that the government—under this half-privatised, half publicly owned model—would need to increase taxpayers' funds in Telstra.
In addition to that, it is also constraining Telstra's growth by keeping it in this half-privatised, half publicly owned model. The fact is that telcos traditionally have enjoyed a higher price to earnings ratio. In the marketplace there is an expectation that its earnings will grow more quickly because traditionally that has always been the case. But because Telstra cannot issue new equity, owing to the fact that the government would need to increase its investment in Telstra through using taxpayers' funds, the market keeps the Telstra share price low because it takes into account this constraint on new growth. In addition to that, it also puts Telstra in an invidious position whereby it is unable to truly distinguish between commercial considerations and the requirements of government, which, as part of governmental requirements as the majority shareholder, blend in considerations such as service delivery and perhaps non-commercial decisions. The government, as the majority shareholder, challenges the board to take these types of things into account in terms of the future plans and future projections of Telstra. By the same token, those that are private shareholders want Telstra to make commercial decisions: decisions that are good for shareholders. 
On the vast majority of occasions, on the basis of the whole economy, we recognise that competitive conditions and commercial decisions are in the best interest not only of shareholders but of customers as well. There are very few examples that you could find in which a company would make a non-commercial decision that is against the interests of its customers. If it did, it would face the consequences as a result of poor decision making. Let us free Telstra from the shackles that it currently has and let us recognise that government can still mandate, still require and still enforce through legislation minimum service levels. Let us not hear this loose talk from the member for Calare and from opposition members: `I happen to know three constituents that have had problems with Telstra; therefore, we shouldn't sell it.' That has always been the case.
What are the other concerns that we hear enunciated in this chamber? We hear members speak about how Telstra will act as a monopoly in the marketplace, if it is fully privatised, and will misuse its market power. I have two responses to that. The first is that Telstra did that when it was fully government owned. When Telstra was fully government owned, it acted like some gigantic monolith in the marketplace, not responding to consumer concerns at all. If you were a customer under a fully government owned Telstra and you had a concern, it was bad luck if you wanted customer service because it did not exist. It has only been through a competitive marketplace that Telstra has become the more responsive organisation that it is today.
People say that, if Telstra is privatised, it will become a monopoly and might misuse its market power. My second response is that that is one reason we have the Trade Practices Act. There are many examples of companies that have significant degrees of market power, yet they are regulated and their conduct is watched closely by an aggressive Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. On this side of the chamber, I make no apology for the strong posturing of the ACCC. It is the ACCC's job to be on the lookout not only for consumers in any marketplace but also for other competitors in the marketplace. I know that there are many examples of Telstra's competitors taking advantage of the ACCC's powers to enforce actions against Telstra. This would continue under a fully privatised Telstra. Again, concerns that are put forward with regard to those two points are false.
With regard to the specific needs of constituents in my electorate on the Gold Coast, I have had some constituents approach me highlighting difficulties they have with Telstra, in the same way, I am certain, that every member in this chamber has had constituents approach them with their difficulties. However, I can report that Telstra responds in a very efficient and effective way to these concerns. I was very pleased to see Telstra recently broaden its Country Wide service to include and embrace the city of the Gold Coast. John Lister, who manages the Country Wide service on the Gold Coast, is someone that I know is doing a very good job of making Telstra a more dynamic and efficient operator in the marketplace. The provision of Telstra's Country Wide service to a city like the Gold Coast—the sixth largest city in the country with 450,000 people—highlights the way that a more agile, privatised and flexible Telstra will respond and react to consumer demands and consumer trends in the marketplace.
The notion that keeping 51.1 per cent in public ownership will somehow maintain the best of both worlds—a flexible Telstra and, at the same time, a Telstra which is in a situation where the government can watch it closely—is false. We can watch it closely irrespective of the ownership structure. I do not believe for one moment that the benefits that have been brought home to Telstra consumers are benefits that would have taken place if Telstra had remained the government monolith that it is—or, rather, that it was. Telstra is a company that needs to be dragged into the 21st century. The telecommunications sector is one of the most rapidly changing and rapidly advancing industry sectors in our entire economy. It is one of the most crucial sectors in terms of providing the kinds of support services that are required across the board. 
Telstra, of course, will always perform a very important role at both a wholesale level and a retail level. In many regards, Telstra Wholesale powers the vast majority of our economy. Telstra Wholesale is in a unique situation, where it provides basic infrastructure needs. The ALP, up until several months ago, had as its policy what I believe it termed `virtual separation' of the Telstra wholesale and Telstra retail networks. It put this forward for a couple of years, saying that the answer to the Telstra conundrum was a virtual separation between the wholesale and retail networks. But we found that, when the ALP was confronted with the facts and when the ALP started to appreciate that the financial market saw this virtual separation as an absolute joke, it dropped it like a hot potato. The consequences are that, in terms of the ALP's policy position, now Telstra can remain both a retailer and a wholesaler.
Let us not get confused about the functions with which the ALP is concerning itself. The ALP often makes remarks along the lines of saying, `Labor is concerned about service delivery,' which you would interpret as being concerns about the wholesale arm of Telstra, yet the arguments it often uses to back that up are arguments pertaining to Telstra at a retail level. I do not hear any clarity from any members of the opposition indicating the reasons why it should not be privatised. The arguments are confused between wholesale and retail. The arguments are confused about the benefits that flow to consumers, the benefits that flow to shareholders and the benefits that flow to government from a half-privatised, half publicly owned Telstra. There is a complete vacuum of any clear policy direction from the opposition with regard to Telstra.
—What about concerns about competition?
—`Concerns about competition' I hear being interjected. What about concerns about competition? A fully privatised Telstra in the marketplace is subject to the rigours of competition. This government has done more to promote competition in the telco sector than any government before it, and consumers have been the beneficiaries of a more competitive marketplace in the telecommunications sector. The fact is that I can now pick up the telephone and pay 3½c per minute to call the United Kingdom, for example. Go back 10 years and you would not have paid 3½c per minute to phone the United Kingdom; you would have paid probably $1 a minute, if not more.
There is an array of examples in a more competitive telco marketplace of where benefits flow to consumers. Look at mobile technology. We have, as I said, an industry sector that is absolutely crucial to our economy. We also have an industry sector with the highest degree of convergence that we have ever seen. The fact is that we do not know whether in 10 years time the land copper wire lines will be, for all intents and purposes, a thing of the past. We talk about 3G technology with regard to mobile telecommunications and we learn that there are opportunities there, through mobile telecommunications, to have Internet access, email and PDA all available through your telephone and at call rates less than we pay for fixed-line calls. 
As well, I hear members of the opposition talking about how line rental charges have increased and how line rental charges are another example of the reason why Telstra should remain in public ownership. What about all the arguments about the way in which so many prices have dropped? What about the numerous examples of how consumers are better off under a privatised and more competitive Telstra? They conveniently ignore all those concerns. They conveniently ignore all the benefits that have flowed to consumers, the investment in new technology, the fact that we have a third generation of mobile technology being rolled out, and they deny the fact that their half-privatised, half-public model of Telstra results in Telstra being ramshackle and unable to invest in new technology. If Telstra cannot pass on to consumers the benefits of new technology, it is because of Labor Party policy on a half-privatised, half-public model.
In conclusion, a fully privatised Telstra would provide consumers with a more competitive marketplace; a fully privatised Telstra would not mean any reduction in service standards. It would maintain, and we will enforce through legislation, minimum service standards. A privatised Telstra is in Australia's interests because it helps us to repay the debt that Labor left—the $80 billion black hole—under the leadership of Kim Beazley. The proposal for a fully privatised Telstra deserves the full support of this chamber. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"—I rise, during this debate on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003, to oppose the full sale of Telstra. We are elected in this place to represent the views and concerns of our own communities, and I can say this without a shadow of doubt: my community does not want Telstra being sold off. So far the government has not been able to convince too many other people that it would be a good idea to sell it, if opinion polls, surveys and the views expressed by the government's own members are any indication to go by.
The member for Moncrieff has just given us some reasons, I believe, why people in this country would not want Telstra being sold off. He is giving us some guarantees, I believe, that a Howard government would regulate a fully privatised Telstra. I ask him: would they regulate a fully privatised Telstra in the same way that they have regulated the Commonwealth Bank to stop the banks from pulling out of electorates like Greenway and others? I do not think so. I also ask him: is he talking about core or non-core commitments? I think these are possibly some of the reasons why the people of Australia are not accepting the government's arguments relating to the full sale of Telstra.
The arguments put forward by the government in favour of privatisation simply do not hold any water. `We have competition,' they say. There are some 89 telecommunications companies in Australia, so there is no need for the government to own one of those 89. The trouble is that when you scratch below the surface you will find that one company makes up about two-thirds of the entire industry and about 95 per cent of the profits. There may be 89 companies, but there is no true competition—certainly not on any level playing field. If you put a first grade national rugby league team, with all its resources, into a local C grade competition, you will get the idea of what sort of `competition' we are talking about in this industry. We have such an overwhelming and dominating single company that it virtually amounts to a monopoly anyway. Such a dominant monopoly should not be placed in private hands. It would be against the national interest to do so. 
The government also like to trot out the line that owning Telstra is a conflict of interest because they cannot own and regulate at the same time. This, of course, is nonsense, but it does show the darker side of the government. Under such a theory, the government would be privatising Australia Post, selling off every public hospital, flogging every school and university, taking offers on a good sale price for the ABC and SBS, and outsourcing the Defence Force with a quick call to the mercenary company Sandline. Maybe they would like to do these things if they could get away with them but they will not, and they will not get away with trying to sell the remaining part of Telstra.
Of course there is no conflict of interest in the government owning Telstra. There never has been, there is not now and there will not be in the future. In fact, it has been argued to me by one of my constituents that the opposite is actually the case: that section 51 of the Constitution demands that the federal government provides telecommunications to the nation and that by telling Telstra off it is abrogating its constitutional responsibilities. That argument, quite frankly, has been around for some time. Maybe some constitutional lawyers would argue differently, but I believe that is the view of a number of people in this country who have legal qualifications.
Labor believes that a privately owned Telstra would be a giant private monopoly that would be too powerful for any government to effectively regulate, as the banks are. It would focus on the more lucrative markets in the bigger cities and neglect the interests of low-income and regional Australians, just like the banks have done. There would be an inevitable decline in regional service levels—again, just as has happened in the financial industry. A fully privatised Telstra would use its muscle to squash effective competition and spread its monopoly power into other sectors like the media and information. Telstra would exert enormous monopoly influence over Australia's economic, social and political landscape. It would be one of Australia's largest private companies and would potentially become an Australian version of Microsoft in the US.
Telstra remains essentially a public utility, with pervasive monopoly characteristics. On simple economic grounds there is no justification for privatisation. A majority publicly owned Telstra is the only effective means of guaranteeing universal telecommunications services for all Australians. Another argument by the government is that minority private shareholders are threatened by the government meddling in their company. This is, of course, fatuous, because the government is also saying that, if Telstra is completely sold off, it can still regulate how it operates—in other words, it can still meddle by other means. It is a classic case of the government trying to have its cake and eat it too.
The government tells us that, because Telstra is exposed to the vagaries of the share market, the government by its ownership is also subject to these same vagaries. The Treasurer has pointed out that under his stewardship Telstra has lost $30 billion in value. This is not an argument for selling Telstra; this is an argument for sacking the Treasurer. All of these arguments put up by the government seem to focus solely on the interests of the minority—private Telstra shareholders. As I walked into this chamber just prior to commencing my contribution, I heard the member for Moncrieff solely focusing again on the minority private Telstra shareholders. This is fair enough, but it does ignore the much larger group, which is the customers who are in themselves the majority shareholders, through the Australian government. 
The government went to the last election with the following policy under the heading `Telstra: further sale'. It said:
The government will not proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians.
At present, the government is not satisfied that this is the case.
You will notice the word `adequate'—not `decent', not `good', not `world class'. It does not aim to achieve that; it merely aims for `adequate': `Let's just get by.' You will also notice the words `to all Australians'. That is a bit surprising, given the blinkered and complete focus by this government on services in the bush, which of course do need good telecommunications services. We do not argue with that, but it has been the case that every time the sale is mentioned the service levels talked about are only those in rural and regional Australia.
My constituents do not live in rural Australia, and Western Sydney is only classified as a region when it suits some government bureaucrats to do so. I have been speaking about service levels and telecommunications infrastructure in my electorate on the outer edges of the metropolitan area for quite a few years now. I am glad to see that the Prime Minister's own parliamentary secretary, the member for Lindsay, has also come out in public agreement with me about the low state of affairs with regard to infrastructure in our community. The member was on the front page of the Western Weekender on 11 July under the banner headline `Kelly talks Telstra'. There was a big photo of her with a clenched fist raised above her head, and she was decrying:
We don't get the benefits of the rural areas and we certainly don't get the benefits of the city. A lot of our area is new housing and we don't have the infrastructure that should come with these new communities.
I say to that quote: hear, hear! I fully support it. It is exactly the point I have been making in speech after speech in this place.
The huge expansion in residential development that has taken place in electorates like Greenway and Lindsay over the past five to 10 years—and, indeed, it is continuing today—has meant that Telstra has not kept up with the infrastructure that is needed to service these new suburbs. The problem of pair gains is huge. There are too many houses and not enough phone lines, so the phone lines are split, which halves the dial-up Internet speed and rules out any chance of broadband completely. In the new suburbs no cable is being laid. Pay TV is by satellite, which means that the satellite is also the only way to get broadband. As I have said in the past, satellite is the most expensive form of broadband services, cable is the cheapest and ADSL is only slightly more costly.
Telstra is currently advertising do-it-yourself broadband for $129 installation and $60 per month for an 18-month contract—that is, ADSL, if you are lucky to be able to get ADSL. As the member for Lindsay and I know, it is not available to everybody in our electorates. So the only option that is left is satellite at $699 for the hardware, $399 for the installation and $120 per month for the service. So you can see the disparity between the options available to our constituents in outer metropolitan areas. Over the 18-month contract that you are forced to sign with BigPond, a do-it-yourself ADSL customer will pay a touch over $1,200 while a satellite customer over the same period will pay a little over $3,250—over 2½ times as much. If that same satellite customer was living in remote Australia, there are enough discounts, subsidies and special programs available that the cost factor is reduced considerably. It is only people in the new developing suburbs on the fringes of our major cities who miss out. 
I had a meeting with representatives from Telstra in my electorate office last week regarding this very issue. I was pleased that they were aware of the problem and I was pleased that I had the opportunity to talk to them and to give them some indication of the concerns our constituents have. I am also pleased that they are taking some steps towards fixing the problems associated with broadband access in these areas. You have to remember that, in our electorates, you have ordinary mums and dads who will use the Internet for their various activities and you have a large group of young people who will use it for education. But you have also got a large number of small business people who operate from home. At the moment they are finding that the Internet connections are simply not satisfactory.
We find that new copper wiring is being run into the remote integrated multiplexers in order to provide ADSL services to a greater area. It is happening slowly and only after years of lobbying. Think how much harder it would be with a private company concerned only with the bottom line. The two representatives also made some very interesting comments about the future. They said that in 50 or 100 years time, copper networks will not exist. There will be some other form of technology. Whatever that technology may be—probably fibre optics—it will require an enormous capital investment in order to upgrade the entire network. Will a private company invest that heavily in what is essentially a public, nation-building exercise? I do not think so. What happens even further down the track when something comes along to replace fibre optics? Who will put the network in place then, if not the government? Capital investment—not in research and development but in network infrastructure—is a huge ticket item that is in the national interest. But a private company, interested only in shareholder dividends and share market prices, will not invest the kind of money that will be needed.
Over the past three years, Telstra has reduced its capital expenditure by $1.3 billion. It spends $1.3 billion less investing in telecommunications networks and infrastructure than it did three years ago. So you can see what a fully privatised company would do. The Telstra work force has been reduced by 13,000 people, from 50,700 to just 37,000 over roughly the same period. How are the infrastructure problems that we are facing in our communities ever going to be fixed with such reductions taking place? A private company even more focused on the profit margin will only further reduce the investment that is needed to take our country to the cutting edge of new technologies. A privately owned Telstra will be concerned only with its bottom line, as any private company usually is, but it will ignore the infrastructure needs of the community and of the nation in order to do so.
One only has to look at line rentals to see where the trend is. Three years ago line rental was $11.65 per month. Today it is $26.50 and will rise to $30 within the next two years. For many in our community the line rental accounts for the vast majority of the monthly telephone bill. I have a letter from a constituent—a pensioner—who has written to me complaining about the costs of his telephone service. In part, it says:
I have a phone mainly for ringing doctors or for an ambulance. If I did not need it for these things, I would not have a phone as the charges are approximately 90% of my account. I'm a pensioner and I look at my accounts: $15.20 for 3 months for calls and the rest is charges. I think Telstra is robbing us. 
A telephone is necessary, as this pensioner indicated. It is not a luxury and yet for many it is being priced out of reach. A privatised Telstra, concerned only with profit, will result in higher call costs and higher line rentals, turning this necessity of life into a luxury item. Telstra has over 100,000 faults waiting for maintenance, waiting to be fixed. Of course, it covers the figures by saying that they are not faults but merely `routine maintenance'. It is a fiction that most people see through.
Service levels are simply not up to scratch and there has simply not been enough improvement since the last election for the government to justify this sale. If the government were not satisfied that service levels were adequate at the last election and Telstra has since spent less on maintenance and infrastructure, there is absolutely no way that the policy the government took to the election has been fulfilled. This is not the time to get into philosophical discussions about core and non-core promises, but it is pretty obvious which basket the Telstra policy falls into. In 2001-02, Telstra made a net profit after minorities of $3.66 billion. The government's dividend from that at 22c a share was approximately $1.4 billion. In the half year to December 2002, the net profit was almost $1.2 billion and the dividend to the government at 15c a share was $967 million.
So in the past 18 months a publicly owned Telstra has paid the government $2½ billion—and that is not including tax; that is just the dividend. This revenue stream will be lost to future governments by a one-off fire sale. You might get a pretty penny for the company but you will only get it once. That will mean less money to spend on hospitals and schools and other government services. And once it is gone you will never get it back. The government have come up with some pretty bad ideas over the past few years and I believe this decision is right up there with the best of them. It is just plainly and simply a bad idea. It is the product of the rampant ideology that infests the conservatives in this country. They are working on a misinterpretation of 18th century economic theory that since its invention some 230 years ago has never worked in reality anyway. The theory demands that individual self-interest be placed before the social good; before the good of the community. It is a theory that simply has not worked when put in practice.
The Prime Minister keeps talking about taking Australia back to some distant memory of a golden age. I might remind him that the golden age he wants was a time when Telstra was 100 per cent owned by the Australian people and the government regularly intervened to correct constant market failure. The middle-class democracy of peace and prosperity is only available with the intervention of government. A completely laissez faire economy results in a society where the losers outnumber the winners by a vast amount. If the Prime Minister truly wishes to have everybody enjoy the wealth of a prosperous nation then he should not be trying to flog off Telstra to the highest bidder. The government is selling out our future.
It is worthwhile concluding with a few points that I believe the Leader of the Opposition made very effectively in his speech earlier today. He said that Telstra services would be leaving areas—just like the banks—and that there would be a need for an increase in taxes to fund future infrastructure expansion. He was also very critical of the golden handshake that has been made available to the chief executive of Telstra. He also made the very valid point—and I will conclude on this—that small business see telecommunications as being the third highest cost in running their businesses. Tax comes first, tax completion comes second and telecommunications comes third. We believe that if there was full privatisation of Telstra the prices would go up. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,2003-08-14,"—I rise in this House today to speak on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003. As the federal member for Maranoa, representing a landmass that is 40 per cent of Queensland, I know only too well the importance of Telstra's role in maintaining optimum levels of telecommunication services in Australia—particularly in my own electorate of Maranoa and importantly in many parts of rural and regional Australia.
When Labor was in government, for 13 years it had a dismal record of improving and guaranteeing access to communications. One of its failures—and a particularly galling failure—was the abolition by legislation of the extremely successful analog mobile phone network. I highlight that one because the analog service was a very good service that was abolished by the other side of this parliament. Labor did not have a replacement for analog but it abolished a mobile service that was providing good service. When we came to government it was one of things in legislation that we had to honour.
When it comes to regional telecommunications, it was never on the agenda of the Labor Party in their 13 years in government. They did nothing about strengthening services and service guarantees. In fact, for many years before we came to government there were across Australia some 40,000 subscribers in remote areas of Australia who paid for a timed local call, including some in my electorate of Maranoa. Under this government, that has been eliminated. That was another one of the things that the Labor Party failed to address when in government. It was a gross inequity in relation to many subscribers—in this case, 40,000 subscribers in remote parts of Australia.
In comparison to Labor's dismal record, since this government was elected in 1996 we have proven our true commitment to ensuring that all Australians, no matter where they live, have access to adequate telecommunications services and continue to share in the benefits of new technology. While our work is not done yet—there is a lot more to do; we acknowledge that—progressively since we came to government we have been continuing to strengthen the service guarantees. We have also continued to improve telecommunications services right across Australia.
This bill before the House is in response to the recommendations of the regional telecommunications inquiry report of 2002—the one we refer to as the Estens report. On 25 June the coalition government announced that it had accepted all of the 39 recommendations made by the Estens inquiry, including the need for Telstra to maintain a local presence in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. I want to touch on that because that is very important and will be a condition of licence for Telstra. The condition this government put in place is that the Telstra Country Wide offices that are out in rural and regional areas of Australia will have to remain. That is something the Labor Party never did and something we know the independents can never do because they will never be the government.
The other thing that we saw with Labor in relation to Telstra's presence in rural and regional areas of Australia was the slow retreat of Telstra country shops, including from my own electorate. In my own home town, under a Labor government the Telstra shop that was once there retreated; it was shut down, closed. Under our legislation, Telstra will be required to maintain Telstra Country Wide offices in rural and regional areas of Australia. 
As well, the government has accepted the recommendation that there has to be regular independent reviews of the adequacy of telecommunications in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. Labor never initiated those sorts of initiatives. As such, a special task force has been established under the leadership of my party colleague the member for Hinkler, Paul Neville, to monitor the implementation of the Estens response and report back to the Prime Minister and to the government on a quarterly basis.
I believe the Estens report has been an enormous achievement. It recognises the need for government to listen to those sorts of inquiries and respond. Certainly, the National Party was instrumental in ensuring that there was another inquiry under Dick Estens following the implementation of the Besley recommendations. It builds on the government's previous telecommunications initiatives in regional Australia, including Networking the Nation and our response to the Besley inquiry. Further, an important point I would like to make is that, regardless of any change in the future ownership of Telstra, the 39 recommendations from the Estens inquiry will be delivered in full. There will be $181 million coming from the budget—
—Seven dollars!
—The member for New England should applaud this: the $181 million will be delivered in full regardless of the future ownership of Telstra. That will commence, and I am sure he will be there with his hand out for his electorate—
—as will the member for Calare, rightly wanting some of that money to go into their electorates. There will be $181 million delivered, commencing in January next year. We will just see where the independents are when that money starts to flow in 2004—whether they are supporting that or not.
After making such tremendous inroads into improving telecommunications, this government believes that communications competition is also important and is in our national interest. I want to make this point: in 1997 there were some three licensed phone companies in Australia; there are now some 89 separate licensed phone companies in Australia, and 40 per cent of those are offering services in regional Australia. In other words, competition is working and it is driving down prices and giving consumers greater options.
This coalition government has already achieved a great deal for the people of Australia in relation to telecommunications since we came to government in 1996. As a Liberal-National coalition we have committed more than $1 billion in direct funding to building Australia's telecommunications and information technology. The issue of mobile phones is just one of the major wins for the people of my own electorate of Maranoa, who have benefited from over $40 million to extend mobile phone coverage in 132 towns across Australia with populations of over 500 and 55 towns with populations of less than 500. I am sure the member for Lingiari, being from the Northern Territory, will acknowledge that he has seen more mobile phone roll-out in his electorate since this government came to power than he saw when he was the member for the Northern Territory.
—The sixth, seventh and eighth largest communities in the Northern Territory aren't getting any coverage! You're distorting the truth!
—If he was honest with himself he would acknowledge that. We have seen $20.4 million given to extend mobile phone coverage in 62 sites along 34 regional highways, many of which are in my electorate and in the member for Leichhardt's electorate. It is now possible to drive from Brisbane right through to Winton with a CDMA mobile telephone with an outside aerial—I always promote the need for an outside aerial—and have very few gaps. 
That is an enormous achievement that has been achieved since we came to government, as well as the elimination of timed local calls, which I identified earlier in my address. In 1999, this government allocated $150 million to upgrade telephone services for residents in Telstra's remote area extended zones. When I first came into this parliament I was a great advocate for seeing that those people who lived in those extended zones had access to untimed local calls. Until we introduced this legislation and put that $150 million into that program a hotel, for instance, would have to pay to ring across the street to the police station or you would have to pay for a timed local call to ring down the road to your neighbour in a little country town. It was this government that abolished that, which is one of the great things that I was able to achieve, because we are in a position to understand the needs of our people in rural and remote parts of Australia.
As part of that same contract the coalition government provided the opportunity for subscribers in these extended zones to access the Internet via a two-way satellite at no cost to the subscriber. The people who took up that offer have got broadband that is on all the time free of charge via a two-way satellite. When you talk to those people—
—If the member for New England or the member for Calare ever got off the bitumen—
 (Ms Corcoran)—I ask the member for Maranoa not to respond to interjections.
—Perhaps if they got off the bitumen in their tiny little electorates, went out to the remote parts of Australia and talked to those people they would understand that those people have seen enormous improvements in communications in rural and remote parts of Australia, including access to the Internet. I challenge them to come out there some time and talk to my people and see for themselves the improvements that have taken place.
Transferring 49.9 per cent of Telstra to private ownership has funded many nation-building projects, for which I have always been a big campaigner. Much has also been achieved for our environment with the proceeds. As a government we face many challenges on the environmental front, and $2.7 billion has been allocated to the National Heritage Trust fund, which has been used to address many issues such as salinity, woody weeds and other environmental issues. In my own electorate the drought Envirofund, which was an initiative of this government through the National Heritage Trust, has made a marked difference by helping people, at a time of the worst drought since Federation, address some environmental issues that they may otherwise not have been able to address. Under Labor, none of these initiatives would have eventuated or even been possible.
Our Natural Heritage Trust is the largest environmental restoration program in our nation's history and it should have the support of the other side of the House. The Natural Heritage Trust fund has provided money to repair Australia's fragile environment, and the benefits will not only flow to today's generations but also to generations in the future. It is an investment in the environment; it is also an investment in future generations of Australians. 
Labor may claim that they will not sell Telstra, but they have a history and certainly a track record in this regard. In fact, if you were going to have a bet, you would put money on them. It would be a better bet than going to the races. We only have to recall Labor's commitment to Australia that they would not sell the Commonwealth Bank. We all recall that. They even wrote to the employees of the Commonwealth Bank and said they would not sell the Commonwealth Bank. But when they were re-elected, what did they do? They sold the Commonwealth Bank. They also sold Australian Airlines to Qantas, and then they sold Qantas. But the point is: what did they do with the money? They spent it. They did not reduce debt. They just continued to rack up debt—which stands in stark contrast to the way this government has dealt with issues of the privatisation of Commonwealth assets.
The issue of telecommunications has always been high on my agenda and the agenda of the National Party and the coalition government. Let me quote, as did the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, John Anderson, from the second reading speech which introduced this transition to full private ownership bill. This is important:
While the government is moving to establish the legislation immediately, it has undertaken not to proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate telecommunications services to all Australians, including maintaining the improvements to existing services.
The National Party has always remained firm on its stance in relation to Telstra. I have always said that I would only support the full sale of Telstra once services in the bush were up to scratch. This is exactly what is stated in the second reading speech, and it is certainly in line with our National Party policy.
People in my electorate and throughout Australia can now look forward to seeing some of the many benefits that will flow from the 39 recommendations of the Estens report. For instance, measures to improve the existing telecommunications services include $30 million over four years from 1 January next year to extend mobile phone services and $4 million to expand the satellite phone subsidy scheme, which is an important subsidy for those people who live beyond the reach of CDMA and the GSM terrestrial mobile service. It is very important for those emergency services and people in the most remote parts of Australia. In my own electorate, many people, communities and emergency services have taken up the existing offers from that satellite phone subsidy scheme.
Another $2.9 million will be spent on the establishment of a national broadband strategy implementation group to provide a national strategic approach across all levels of government. The $10.1 million for information technology training and support is also important in rural and remote areas of Australia, where formal training programs are not currently accessible. A national broadband strategy will see that $2.9 million is spent to establish a national broadband strategy implementation group to provide a national strategic approach across all levels of government. Future proofing is another important element. The recommendations from the Estens inquiry will ensure that, as technologies improve, regional communities will continue to share equitably in the benefits of advances in technology. The Estens inquiry recognised the importance of a regional presence for Telstra Country Wide, which I spoke about earlier, and we will make it a condition of licence on Telstra to maintain that local presence in regional Australia. I repeat what I said earlier: this licence condition will apply regardless of the future ownership of Telstra. 
The government has also accepted Estens recommendations to do with the enhancement of existing Internet and telephone services. Of particular interest to my electorate is the upgrade of the DRCS—the digital radio concentrated system—to CDMA. This initiative will be particularly important in those areas that were not upgraded and did not have access to a satellite service under our $150 million extended zone tender. Additionally, we will obtain a commitment from Telstra in relation to the upgrade of the pair gains system, including a time frame for improvement to this system.
The National Party has always been a great believer in national infrastructure and building our nation. We have a proud record in this area. We have always had policies to invest in health, education, communications and road infrastructure, which we have delivered whilst we have been in government with our coalition partners. A great example of that road infrastructure is the Roads to Recovery program. The member for Calare and the member for New England are always announcing the Roads to Recovery funding and how that is helping local government and local roads in their areas. That is a very good example of how we have always been a great supporter of national infrastructure. That was an initiative of the National Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson. Other examples include the Regional Solutions—now Regional Partnerships—Program and the Rural Transaction Centre Program. And the list goes on.
We as a party, in the coalition and in the government, have been great believers in building a better nation and putting money into national type infrastructure, both small and large. One of the conditions of support for the partial privatisation of Telstra was that the National Party wanted to spend money on the upgrade of communications infrastructure. A national infrastructure project will have flowed from the benefits that have accrued to the budget as we have been able to reduce Labor's debt. The benefit of reducing debt is that the Commonwealth has less interest to pay. The debt we reduced was the debt that was incurred by the Labor Party. With less interest to pay, you have more money to spend on nation building projects. That is what the National Party has always supported: reduce the debt, but make sure there is a dividend that flows from it.
Whilst I am concluding, I want to urge that there not be any horse-trading on this bill. We know that the Labor Party, the Independents and the Democrats love to horse-trade and then claim that the successful passage of a bill was because of their horse-trading. We also know that you just cannot trust them. Let me reiterate the quote from the second reading speech:
While the government is moving to establish the legislation immediately, it has undertaken not to proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate telecommunications services to all Australians, including maintaining the improvements to existing services.
That is a safeguard for us all. We are committed as a coalition government to improving services in rural and regional Australia. We have a track record, unlike those on the other side of the parliament, who have an abysmal record and certainly cannot be trusted. I thank the House.
Debate (on motion by Mr Entsch) adjourned.",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"—The previous speaker in this debate on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003, the member for Maranoa, has shown us that Telstra is not the only thing in Australia that is for sale by this government. We just heard the National Party selling its soul, selling out the people of Australia—not only the people in the bush but people all over Australia—selling out its integrity and selling out all Australians who rely on this essential service. Telstra is an essential service, yet we see the National Party—that pale echo of what was once a great party, now just a political rump that sells out on every occasion to the Liberal Party—selling out on Telstra today.
Listening to the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, and our ALP spokesperson, Lindsay Tanner, speak on this issue, I was pleased to hear them both reiterate the ALP's strong opposition to the further sale of Telstra. We oppose this for a good reason: the sale of Telstra is bad for Australia, it is bad for the bush and it is bad for the budget. Not only is the sale bad but the whole process which the government are trying to set up is flawed. I say this because the government have not set in this legislation a timetable for the sale but would leave the timing up to the minister. What they would have this parliament do is pass the legislation and then have the minister gamble on the best time to sell the remaining equity—an equity which already belongs to all Australians.
I say to members opposite, particularly members like the member for Maranoa: if Telstra is so good, why sell it? The government claim that they will not sell the remaining equity until they are `satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians, including maintaining the improvements to existing services'. That is what they say, but we know that they are prepared to gamble on the future price—and they are asking the people of Australia to trust them on the basis that they will not sell until the price is right. That is a big gamble, because we know that in Australia we have a government and a Prime Minister whose word cannot be trusted. 
Just as the government are prepared to sell Telstra for a quick buck to meet their political ends, so too are they prepared to lie to the people of Australia. Trusting this government and this Prime Minister is indeed a gamble—a big gamble. In racing parlance, trusting this government would be like trying to recoup all of your losses by betting all of your hard-earned money, in the last race of the day, on the biggest roughie when it has drawn wide on a wet track. The odds are too great and the government and this Prime Minister have form and a proven track record of deceit, lies and deception.
We know that Telstra's service levels are not up to scratch—and that is true not just in the bush. In my electorate of Cowan, which is situated in Perth's northern suburbs, we have poor services. Indeed the shadow minister, Lindsay Tanner, visited Wanneroo earlier this year and spoke to the City of Wanneroo's Economic Development Unit, who are rightly concerned about poor broadbanding in the area. Lindsay listened to their complaints as to how that impacts on economic growth in the area and the flow-on problems which are created for one of the fastest growing local authorities in Australia. This is an area desperate for economic growth and for the jobs and services that go with that growth.
Indeed, the Mayor of the City of Wanneroo, Jon Kelly, was recently quoted as saying, `How can Telstra claim it has improved services to the bush when it can't even properly service the fastest growing city in Australia?' That is true. How can members opposite possibly come into this place and make that claim day in, day out? They are either very badly informed, not in touch with their electorates or just simply having a lend of themselves, because they are certainly not having a lend of us. We do not believe them.
Telstra has a long way to go. Instead of selling off this asset, the government would be better served to demand a return to proper management of the corporation. Instead of gambling and losing hundreds of millions of dollars in dodgy overseas investments, Telstra should be investing in capital expenditure, which has fallen from a peak of $4,705 million in 1999-2000 to an estimated $3,250 million in 2002-03. We now know that during these same years staff have been shed at a rate of some 4,500 full-time employees per year. So I say to members of the coalition: how can services possibly have improved during this time and how can they possibly have kept pace with the technological and capital growth which has been experienced in other areas of Australia? 
This government should be insisting on improved investment in Telstra to ensure services keep pace with growth, rather than simply selling the remaining equity solely for the purposes of bankrolling and pork-barrelling exercises as it lies and buys its way to the next election. This government should also be insisting on proper consumer protection of those who use Telstra's services. If consumer protection is bad now—and I believe it is—just imagine what it would be like under a fully privatised Telstra. 
For most of us on this side of the House hardly a week goes by that our constituents do not bring to our attention some problem relating to Telstra. I recently took up the case of a family in my constituency who was having a blue with Telstra over a bill. I wrote to Telstra on their behalf, sending with my letter sections of their telephone accounts for the months of April and May. These people also complained directly to Telstra. In my letter to Telstra I said:
As you will see, an amount of $3200 is owed for calls on a 1902 number to World Psychics. These calls were made by— 
the couple's—
15 year old daughter who has been under psychiatric counselling and on anti-depressant medication. The calls were not authorised by her parents. 
I went on to say that this family:
... have expressed their extreme concern that Telstra has no capacity to identify such a vastly different telephone usage pattern, similar to that used by banks with credit card usage, particularly when an amount of $645 was generated during the course of one day and $862 was generated in less than 6 hours on another day. They are concerned that the only advice received from Telstra was that they should have “opted out” of a service they did not know existed, did not request and did not authorise. 
I am extremely concerned at the position—
this family—
now find themselves in. The family will be put under extreme financial pressure in order to pay this large account. 
I asked for some consideration, some understanding, to be given to this family by Telstra. I will not quote all of Telstra's letter in response, but these are some of the things that they had to say: 
Customers have a responsibility to monitor accounts and make sure the costs are affordable. However Telstra is not obliged to monitor the usage of a Service, if there is unusual usage the Customer remains liable for all uses of the service. 
Further, they say:
The customer is liable to Telstra for all Charges in relation to a Service whether or not the Customer authorised the particular use of that Service by another person. 
They conclude by saying: 
I appreciate that you may not be satisfied with the outcome of this matter. However, I wish to advise that the charges of $2207.00 are legitimate and payable to avoid further credit management action. 
So much for the corporate responsibility of one of the biggest corporations in Australia. I feel very sorry for this family. They are some of the battlers that we on this side of the House deal with. If Telstra is doing this sort of thing now, just imagine what it will be like if it is fully privatised, fully sold, where there is a lack of accountability and a lack of proper consumer protection. If it is bad now, it will be a damn sight worse fully privatised. 
Labor is the only political party in this nation that is opposed to the further sale of Telstra. But preventing that sale is not all that we want. We have a number of other things that we want of Telstra. The Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, spoke about some of those things this morning when he made his very fine speech here on this issue today. There are four things which I am going to reiterate that the ALP wants. Telstra will be required to intensify its focus on its core responsibilities to the Australian community and reduce its emphasis on foreign ventures and media investments. That is for good reason, because we are all now aware of the massive losses that Telstra has suffered as a result of its poor investments overseas. The second thing that Telstra will be asked to do is to intensify its focus on the provision of affordable and accessible broadband services available for all Australians. I mentioned earlier the problems that are being experienced in Wanneroo in the northern suburbs of Perth. It is not the only area that is experiencing these problems.
The third point is that the competition regime will be strengthened by requiring much stricter internal separation of Telstra's wholesale and retail activities, and the minister for communications will be removed from the process of the ACCC's scrutiny and regulation of accounting separation within Telstra to ensure the process is genuinely independent and rigorous. The fourth point is that consumers will be given stronger protection from sharp practices by telecommunications companies and the price control regime will be made fairer. 
We do not just stand opposed to the sale of Telstra—although we are firmly committed to prevent that happening—but we also want to see Telstra lift its game. We want to see better investment in Telstra. We want to see Telstra providing better services, accessible by all Australians, because indeed the services that Telstra provide are essential. We stand opposed to the sale of Telstra and we stand opposed to this legislation. It is bad legislation and, as I said earlier, the sale of Telstra is bad for Australia, bad for the bush and bad for the budget. We oppose this legislation.",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2003-08-14,"—Let me start by putting the significance of this debate—and it is significant—on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 in a historical context. It is the conceit of every generation that it is in the midst or at least on the cusp of momentous events that dwarf the experiences of those who have gone before. The examples are obvious. The baby boomer generation continues to view the 1960s as the crucible of great historical forces, a time when things profoundly changed in society. Their parents saw the Second World War as the great clash of world views, a time of challenge and triumph, unprecedented for centuries. In fact the Americans even have a term for that: the `greatest generation'. Yet their parents too, the veterans of Gallipoli and the Western Front, saw the world transformed by a unique cataclysm. And so on and so forth.
One is entitled to be sceptical then, when a person—least of all a politician—describes events as epochal, or a contemporary period as transformational. Yet that is precisely what we have witnessed over the past decade and what we are witnessing at every moment. It began with the crescendo of victory in 1989—the dissolution of the Soviet bloc, not into blood but through peace. A tyrannical system collapsed in the wake of its own contradictions and unmet expectations in the face of a prosperous and powerful free world. At the time it was difficult to think outside the orthodoxy and see in the new world, ordered or otherwise, a global environment fundamentally different from the near century that it followed.
There were indications. I remember that, at the time of the last gasp of communism during the abortive coup of 1991—a coup that accelerated the forces at work, despite the coup's architects—a now forgotten pop band wrote of the evening news, `Bob Dylan didn't have this to sing about.' They were right. A world was delivered from the stalemate of mutually assured destruction. People were unchained from the misery imposed by treaties negotiated before they were born. Yet the transformation was not limited to the other side of the wall. We were changing, too. We had been changing for a decade.
In this country there had been bipartisan agreement that Australia's particular circumstances—its workplace disputation, nationalised services, stagnant industry and uncompetitive practices—needed to change. Throughout the 1980s, Australia followed a course of market based reforms, echoed but not necessarily mirrored in the United States, Britain and across the Tasman. Those reforms were sometimes painful, but they were pertinent. Australia emerged a stronger nation for the experience, surer of our place in the world and better equipped to make the next generation of Australians all they can be. Unemployment has been reduced, inflation conquered, budget deficits forgotten and growth accelerated. But there is more to do.
In coming into office, this government identified a series of much needed reforms, reforms not necessarily addressed during the Hawke period: reform of the labour market, reform of the taxation system, reform of government financing and reform of our nation's telecommunications system. For the revolution of the 1980s and 1990s—the revolution that propelled the West into the information age and broke down a tyrant's capacity to resist—was built largely on the incredible growth in telecommunications, data transmission, computing power and networks. Nations across the globe have recognised that only through free, unimpeded telecommunications can their businesses be as profitable as possible and their living standards as high as possible. This government shares that awareness. 
Of course, there had been tentative reform moves before 1996. Members would be aware that upon Federation the powers of the states with regard to postage, telegraphic communications and telephones were consolidated and handed to the Commonwealth. Under the terms of section 69 of the Constitution, their existing services were brought within the management of the federal government through the Postmaster-General's Department—the PMG. As the Bills Digest notes, through progressive constitutional interpretations by the High Court the Commonwealth's authority was extended in this regard until it acquired an effective monopoly on telegraph and telephone services.
In 1975 Telecom was formed as the statutory authority responsible for telecommunications and 14 years later it was corporatised as the Australian Telecommunications Corporation. In 1992 Telecom became Telstra with the merger of Telecom Australia, the domestic service provider, and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, otherwise known as OTC, the international carrier. It is important then to reflect on what Telecom, Telstra's predecessor in the age of nationalised communications, was actually like. In short, it was a bureaucracy uncommitted to customer service, terrified of change and improvement and unresponsive to the demands of Australian businesses or families. There were even standing national jokes about the government business enterprise. I recall that in my rural area in the Adelaide Hills it was better known as `Bastards Inc.' Things were even worse way out in the bush. Many members will recall the standard `party lines', for example.
Conditions improved somewhat in 1991 when an effective duopoly was created by Optus's entry to the market and their purchase of the Aussat satellite. But improvements did not really come until the market opened up even further and the first two tranches of Telstra were sold to Australian shareholders, bringing to bear on the company not only consumer pressure but corporate pressure. Prices have come down and services have expanded. Remember that less than two decades ago Australian families would actually post their expatriate sons and daughters audio cassettes of conversations rather than incur the prohibitive cost of an international call. I remember it well, as our family did it. My two sisters were living in North America at the time, so we would sit around and tape a conversation and post it to them. How the world has changed—and for the better.
These reforms—that is, the sale of the first two tranches of Telstra—came honestly. The Liberal and National parties went to two elections promising that those sales would occur if we were elected or returned to office. It is likewise with the initiatives to be implemented in this bill. The coalition have been up front with the Australian people. There will be no unforeshadowed privatisations like those of Qantas or the Commonwealth Bank. We have taken the Australian people into our confidence because we have good faith in their judgment and their commitment to economic reform. We have stated without reservation that the sale of the remaining tranche, leading to the effective full privatisation of Telstra, would only occur when we could be satisfied that arrangements were in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians. This commitment was expressed through the regional telecommunications services inquiry, otherwise known as the Estens inquiry, undertaken in 2002 following earlier recommendations made in 2000 under the chairmanship of Mr Tim Besley AO. This is an explicit recognition of the particular circumstances of this country and its telecommunications network, its often disparate population and the important role that Telstra and its predecessors have played in building a national network. 
It has been profoundly disappointing to listen to the arguments of the opposition. The member for Melbourne, for example, said, without any evidence, that Telstra will abandon rural and regional Australia and will deny country Australians access to quality telecommunications—and so on and so forth. I say to those listening to this debate: make no mistake. Do not believe the hype. The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 does nothing to weaken the capacity of the Australian government and, through the government, the Australian people to make laws on telecommunications, to mandate service requirements or to give guarantees. Governments—local, state and federal—safeguard the Australian people through regulations and laws every single day without recourse to the nationalisation of services, and this is how it will be with telecommunications once Telstra is a wholly private company.
If anything, the Australian government will be in a better position to specifically regulate the activities of Telstra. At present the Commonwealth Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts is charged with setting the rules for a company of which he is the effective owner. This is the grand flaw in the nationalised profits dream imagined by some members of the opposition and some of the minor parties in the other place. The nationalised profits they crave come only through a regulatory system skewed away from the public interest towards the state interest. In a free market Telstra will be just another player—better able to act flexibly to meet customer demand and required, like its competitors, to meet certain standards of service but unable to use the state as its dedicated advocate.
The bill itself leaves open the date for sale. This will, after all, be a long and involved process. The government accepts that fact. This is the subject of much public interest and debate—and so it should be. Such a debate in the other place has already been foreshadowed. Furthermore, the government is committed to obtaining the best return possible for taxpayers in terms of sale conditions. As the Minister for Education, Science and Training noted in the second reading speech, the bill gives the Commonwealth the options to pursue a conventional sale, sale through a number of different tranches or some alternative arrangement—for example, hybrid securities—and it gives the Commonwealth the authorisation to make any borrowings necessary for the sale process.
Let me refer for a moment to the option of hybrid securities in addition to the release of ordinary shares. Hybrid securities were not part of the first two tranches. However, this bill introduces a sale scheme arrangement whereby the Commonwealth may transfer some of its shares to a wholly owned Commonwealth company that would issue hybrid securities. I will not attempt an expert explanation of this category of securities. Suffice it to say, they are a combination of equity and debt. I believe they provide a set dividend rate for a five-year period and can later be converted into shares at a set ratio of one hybrid to one ordinary share. There are different types within this broad group, varying in characteristics and degree of flexibility. 
In any event, the government have decided to maximise the flexibility available in the sale arrangements for the remaining publicly owned shares, and I refer to the amendment contained in items 16 to 21 in schedule 1 of the bill which provides for these Telstra hybrid securities, issued in Australia and overseas, in Australian or foreign currency, to be exempt from state or territory stamp duty or other taxes. This will be a blessing. To re-emphasise, post-sale Telstra will, like its competitors, be subject to regulatory safeguards like the universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee, price controls, the network reliability framework and the jurisdiction of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. To address the specific concerns of Australians living outside of the capital cities, the legislation before the House establishes a licence condition that requires a privatised Telstra to prepare and implement local presence plans for regional Australia. The minister or the Australian Communications Authority will be empowered to make administrative arrangements for the implementation and monitoring of those plans.
The bill also establishes an independent review of regional services, scheduled within five years hence. That will review the adequacy of services provided outside metropolitan areas and report back to the minister with its findings. This regional telecommunications independent review committee will comprise a chair and at least two other members. It can derive assistance in performing its functions from the Australian Communications Authority and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. We can also assure Australians that Telstra will, under the provisions of this bill, remain Australian owned and controlled. The maximum level of aggregated foreign ownership will remain at 35 per cent, with individual foreign ownership restricted to just five per cent. Finally, the bill makes provision for employee entitlements and rights such that employees of Telstra will not be disadvantaged by the transition of the corporation from government majority ownership to private ownership.
In conclusion, I refer back to my initial comments concerning the changes that are occurring within and between states across the globe. There is an increasing awareness that citizens in free, open nations like Australia are demanding different responses from their governments. Their expectations of the state are not necessarily shrinking or expanding, but they are changing. Increasingly it is the capacity of governments to maximise individual opportunities that is of integral importance. This sale, as the final stage in the reform of the Australian telecommunications industry, helps meet that challenge. As Henry Ergas argued recently in an article in the Australian:
There are many things that governments can be good at, but owning the means of production—be they steel factories, shopping centres or telecommunications networks—is not one of them. All too often, when these assets are in government hands, they are used not to produce wealth but to consume it—most notably by shifting resources from consumers and taxpayers to powerful constituencies with a claim on public resources. As these transfers occur within the apparatus of government they can be made without the transparency that sound public policy requires.
Australia's telecommunications policy has proved time and again just how harmful this can be.
So this sale, the final stage of the reform of the Australian telecommunications industry, is good public policy. It gives citizens the opportunity to benefit from a more open industry and a more responsive Telstra, whether they are a family interested in residential services or a small business concerned with commercial services. Listening to the opposition today—and on ABC Online we are getting a moment by moment update of the dire warnings Labor issues on a privatised Telstra—we heard the member for Melbourne suggest that Telstra is going to abandon rural and regional Australia and deny country Australians access to quality telecommunications. He threatened that there will be poorer services, higher prices and so on. The opposition have a choice: they can follow their usual dictum that the duty of an opposition is, very simply, to oppose everything and propose nothing or they can rise above their rusty industrial ideology and embrace change. 
Telstra's full privatisation is a major step towards completing the micro-economic reforms which have contributed to Australian prosperity, and we have seen that with the sale of the first two tranches of Telstra. As I said earlier, the Liberal-National coalition went to two elections promising that these sales would occur if we were elected or returned to office. The Labor Party have form in this regard—the unforeshadowed privatisations of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank—but we have taken the Australian people into our confidence. We trust their judgment and we trust their commitment to reform. We have stated that the sale of the remaining tranche and the effective full privatisation of Telstra would occur only when we were satisfied that arrangements were in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians. I reiterate that Telstra's full privatisation is a major step forward to complete the micro-economic reforms—which began in the eighties, which continued in the nineties and which will be resolved under this government—that will contribute to more Australian jobs, greater prosperity and continued economic growth.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"—My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to page 147 of the Department of Foreign Affairs publication East Timor in Transition 1998-2000, which records an incident at Suai on 6 October 1999. Does the minister recall that, in this incident, an INTERFET vehicle came under fire in a militia ambush? The two Australian INTERFET soldiers were seriously wounded and two militia were killed in the exchange. Can the minister assure the House that neither Gardapaksi, described by the minister's department as closely associated with Kopassus and used to conduct activities on its behalf, nor any other Kopassus-trained militia unit were responsible for opening fire on Australian troops on that occasion? How will the minister ensure that, in the re-establishment of links with Kopassus, all those Kopassus troops responsible for the training of militia in East Timor for operations against pro-independence elements and the Australian Defence Force will not form part of the Kopassus units with whom the minister now proposes to re-establish links? ",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: East Timor</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,question
"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,2003-08-14,"—It has been a longstanding policy not just of this government but of the previous Australian government that, where we are aware of known people being involved in partner militaries—and I refer in particular to what used to be ABRI and is now TNI—we endeavour not to be involved in any activities jointly with those people. That is the policy of this government, it was the policy, as I understand it, of the last government and we will continue to maintain that policy. Our view, as I expressed it two days ago, is that, where we are aware of TNI members, be they in Kopassus or in other units of TNI with which we may have, through necessity, some degree of cooperation, and where those people have been involved in egregious human rights abuses of one kind or another, then we will not be participating in activities with those people.
I make another point: this government believe that it is fundamentally important that we at least do all that we possibly can to protect the security of Australians. We make no apology for the fact that we are prepared to work with those elements in Indonesia—
—So why aren't the Americans?
—The member for Griffith has asked his question!
—that have the greatest capacity to help release Australians who may be taken hostage in that country or who may be part of some hijacking drama—
—The member for Griffith is defying the chair!
—We make no apology for working with those organisations to help Australians because, on this side of the House, we are unapologetic about standing up for our national security and the safety of our people. One of the most ironic interjections I think I have heard in a very long time from the rather anti-American Labor Party is the interjection of the member for Griffith, who says, `What about the Americans?'

Would the minister inform the House what action the government is taking to counter the threat posed by man-portable air defence systems to civil aviation?,REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: Man-Portable Air Defence Systems</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,question
"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,2003-08-14,"—I thank the member for Ryan for his question and for the interest he shows in this issue, which, of course, has been very much in the news in the last 24 hours. The threat from man-portable air defence systems, or MANPADS as they are known in jargon, to civil aviation is real. I think we need to understand that it is a threat which is growing. That is shown clearly in the arrest two days ago of a British citizen allegedly trying to sell MANPADS to terrorists. Also, I think it was very clearly demonstrated when, I think towards the end of last year, an Israeli passenger jet, on taking off from Mombasa in Kenya, was attacked using a MANPAD system. The missile barely missed the aircraft. Mercifully, it did miss it. 
Between 1996 and 2001, I am advised, 24 aircraft are suspected of being downed or damaged in-flight by MANPADS. I understand that the bulk of these were military aircraft, not passenger aircraft. Nevertheless, it is quite a dramatic statistic. These weapons are capable of shooting down aircraft at ranges of around five kilometres and altitudes of 3,500 metres or around 10,000 feet, but they can be effective at greater distances. Some are resistant to all but the most sophisticated countermeasures. Furthermore, these weapons, which weigh only about 15 kilos when loaded, are relatively easy to use as long as the user has the appropriate training.
Stopping the proliferation of these weapons—and especially, of course, stopping these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists—has been a priority for this government and is also a priority for our friends and allies internationally. I acknowledge the presence in the gallery of the British Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs—he and I have been talking about security and terrorist issues over the last day. I know that the British government is particularly forthright in its endeavours to try to stop systems like the MANPAD systems.
We are not just working with the British government. Consistent with the strong support on this side of the House for the American alliance, we are working especially closely with the United States in key international arms control fora to control the production, transfer and trade in MANPADs. We have extended our support to a comprehensive G-8 initiative, which took place in June of this year, which includes the adoption of best practice export controls and a ban on transfers to non-state actors. We are also working together to strengthen guidelines on MANPAD controls through what is called the Wassenaar agreement, which is the principal international conventional weapons export control regime. Domestically, Australia applies strict and comprehensive national controls and licence procedures to regulate the import and export of MANPADs and similar weapons. These controls regulate the legal trade, which in turn helps to prevent diversion to non-state actors and terrorist groups.
In concluding my answer to the honourable member for Ryan's question, let me say that there is no intelligence to suggest that MANPADs pose an immediate threat to aviation in Australia. But the government and the airline industry—and I know the Deputy Prime Minister, as Minister for Transport and Regional Services, is particularly focused on this—do take this issue very seriously. We have a robust aviation security framework in place in Australia that is comparable to systems in the United Kingdom and the United States. This problem of MANPADs will be assessed as part of a continuous review process to ensure Australia continues to meet emerging threats.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: Man-Portable Air Defence Systems</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,answer

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"—On 8 August the Prime Minister was interviewed on ABC radio in Hobart. He, at least, admitted that there were problems with the new Job Network. He described them in two ways: as teething problems and, later in the interview, as glitches. We know that the teething problems are the problems being suffered by providers. The glitches are the problems being suffered by the consumers, the unemployed. First of all, I want to go through the glitches—the problems that unemployed people are having. I will then go through the massive teething problems with Job Network 3. 
Today we had another example of the so-called glitches. We were contacted by an unemployed man in Brisbane who had gone along to a seminar as part of Job Search training—a compulsory element, part of the mutual obligation arrangement, that anyone who has been unemployed for three months has to do. This man went to a seminar held by a company in Brisbane and was given an exercise on first impressions. When you look at the original of the document, it is very clear that of the four caricatures, person A and person B are white, in a suit and tie and very businesslike. Persons C and D are of a much darker complexion and both are stereotypically in thongs. People had to fill in a survey which went through a series of questions. They were asked to identify which young man, out of A, B, C, or D, they would: (a), buy a used car from; (b), give preference to in employment as an electrician; (c), have confidence in as their doctor; (d), would not like to see married to their sister or, if female, would not consider going out with; (f), think would be likely to use illegal drugs; (g), think would have respect for authority; (h), think would be intelligent; and—last but not least—think would be likely to vote Labor. Here is an unemployed person going along to a seminar and being asked which way they think these people would vote, who would be likely to use an illegal drug and who would have respect for authority. It is a totally inappropriate exercise. It is consistent with a Job Network system of which the government have washed their hands. From July 1, with a fully privatised system, the government have said, `We will just hand over the money and we will take no responsibility for any of the problems.' This is today's problem.
Yesterday's problem was outlined by the member for Ballarat in question time. An elderly woman in her electorate was sent off for combat training. There are other examples. There is 27-year-old Tom in Tasmania. Tom had been unemployed for longer than 12 months. Tom was pretty keen to get a job; he would do almost anything. He put himself through a TAFE course. However, he did think that getting matched up with a job as a callgirl in an escort agency was just a bit too much, so he declined it. But the minister took no responsibility. Then there is Mark from Western Australia. Mark is 41. He was matched with a job in an overseas based company and was told that all he needed to do was to receive money for them in Australia and deposit it in their bank account. The job offer on the government's Job Search web site said: `We are now hiring an honest, reliable partner in Australia who agrees to receive payments from our customers. You receive up to five per cent for just receiving payments.' That is a pretty good job. You do not have to do anything except launder money.
Then there is Joanna, in Tasmania. She is a former art gallery worker who was also matched with a job in an escort agency. She at least was the right gender. She was also matched with a job requiring a chainsaw licence. The other jobs that she was offered were without exception more than 200 kilometres away. To add insult to injury, Minister Brough's spokesman told the Hobart Mercury that if mature age job seekers want to improve their chances of finding a job they should just remove their age from job application forms. This minister's idea of age discrimination is that they should just take their age off. The member for Mackellar gave a great performance on AM last week taking him apart. 
There are numerous other examples, because the system is simply not working. Why isn't it working? For a start, the government has relieved itself of all responsibility. From 1 July the government determined that it had no role in labour market programs. Employment National shut throughout the country. 400 workers lost their jobs—people whose job it was previously to get people work found themselves on the other side of the counter. If it is not a core responsibility for government to have a role in getting people employment, then what is? But it is not under this government. It was not only the public sector that got hit. Fifty three per cent of Job Network offices under Job Network 2 closed up on 1 July—a loss of 1,101 sites. The government closed more offices than it kept open.
The third teething problem was the big whizzbang IT system that we have heard about. All the providers are incredibly frustrated at the fact that it simply keeps going down—not for an hour or two but for days at a time. And we as local members are being contacted by them about these issues. Computer World magazine quoted a Job Network provider as saying:
All the providers I have been in contact with have indicated that EA3000 is the dog we expected. In terms of impact, we are no worse off than other providers, job seekers are clearly being impacted ...
But there is more. The fourth problem is that the government's database of unemployed was obviously not being kept updated. We have heard for seven years about how this is a government that keeps its eye on the unemployed: `They are all job snobs and dole cheats and we are going to get into them. We will find where they are and make them fulfil their obligations.' The government does not even know where they are. A large part of the reason why there are problems with people not turning up is that the database has been shown to be completely hopeless. The government sent out 18,000 letters to people on the personal support program who are not required to participate in Job Network—that is 18,000 mistakes.
The fifth problem is the ministerial wars in Canberra. Whenever this minister is away the member for Warringah has to step in and overrule him. Under the system, every week DEWR published data as to how many people have been sent referrals, how many people have turned up and how many people have found jobs, but it was not working out too well, because there were glitches. The media were getting hold of some of this because providers were so angry they were providing it to the press gallery. So what happened? The minister said, `We just won't publish any information any more.' But that lasted two days until Minister Abbott had to overrule Minister Brough. The situation with the Centrelink minister, Senator Vanstone, is even worse. The relationship there has completely broken down because she is having to fix up the mess. She is having to fund Centrelink people to work overtime on weekends to try and fix up the data because time after time the data is disappearing from this whizzbang IT system.
The sixth problem is that the government chose an automatic referral system. It has been shown internationally that automatic referral simply creates problems. Referral letters have been generated that contain confusing information for unemployed people. For example, unemployed people are being referred to Job Network agencies that they are supposed to turn up to without it being explained who the agency is or what their obligations are.
The seventh problem is that the government's policies have actually been found to be prolonging unemployment among many job seekers. That is not what we are saying; that is what is said in the research from the University of Melbourne's Centre for Public Policy, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the St Vincent de Paul Society—all probably communist fronts according to Minister Brough. The report, Much Obliged, said that the long-term unemployed `were so engaged in meeting their Centrelink requirements, that these seemed to have replaced actual job search activities'. The report went on to say: 
In effect ... the system operates for many disadvantaged job seekers not as `welfare to work' but `welfare as work'.
The eighth problem is that when we had an MPI debate and some questions before we rose in June—before 1 July came in—about how the system was going to operate, Minister Brough stood up and said, `It's all okay. It's all on track. It'll be fine.' The truth is he slunk out of here on the last day that parliament sat and had an emergency meeting. He faxed the CEOs of every Job Network agency in the country and had the meeting at five o'clock at Sydney Airport Hilton. At the meeting he promised them, `We understand you have this massive problem with cash flow. We understand you're going to have to close your doors. What we will do is, despite the system that we set up and the forward program of the income you were supposed to get—even if you don't get it—we will delve into taxpayers' funds and give it to you.' So a $30 million bailout happened—and that was the first one.
The minister has an opportunity today to rule out a further bailout, because he knows that the system is still not working. It is incredible. I do not blame the providers for this; I blame the minister and the system. Quite clearly the business plan did not work. But $30 million of taxpayers' money bailed them out, not as money to be given to the unemployed—not for training, not for labour market programs—but so they could keep their doors open. The fact is that the system is not working. The minister has an opportunity today to rule out any further bailout money going. By the way, Minister, we are not arguing that that should be the case. We think that you should bear the responsibility for your actions. We hear a lot about Work for the Dole and how terrific it is, but part of the bailout was that they had to take 75,000 job seekers back into Job Network out of Work for the Dole so as to generate some income for them. So it did not really matter; Work for the Dole was pretty flexible there.
NESA, the peak body, has found that 90 per cent of Job Network providers surveyed reported that their cash flow and revenue were well below what they were told they would get. One provider said:
Cost of system errors in delayed data entry, extra staffing costs, client ineligibility in wrong referrals added to unexpected costs which until now could not completely be assessed. 
NESA said:
... if Job Network Members are not provided with substantial additional funding then we will see most providers retrenching staff within weeks and a number of providers actually ceasing to trade within a month.
So much for the great new whizzbang system, Minister. But it is consistent. Problem No. 12 is that it is consistent—there is a pattern. There has been an underspending on Job Network of $214 million in 2000-01, $70.8 million in 2001-02, and $15.6 million in 2002-03—a 10 per cent underspending on predictions. Why? It is because the system is not finding the number of unemployed people the jobs that they said it would. That is why Job Network providers are getting less money. The fact is also that in the mutual obligation system eight out of 10 have been overturned.
Minister, you must be the only person in this nation who did not know that 1 July was the day after 30 June. They had three years to get it ready. It was not as though it was a surprise and they did not have the IT system ready. They were told that in terms of some job search activities it would not be ready until September or October—forget that the new system began on 1 July. Minister Brough must be held accountable both for what he has done to providers in terms of the misleading information that they were given and, most importantly, for what has happened to the unemployed as a result of the botching of this system.

"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,2003-08-14,"—As always, when the member for Grayndler gets to his feet in this place, you hear diatribe and misrepresentations—you hear anything but the truth. Today he stooped, with his colleague from Ballarat, to a new low. At question time today, we had the member for Ballarat stand up and ask me her question regarding her constituent. The constituent has contacted us. As I recall it, at that time Mr Speaker drew the attention of the member for Ballarat to the fact that she was unnecessarily using a constituent's name in this place. That constituent feels absolutely betrayed by the member for Ballarat because she did not go to the media. You went to the media and you—
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The minister will address his remarks through the chair.
—You, the member for Ballarat, used this as an attack upon the government and you abused the rights of that individual.
—The minister will refer to the name of the seat, not the member.
—The member for Ballarat is a relatively new member but this is a very low act. I can only presume that it is because the member for Ballarat is tied up with the member for Grayndler, who has a long history of such matters. Let us have a listen. When the woman contacted our office, she said, `I was rung by the ABC after I contacted my local member.' It was quite right for this constituent to talk to her local member. The local member, having had a problem, should then have contacted the complaints line of Job Network, the department, the local Job Network member or my office. But no, they contact the ABC—not with the authority, either, of this individual. The individual said: `I was contacted by the ABC; I did not go there. This has been blown out of proportion.' This is another typical stunt by an opposition that is bereft of ideas.
One idea came out today, and I hope that the member for Grayndler expands upon it next week at the NESA conference. In all the ranting and raving, one thing becomes clear: you believe—you, the opposition, the ALP—that there must be a return to a publicly funded provider. I just hope that you have the guts to stand on your feet and state that. State that you want to turn back the clock to the CES when the Leader of the Opposition, then the employment minister, spent $3 billion of taxpayers' money, did not get the results that the Job Network is getting, and continued to throw money like confetti at unemployed people without getting them a job—a cruel hoax—and now you, the shadow minister, are looking at returning to such a flawed process.
We now go to the second question that appeared here today. At the time that that was occurring, and when the shadow minister's press secretary was up there in the gallery, against standing orders, the ABC was in front of the office of the Job Network member—yet another stunt. It was not about trying to direct any issue.  
—The member for Grayndler has had his chance.
—When the piece of paper was tabled, we found that it was a figment of the imagination of the member who sits by the member for Grayndler. Do you know what this is about? This is about the shadow minister trying to have some relevance because, when on 1 July and shortly thereafter the Job Network came down, he was not even to be found in the country. He was overseas with his wife, at New South Wales government taxpayers' expense.
—What's that got to do with it?
—What's that got to do with it? He comes in here ranting and raving when he was not in the country—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. First, I ask that the minister be asked to direct his comments through the chair. 
—I have already done that.
—Secondly, I ask that he withdraw what he just said, which is untrue and which I regard as a reflection—
—The best course would be to make a personal explanation at the end of debate on the matter of public importance, if you wish.
—I accept that there is one thing that the shadow minister would like to see. The shadow minister would like to see at least one Job Network office—am I right? He would like to see more. The place where the shadow minister would like to see a Job Network office is Badgerys Creek. That is what has focused the shadow minister's attention since 1 July. I am fighting an internal battle within the Labor Party about airports—nothing whatsoever to do with Job Network. The shadow minister wants to change this debate into one about looking after the new employment prospects of the people of Badgerys Creek, where he would like to see the next Sydney airport. 
Let us just go to some of the issues—if you can call them that; I think I am being very generous—that the shadow minister raised. First of all, he mentioned IT. He ridiculed IT when this department's IT—the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations' IT—has been recognised by Accenture, when it looked at world-wide IT, as being best practice in the world. It was first. That was an absolutely independent view. Today, there have been 3.6 million transactions on our Job Network site. The system response time has been 0.5 of a second, except in some of our satellite sites where the process has to go through the satellite system. We have to work on those issues. Centrelink, which is interconnected with us, has 120,000 to 150,000 transactions a day with a response time of around one second.
The system is operating at a stable level—although there are still some application issues—on 3.6 million transactions a day. You have to ask: has the department had a result like this in the past, where it has reached world's best practice? Let us compare the IT system to something that has been heralded in the papers day after day—CareerOne. I would like to applaud CareerOne and the Murdochs for what they are doing. They are promoting employment and putting opportunities in front of people. They have similar processes and tools; the difference is that this is a far more refined tool. It has 2,000 different categories of jobs compared with about 40 available on CareerOne. You can search the whole nation, your state, your town or your suburb. You can break it down however you wish. If someone is getting opportunities all around Australia, there is a reason for that: that is the criterion the individual has put into the system. The individual has said, `Send me jobs from other parts of Australia'—for argument's sake, 200 kilometres away. The results were from 200 kilometres away because the individual asked for that to be the geographical area they were covering for jobs. 
Let us go back and look at the Labor government's IT record. It was far less complicated and far less detailed than what we have just brought in. They did not have anything with the functionality that is being achieved now. In 1994, when the current Leader of the Opposition was employment minister and was running the CES, he tried to implement an IT change supporting the Working Nation policy—that great failed white elephant that ate up Australian tax dollars like there was no tomorrow. The change to that computer system called Job System Release 12—it should have been called `Job System Fail 12'—failed entirely. When the shadow minister and the ALP were in government, the system failed for two months. The department tells me that there was a delay for two months for half the employers on the database and jobs were lost. 
I know that the shadow minister was not in the country for much of the implementation after 1 July, but can I remind him of this. If he goes out there today and looks at what is happening on the ground instead of wandering around here dribbling and not listening, he will see that there are 3.6 million transactions today at an average of less than one second per transaction—half a second.
Let us go to the fundamentals about why the government changed this system and why we moved away from a public provider. It was not because we were relinquishing and relieving ourselves of responsibility; it was because we take full responsibility for the more than 500 organisations that are delivering employment services from more than 2,500 sites around this country. Today there are nearly 70,000 jobs on our web site, to which unemployed people have access. Prior to 1 July, there were about 35,000. I am sure that that is one point we will agree on because I know that those figures have been quoted by the shadow minister previously as well.
Those jobs are matched against the criteria that individuals put into the system, often with the support of the Job Network member. If the Job Network member asks someone: `What information would you like to put in? Do you want to have jobs sent to you from all over Australia, just New South Wales, just Sydney or just Bankstown and the surrounds?' they can do that, but it is up to the individual. If the individual says, `I would like to be matched against defence jobs and administration jobs,' then those are the jobs that person will be matched against. Are people required to turn up for those jobs if they are not suitable? No. So when we flick through the newspaper, do we blame the newspaper if it has the wrong one there? If you are sitting in front of a consultant and the consultant says, `Now tell me, Jenny, have you ever considered working as an administrative assistant?' and the answer is, `No, I can't actually do that job,' fine, they move on. Do we sit there and ridicule them? No. Do we look at the 60,000 jobs that have been sent out that have been matched automatically to help people get jobs that are remote? Perhaps we should hear some of the good news stories, because they are numerous.
Isn't it funny that the shadow minister is ridiculing the Job Network while at the very same time his own colleagues have been out there—
—No, I am ridiculing you.
—Just to correct the shadow minister, you stood here and ridiculed the system, the IT, the referral system, the fact that there was no public provider and the cash flow, but let me go through this. The member for Prospect opened a Work Directions office and sat in front of a computer. Unless your people are absolute idiots, which I am sure they are not, surely they would not be associating themselves with failed IT. What about the member for Throsby? She opened Work Directions offices in Dapto and Shellharbour on 4 August. The member for Newcastle visited a Work Directions site opening with me and she was absolutely applauded. The shadow minister tells me that he has opened one as well. On the one hand, you come in here and ridicule the system and the individuals who are running the system, and you ridicule the IT that underpins it, but on the other hand you have the hide to take the publicity that this government provides and say you are proud of it when you are there. It is so much like the member for Werriwa: you walk both sides of the street depending on what audience you are talking to. Next week, when the shadow minister goes to the NESA conference, he will probably tell them how great they are, but he comes in here and tells the Australian public how ineffective the Job Network and the IT system are and that there has been a bailout. 
Let me set this straight once and for all: there has not been a $30 million bailout. This government did not provide one additional cent from consolidated revenue or which was not already allocated to this budget. What we did do was provide an additional service to the unemployed of this country. As has become known, when the letters have gone out there has been an appalling turn-up rate of unemployed people to scheduled interviews. So what did the government do? We paid the Job Network members to get on the phone to them and say, `I know you have received a letter, but I am ringing you up to remind you that there is an appointment for you tomorrow which is designed to help you.' Is the shadow minister going to go to the conference next week and say to those good people, `You should have done that without being paid'? Is that what the shadow minister is suggesting?
—It is not my argument.
—No. In other words, what you were suggesting is that if people are not showing up we just forget about them. Labor's answer is to push them under the carpet; ignore unemployed people who are not turning up. That is what it did for 13 years. When it could not get them a job it gave them a mickey mouse training program that went round and round. If they did not turn up to it was there any cause and effect? No. This government takes its responsibilities a lot more seriously. If unemployed people do not turn up we tell them they have two choices: turn up and use the money the taxpayer has provided to you through the Job Network to assist you into training and a job as best we can; or, if you do not want to do that, this government's responsibility is to ensure that you do not receive unemployment benefits. That is what this government is about. It is giving every unemployed person, for the first time, a full suite of services. The government has a great Job Network which is driven by people who are committed and doing a great job. The last thing they need is the ridicule, the deceptions and the untrustworthy and dishonest comments that have continued to flow from the member for Grayndler as a way of trying to make himself relevant, when all he is really interested in is Badgerys Creek and where the next Sydney airport is to be.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask that the minister withdraw the slurs against my staff member. There is a code in this place— 
—Can you explain what the slurs were?
—Will you withdraw it?
—I do not think a withdrawal is necessary.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Employment: Job Network</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1,speech
"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"—I will shortly address the matter of my constituent and the matters raised by the minister. But I want to start by saying that I am very pleased to be supporting this MPI. I want to echo the sentiments of the member for Grayndler. This minister has failed in his responsibilities to unemployed people. The extraordinary example the member for Grayndler has revealed in the House today of the material that is being used to supposedly assist the long-term unemployed is frankly outrageous. If it was not a real example you would think it was material from some comedy skit to show what not to do when trying to help unemployed people and raise their self-esteem. This minister takes no responsibility for his portfolio and his consistent pattern of behaviour is to blame unemployed people for the circumstances in which they find themselves.
The minister's attitude towards the people he is supposed to be working for is well known. On 15 April, in an article entitled `Government tries to weed out dole bludgers', the minister is reported to have said:
There are a number, a considerable number, who are bludging on the public purse and we shouldn't tolerate that and I think this will flush those individuals out ...
Those people who are not motivated and are trying to pass on their responsibilities ... will be flushed out and so they should be quite frankly.
What about ministers who bludge? What about ministers who try to pass off their responsibilities and blame unemployed people for the circumstances they find themselves in? This minister's initial response, on every occasion when there are problems with his Job Network system, is to sheet the blame home to unemployed people.
The latest example is the current problems we have seen with the move to Job Network mark 3. The Job Network system is in significant disarray and Job Network providers have reported severe difficulties in transitioning to the new arrangements. The minister, as expected, blames unemployed people for all the problems associated with the transition to the new Job Network arrangements. According to the minister, some are failing to turn up for their appointments. He ignores the fact that you need a degree in advanced linguistics just to understand the letters that are sent out asking people to turn up. As I said, he shows a consistent pattern of blaming unemployed people for the failures in his own system.
Week after week and month after month we hear stories of what is happening to unemployed people in this country. There are 620,000 Australians currently languishing in the unemployment queues. Since the Howard government came to power, all the unemployed have got from this government is a privatised employment service that has been failing. As a result of the government's policies, the number of long-term unemployed is higher today than when the Howard government was first elected to office in 1996.
I now want to turn to the matter of my constituent, which I raised in question time today. I want to respond to the minister's comments during this MPI when he stated that my constituent had rung his office during question time. I have just been told that she did in fact ring his office. She rang to complain about some bullying tactics used by the minister's office. She made no mention of any actions taken by my office—none whatsoever. This is yet another appalling misrepresentation from this minister.
Let us go to what has actually happened with this woman. She is 56 years of age and lives in my electorate. She has been unemployed for the last two years. She is a mature age unemployed person and has worked enormously hard to try to find work. She has over 300 rejection letters from the jobs for which she has applied. She is looking for work in office administration, general typing and secretarial duties. It is an environment she has worked in before and which is well known to her. 
Last Thursday my constituent called the 1300 JobSearch number to hear the messages from the automated computer system telling her of the matches the JobSearch computer had found for her. The message that she received—the first she had received in five weeks—said that JobSearch had found her a position in Geelong in the A Company 87th Army Reserve Battalion training facility. It would have been appropriate if my constituent had not been 56 years old, suffering from high blood pressure and prone to severe arthritis in both hands. It would have been appropriate if my constituent had been able to drive or had access to public transport, but she does not. These are the circumstances she told the Job Network. She told them of her health concerns and her lack of transport. The only reference she made to the possibility of working within the Defence department was that she had done some secretarial work for them some time ago.
The constituent contacted my office to highlight the difficulties she as a mature age unemployed person is experiencing with the minister's system. We asked her quite specifically: would you like to talk to anyone else about this and would you be prepared to go to the media about this to highlight your case? She said that she would. On every occasion that the media contacted us, we contacted the constituent first and checked with her to see whether she was happy for her personal details to be given out. 
Upon making her situation public on ABC radio in Ballarat, the constituent was called by a man who said his name was `David from Minister Brough's office'. He asked for the name of her Job Network provider. My constituent refused to give it. She said: `I don't actually have a problem with my Job Network provider. That is not the complaint I am making. It is the JobSearch matching system that I am complaining about.' He then asked her for her confidential Job Network number. She refused to give it. She refused because she had the distinct impression from the tone of the call that the purpose of the call was not to help her, not to support her, but in fact to find out if she was lying.
I think it is appropriate for MPs and ministers to seek constituents' ID numbers when we need to contact government agencies on their behalf. But we do so because it is our intent to help them. That was clearly not the intent of the call from the minister's office. As the story evolved over the course of yesterday, the minister's office was giving out conflicting information about what it thought had happened in this case. First, the minister's office sought to imply that this woman was lying. Once again this is a pattern of behaviour of blaming the person raising the complaint—taking no responsibility, no care, and just blaming the person raising the complaint. Second, the minister's office apparently claimed that my constituent had got a bit confused and that it was a clerical job she was actually offered. Again we went back and checked and we saw quite clearly that it was not a clerical job she had been offered; it was a combat medic training position.
Again this is a pattern of behaviour from the minister and his office of seeking to put blame on the unemployed and not taking responsibility for the failures of the system. The call to my constituent's home by the minister's staff member was not a call to help and support this woman; it was an act of bullying by the minister because he was under some pressure. His office sought to obtain personal details with the object of bullying my constituent in order to protect the minister. It is shabby behaviour and beneath contempt. The quality of the minister's answer to my question in question time today is an indication of his disregard for the interests of my constituent and other job seekers ill served by this government. Today I have written to the minister seeking an explanation for the behaviour from his office. If the minister does not provide a satisfactory answer I will be raising this matter with the Privacy Commissioner. The minister must take responsibility for the actions of his office and he must take responsibility for the failures of the Job Network system. 
The Howard government has slashed the number of Job Network sites in regional Australia—of which Ballarat is one area—by 58 per cent as part of its Job Network mark 3. This translates into the loss of 691 sites and potentially hundreds of jobs across regional Australia at the same time. It means that towns will be left without any Job Network provider and that the unemployed in those towns will have to travel further to get the help they need to find a job. This dramatic cut in employment services comes at a time when many regional communities are experiencing unemployment rates of 10 per cent and above, with youth unemployment stuck at around 30 per cent. In my electorate the federal government closed nine Job Network sites. Ballan has lost two. Bacchus Marsh has lost two. Ballarat has lost five. Creswick has lost one and it now does not have a Job Network provider at all.
This minister has shown a pattern of behaviour of blaming unemployed people for problems within his own system. The problems being faced by unemployed people under the government's Job Network mark 3 are serious ones. When are we going to see the minister take them seriously and treat them as such? When will the minister wake up and take responsibility for actually assisting the long-term unemployed rather than blaming them for his own failures?",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Employment: Job Network</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1,speech
"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2003-08-14,"—Today we have heard an attack on the government by the member for Grayndler and the member for Ballarat. As usual, the members of the Labor Party have missed the point entirely. Again they have picked isolated incidents rather than looked at the total picture. You only need to look at the record of this government in employment to understand that this government is on track and is delivering direct benefits to those who are unemployed. 
You need to look at the situation as a whole. The economy of Australia is so strong that it is the envy of every other country in the world. We need to look at a comparative analysis. Inflation under this coalition government is currently running at around 2.5 per cent. Under Labor it reached 10 per cent. Interest rates are another great indicator of whether jobs can be created and sustained in the community. Under Labor, interest rates went up to greater than 20 per cent. Under the coalition they are five per cent. The only reason that interest rates for housing—which is one of the greatest employment sectors in Australia—only went to 17 per cent is that the Labor government at that time had to cap them because they were becoming rampant.
The most telling thing in this argument is the unemployment rates. In August 1993 there were 8,627,000 people in employment in Australia and there were 928,000 people unemployed. Compare that with today's figures: there are 9,452,000 people employed in Australia, with only 626,000 unemployed. Not only do we have more people in employment; we have fewer people in unemployment. Let us look at it purely as statistics. If we go back to September 1987, in New South Wales the unemployment rate was 8.3 per cent and in the Hunter it was 11.2 per cent. In February 1992, in New South Wales it was up to 10.8 per cent and in the Hunter it was 12.9 per cent. In February 1993 it was 12.9 per cent in New South Wales and 16.7 per cent in the Hunter. In March 1994 it was 10.5 per cent in New South Wales and 15.9 per cent in the Hunter. In June 1994 it was 9.6 per cent in New South Wales and 15.7 per cent in the Hunter. In February 1996 it was 8.6 per cent in New South Wales and 12.7 per cent in the Hunter. So in 13 years of Labor government the only record that we saw was a record increase in unemployment, driven by record inflation and interest rates. 
Let us have a look at the record of the coalition. In November 1999 unemployment in New South Wales dropped to 5.3 per cent; in the Hunter, down to 8.8 per cent. In August 2000 unemployment in New South Wales was 5.4 per cent and in the Hunter it was down to seven per cent. In October 2002 in New South Wales it was 5.2 per cent and in the Hunter it was 5.4 per cent, one of the lowest unemployment figures in living history. For this June the unemployment rate in New South Wales is down to 5.8 per cent. For the opposition to get up and talk about employment programs being wrong means they obviously do not look at the statistics. It was the Labor Party's employment programs that were wrong and led to such high unemployment—nearly a million people out of jobs.
If we look at the long-term unemployed figures, they are now down by over 30 per cent. They are the lowest figures for long-term unemployment since 1990. That was before `the recession we had to have'. So when the member for Grayndler comes in here and talks about problems with employment programs, what he needs to look at—and the only thing that any government should ever look at—is the outcomes. The ALP's Working Nation had a success rate of only about 34 per cent, whereas the Job Network program has a success rate of 50 per cent—under Labor, 34 per cent; under the coalition, 50 per cent—and under the Labor Party over one million people were unemployed.
I am very proud of the Job Network providers in Paterson. I have Wesley Uniting Employment's outreach service at Dungog, and Wesley Uniting Employment also have an outreach service at Gloucester. I have a full-time service run by the Salvation Army at Employment Plus at Nelson Bay. They are doing a great job. There are the Salvation Army's Employment Plus in William Street, Raymond Terrace; Wesley Uniting Employment's service at Raymond Terrace as well; and Wesley Uniting Employment's service at Tuncurry.
During the break, our Minister for Employment Services, Mr Brough, did not sit around or go off on holidays. Minister Brough came out into the electorates talking to people such as these employment providers. I took him in to see the Salvation Army and Wesley Uniting people at Raymond Terrace and he sat down and had a chat one-on-one with those people to see what they thought of the system. Yes, they were having some glitches in the system but nothing that was unmanageable, because it was getting better on a daily basis. Any system that processes 60,000 job-matching services every night has to be doing a rather large task and is bound to have glitches, whether it is a Labor or a coalition government that is in. But what we need to do is look at the outcomes, which, as I said, are what we should be measured by. If this program is so bad, then why is it that since 1 July these job placements have achieved 23,519 jobs—not one or two and not everybody in a mess but 23,519 jobs, or about 25 per cent of the total of the member for Grayndler's electorate? 
The vacancies that have been lodged are 69,891, and there are some 2½ thousand sites for people to access. When I took the minister in to the Wesley Uniting service, we were impressed by the new touch screens. It was not just us who were playing with them and having a look and seeing how they were working; more importantly, there were unemployed people in there working the screens, looking for jobs through self-help. I know my colleague the member for Dobell speaks regularly about IPC Australia at Wyong, who have delivered hundreds of jobs to people, predominantly because they are having such a huge success with their in-house training scheme. What we should do is work with and build up these people who are putting fellow Australians into jobs. Jobs are not the easiest thing to provide, to find or to sustain. But when you have a stable economy driven by a government that has a successful track record, not only on interest rates but on the inflation index and also on employment, then those jobs are long term and they are sustainable.
I also think that, if the member for Grayndler went into one of these services and looked up all of the possibilities there, he would see that there are 70,000 jobs available on the system right now. You never know: with the Leader of the Opposition's policy on airports to keep Sydney airport so intensely busy, perhaps the member for Grayndler might need to use this service to find his next job. We have heard that he is in total disagreement with the Leader of the Opposition over getting rid of the Badgerys Creek proposal and ramping up the pressure long term on Mascot, but this service would be there for him as well to access. The only thing that we hope, because we all like him, is that he does not fall into the trap of being one of the long-term unemployed—but long-term unemployment has dropped under the coalition by 30 per cent.
Members on this side of the House are extremely proud of the figures that I have given, because we gave a commitment and these have come about by having all of the factors right. The members of the Labor Party look at things in isolation and look at things to be destructive about. If the Labor Party are serious, where is their policy? Is their policy to shut down the entire Job Network system and go back to the bureaucratically controlled, government Trojan horse that failed to deliver the jobs that were required to keep the people of Australia in work? If that is their policy then let us see it tabled. But for them to walk into this House and carp and carry on without any substance in their argument betrays the trust of the people of Australia. People expect their government and their opposition to work towards their benefit. If we come into this House and attack those who are putting our fellow Australians into jobs then what message does that send to the unemployed people of Australia? In my electorate I do everything I can to help people who are unemployed. I do what I can to work with my network providers and, importantly, the employers that provide the jobs, to make sure that people have the best opportunity that they can have. I know that every one of my colleagues—whether it is the member for Mackellar, the member for Dunkley, the member for McEwen or the member for Lindsay, who are all in this chamber now—is extremely concerned about long-term future employment prospects and that each and every one of them supports the providers in their electorates (Time expired)

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"—In the Second World War, over one million Australian men and women served in our defence forces, and tens of thousands have served in later conflicts. They were then the flower of our nation's youth. Today those who survive are now in their 80s. They are becoming frail and in need of special care. We may remember them on one day of the year, but for the rest of the time they are forgotten. As the old song goes, `Old soldiers never die, they just fade away'—they have indeed faded from the memory of the nation they served. In their hour of greatest need, their country has deserted them. When they need nursing home care, they are left to fend for themselves. They have special needs, but in Sydney there is only one dedicated nursing home to provide for veterans. That compares poorly with the state of Queensland, where, to give a comparison, there are five specialist veterans nursing homes in Brisbane alone. There is one on the Gold Coast, three on the Sunshine Coast and a further seven in regional centres. But in Sydney there is only one, and that is located on the northern beaches at Narrabeen, a long way from the homes of many elderly veterans.
For thousands of veterans in the Sydney area, specialist veterans nursing home care is not available. For those fortunate enough to gain admission to Narrabeen, it can be a two- or three-hour journey by public transport for their wives and families to visit them. This is a problem faced by many families in Sydney and other centres. Couples are often separated; couples who have been together for more than 50 years can now only see each other once or twice a week. It is a real tragedy for couples to be separated at a time of life when every moment spent together is so, so precious. For wives, it is a time when they might remember their separation in wartime, how they feared the worst when they were apart and how they cherished each moment together. If you live in south-western Sydney in Liverpool, Bonnyrigg or surrounding areas, it is a long way to Narrabeen in Sydney's north-east. Many veterans are forced into mainstream nursing homes and often suffer badly as a result of the lack of specialist care.
I had the unhappy task of informing the House two years ago of the fate of Eric Davis, a veteran of both the Second World War and the Korean War—a veteran of Sandakan. In his final days, he suffered a substandard nursing home before his mates from Liverpool RSL fought to have him transferred to Lady Davidson Hospital, a specialist veterans hospital. That is now commonly the fate of so many of our nation's heroes. There are reasons why states like Queensland have more veterans nursing homes. No-one would deny that New South Wales has not taken full advantage of the opportunities to have more nursing homes for veterans. But there is no point arguing the reasons why. 
In the finest ANZAC tradition, we need to get off our backsides and do something about it. The site at Narrabeen was crown land granted to the RSL. Many of the facilities there were built from public donations and art union proceeds. In south-west Sydney, when you look around for a suitable site for a veterans nursing home, it is hard to go past the large Commonwealth government sites at Moorebank and Holsworthy. But this government will only consider selling sites to the highest and the biggest bidders, and that places those sites out of reach of organisations willing to manage a veterans nursing home. We have a government that recognises the priority of aged care for veterans but leaves them to fend for themselves in mainstream nursing homes. With a guarantee of land from the government, I would like to see what we could do as a community to provide for those in their time of need—those who served our nation in our time of need.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Veterans: Nursing Homes</title>,Adjournment,16,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"—The Institute of Public Affairs is one of those right wing think tanks dedicated to promoting inequality in our society. They work for a world in which companies have all the power and ordinary citizens have none. They have close links to the Liberal Party—for example, to Senator Rod Kemp and his brother, the environment minister, David Kemp. In their indefatigable quest to enhance corporate power, they relentlessly attack any alternative sources of power, such as the role of government or trade unions. Increasingly, they have in their sights non-government organisations—citizens who dare to gather in groups. Extraordinarily, they describe these manifestations of the health of our civil society as a `challenge to liberal democracy'.
The Institute of Public Affairs has been complaining that non-government organisations with no public accountability are the beneficiaries of taxpayer funds through government grants. What strange times we live in. Last Sunday, the Sunday Age reported that the Howard Liberal government are spending $50,000 for an audit of which non-government organisations are getting taxpayer funds. You would think they would know already. It must be amateur hour in the federal bureaucracy if they do not know who they are giving money to. But it is even worse than that, because the body they gave the $50,000 to was none other than the Institute of Public Affairs. Incredible! A non-government organisation which rails against taxpayer funds going to non-government organisations gets $50,000 to do an audit of other non-government organisations. Alice in Wonderland eat your heart out.
So let me ask of the Howard government all those questions which those great hypocrites of the Institute of Public Affairs would be asking if they were not themselves the beneficiaries of this taxpayer largesse. First: was there a tender process? Second: was any other organisation invited to apply to do this work? Third: who are the members of the Institute of Public Affairs, and how do you get to join it or vote for its governing body? Fourth: what are the IPA's sources of funding; is it principally funded by donations from large companies? Fifth: given its publicly expressed hostility to other non-government organisations, hasn't it prejudged this issue? Isn't it biased? Sixth: does the IPA not say that organisations with an agenda of legislative change should not be classed as charities and get government support? If so, given their agenda, why should they get government support? Finally: is this not a blatant attempt by the Howard Liberal government to bully and intimidate charities, environmental groups and other non-government organisations into refraining from criticism of the Liberal government? Doesn't this constitute the real threat to our democracy?",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Institute of Public Affairs</title>,Statements by Members,17,1,speech
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"—This legislation is significant because it ties together current transport arrangements in which the state governments act together under the aegis of a bill that was originally put together in 1991, when we were last in power. This legislation comes before us now because when the original bill was put into place there was a sunset clause which indicated that this parliament should be required, 12 years after the first operation of the initial bill, to undertake a certain set of measures to look at future transport regulation provision. 
I would like to go to the question of the original compact between the Commonwealth and the states and then take it a bit further. As indicated in, as usual, an excellent brief from the Parliamentary Library, this bill is about the incorporation of a new entity, the National Transport Commission, and about giving that commission a broader charter than the original National Road Transport Commission that was set up in 1991. The original bill allowed for a review and report process before the expiry of the 12-year period and before the sunset clause came into operation—so that when the original arrangements were put aside, future arrangements would be put in place. This government has rightly recognised the need for this kind of function to be in place, as a fundamental contribution to the safety of Australians in the transport industry and of those who are affected by the national transport industry in all of the states and territories of Australia.
In 1991 the key reason that the federal government moved to create the commission was the recognition that, across Australia's states and territories, there was a lack of uniformity in the regulation of transport vehicle operations, including vehicle standards, weights and dimensions. That lack of uniformity had been there for a considerable time. We know that that lack of uniformity was attractive to some people in the transport area because it included a lack of uniformity in registration costs. South Australia in particular was extremely popular as a place to register a vehicle, because you could do it at much lower rates than in New South Wales, for instance. 
We know the dominant area of national transport usage runs, as it does in rail, along the eastern corridor—Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne. We know that there is a significant cross-Australia movement from Melbourne through South Australia to Western Australia and of course to Darwin. We know that those road movements from Darwin to South Australia and from Darwin to elsewhere are going to be impacted upon due to the fact that the rail link from Adelaide to Alice Springs is being extended to Darwin. We know that will impact on road transport. We also know that the total volume of transport from Darwin to other parts of Australia and from Perth to other parts of Australia is much smaller than that carried along the eastern seaboard, so the total impact is much greater on that eastern seaboard.
We also know and understand that a national government had to be prepared to address the significant problems that were embedded in what the states had experienced—but that was meant to be grappled with. It is not easy for a government to come up to the front line and say, `We recognise that these are significant differences and that in the greater national interest everyone will have to sit down and cooperate and get their act together with people of different parties at federal and state level.' This was, however, achieved, because it had been recognised that, while people working in the transport industry might save on registration costs by going to a state with lower costs—that might give them a short-term benefit—in fact it would impact on them, their business, their contracts, their costs and charges and the safety of everyone involved in transport. It was recognised—by those who were owner-operators but not union members as much as those who were members of the Transport Workers Union—that a national solution was needed. 
In looking at those current operations, the states, the territories and the Commonwealth got together behind this original bill. What did it provide? It provided for the variations in regulations which impacted adversely on interstate transport operations to be codified. They needed to be regulated. We needed to have a common set of arrangements not only so that people could be certain of what would impact upon them when they travelled from New South Wales to Queensland or from New South Wales through to Victoria and South Australia—so that people would not be caught short by not complying with the state jurisdiction's demands—but also so that safety of operation would be a central focus in dealing with the problems that drivers encounter. If you have a commonality of treatment, you also have a commonality of purpose and approach.
We know that in all long-haul work Australia wide, there is a significant problem with people working longer hours than they should. Part and parcel of the regulation package which the previous Labor government put together in 1991 was a focus on the safety of those people involved in road transport and a demand that, whoever they were working for—either as private contractors or for companies—safety standards should be abided by. This government has recognised that over the last 12 years the states and the Commonwealth have worked together cooperatively to enhance the health and safety of people working in this industry. The commonality of regulations has been a boon not only to the individual operators but to the companies and Australians as a whole. Therefore, instead of knocking this over at the end of the sunset period, this is a question of re-endorsing the kind of approach that there can be Commonwealth activity in regulating what happens with national transport. I commend the government on recognising that when you do good work, it should be substantiated and that there is a valuable and vital role to play. 
I will go a little further on this and say that over the last six years it has been recognised on both sides that a lot needs to be done for national transport. There have been some stuttering attempts to fix some of the core problems. But there are members of the coalition, in both the National Party and the Liberal Party, who recognise that reports brought down in this House—one by the member for Hinkler some parliaments ago—looking at the national transport needs of Australia have identified that significant amounts of money need to be expended to fix our core problems. About $600 million—it might be a bit more now—needed to be expended to fix the fundamental problems in rail transport.
We have seen some stuttering attempts and announcements recently that these problems might be addressed. The almost completed link to Darwin was not part of the considerations of that report, as far as I understand it. The key elements of that report go to the question of how you get rail freight running along the eastern seaboard and how you do it more effectively, in a modern way, to make up for the serious difficulties that are currently encountered. One problem is that we do not have a dedicated freight line running right up and down the eastern seaboard. That is evident in Sydney. When freight hits Sydney, it hits the normal passenger network. It cannot effectively and efficiently be dealt with in Sydney; it cannot move through Sydney to Brisbane or Melbourne or on to Perth because of delays within the Sydney system.
This government has not addressed the great challenge of how to deal with national rail freight efficiently and effectively. It demands not only a dedicated freight line and a way of unclogging movement through Sydney but also cooperation with the states, owners and companies in the transport area to fix up old infrastructure problems that were not addressed when National Rail controlled the whole show.
Some fundamental things need to be done. The member for Hinkler's report underlined the fact that, if you spent your money on addressing the key nodal problems of overhead passes, repairing bridges, ensuring that there were extended lay-bys so that trains could move aside to allow other trains—whether freight or passenger—to move past, you could rejuvenate our system and make it operable.
That is significant because the kind of regulation involved in this bill—which goes to the commonality of usages, charges and so on—also goes to the question of how we look at national transport as a whole. Is it just the responsibility of the Commonwealth? No. Is it just the responsibility of the individual states? No. The only fundamentally successful platform we can lay is one where cooperation is embedded in the entire process. This was evident in what was put together in 1991. It has been evident that the regulatory regime that that has encompassed has been successfully operating for the past 12 years. It means that state, territory and Commonwealth governments can cooperate not only in relation to the National Transport Commission but also to fix the key unaddressed problems with our national infrastructure. 
A fundamental problem, when we are dealing with the question of road infrastructure, is the national highway. When in office, Labor expended $5,000 million on ensuring that the national highway was really a national highway—that is, that it covered the whole of Australia so people could move from one part to another on a tarred surface and the nation could be bound together. There are different priorities in different governments, and the coalition have put their money into the Pacific Highway. They have addressed, fundamentally, state road concerns, not national road concerns. They have done that for their own purposes. I know how dear to the hearts of certain members that expenditure has been over time.
I would argue that there is a higher question here, and you need to look not just at short-term approaches to try to get electoral effects in seats associated with this highway. If you look at the Commonwealth point and purpose, you will see that a national road system was a major and significant accomplishment of the last government. The next Labor government, under our current shadow minister, has a plan for fixing those national problems which are centred on Sydney. Labor has announced an integrated plan to fix the fundamental problems in the Sydney road, rail, air and sea network which will address those problems in a manner where the state and federal governments work cooperatively. Everyone who is part of the Sydney transport system and lives with it knows those problems need a great deal of addressing.
The one thing that the Commonwealth government have done is to eventually agree to the orbital road in Sydney. That has been a long time coming. The financial support for that will be based on the users, people in Western Sydney, paying a high toll to have that facility. People in the transport area will pay the money that it takes to get through Sydney because currently there is a great deal of delay when trucks go through from the south to the north of Sydney, or the reverse. The orbital road will make a significant difference to the ease of use of transport through the city.
The clogging in the rail area has not been fixed or addressed. The government have made some stuttering attempts to say they will do a bit about it, but there is not much that is integrated or highly regulated about their approach. It is episodic, it is ad hoc, it tends to be election driven and it tends to be off-key. Often they look at purely state concerns, rather than national concerns that bind together the Commonwealth, states and territories—as encompassed in this bill.
At this juncture I want to underline the fact that Labor has an extremely proud history in government as a party that is willing to address the difficult problems. It is very easy to try to address the simple ones and to try to belt out a bit of rhetoric and beat the drum over issues that do not demand much of a government. But you need imagination, vision, determination, commitment and a pragmatic approach to fixing fundamental infrastructure problems. You need the willingness to belt your head against the wall to get state ministers around the table to agree to a common set of purposes and a common set of approaches in addressing these difficult issues.
The core of Labor's approach, demonstrated in our last 13 years in government, is expressed in the continuation of our work in this bill. If what we had done had been so wrong the government, at the end of the 12-year period, in looking at this and determining to review may have said, `This isn't going to go anywhere; there's not much that's very good in this. We've been forced to have a 12-year period, but let's go back to the market and let individuals simply choose the approach they are going to take to regulation. Let's have a federation where the states should be as free as individuals to determine what their road haulage charges are, what their insurance charges are, what taxes and imposts they should make, what safety regulations they should have and what other determinants they should have.' 
If you follow Liberal philosophy, that is how it should run. That is what they mostly argue should happen here. But there is a giant corrective in the approach we have taken which the coalition have had to acknowledge: one, that it works and, two, that there is a great national and public interest that is addressed by that commonality of standards and approach. It makes national transport run well and run effectively if you do it in cooperation and you do not have a laissez faire attitude towards these issues.
Labor strongly endorses cooperative development at the state and federal levels no matter how hard that is to achieve. As that has been re-endorsed here, in what is an extension of the work we have done by putting it onto a broader canvas, we have called for, as the shadow minister has indicated, a commitment—we know we will get a commitment on the part of the next Labor government, but we do not have a commitment on the part of the coalition—to address the fundamental key problems of transport infrastructure and the difficult unyielding problems that exist because it is not a big project that looks flashy and can be talked about from one end of the country to the other.
The inland rail proposal, because it is a private proposal, has been whipped up from one end of Australia to the other, but it is a proposal that is dependent on two things: one, the Commonwealth giving a total guarantee that it will underwrite any cost if that project happens to fail; and, two, the Commonwealth underwriting a series of connections to ports such as Gladstone and so on. We have seen no movement forward, except rhetorically, in relation to that proposal because it is fundamentally not sustainable. People in country Australia have been promised an easy way out of these problems, but they have not been told the truth about what the fundamental difficulties of it are and the fact that the Commonwealth is not going to sign under the line.
We need a re-endorsement of a commitment to a national approach to our national problems. We need a re-endorsement of the Commonwealth's central role in bringing together disparate state interests and directing them towards fixing our national transport problems. In terms of safety conditions, regulations and how they have been bound together, we have had 12 years of positive experience of how that has worked out and we have had an endorsement by the coalition of Labor's approach in government. We have had an endorsement of the fact that if you do it cooperatively you can also do it in the national interest. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NP,2003-08-14,"—I rise in the chamber today to speak on the National Transport Commission Bill 2003. One of our nation's greatest challenges in the next 20 years is to ensure that our transport infrastructure is best placed to meet the rise in demand. Projections which have been made on freight movements in 20 years time highlight why it is essential that we put in place a transport action plan now. Demand on road, rail and sea infrastructure is going to grow significantly over the next 20 years. Estimates predict, for instance, that the road freight task will double over the next 15 years. This is a significant increase which requires a whole-of-government national response. If we are to ensure that we are prepared for such substantial growth, it is essential that we have a unified approach to ensuring our national transport framework can respond to the challenges ahead. 
Transport is vital to our everyday lives and has particular importance in regional areas for regional business and regional communities. Transport and communication links break down the age-old tyranny of distance. The upgrade of the Pacific Highway between Sydney and Brisbane is well advanced and is a result of the hard work and strong representations on this issue by the National Party. At the very least, governments at federal, state and local levels have to make the commitment of cooperation so that the public and private sectors have the opportunity to reform and expand our transport networks. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services has released a green paper—AusLink—which is the Commonwealth government's response to the challenges that lie ahead for Australia's land transport network.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I am seeking to exercise standing order 84A with respect to a question to the member.
—Will the member for Cowper allow the question?
—I will allow the question.
—I turn to the issue of the Pacific Highway. Firstly, isn't it the case that the Pacific Highway agreement was originally formulated by the then Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, and the New South Wales Labor government? Secondly, is it soon to expire with no commitment from the current government to sign up to finish the Pacific Highway upgrade?
—I thank the member for Batman for his question. Certainly I know that he is keenly interested in regional transport. One day he may even visit the electorate and actually see the very fine work that is going on. In fact, the member for Batman is famous in the electorate for his interesting statements on airport security and the fact that there was no security at Coffs Harbour Airport when, in fact, there has been security for quite a long time.
—You don't want to answer the question!
—I am coming to your question, member for Batman. If one looks at outcomes, the voice that is most heard on the issue of the Pacific Highway is in fact the former member for Cowper and Deputy Speaker of this House Garry Nehl. Garry was a tireless worker for the upgrade of the Pacific Highway. He was known in this House as Mr Pacific Highway, I must say. In answer to the question, lobbying by the National Party—lobbying by the former member for Cowper, Mr Garry Nehl—was a major part in bringing about those changes.
Getting back to the issue of national transport, AusLink is the Commonwealth government's response to the challenges that lie ahead for Australia's land transport network. Its principal objective is sustainable economic growth, development and connectivity at national and regional levels. By the end of this year a white paper will be released, which will detail a strategic approach and direction for transport over the next two decades. AusLink is a very important initiative for the Commonwealth, and I intend to expand on some of the issues raised in the green paper a little later. However, in addition to the need for a strategic plan, it is essential that we have national transport tasks monitored by an independent body. This bill proposes to set up an independent body—an authority responsible for developing, monitoring and maintaining uniform or nationally consistent regulations and operational reforms for road, rail and intermodal transport. 
The commission will replace the National Road Transport Commission—or NRTC—which currently has responsibility for progressing road transport regulatory reforms. It is part of the overall strategy that recognises transport systems are integrated. They rely on each other. The new National Transport Commission will work at all levels of government to bring together important road and rail links. The NRTC was established under the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 and is directly accountable to the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers through the Australian Transport Council, ATC, as will be the commission.
This body is essential to ensuring that all stakeholders work in unison to achieve the best possible transport network across the nation. One of the real challenges that Australia has faced since Federation is that different state governments have different approaches to their transport infrastructure. It is essential to our nation building that we are able to bridge the gaps and get a more national and uniform approach to transport, which converts into a more effective and efficient network. For instance, I know that in my electorate the ongoing upgrading of the Pacific Highway, which the member for Batman has shown some considerable interest in, continues to be an issue. The Commonwealth has shown real commitment to the highway by providing, over 10 years, $750 million to its upgrade, even though this road is the responsibility of the state governments.
I note that a great deal of credit for securing those federal funds has to be given to the former member for Cowper, Mr Garry Nehl, who lobbied long and hard on the issue of upgrading the Pacific Highway. The coalition government has committed significant funds in this year's budget to road funding. This is committed over a number of programs, including the Roads to Recovery program—which empowers local governments to improve their road network and which members opposite voted against—and the Black Spots Roads Program. Since the black spots program was launched in 1996, 2,800 road black spots projects throughout Australia have been approved and have addressed major accident-prone sites. This year, $23 million will be spent in New South Wales as a result of National Party lobbying in the budget to secure important measures for rural and regional New South Wales.
—What about Western Australia?
—I will leave the member for Canning to speak on Western Australia later. Exports from regional areas are responsible for one in four jobs in regional Australia. Those export goods start their journeys on a local or regional road. If we could ensure those goods were leaving Australia through sure, effective and efficient transport channels, Australia as a nation would be in a better position to compete for international business and have a much more efficient economy. Those goods provide a tremendous opportunity to create jobs, increase investment and improve living standards in regional areas. As a former tourism operator, I know the Pacific Highway upgrade will make an important contribution to tourism and the development of those regions up and down the east coast of Australia. In commending this legislation to the House, I again note for the record the vital importance of these issues for all Australians, particularly those in regional areas.
The Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, has focused a great deal of attention on AusLink due to the significant transport challenges that Australia faces over the next 20 years. AusLink will improve our national transport network by integrating separate rail and road networks and ad hoc intermodal developments. Under AusLink, we will develop a rolling five-year national transport plan that will identify the future challenges and needs of the network. Under AusLink, the range of organisations able to access Commonwealth government funding will be expanded. For the first time, the private sector, transport user organisations and community organisations will be able to join state governments and local councils in proposing projects for Commonwealth government funding. 
The range of solutions eligible for Commonwealth government funding will also be broadened to include new technologies which will reduce congestion, make transport safer and reduce its impact on the environment. AusLink will bring together separate Commonwealth government funding programs for rail and road into a single, flexible funding program. Funding will go to the best solution, regardless of transport mode. We will specifically earmark funding for regional transport infrastructure projects. AusLink will encourage the joint development and funding of projects between the levels of governments and between the public and private sectors. This will increase the level of available funding and ensure everyone is working towards similar goals. AusLink will not involve a reduction in the Commonwealth government's transport—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene.
—Is the member for Cowper willing to give way?
—Yes.
—My question is: is it not true that no extra money is provided for under AusLink? There is no extra money for railways, and there is no commitment under AusLink to continue to involve national highway construction and maintenance.
—I can only suggest to the member for Batman that he await the release of the white paper and reserve his comments until that time.
—I thought the National Party was running the government?
—The National Party is doing a great job in representing the interests of rural and regional Australia.
—I see he speaks with confidence.
—Absolutely. As I said, AusLink is going to bring together separate funding programs for road and rail into one single program, and we are looking at creating the best solution. AusLink will encourage the joint development and funding of projects between the levels of government and between the public and private sectors. This will increase the level of available funding and ensure everyone in the system is working towards similar goals.
AusLink will not involve a reduction in the Commonwealth government's transport expenditure, so I can put the member for Batman's mind at rest. It will not affect any of the projects currently funded by the federal government or any project where there has been a firm commitment for federal funding. AusLink will develop a higher performing national transport network, which will improve the productivity of the economy and contribute to Australia's international competitiveness and broad economic performance. It will do this primarily by focusing investment and effort on an integrated land transport network made up of links of strategic importance and on projects that can deliver higher benefits. This will make a substantial contribution to improved logistics. 
The Commonwealth government will also focus on areas of the land transport network that are likely to yield national and regional benefits. These include national and interregional corridors; links from broader national networks to ports, airports, production and distribution centres; connecting internodal facilities; local routes of regional significance; and links that are critical to national and regional economic growth, development and connectivity. The result will be a more productive transport network and a major contribution to improved freight logistics.
AusLink proposes to expand the range of organisations able to propose projects, as I said before, to include groups such as community groups, rather than just state governments. The private sector will be involved in the development of a plan from an early stage. More extensive and early involvement of the private sector will better integrate privately owned and operated land transport facilities and projects into the planning process. Under AusLink, the Commonwealth government will establish a National Transport Advisory Council, consisting of experts from the private and public sectors, to provide transport ministers with strategic analysis and advice on Australia's transport priorities.
Intelligent transport systems are already being used in Australia, particularly in the major cities. Sydney led the world in the roll-out of first generation ITS technology with the development of the Sydney traffic control system, which coordinates over 3,000 sets of traffic lights. The electronic tolling system on Melbourne's CityLink handles more than 650,000 transactions a day. Satellite navigation systems are now available as an option or standard in almost 30 per cent of Australian vehicles. Technological solutions will become a vital part of the Commonwealth government's approach to transport infrastructure as the cost of technology continues to fall. They will reduce congestion, make transport safer and reduce its impact on environment.
AusLink will promote the effective development and use of new technology by evaluating and using technological solutions to facilitate better management and pricing as alternatives to, or in association with, traditional road construction. AusLink will provide stronger encouragement for national initiatives to develop innovative solutions that meet Australia's needs, such as further development of the intelligent transport systems national strategy and the use of satellite based technology. The Commonwealth government wants to support a more strategic local government approach to identifying and funding regional transport priorities. As well as providing broad funding support to local government, AusLink will contribute to the development of a stronger regional Australia.
AusLink will earmark funds for regional transport infrastructure. A portion of these funds will be used on projects that promote the development of links of regional significance, hence strengthening opportunities for regional trade, industries and tourism. AusLink will offer a framework for local councils and their project partners to address local links of significance on a regional basis. This will offer greater opportunities for local councils to bid for Commonwealth government funding. AusLink aims to foster partnerships, particularly between levels of government and between the public and private sectors, to promote the link between investment in transport and regional growth.
The Commonwealth government will continue the existing roads funding mechanisms that apply under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995. AusLink will not affect any of the projects currently funded by the Commonwealth government or any projects for which there has been a firm commitment by the Commonwealth government. It will not affect the Black Spots Roads Program or the Roads to Recovery program. If we are to have an efficient transport system, it is important that it be coordinated. The National Transport Commission will be important in facilitating that sort of coordination. I note the member for Blaxland's support for the NTC; I was certainly pleased to hear that degree of support. I commend the bill to the House. ",REPS,<title>NATIONAL TRANSPORT COMMISSION (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"—As previous speakers have outlined, the main purpose of the National Transport Commission Bill 2003 and associated bills is to establish a new transport commission. Before going to the importance of this bill, I will make some remarks about the previous contribution by the member for Cowper. If this government is so committed to existing undertakings with respect to regional communities, I think it is about time that this government met promises made at the last election with respect to some outstanding major projects in regional Australia. I refer specifically to promises made by the Treasurer in relation to the Pakenham bypass and the upgrade of the Calder Highway.
During the course of the last campaign, the Howard government, in an endeavour to gain political support, sent the Treasurer out on a mission. He had the responsibility to go to Pakenham to give an undertaking to the people of the La Trobe Valley that the Pakenham bypass would be classified as a RONI and hence receive a 50 per cent contribution from the Commonwealth government. He also travelled to Bendigo—one of his rare trips to regional Australia—at the height of the campaign and gave a similar undertaking with regard to the upgrade of the Calder Highway, which is a deathtrap, in the same way in which the Pakenham bypass is a deathtrap, because of the large number of schools which exist along that section of the road into the La Trobe Valley. There are outstanding questions relating to the Commonwealth government meeting its 50 per cent contribution to those exceptionally important road projects. Those questions are not only about sections of some important roads but also about overcoming major road safety challenges for the people of Victoria.
I listened with some interest to the comments by the member for Cowper, a person who regards himself as an aggressive representative of regional Australia. All I can say to regional Australia is that when it comes to the implementation of election promises to regional Australia post-election by the Howard government—and there are many other examples I can give with respect to the performance of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services—despite commitments given by the Treasurer, there is a lot left to be desired. Insofar as I am concerned, it is about time the Howard government met those commitments. We are still seeing fatal accidents, lives lost and major injuries because of a shortfall of Commonwealth money with respect to those road projects.
That goes to the nature of this bill. I very much support the continuation of the National Transport Commission. It is important that Australia as a nation has an independent statutory body with responsibility for developing, monitoring and maintaining uniform or nationally consistent regulatory and operational transport reforms. In the past, all too often the states and the Commonwealth have been unable to put their heads together and come up with a consistent approach to these challenges. We as a nation cannot tolerate that approach to national land transport. 
I am pleased to note the historical position. The original commission was established by the Labor government in 1991 as the National Road Transport Commission. Not only do I want to acknowledge the commitment by the then Labor government but also, perhaps more importantly, I want to acknowledge that the original desire to go down this path came from the former member for Newcastle and minister for transport, Mr Charlie Jones, who has only just passed away. The truth of the matter is that until Charlie Jones became Minister for Transport and Aviation, Australia lacked a national commitment to road transport in Australia. I think we also lacked a national commitment to an integrated Commonwealth railway system until then. One of the achievements of Charlie Jones was the commencement of the Darwin to Adelaide railway. He put in place the Commonwealth commitment which saw the railway extended from Tarcoola to Alice Springs. In January of next year we will see the final link of that railway opened, with the Darwin to Alice Springs section completed.
In historical circumstances I had the responsibility—from a union point of view—of handling the decision in late 1975 or early 1976 by Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to close the Darwin to Katherine section of the railway. So it is a strange twist to now find myself, as the shadow minister for transport, watching the section of the railway have the potential to open soon, having handled the closure of that part of the railway back in 1976. In terms of a national commitment to land transport, it is also interesting to note that Charlie Jones, as minister for transport, finally put in place a Commonwealth commitment to the national highway structure.
I am very worried about the potential development of AusLink. Having only commenced the task of building and maintaining the national highway commenced by Charlie Jones back in 1972, AusLink, the coalition government's so-called commitment to a national land transport plan, does not provide for an ongoing commitment to the construction and maintenance of the national highway system in Australia.  Having said that, I do welcome the fact that this bill builds on the achievements of not only this government but also past Labor governments in transport reform. It takes the reform structures beyond road transport for the first time to also include rail and intermodal transport. That is a statement about the importance of the logistics debate and an intermodal approach to transport in the 21st century. 
The new structure arises from a review of the National Road Transport Commission that was prescribed when it was originally established. In fact, this broader intermodal structure should have been put in place in 1998, when the inaugural sunset of the original commission was reached. Unfortunately, the current government—through its National Road Transport Commission Amendment Act 1998—merely extended the same structure for a further five years. To give credit where it is due, the 1998 act did take the positive step of expanding the then Ministerial Council for Road Transport to create the Australian Transport Council, with a broader agenda and a broader commitment to actually doing something. It built on the achievements of the original act.
In my view the transport industry would have benefited if the broader reform agenda provided in the bill today had also been introduced in 1998 as part of the expansion of the activities of the national council for roads and the creation of the Australian Transport Council. The opposition very much supports the broader focus of the commission to encompass these other modes of transport. However, in doing so I acknowledge the concerns of the road transport industry. During the legitimate discussion and debate about these issues, the road transport industry have made it clear that their industry cannot afford to have a reduced focus on reform. We have come a long way on road reform, but there is still a lot to be achieved—there are many challenges ahead of us. I therefore support the call by industry and request that the minister ensure that road reform continues apace. 
The bill also provides a mechanism for setting out model legislation and other instruments in the regulations. One cannot underestimate the importance of this national approach. The states and the territories—and the Commonwealth where appropriate—may then either reference or enact the substance of the model legislation in their own law. So it is about getting a commitment not only to a national approach but also to a set piece of legislation that can be enacted and mirrored across all the states and territories. This is an important mechanism to establish and maintain a nationally agreed regulatory framework. You do not just have a meeting and a commitment to do it; you set about putting in place model legislation that all the states and territories can pick up with ease, therefore enacting the commitment reached at the ministerial council and other associated meetings which are part and parcel of this commission.
As a result of the 1998 amendment—the review of the act—the NRTC Act therefore provides for its own sunset, on 14 January 2004, which brings us to the very debate before the chair today. It also requires the ATC to report to heads of government at least 12 months before that date to advise whether the NRTC Act should cease to be enforced or be re-enacted. In fulfilment of this requirement—and correctly—the government conducted a review of the NRTC Act. The ATC recommended to heads of government the continuation of the road transport regulatory reform process with increased emphasis on maintenance of reforms and the extension of the NRTC reform model to rail and internodal operations requiring replacement of the NRTC by the commission. Interestingly, all heads of government subsequently agreed to the ATC developing legislation for the purpose, and the ATC ministers have subsequently agreed to the current reform embodied in the legislation before the chair today.
The provisions of the proposed act will be supported by an intergovernmental agreement which goes hand in hand with the legislation. This agreement will serve to formalise the cooperative arrangements between the Commonwealth, states and territories and define the roles and responsibilities of the commission and of the ATC and its jurisdictions. You cannot have one without the other. The agreement will set out the voting agreements and arrangements of the ATC. I think these are important, because they go to the governance commitment to deliver reforms—a commitment to do something—when the commission determines how it acts, the nature of the agreements, the approval processes or the resolution of matters provided for by the proposed act.
The agreement is currently being finalised for signature by the Commonwealth, state and territory transport ministers prior to the commencement of the act. For that reason, it is my view that the opposition should also be consulted and kept informed about progress of that intergovernmental agreement. Unless it is finalised in a proper constructive way, the very legislation we are all supporting today could come apart. Certainly, we should be consulted on the final draft form of the agreement before it is signed off.
As I and previous speakers on my side of the House have indicated, the opposition support the legislation. It largely replicates the NRTC Act originally put in place by Labor. It essentially retains standard practices regarding the appointment of commissioners, remuneration, and procedural and reporting requirements of an organisation of this kind. The legislation renews and builds upon the governance structure for national transport policy reform that was pioneered by Labor in the 1990s and built on by the current government in the review of 1998. I believe that, historically, only the Labor Party has been interested in genuine reform in the transport industry. 
That takes me to the issue of railway infrastructure—an area in which I think the Howard government has let down the nation. Since 1998, the Howard government has spent less than $100 million on our mainland interstate traffic. As we speak, despite the fact that we have major problems with the further intensification of freight being moved on roads around Australia, we still have $111 million locked up which should be spent on our mainland interstate track now. Worse still, that money has been there since 1998.
The Australian Rail Track Corporation audit released two years ago with the support of both sides of the House showed a basic requirement for $507 million to be spent on the mainland rail track, because it was falling apart. While the track falls apart and the rail freight industry screams for infrastructure spending, the government sits on its hands, that $111 million which ought to be spent now is not spent and the movement of rail freight continues to deteriorate from a competitive point of view. The negotiations of the Commonwealth with the New South Wales government have continued at a snail's pace.
Frankly, I believe that they have been going on for too long. I think it is imperative that we see an agreement within a matter of weeks to not only advance the need for regulatory reform but also get that $111 million spent on the upgrade of the mainland rail track, ostensibly from Brisbane through to Melbourne. The real problem is that for far too long the current minister, rather than getting involved in those negotiations himself, left it to departmental officers. Whilst not reflecting on the performance and commitment of those departmental officers, I always have the view that it is a minister's responsibility to do his own dirty work, to engage in negotiations and to broker necessary agreements to make progress on difficult challenges.
It was only on 1 May this year that, following suggestions from the opposition, the minister finally met with the New South Wales minister and, for the first time ever, pledged to actually deliver an outcome rather than sit on the sidelines and throw stones at the New South Wales government—as is the normal method of operation of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Unfortunately, we are still awaiting the outcome of those negotiations—whilst very important infrastructure funds remain idle. On that note, it is interesting that Labor was the only party that went to the last election with a commitment to increase rail funding for our national track. Alternatively, the Howard government sold the National Rail Corporation and did not put one cent from the proceeds of the sale into upgrading rail infrastructure in Australia.
This brings me to the issue of road infrastructure, an area in which there has been another dismal performance by the current minister and Leader of the National Party, Mr Anderson. The opposition recently released statistics showing that spending on our national highway network has actually reduced since the Howard government was elected. Increasingly funds are going to the Roads of National Importance program. The spending on these state roads—and they are state roads—as a percentage of the total National Highway/RONI program has grown dramatically since the RONI program was first introduced in 1996. It currently stands at 23 per cent of the budget allocation. That effectively means that our commitment to the ongoing construction and maintenance of the national highway continues to go backwards. What is worse is that the RONI program has become better known around the country as the `roads of National Party importance program'. I know that view is strongly held by a number of members of the major coalition partner, the Liberal Party, with respect to decisions on road construction in Australia. Although it is fair to say that when you have a by-election such as Aston, all of a sudden you find a RONI called the Scoresby Freeway being embraced—which is important for the purposes of winning a by-election. 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to propose a question on the issue of Scoresby to the Member for Batman.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—Will the honourable member take the question?
—Most certainly.
—I would be delighted to know whether the opposition spokesperson for transport supports or rejects tolls on the Scoresby Freeway.
—The opposition have been endeavouring to get a copy of the original agreement with respect to the Scoresby Freeway. We know that, in negotiations around that agreement, the coalition government very seriously considered the question of tolls and detailed work was done by the department and the minister's office on this. We also know that the people of the eastern suburbs were lied to at the election because there was not sufficient money in the budget for the coalition government to build the Scoresby without a toll. We note that there is a political game currently being played with respect to whether or not there should be tolls on the Scoresby, but from our examination of the budget processes we have come to the conclusion that the Howard government have over-allocated the current transport portfolio and are not in a position to build the Scoresby without tolls. The debate will continue. A lie was told by the coalition government at the last election with respect to the Scoresby Freeway because the money was not there, at the time of the promise, to build it without a toll. More importantly, the government were involved in discussion with the then Victorian government about building the Scoresby with either tolls or shadow tolls. I think it is about time the minister released all the documentation going to the discussions about the construction of the Scoresby.
As I was saying, all too often Liberal Party members of the coalition are missing out because the Roads of National Importance program has become a program better suited to the protection and advancement of members of the National Party rather than the coalition government. The criteria for selecting RONIs are disregarded more often than not and the projects are hand-picked for political purposes. AusLink, a plan sponsored by the Howard government, is premised on introducing into the national highway system around Australia RONIs par excellence, based on tolls, and national highways par excellence, based on tolls. That is what the AusLink plan says: in the future, if we want to upgrade our road structure in Australia under the coalition government, tolls will be the order of the day. The members on the other side ought to go and have a look at the fine print of the AusLink proposals, because it is basically premised on not going forward without the capacity of the Howard government to introduce tolls all around Australia, including on the Scoresby. 
I remind the House that state and local governments are already struggling to meet their road funding commitments. I also note that there is no commitment by the current government for continuation of the Roads to Recovery program beyond the next financial year. The AusLink plan will simply make the job harder. The Howard government does not want to continue to build and maintain our national highway system. I have already referred to outstanding commitments on important roads such as Pakenham and Calder. I am also worried about the upgrade of the national highway system north of Albury and outstanding national highway jobs on the Ipswich motorway and the Bruce Highway. These are death traps that require urgent Commonwealth government attention, because they are 100 per cent Commonwealth government responsibilities in terms of the national highway system. This is critical safety work that must be attended to. 
Labor's alternative proposal is for an integrated transport plan which goes to thinking about all modes—actually, for example, considering whether it is best to put money into a road or into a railway option. We do not want a botched approach to transport reform, as has occurred in the shipping industry with a government committed to destroying Australian seafarers' jobs by basically sponsoring overseas flagged vessels and overseas crews. I am pleased to say that the High Court of Australia—an institution not known for reform in terms of looking after workers—last week brought down a decision that effectively said that it had got to a point where even the High Court could not tolerate where the Howard government was going with its shipping policy. I am delighted that the High Court ruled last week that foreign shipping operators plying the coastal trade should comply with Australian industrial laws and associated instruments. For far too long, the current government has been manipulating coastal shipping, bringing in foreign ships and crews and seeing Australian workers lose their jobs and Australian families suffer. That is the so-called commitment of the current government to jobs in Australia.
I think it is about time that we actually put in place a consistent, level playing field with respect to the issue of shipping policy in Australia. The current playing field is tilted in favour of foreign operators—potential ships of shame—which endanger our environment and leave us in a situation, as we currently have in the Solomon Islands, of not even having Australian coastal ships to take the necessary equipment to service our troops. We actually had to get a foreign vessel to transport the necessary equipment to back up our troops in the Solomon Islands. What a disgrace, when you think about problems of international terrorism and threats to the Australian community, and we cannot even get an Australian ship that we can rely on to help Australian troops—young men and women—in the Solomon Islands. We know it is part and parcel of the Australian way of life, and we engage a foreign ship and a foreign crew to send backup material and goods to assist our people in the Solomon Islands. It is un-Australian, it reflects on the Prime Minister, and it reflects on the blinkered ideological approach of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to the shipping policy in Australia. It is cheapjack policies pursued by a cheapjack minister.
That takes me to the issue of aviation reform and the Airspace Reform Group, under the stewardship of Mr Dick Smith, who is a well-known friend of the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, although historically not a very good friend of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson. We all know that, contrary to the wishes of the minister, the Airspace Reform Group, under the stewardship of Mr Dick Smith, was put in place by the Prime Minister as part of a dirty little election deal at the last election to get Mr Dick Smith out of campaigning in Gwydir against the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Everyone knows it and, unfortunately, we may potentially now have to live with an outrageous approach to airspace reform which could potentially put people at risk because of an enthusiastic amateur—Mr Dick Smith, a friend of the Prime Minister's. 
That takes me to the issue of the rewriting of CASA's regulations. The truth is that people in CASA are very worried about where airspace reform is going. We cannot allow the industry to be drowned in paperwork, and we have got to make sure that if there is any reform it is done in an open, constructive and transparent way, not by mates' mates as is currently occurring with respect to the Airspace Reform Group. I raise these issues because I am exceptionally worried, as are many in the aviation industry, that this airspace reform could go wrong and that we will put at risk the Australian travelling public—that we will risk their lives and major accidents because of the work of an enthusiastic amateur. Just because something occurs in America that does not necessarily mean it is right for Australia. The last thing we should do is buy political favours in the lead-up to an election which could end up in us seriously endangering airspace reform just because we needed to protect the political hide of the current Minister for Transport and Regional Services in the seat of Gwydir.
These are exceptionally important issues. They go to the whole approach to transport in Australia. It is about time that we got a commitment from the Howard government to actually do something about transport in Australia. We have a minister at the moment who is very soon to leave parliament. It is very clear he will not go to the next election. The real issue is whether or not he will see out Christmas, let alone this month, as the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Everyone knows he is on the way out—why doesn't he just pull the pin so that we can get a minister who actually wants to do the job with some commitment? I know that the Liberal Party members on the other side of the House have their eyes on the transport portfolio because they have also had a gutful of the nonperformance of the current minister. If he wants to go back to the farm then he should go back to the farm. Let us put someone in the job who is prepared to do the job, who actually cares about airspace reform and who is not prepared to be part of a dirty deal which endangers airspace operations in Australia to protect his political hide. That is what has occurred with respect to the performance of this portfolio for far too long. Lives are potentially at risk because of dirty little deals done in the lead-up to the last election. When an aircraft accident occurs I will, frankly, be hounding the minister if it occurs as a result of this airspace reform, which was part of a dirty little political deal.
In conclusion, we do fully support the legislation. It builds on the initiation of reform that we put in place in 1991, which was further improved in 1998. Some of the changes embodied in this legislation perhaps should have come forward in 1998 as part of a national commitment to the logistics debate. We are a party of transport reform. The legislation is overdue and largely replicates the reform structure established by Labor in the early 1990s. It is not creative and innovative, because that is beyond the minister. We welcome the extension of the framework to rail and intermodal activities. However, we question the lack of commitment and focus on the shipping industry, because it is excluded from the reform process. It is a policy area that needs urgent attention. As he departs, we also call on the minister to see this legislation as at least a bit of a legacy for a new focus on transport in Australia. He was incapable of doing it—let us hope that the legislation actually establishes the framework for the new minister to do something of substance, because this minister has left very little else other than this legislation as his legacy.

"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,2003-08-14,"—For more than a decade the National Road Transport Commission has been at the centre of progressive regulatory reform in this country's national road transport. Legislation requires the Australian Transport Council to consider and report to government on whether the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 should cease to be in force after its prescribed term or whether it should be re-enacted.
In accordance with that requirement, in 2002 the Australian Transport Council—the ministerial forum for consultation between Commonwealth, state and territory governments and for providing advice on the coordination and integration of all national transport and road policy issues—commissioned a review of the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991. The review found that there is a need for new structures to be established for regulatory reform of road, rail and intermodal transport operations. The review recommended that the National Road Transport Commission be replaced by a new statutory body called the National Transport Commission.
On 6 February 2003 the Australian Transport Council announced that Commonwealth, state and territory heads of government had agreed to the establishment of the National Transport Commission. The bills now under consideration, the National Transport Commission Bill 2003 and the National Transport Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2003, give effect to that decision. 
The National Transport Commission will take over the role played by the National Road Transport Commission in reforming road transport regulation and operations and, in addition, it will undertake an expanded role in a similar reform approach to rail and intermodal transport.
The National Road Transport Commission has been in existence since 1991. It was reviewed in 1996 and again, as mentioned earlier, in 2002. The latest review was unstinting in its approval of the impact that the NRTC has had on the road transport industry, particularly since 1996, concluding that:
The NRTC has been an outstanding and rare example of joint action by the Commonwealth, States and Territories to fix common problems of inconsistency, inefficiency and safety management.
and that:
Confidence in the NRTC has grown since 1996. As it completes a decade of reform it is now regarded by most in the industry and outside it as a notable success story.
The review found that the regulatory reform of road transport developed by the NRTC would by the end of 2003 deliver economic, environmental and safety related benefits estimated at being worth approximately $400 million. For example, Australia now ranks in the top 10 OECD countries in its road safety performance following the reduction in the fatal accident rate involving heavy vehicles since the NRTC was established. The review, however, quite correctly noted that there is no room for complacency. 
Community concern about the growing number of large combination vehicles on shared roads is likely to continue. The task ahead is to consolidate the benefits achieved since 1991 and it is important that the momentum of regulatory change developed over that period be maintained. Sustaining road transport industry reform and focussing on improvements to the efficiency and safety of the transport system for the benefits of customers and the community as a whole must be a priority. 
But it is also important that the regulatory reform processes so effectively promoted by the National Road Transport Commission are now extended to rail and intermodal transport. The transport industry is continually and rapidly changing. We face growing competition in the global economy and the community demands continuous improvements in safety and environmental affordability.
Transport operators are constantly working to improve intermodal integration, bringing together the best elements of road transport, rail transport and their connections to all parts of the transport system and seeking improvements in efficiency, service quality and risk management. Modernisation of the vehicle fleet, the growth of freight being managed by logistics service providers, advances in information technology and continuing industry concentration across all modes are further evidence of change in the industry.
The Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics estimates that in 1999-2000 freight logistics activities were approximately nine per cent of Australia's GDP—around $57 billion. The bureau suggests that total freight will continue to grow faster than the economy, and both road and rail freight will grow substantially in the next decade. Even small changes in productivity can have significant economic benefits. Transport firms are integrating their operations and providing services in road, rail, maritime and air transport. As a result, significant shifts are occurring in freight movement.
The review found that, as the relative cost and quality of rail transport improve, the demand for movement of freight by rail will grow more quickly than in the past, putting pressure on capacity. This will emphasise the need for a more consistent operating environment and the need to improve track capacity and control systems. There will be pressure on governments for more efficient operating environments and complementary investment to fill gaps in the transport network. There is ample evidence for this in the reforms in rail transport that have occurred in recent years. For example, the bulk of major rail transport operators are now in the private sector and significant parts of rail infrastructure have been transferred to private hands.
The review found that reform in safety regulation and the harmonisation of standards and practices have begun, but there is a need to provide additional impetus for the reform process to become self-sustaining. Trends towards integration across transport modes will highlight inconsistent standards and practices, gaps in transport infrastructure and systems, and inefficient intermodal interfaces. The review found that there was a strong need for reform to improve efficiency and reliability along integrated supply chains. This is a need that will continue to grow as the industry further develops. Increasing overseas trade will highlight similar inconsistencies internationally.
Customer demands and technological advances in freight management and handling are growing in response to pressures from global competition, along with e-commerce applications and new communications and control systems. In this changing environment, the review saw that Australia's integrated logistics firms will need an operating environment and infrastructure which enables them to respond quickly. Growth in urban freight movements, including increasing movement of imports and exports to and from capital cities, will also be a significant issue as communities become further concerned about urban congestion, noise and exhaust emissions. This will require improved system performance if the sustained, efficient operation of large and medium-size road vehicles on city streets is to be maintained. 
The review recognised that the Australian transport sector accounts for over 16 per cent of total greenhouse emissions. About 90 per cent of these come from road users, including cars, trucks and buses. Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector are the fastest growing emissions from any sector, rising by 20 per cent in the last decade according to the Australian Greenhouse Office. In this context, the transport industry will come under increasing pressure to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to adopt more environmentally friendly operational practices, technologies and fuels. This will favour solutions which encourage choices between modes based on the efficient use of resources.
The role of governments in transport reform has been to provide processes to identify needs and to develop and consider recommendations for change to legislation and industry practice. Governments have a fundamental role in providing strategic direction and regulatory reforms in response to changing economic and community needs. The National Road Transport Commission has been an outstanding example of the manner in which reforms can be achieved through cooperation, not only between Commonwealth, state and territory governments, but within the transport industry itself.
The review of the National Road Transport Commission Act has examined the transport industry in comprehensive detail and, in consideration of the factors I have mentioned here and having regard to a number of other factors covered in the review which I could not speak to you about, has recommended the establishment of the National Transport Commission. This new commission, which will be established under these bills, will continue the work of the National Road Transport Commission in the reform of road transport regulation and operation and, in addition, will have an ongoing responsibility to develop, monitor and maintain uniform or nationally consistent regulatory and operational reforms relating not only to road transport but also to rail transport and intermodal transport. 
It is important to note that the opposition endorsed these bills in a speech that, despite being rather like the curate's egg, was interesting in some of its historical analysis and important for the tribute it paid to Charlie Jones. I commend the bills to the House.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL TRANSPORT COMMISSION (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"—I want to chiefly address the issue of the Pakenham bypass, which has been talked about by my colleague and friend the member for Batman in the contribution he has made to this debate. Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, I know that you have been around politics for a little while and in the national parliament for a little while. You will remember the hot debates we have had in these places in the past about the importance of the Pakenham bypass. It was a hot issue in 2001 election campaign and it was a hot issue in the 1998 election campaign.
I remember the Treasurer, Peter Costello, getting out his Melways and managing to get himself all the way to Pakenham from his electorate office in Armadale. He stood on the Princes Highway at Pakenham with one arm around the Liberal candidate for McMillan and the other arm around Bob Charles, the Liberal member for La Trobe. He said, `We'—that is, the Howard government—`will fund half of the cost of the Pakenham bypass.' It was a pretty big deal because it came about two weeks after Labor had made that commitment. They made a pretty desperate attempt to get the votes of people to try and take me out in the electorate of McMillan. 
They tried hard, and fair enough—political life is a hard game. This is what goes on. A political party does something to try and get a seat, and I can understand what the Liberal Party was trying to do in making that commitment. As it turns out, I am still here. But the problem for the Howard government is that they have to honour the promise they made. It seems pretty clear now that they have no intention of honouring that promise. John Howard and the Liberal Party say that all they are prepared to commit to the Pakenham bypass is $100 million. That is $21 million short of half of the cost of project, and they promised us that they would fund half.
The Howard government says it is not prepared to commit the extra $21 million which we need to get the project built and then, in the next breath, it wastes $26 million of taxpayers' money on government advertising to justify its changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This is an outrageous waste of taxpayers' money and I am sure that the great majority of people who live in our district would agree that this money would be better spent on the construction of the Pakenham bypass. We know that, in the five years to the end of 2002, four people lost their lives and 66 people have been seriously injured on the Princes Highway through Pakenham.
 The government's own budget papers recognise the Princes Highway through Pakenham as Victoria's worst crash zone, yet the government continues to refuse to honour its promise and fund half of the cost of the project. The government should axe its wasteful promotional advertising about the changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and put the money towards the building of the bypass. We are all sick of the government's excuses in relation to the project. We want to see the bypass built, not more ads promoting the Howard government on telly. 
It is very interesting to consider the people who have been involved in the Howard government's so-called commitment to the Pakenham bypass. Let's list them. We know that one of the chief characters in the play was the member for La Trobe, Bob Charles. We know that one of the other chief characters in the play was the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson. We know that one of the other chief characters in the play was the Treasurer, Peter Costello. Let's have a look at these three fellows.
Bob Charles announced in the parliament yesterday that he will be standing down as the member for La Trobe and will not be recontesting at the next election. I wish Bob and his family well and wish him all the best in post-political life. But politics is all about accountability. When you are in government and make a promise to people and you do not honour that promise, they can vote you out at the next election. That is what government is all about. So Bob Charles, the Liberal member for La Trobe, will not be around to put himself forward at the next federal election for people to judge his performance and his effectiveness in terms of delivering on the promise that the Howard government made at the federal election.
Let us turn to the other two characters in this play. One is the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson. Every time I see him get up at question time to answer a question, I think about that old Clash song from the 1980s, `Should I stay or should I go? If I stay there will be trouble.' That is what I think about every time he gets up to answer a question. That is what goes through his mind every day of the week, and he has refused to give a commitment to the parliament and to the people in his electorate as to whether he will stay or go. So it is possible that he, as one of the other chief characters in this drama, will be around at the next election to be held to account for the promise that he made in relation to the Pakenham bypass. 
That brings me to the third chief character in this drama: the Treasurer, Peter Costello. Will he be around at the next federal election, or will he do a dirty big Liberal dummy spit and just get out of here and not recontest at the next election? It seems to me from his sullenness, from his attitude and carry-on about things, that he is probably only half-interested in staying on, unless he is made leader. They are the three main people involved in the Liberal Party promise to fund half the cost of the Pakenham bypass, and apparently there is a pretty strong likelihood that none of them is going to be around at the time of the next federal election to be held to account in relation to this promise.
If politics is not about accountability, what is it about? This is an important issue for the people who live in my electoral district; it is important because it affects families. We are talking about a road that carries the full force of the Princess Highway right through the guts of the township of Pakenham—about 30,000 cars every day. I know Pakenham pretty well; I am sure there are colleagues here from Victoria who know Pakenham pretty well too.
—Good racecourse.
—Exactly. The member for Canning, on the other side, makes a good point: Pakenham does have an excellent racecourse. That is one of the contributing reasons—not often quoted—for our need to have the Pakenham bypass: to have safer access for all of the people involved in the racing industry as they come in and out of Pakenham. So I am glad that the member has mentioned that point. As well as the racecourse, which is right next to the Princess Highway as it runs through Pakenham, we also have Pakenham aged care right on the Princess Highway, Pakenham secondary college, the Catholic primary school, the Pakenham consolidated school, a number of kindergartens and childcare centres and so it goes on. So diverting the Princess Highway as opposed to it going right through the guts of Pakenham will make a really big difference to road safety in the district.
Let me give just a few statistics, because that is how we tend to measure the importance of these priorities in terms of road funding. On that road in the five years to the end of 2002, four people were killed, 66 were seriously injured and, perhaps most breathtaking of all, 214 people sustained other injuries. This is why in the federal government's own budget papers the Pakenham bypass is listed as addressing Victoria's worst crash zone. 
We would like to see the Howard government honour its promise in relation to this road. We really want to see it prioritise this road above some of the other things which it seems to be focusing on at the moment. I was absolutely astonished the other day to see that the Howard government had forked out $26 million of taxpayers' money on an advertising campaign spruiking for the changes it is putting in place with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I do not think anyone in the community would begrudge a government spending a few dollars in trying to explain to people what is going on; I do not think anyone has a problem with that. But, fair dinkum, $26 million is a lot of kanga. That is a lot of the folding stuff, a lot of money. That $26 million could have been used as the additional amount of money which the Commonwealth needs to put in to match the promise that it made—to match its commitment to this project. 
The Commonwealth government promised to fund half of the cost of the Pakenham Bypass—$121 million. They have allocated $100 million in their budget. So I say to the government: `Why don't you leave $5 million in your Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme advertising budget'—leave $5 million there; I'm not telling you not to do anything about it—`take $21 million out of the $26 million, add it to the $100 million which you have said you are going to put in for Pakenham and let's just get the thing built.' People in our district are fed up with the obfuscation on this project. How many more people need to die on this road before the Howard government commits to this project? How many more people need to be injured and how many more people's lives need to be disrupted before we see some action from the government?
Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you are country member of parliament. Country members of parliament in this place understand, I think better than most people, just how important roads are to the communities that we represent. They are incredibly important for road safety and to ensure that people are able to access opportunities in the cities—opportunities not available to people living in country districts. The great majority of people who live in the Pakenham district commute to Melbourne every day for work. It takes them 50 minutes every day to get to work. If we are going to say that that is an okay thing to do and we in fact encourage them to do that and to take advantage of those opportunities, we have to make it as safe as we possibly can.
Increasingly, people from the Baw Baw Shire municipal area are commuting to work in Melbourne as well. I am sure you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, the day that you came to visit me in my constituency and we went up to the Tarago River Cheese Company in Neerim just north of Warragul. In that district, 14 per cent of the people in the Baw Baw Shire municipality who commute to Melbourne every day for work—and the number is growing daily—drive through Pakenham. We know that this figure will continue to grow, which will mean more pressure and more congestion for Pakenham. This will add substantially to the already clearly obvious traffic problems in Pakenham. If we are going to say that we want people to take advantage of these opportunities, we have to make sure that the road infrastructure is in place to support them. It is vitally important that when people drive to work they are not in an unsafe situation and are not putting others at risk. 
The Pakenham project is incredibly important for a lot of reasons. As this is a country area, we also face the important issue of being able to get a lot of the goods that we produce in the Latrobe Valley, and West Gippsland in particular, to market. We want to encourage people to focus more on world markets rather than on domestic markets. So we need to make it as easy as possible for them to get their products out to the wharf in order to ship them to the rest of the world. We have some very important industries in our district with very significant export potential: a number of export abattoirs, a timber industry which is increasingly focusing on value adding, and a number of innovative companies in the timber industry that are exporting to Japan and other places throughout the world.
We have the greatest brown coal deposits in the world in the Latrobe Valley and we have Morewell based Energy Brix Australia at their briquette factory producing a product which is in demand right across the world. The easier we can make it for these companies—these great innovators and these people with a bit of dash and courage—to get their product onto world markets, the more jobs we are going to create in local districts. It is as simple as that. We need good road infrastructure to be able to support that innovation. 
I notice that my colleague and friend the member for Burke has a book here by Robert Reich. He is a very important author for people to read. It is not in that book but in another of his books where he says that the chief task of government, more than anything else, is to focus on the education and training of its people and on the transport and communications infrastructure of its population. They are the two big things that he says should be the chief task of government.
What we are saying is very consistent with what Reich has been espousing now for some 10 years, which is that in a globalised marketplace you need to have good education and training for your people so they can think for themselves, take advantage of opportunities and be creative. But you also need to have good transport infrastructure and good communications infrastructure. In putting forward the Pakenham bypass as a project we are saying that it is important for the road safety of the people of the Pakenham district and for the people in that region more generally, but it is also important for making sure that people in our region have opportunities to enter world markets through being able to use a quality road network to get their product to those markets.
We are saying that the government should honour their promise in relation to the Pakenham bypass. It is of concern to us that the three people who are most closely associated with this decision may not be contesting the next election. The Treasurer may not be contesting the next election, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services may not be contesting the next election and we heard yesterday that the member for La Trobe, Bob Charles, will not be contesting the next election, to be held accountable for the promise that the Howard government made in the 2001 election, which they have not honoured.
This is a fundamental issue in any democracy—the principle of accountability—where you put yourself forward before the people and say, `Vote for me and I am going to do this.' If you do not do it, people have the ability to hold you accountable for that broken promise. I am worried that in these circumstances the three people most linked to this broken promise may not be recontesting the next federal election—and I want them to. I want them all to so the people in our district will have the opportunity to hold them accountable and let them know just how angry they are about this broken promise.
The issues of road transport and transport generally are important in a country the size of Australia, and we need to understand that they are particularly important for those people who live outside the capital cities. We see a lot of opportunity through the expansion and improvement of the road network in our district. We have just seen the great Bracks government achievement in Victoria with the opening of the Hallam bypass—a great project, delivered ahead of time by about 12 months or so and under budget—which has taken something like 10 or 15 minutes off the travel time to Melbourne from the Latrobe Valley.
When we build the Pakenham bypass—and we will build it; the Labor Party in government will build it—it will take a further 10 or 15 minutes off the transport time from the Latrobe Valley to Melbourne. So that brings Melbourne closer to us and us closer to Melbourne and provides opportunities for people to come and visit our district in larger numbers, which will support our tourism industry as well as provide opportunity for our district to be further developed as a commuter centre for people who are going back and forth to Melbourne, Dandenong or the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne for work. 
What we are saying to the government very clearly in our district is that we want the government to honour their promise on the Pakenham bypass. We think that they should not spend $26 million on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme advertising; we think they might be better advised to take $21 million out of that advertising budget, put it towards the Pakenham bypass and get the project built. That would still leave them $5 million to spruik, if they really have to, for their changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL TRANSPORT COMMISSION (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2003-08-14,"—It has been a characteristic of road transport regulation, and of transport regulation more generally, that there has been close cooperation between the Commonwealth, the territories and the states and a high level of bipartisan support for that regulatory reform agenda. So it is perhaps regrettable that the member for McMillan chose to devote the majority of his remarks to a characteristically partisan attack on some very able and important members of this government. I feel obligated to make some response to those remarks before turning to the substance of the bill.
The member for McMillan based about 75 per cent of his speech on a series of speculations about the possible future of various members of the government—with the exception of the member for La Trobe, whose passing away politically he described as an attempt to avoid accountability for promises made by his government. I merely note the fact that the member for La Trobe is someone who has won a marginal seat in the western suburbs of Melbourne at five successive elections. His representation has been such that the electorate is increasingly non-marginal. He, unlike so many of his colleagues on both sides, had the political wisdom to choose the moment of his departure—unlike, I suspect, members like the member for McMillan and perhaps myself, who are much more likely to hear of our demise from a television broadcaster on some future election eve. 
I merely note, in relation to the Pakenham bypass, that the member for McMillan did not, I think, utter a word about the accountability of the Victorian government or the Victorian minister for transport. I simply note that the Pakenham bypass is not a federal road, it is a state road. It is a Victorian government road. The Commonwealth government recognises the importance of the road to the constituents who surround it; so, as a gesture—purely a volitional gesture of national leadership and benevolence—it committed $30 million originally to prompt the lethargic Victorian government into action. That, of course, turned out not to be enough—$30 million was not enough of a sweetener for the Victorian government to respond to the needs of its constituents in an area of its core responsibility. The Commonwealth therefore stepped up and said, `Okay, lads and lasses, we will give you $100 million if you will just get off your lethargic posteriors and begin to construct this bypass. 
The complaint advanced by the member for McMillan is that $100 million is no longer exactly 50 per cent of the cost of construction. I note two things. Firstly, there is no constitutional or legislative requirement that RONIs should be 50 per cent of the cost of a road. The second point is that the reason that $100 million is no longer 50 per cent of the cost is because of the delays, the laches, of the Victorian minister for transport, who simply cannot muster the internal resolve to make a decision and give an instruction to start constructing the road. So can I suggest that $100 million of discretionary spending—which comes out of the tax paid by my constituents in Parramatta who are funding your government's road—is a pretty generous offer. My suggestion to you is: put a little bit of pressure on your state Labor colleagues to deliver, in Mr Reich's words, the fundamental core responsibilities of government, especially of state governments.  
To reflect for a moment on the record of governments in delivering their transport funding commitments, I note that I sat through the last state election in Victoria, the last state election nationally, where we went to the people and said, `We are going to fund the Scoresby bypass as a freeway. We are going to commit over $400 million of Commonwealth funding to that freeway.' We went forward, with Steve Bracks smiling that lovely smile before the cameras, shaking hands and putting out press releases about the Scoresby Freeway. It was not until after the Victorian government was re-elected that we suddenly found this was not to be a freeway, according to Steve Bracks.
Between the declaration of the polls and the resumption of parliament, something extraordinary and unexplained happened in the mind of the Premier. Suddenly this was not to be a freeway, as Steve had promised to the Commonwealth and to the Victorian and Australian people; it was to be a tollway. As a supporter of private enterprise and a defender of capitalism, I am not instinctively opposed to toll roads or tollways. Toll roads such as the M2 motorway have made an enormous, constructive difference to many of my constituents. I do object, however, to Premier Bracks promising to deliver a freeway and then, having won an election partially on the basis of that promise, turning it into a toll road.
We saw Premier Bob Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, do exactly the same thing. He pulled exactly the same stunt in relation to the M4 motorway in not the last election but the one before. I will come to the last election in a moment. Premier Carr went to the people with an explicit election promise to remove the tolls from the M4 motorway. All my constituents, who pour off James Ruse Drive in their hundreds and thousands onto the M4 motorway to head into Sydney, had a confident expectation that Labor was going to abolish the toll. But, sure enough, the election came and went, and there was an epiphany, an unexplained event that took place in the mind of the Premier and the state Labor ministers: `I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but it is simply too expensive.' So, today, the toll road remains.
We could, of course, look to the Carr government's record of delivering transport infrastructure in relation to the Parramatta to Chatswood rail link, which we have seen proudly heralded to the people of Western Sydney as an example of the Labor government's commitment to delivering core transport infrastructure—in Mr Reich's words, its `core responsibilities' as a government. We have seen this happen now over three elections. About six weeks before the election, bureaucrats from the Department of Transport came out with beautiful three-dimensional models of great looking new civic squares and transport interchanges and promised $1 billion of investment. It was not until just after the election that a new transport minister was appointed. We have seen Mr Costa, the troublesome police minister, shifted into the frame. He wandered in and said, `I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, about the 21 press releases we put out about the Parramatta to Chatswood rail link and all the promises about the forward funding for this core piece of infrastructure. There was a mistake in the calculations, so we cannot afford it and it has been put on ice.' If you want to talk about fulfilling commitments, I suggest the model that will instil confidence in the Australian people is the performance of the coalition at the federal level, while the model that will put the fear of God into any Australian who relies on core transport infrastructure is the performance of the state Labor governments in New South Wales and Victoria. 
I turn to the substance of the bill before the chamber. We are discussing the establishment of a national transport commission to replace the National Road Transport Commission. This move follows a review required by legislation of the operation of the National Road Transport Commission Act, which at the time of the review had been in force for about a decade. It was felt by the framers of that legislation that it ought to be reviewed at a certain point in its operation, and that review has subsequently taken place. The review recommended that it was time to take the next step forward in the evolution of road transport regulation, which was to integrate it more seamlessly and successfully with rail transport and with other intermodal connections. This is, I am pleased to say, a measure which enjoys wide bipartisan support. It is a measure that was developed with the consultation and consent of the Australian Transport Council, which is made up of the ministers of transport from the states, the territories and the Commonwealth and the major road user groups—in particular the trucking organisations which have carriage of so much of our freight movements.
The National Transport Commission is intended to ensure the regulation of the national road and rail systems so that they can communicate with each other more effectively. I would have thought that, of the many occasions on which members rise in this place to support propositions—often with some difficulty—this is one occasion on which they can rise to support it with some ease. Where you have a relatively small population spread across a vast continent governed by three levels of government, having been hewn out of the rock of a Federation, there is a very great risk that the various state, territory and Commonwealth jurisdictions may not communicate with each other effectively. So there is a need for standardisation across the various jurisdictions.
We have seen the minister for education recently talking about the importance of national standards in education so that a parent might be able to move with confidence from one state to another and be assured that his or her child would be achieving the same minimum levels of outcome in the education system. In the same way, we would like a road user to be able to travel perhaps from the far north of Queensland to Tasmania via ferry and be confident, for example, about the rules governing the road. One of the successful initiatives of the former National Road Transport Commission was to develop a national uniform set of road rules. Now we need to move that kind of initiative forward to include the rail network as well.
The member for McMillan was quite correct to applaud and uphold those who were prepared, in his words, to take a risk and to have a go. I am pleased to see the gradual conversion of the ALP to modern democratic capitalism. It has been a long time coming. I note that the member for McMillan instinctively quoted from a Clash song from the 1980s, which I think reflects the current state of evolution of Labor's philosophical position in relation to economic management. Nonetheless, he did uphold those who were prepared to take a risk and to have a go. We gather together to uphold today those who are creating goods that need to be moved by trucks and by trains and by ships and by planes. That brings into sharp relief the issue of the intermodal focus of the new National Transport Commission. `Intermodal' is simply a transport jargon word for the point at which different forms of transport connect and interface with each other, whether they be road, rail, maritime or aviation. All the research shows that it is the seamlessness and the speed at which those interactions—
 (Mr Mossfield)—Order! If the members on my left would like to have a conversation, they should go outside because it is difficult to speak over the top of the chatter. 
—Thank you for your characteristic courtesy, Mr Deputy Speaker. The seamlessness and the efficiency of those intermodal connections—for example, as a train comes to a stop at a port, the speed at which containers or bulk goods can be unloaded from that train and loaded onto a port—is one of the things that drives the efficiency of the national economy. In the same way, if we are moving containers off the back of trucks onto trains then the speed and safety of that connection is critically important. I was a member of the backbench transport committee along with the former Labor Minister for Transport, Peter Morris, who was described recently by Gough Whitlam as Australia's second best transport minister—certainly I always found him to be a person of wisdom and practical commonsense.
As members of that committee he and I went to the freight terminal at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. We listened to the problems of the exporters of high-value seafood who were seeking to export lobsters, oysters and other exotic produce. They told us that a palette of lobsters had sat on the tarmac in the midday sun at Sydney airport for 12 hours and been completely spoiled before it ever made it into the hold of an aircraft. We asked how that could possibly be in that the provedore would suffer enormous losses. We were told, `There are about five different unions that have to be negotiated with in order to get the produce to the hold of the aircraft. If any one of those unions decides not to play ball then the lobsters rot in the sun on the tarmac.' Many passenger aircraft were flying into Australia packed with people, goods and produce but almost all of them were flying out of Australia packed with people but no goods or produce. We need to enhance the quality, efficiency, predictability and affordability of those points of interchange.
While the National Transport Commission will not be focusing primarily—or even, I suspect, extensively—on the issue of public transport access, it is clear from all the research that, when we ask ourselves how we can reduce pollution by getting more people onto public transport in our major cities, one of the most critical issues is the quality of the interface between, for example, cars and trains or between buses and trains. Every time you introduce a new intermodal interface you tend to lose a cohort of passengers. Every extra minute that interchange takes is very costly to the patronage of the public transport system. The same can be said in the area of freight. So this is a fulfilment of the encouragement given by the member for McMillan that we should focus on our core responsibilities as a government—and transport is one of them. I entirely accept that proposition. What we are doing here is not revolutionary—it will not be reported on the front page of any newspaper tomorrow—but it is an important part of the work of this parliament.
I will conclude on the issue of coregulation. In the same way that the physical points of interchange between people moving freight in this country are critically important, the quality of the interface between the state, territory and Commonwealth government is also important. While the Commonwealth may not have an explicit power to command the obedience of other players on this issue of coregulation, we nonetheless have a leadership role to play, a catalytic role to play, in bringing together the states and territories to encourage the production of nationally consistent standards which would then be enacted by the states and territories on the strength of their own constitutional powers. So it is anticipated that the National Transport Council will produce model regulations for safety on these various modes of transport. The states and territories would not be compelled to adopt those model regulations; they may be at liberty to adopt some but not all of them according to their unique circumstances. So this is not a heavy-handed approach; it is the Commonwealth stepping forward to play our leadership role and saying, `We are going to produce what we regard as best practice in the regulation of safety or of some other aspect of the transport equation and we are going to encourage the states and territories, to the benefit of our shared constituents, to step up and join in the task of national best practice regulation in the transport sphere.' I commend the cognate bills to the House and I thank members for their participation in the debate.

"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2003-08-14,"— I am very pleased today to speak in the Main Committee on one of the wonderful sporting, social and cultural clubs in my electorate: the Balcatta Soccer Club. I am also delighted to inform the House that I was thrilled when they recently made me the No. 1 ticket holder. I think I am one of the few female No. 1 ticket holders anywhere in soccer in Australia, so I take that as a privilege. I want to tell you how wonderful the club are. Having signed up between 300 and 400 young people, they have decided that soccer is not just about sporting and competition but also about social life, connecting back to your local community and contributing to your community. The club have done amazing things in the last couple of years to develop that side of their life. They very much hold the ethos, which is now strong in soccer, that it is about participation and playing; it is not just about winning and competition. They want to move away from the side of soccer which concerns the community when they see disputes on and off the field between parents.
I commend the club on their excellent training program and coaching and their ability to train young people. They are now in the unique situation of having eight state representatives, which is truly amazing. I congratulate Lisa Tana, Sarah Cunningham, Jessine Bonzas, Helen Carrol and Debbie Gorton who were selected in the state senior team; Ashley Cane and Gemma Langley, who are part of the under-18 team, and Jessica Pilcher, who is in the school team. Domenica Carbone, in the under-15s, is also a state representative. This is a fantastic record for the club. Congratulations also to their under-6s, under-7s and under-8s who are champions of the Italian Festival Junior Carnival and the under-16a girls who won the state championships. Not only was it a great competition, it was a lot of fun and I commend them on the excellent social program they have had recently. They have monthly sausage sizzles—in June, they had a karaoke sausage sizzle night. In July, they had a family fun night at Rosetti's restaurant and a bingo night to raise funds for the senior girls to go to the state competition.
The most amazing thing this club has done is to start a youth dance called Xplosionz Under-18s Dance Party. It is an alcohol-free dance for 15- to18-year-olds and the club has set up a youth committee, which consists of 15 very enthusiastic young men and women aged between 16 and 22. This committee and the club are currently under the visionary leadership of the president, Pat Luca, and they have managed to have eight dances at the Ilinden Macedonian Hall in Balcatta. Their last dance was at a new venue, the Vasto Club Casa D'Abruzzo, also in Balcatta. These young people have done a wonderful thing and they must be meeting a need, because the dances are getting between 800 and 1,000 children at them. They are very well run and the parents are very happy with them, because there have been no incidences or untoward events.
I would like to commend the Mirrabooka police district and the City of Stirling rangers for their support of the dances and the local parents who give of their time as volunteers to make sure the dances are supervised properly and there is good behaviour as well as clean, alcohol-, smoke- and drug-free fun.
In particular, I would like to focus on the committee of the Balcatta Soccer Club, a wonderful group of people who stood back from the sports side and decided there needed to be more done for the Stirling community and have put all this work, effort, money and other resources into the club and its activities. They also think of others; from the Xplosionz dance last Friday night, $1,000 was given to a cancer foundation. They recently donated $700 to the Bali disaster appeal and $200 towards a trip for a girl that got into the state soccer team. They have also donated a table-tennis table for all to use at Balcatta Soccer Club. This is a wonderful club, they have wonderful initiatives, and we should all be very proud of them.
