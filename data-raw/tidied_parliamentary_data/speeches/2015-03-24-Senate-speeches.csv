Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION AND ACCESS) AMENDMENT (DATA RETENTION) BILL


The Bill contains a package of reforms to prevent the further degradation of the investigative capabilities of Australia's law enforcement and national security agencies. The Bill will require companies providing telecommunications services in Australia, carriers and internet service providers to keep a limited, prescribed set of telecommunications data for two years. The Bill amends the Telecommunications Interception and Access Act 1979 (Interception Act), and the Telecommunications Act1997 (Telecommunications Act).


Modern communication technologies have revolutionised the abilities of people to communicate, collaborate and express themselves. Sadly, however, these same technologies are routinely misused and exploited by criminals, including those who threaten our national security. 


Historically, telephone companies have kept call records showing the numbers of both the A and B parties, time of call, duration of call and often the location of the parties. These records have been kept for long periods and were used for billing purposes. Under existing and long-standing legislation, a range of law enforcement and other agencies have had the ability to access this information without a warrant. 


The type of data referred to in the Bill as telecommunications data, more often described as metadata, is information about a communication but not its content. So, in the telephone world, it reveals that one number belonging to a particular account was connected to another number at a time and for a duration, but does not reveal what they discussed. In the IP world it reveals that a particular IP address, which may have been observed to have been engaged in some unlawful activity, had been at the relevant time allocated to a particular account. In the context of messaging—email, for example—it reveals the sender, recipient, time and date, but again not the content.  Access to the content of communications requires a warrant.


Access to metadata plays a central role in almost every counterterrorism, counterespionage, cybersecurity and organised crime investigation. It is also used in almost all serious criminal investigations, including investigations into murder, serious sexual assaults, drug trafficking and kidnapping. The use of this kind of metadata, therefore, is not new. 


However, as the business models of service providers are changing with technology they are keeping fewer records. And they are keeping those records for shorter periods of time because they do not need them any longer, in many cases, for billing. Many of the records that are still kept are kept because of legacy systems put in place years ago. In June 2013, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security concluded that this diminution in the retention of metadata is harming law enforcement and national security capabilities, and that these changes are accelerating.


Existing powers and laws are not adequate to respond to this challenge. Preservation notices under the Interception Act can require carriers to 'quick freeze' records that they hold, but these notices cannot create records that have never been kept, and cannot bring back records that carriers have deleted days, weeks or months before a crime is brought to an agency's attention.


Simply put, because of businesses' changing practices investigations are failing.


For example, in a current major child exploitation investigation, the AFP has been unable to identify 156 out of 463 potential suspects, because certain internet service providers do not retain the necessary IP address allocation records to enable the resolution of the IP address to the particular account number the person in question was using. These records are critical to link criminal activity online back to a real world suspect.


These impacts are not limited to law enforcement agencies in Australia. During a recent Europol child exploitation investigation, child exploitation investigations relied heavily on access to telecommunications data as perpetrators primarily shared information online, meaning that physical evidence was rarely available. Three hundred and seventy-one suspects were believed to be in the United Kingdom. Using retained telecommunications data, UK authorities were able to positively identify 240 suspects, leading to 121 arrests and convictions. In contrast, of the 377 suspects believed to be in Germany, which does not have a data retention regime in force, German authorities were only able to identify seven and were unable to obtain sufficient evidence to arrest or convict a single person.


I can also give a clear example of how a simple business decision can undermine the national interest.  In 2013, a major Australian ISP reduced the period for which it keeps IP address allocation records from many years to three months. In the 12 months prior to that decision, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) obtained these records in relation to at least 10 national security investigations, including counter-terrorism and cybersecurity investigations. If those investigations took place today, vital intelligence and evidence would simply not exist.


No responsible government can sit by while those who protect our community lose access to the tools they need to do the job. In the current threat environment in particular, we cannot let this problem get worse.




Data retention



As such, this Bill will allow regulations to prescribe a consistent, minimum set of records that service providers who provide services in Australia must keep for two years.


A two-year retention period is based on the advice of our law enforcement and security agencies, as well as the experience of a number of foreign jurisdictions. While many cases are solved within a few months, investigations into serious and complex crimes and threats to security often span many years, requiring access to older records.


The Government recognises that data retention raises genuine concerns about privacy. We are committed to addressing those concerns.


The dataset that has been endorsed by the PJCIS, and inserted into the bill as recommended by that Committee, is strictly limited. For example: 


1. service providers will not be required to retain the content or substance of any communication, including subject lines of emails or posts on social media sites


2. the Act will expressly exclude a person's web-browsing history, and


3. providers will not be required to keep detailed location records that could allow a person's movements to be tracked, akin to a surveillance device.


There has also been a great deal of conjecture about how much data retention may cost.  I can advise the Senate that the cost, both up front and ongoing, of data retention in its first ten years will average out to $73 million per year.  This is a remarkably small impost on an industry that generates over $42 billion in revenue each year.  It is in fact well under 0.1% of the industry's revenue.


That low cost must be measured against the immeasurable benefit to the victims of crime who will be much better protected by our agencies than without data retention. 


As has been previously stated, the government is committed to ongoing, good faith consultation with industry and will make a substantial contribution to the cost of implementing  the scheme. In terms of the ongoing costs, it is important to recognise that providers will be able to recover from law enforcement and security agencies the financial cost incurred in providing requested data. Those ongoing costs will be recoverable on a no-profit/no-loss basis.  These cost recovery arrangements already apply to agency requests for telecommunications data collected by industry for its own purposes. This practice will not change.


I can say that, to date, our consultation with industry has been very productive. For example, based on industry advice, the Bill allows individual service providers to develop an implementation plan that provides a pathway to compliance over up to 18 months. These plans will allow industry and government to prioritise the retention of data that is most critical to investigations, while allowing service providers to significantly reduce their implementation costs by aligning any systems changes with their internal business cycles.




The PJCIS Report into the Bill



I draw to the Senate's attention the concluding remarks of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in its inquiry into this Bill:


Through the process of this inquiry, the Committee has considered the current utility of telecommunications data to law enforcement and national security investigations. The Committee has noted the inconsistency and degradation of current retained telecommunications data, possible future reductions in retained data and the serious impact this may have on national security and public safety. 


Accordingly, the Committee considered carefully the rationale for a mandatory data retention scheme, and has concluded that such a regime is justified as a necessary, effective and proportionate response. The Committee therefore supports the intention of the Bill. 


The Committee's support is subject to thirty-eight recommendations.  Twenty-six of these recommendations relate to amendments to the Bill or Explanatory Memorandum.  


A further eleven recommendations relate to additional administrative measures (including additional resourcing for the Committee and Commonwealth Ombudsman), reviews, and further reform (including telecommunications sector security reform and data breach notification). 


The PJCIS also recommended that the proposed two-year retention period be maintained. 


The Government supports all of the recommendations to amend the Bill and so moved amendments to implement them.  The other place has passed the Bill with those amendments.




Access arrangements



This Bill does not provide agencies with new powers to access communications data; the Bill simply ensures that data will continue to be available to agencies as a part of legitimate investigations, subject to strict limits that currently apply and additional safeguards.


In fact, the Bill will  significantly reduce the range of enforcement agencies permitted to access telecommunications metadata without a warrant.


The Bill will allow what we might call 'traditional' law enforcement agencies, such as the police, Customs, crime commissions and anticorruption bodies, to access this information.


The Bill will also grant the Attorney-General the power to temporarily declare, via legislative instrument subject to parliamentary oversight, additional agencies. Before making such a declaration, the Attorney-General of the day will be required to consider a range of strict criteria, including whether the agency is subject to a binding privacy scheme.  Any permanent additions to the list of agencies with these powers will require an Act of Parliament.




Safeguards



The Bill will introduce a range of new and enhanced safeguards. In particular, it:


introduces, for the first time, independent and comprehensive oversight of agencies' access to telecommunications data 


requires the PJCIS to begin a review of the effectiveness of the scheme no more than two years after the end of its implementation phase, and


requires the Attorney-General to report annually on the operation of the scheme.


The Government has also committed to reforms to strengthen the security and integrity of Australia's telecommunication infrastructure by establishing a security framework for the telecommunications sector. This will provide better protection for information held by industry in accordance with the data retention scheme. 




Concluding remarks



This Bill is critical to prevent the capabilities of Australia's law enforcement and national security agencies being further degraded. It does not expand the range of telecommunications metadata which is currently being accessed by law enforcement agencies. It simply ensures that metadata is retained for a period of two years. 


More broadly, this Bill demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring that access to sensitive and personal information by these agencies is strictly controlled through robust accountability processes.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-03-24,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (12:32):  The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014 is a complex and controversial piece of legislation. Regrettably, the Abbott government has done an exceptionally poor job of explaining why these laws are necessary and how they will work. The government announced its intention to introduce this legislation in the middle of last year. The political agenda at that time was dominated by the Australian people's violent reaction to the Abbott government's unfair budget, and the Prime Minister and his colleagues were in a state of panic. It was in this chaotic and dysfunctional environment that the government foisted the data retention bill on the Australian people.


There is one particular element of this botched sales job that it would be remiss of me to fail to mention. I am talking about Senator Brandis's shambolic attempt to explain the terms 'metadata' and 'internet browsing' in his humiliating interview with David Speers on Sky TV in August of last year. I congratulate David Speers on winning a Walkley award for that interview. While the interview may have been an outstanding achievement in terms of journalism, it was not the high-water mark of public policy. Senator Brandis's performance was emblematic of the government's failure to persuade the Australian people of the importance of data retention.



Senator Ludlam interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I do not mention the government's failings or Senator Brandis's embarrassing blunders gratuitously, as much as Senator Ludlam might like. I do so to illustrate how the Abbott government has failed to take the Australian people with it and win their support for the data retention bill.


This parliament has no greater duty than keeping Australia safe from the threats of crime and terrorism. Maintaining public confidence in our national security and law enforcement agencies is an essential element of this duty. It is incumbent upon the government to reassure the Australian people that national security and law enforcement concerns are being appropriately balanced with the importance of upholding fundamental democratic freedoms. The government must satisfy the people that additional power is not conferred on our security and law enforcement agencies unless it is necessary to do so and only where matched with robust oversight and accountability mechanisms.


The Australian people must be satisfied that in seeking to defend ourselves from crime and terrorism we do not trample upon the very rights and freedoms that characterise Australia as a free and open democracy. The Abbott government has failed this test. This failure has left the Australian people vulnerable to a scare campaign about data retention. Senator Ludlam, interjecting earlier, and the Greens Party have exploited this vulnerability ruthlessly. They have deliberately and irresponsibly misrepresented the facts for their own cynical political purposes. The Labor Party has found itself stuck between a rock and a hard place on this legislation: stuck between the failure of the government to take the people with it on the one hand and a hysterical campaign of misinformation by Senator Ludlam and the Greens Party on the other. Remember the YouTube interview, everyone? This is an invidious position. Nobody in the Labor Party is happy about once again being forced to rescue this government from its own incompetence.



Honourable senators:  Oh!




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  And listen to the shrieks down at the end of the chamber. But, as the alternative government, unlike you, it is incumbent upon us, the Labor Party, to take a responsible, bipartisan approach to national security and law enforcement. We in the Labor Party believe that our law enforcement and national security agencies should have the power they need to protect Australians from the threats of crime and terrorism. However, we also believe in the importance of protecting the fundamental freedoms that define Australia as a democratic nation. It is critical that we get the balance right between keeping people safe and protecting the liberties we hold so dear.


The incompetence of the government and the hysteria of the Greens party have made it very difficult to have an open and honest conversation about data retention with the Australian people. Let me take this opportunity, though, to put some facts on the table. I have been astounded by the number of people who have responded to me in the last few days as we have been able to clearly elucidate these facts, so let me do so again. First fact: private companies have been retaining very large volumes of metadata in largely unregulated ways for many years. This data has been accessed by many dozens of federal and state and territory government agencies hundreds of thousands of times each year—with, in my view, insufficient safeguards to protect personal privacy. This is the status quo. This would be the consequence of no change.


Second fact: this legislation simply governs access to metadata, not content data. This is an important distinction to make. Metadata is data about a communication, not the content of that communication. Access to data under this scheme will allow an agency to determine the time a telephone call was made, the number dialled and the duration of the call, but it will not allow the agency to listen to the telephone call. It will allow access to the date and time an SMS message was sent and the number it was sent to, but it will not allow the agency to read the content of that message. It will allow access to the date and time an email was sent, but reading the content of that email will not be permitted. Importantly, access to a person's internet-browsing will not be permitted, despite the confusion caused—or perhaps it was a backflip subsequently—by Senator Brandis's remarks during his now infamous interview on Sky. Agencies wishing to access content data will still need a warrant, which must generally be sought from a judge subject to the usual oversight and accountability mechanisms.


Labor approached parliamentary consideration of the data retention bill as an opportunity to regulate and improve the use of metadata for law enforcement and counterterrorism purposes, while at the same time introducing safeguards that will greatly improve the transparency and accountability of storage and access to that data. Another fact: access to metadata is a legitimate tool used by security and law enforcement agencies and it plays a vital role in preventing, investigating and prosecuting crime, including terrorism. It is not some grand conspiracy—and those who say it has no role simply have it wrong. The joint parliamentary committee received evidence of 21 cases in which access to metadata was critical to the investigation, prevention and prosecution of serious wrongdoing.


Technological change and changing business practices of telecommunication providers means that less data will be retained by some companies in the future. This is the problem for law enforcement agencies. There is a significant risk that this will hamper the important work of security and law enforcement agencies and lessen their ability to keep Australians safe. It would be irresponsible for the Labor Party as the alternative government to pretend that these risks do not exist.


The bill was introduced into parliament by Malcolm Turnbull before Christmas last year and it was nowhere near good enough. The safeguards were inadequate and the detail was vague. This is why Labor insisted that it be sent to the joint parliamentary committee for proper scrutiny and to allow the public to have their say. The Labor members of the joint parliamentary committee listened very carefully and forced the Abbott government to accept 74 amendments to improve this bill, to better balance the importance of upholding fundamental democratic freedoms with national security and law enforcement concerns. And remember: the status quo is not good enough in terms of upholding fundamental democratic freedoms. As I previously mentioned, we have been particularly focused on oversight and accountability mechanisms. We believe these improved safeguards are essential to protecting the privacy of Australians and to giving the community confidence that personal data collected under the scheme will not be compromised or misused in the future.


Labor strongly believe that freedom of the press is one of the most fundamental elements of our democracy, and we will always fight to protect it. Labor forced the Abbott government to implement a regime whereby it will be illegal for agencies to access metadata for the purpose of identifying a journalist's source unless they first obtain a warrant, generally from a court. There will be a statutory presumption against issuing the warrant and agencies will be required to prove that the public interest in obtaining the metadata outweighs the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of a journalist's source, which is central to the freedom of the press. A public interest advocate will be appointed to stand in the shoes of the journalist and argue against the issuing of the warrant.


These changes will mean much stronger protections for journalists and their sources, certainly much stronger than what Malcolm Turnbull originally proposed. It has been very frustrating that it has taken so long for the Liberal Party to agree to support better protections for journalists. It is even more frustrating that the government still refuses to acknowledge that the stronger protection secured by Labor needed to occur. It took Bill Shorten writing to the Prime Minister insisting on defending the freedom of the press to force the government to back down in this area. I am told that the Prime Minister still does not see what the fuss is about. Nobody was worried about metadata when he was a journalist back in the early eighties, we heard. Somebody might like to tell the Prime Minister about the advent of the internet and mobile phones.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Metadata was kept by telcos for decades.



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my right.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I will come to that point. We do need to better regulate this area. The old envelope versus content distinction does not encapsulate the intrusion involved in accessing metadata today. We can trace people's locations with these things now, Senator O'Sullivan, and you should understand that better.


The data retention bill will limit access to metadata to a much smaller number of core law enforcement and national security agencies. Corporate and competition regulators will retain access to metadata to help them crack down on serious white-collar crime and other wrongdoing. But it is also important to point out that security and law enforcement agencies will use metadata in a targeted fashion to investigate specific subjects. It will not be part of some mass surveillance dragnet that is being suggested by some.


Labor members of the joint parliamentary committee insisted that the authorisation requirements for access to metadata be tightened. Before approving access, the authorising officer must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that any interference with the privacy of persons that may result from the access is justifiable and proportionate. In making this decision, the authorised officer should be required to have regard to: the gravity of the conduct being investigated, including whether the investigation relates to a serious criminal offence, the enforcement of a serious pecuniary penalty, the protection of the public revenue at a sufficiently serious level or the location of missing persons; the reason why the disclosure is proposed to be authorised; and the likely relevance and usefulness of the information or the documents to the investigation.


The data retention bill will also significantly strengthen the Ombudsman's powers to supervise access to information under the TIA Act. The Ombudsman will be empowered to comprehensively assess agency compliance with all of its obligations under the TIA Act, including the use of and access to metadata. Oversight of this category of data would also extend to auditing the use of and access to data retained as a result of the data retention obligation. This is a significant win for oversight and accountability. There is currently no independent oversight of the use of and access to metadata. Neither the TIA Act nor the predecessor arrangements in the Telecommunications Act included an independent oversight arrangement in relation to metadata. Labor has insisted that the Ombudsman be given additional resources to fulfil this important role.


Labor has been consistent in our belief that we must strike the right balance between keeping people safe and protecting the rights and liberties we value as Australians. Parliament has no greater responsibility, and it is essential that we take a mature and bipartisan approach to these issues. I am confident that the hard fought improvements won by the Labor Party achieve the right balance. As I have already said, Labor has pushed for comprehensive amendments to this bill. But there also remains some unfinished business.


Labor remains concerned about whether companies should be obliged to store retained data in Australia. Former Director-General of ASIO, David Irvine, said at a recent Defence and National Security round table that he would be concerned about the security of retained data if it was stored overseas because it would be:


… governed by someone else's sovereign legislative system.


This matter is currently being examined as part of the Telecommunications Sector Security Reform—TSSR—a process commenced by Labor while in government and which the Abbott government has stated will be completed well before the end of the data retention scheme implementation period. When completed, any TSSR legislation will come before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Consistent with the comments of the former head of ASIO, during the review of any TSSR legislation Labor will insist on a requirement that retained telecommunications data be stored onshore, an extra protection needed for people even today under the status quo.


There also remains unfinished business relating to the oversight of the entire architecture of Australia's national security agencies. My former colleague Senator John Faulkner, who retired from the parliament in February this year, was a fierce advocate of this cause. No one should doubt that Senator Faulkner believed that Australia is served by professional and well-run intelligence and security agencies. But Senator Faulkner also argued that effective safeguards against the abuse of security powers cannot depend and should not depend on the personal integrity and quality of the leaders of our agencies. If we are to have full confidence in our security agencies, we must have a suitable level of transparency built around them. It was Senator Faulkner's view that it is the parliament to which those agencies are accountable, and it is the parliament's responsibility to oversee their priorities and effectiveness, and to ensure agencies meet the requirements and the standards parliament sets. I agree.


Senator Faulkner developed a set of reforms designed to ensure that the effectiveness of parliamentary oversight of intelligence and security agencies keeps pace with any enhanced powers given to the agencies. One key reform was for the intelligence committee to have oversight of some operational matters of the security agencies. Progress towards that reform is evident in some ways in this bill, which Labor pressed be amended so that the committee could oversight the data retention scheme. But there is more to be done. 


So Labor will bring forward legislation this year to give effect to the reforms proposed by Senator Faulkner to build better oversight of the whole national security framework. It is in this context that the bill was first presented. The bill now, as heavily amended, sits— (Time expired)

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-24,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:53):  I am here today on behalf of the Australian Greens to oppose this bill in the strongest possible terms. In the course of the debate over the next few days, we will spend a lot of time considering elements of the bill in detail: its impact on journalists, the unknown costs, the inevitable mass breaches of privacy that will follow and the technicalities of how the bill will actually work. But, before we disappear into the weeds and the technical detail, I want to state plainly why I believe that this bill is unamendable and why it should be rejected.


This legislation, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014, betrays a mindset that inverts the power relationship between the state and the individual. It provides for the mass collection of private information of 23 million people who are neither suspected nor accused of having committed a crime. It entrenches the ability of dozens of government agencies to access these private records hundreds of thousands of times a year without a warrant and it normalises the fiction that this information is nothing more than billing records or the envelope that surrounds substantive communications.


Over a period of many decades, democracy has evolved, developing ways to protect citizens from the power of the state. These are some of the foundation principles of liberalism, from which the hollowed-out entity that proposed this bill takes its name. One of these points of balance is the judicial warrant: if the state wants to violate your privacy, there needs to be a good reason. These reasons include corruption; serious organised or violent crime; crimes against children; or genuine national security threats, including terrorism. In Australia, around 4,700 such warrants are issued every year, and, in a country of 23 million people, that does not seem like an undue amount. The police surveillance scandal in New South Wales has exposed the fact that even these judicial checks and balances sometimes fail, but it is a system which has worked tolerably well for the most part.


The act that we are amending today was written in 1979, under the prime ministership of the recently passed Malcolm Fraser. Mobile phones only existed in Star Trek. The internet was unthinkable for all but a handful of researchers and futurists. Fast-forward to 2015: there are more mobile phones than people in this country and the internet is busily infusing nearly every corner of our lives. Every one of these devices, seen and unseen, generates a cloud of information in the course of its ordinary operation. One single tweet 140 characters long is the tip of a small iceberg of code that runs to about a page and a half. Your phone handset is essentially a tracking device that allows you to make phone calls. Our relationships and our social lives are increasingly mediated by digital tools. Collectively, these devices and apps silently generate billions of records of place, time, contact, data type and volume, all of it aggregated under this loose concept of 'metadata'. Anyone who tells you that these are simple billing records or the innocent envelopes surrounding substantive communications is either technically illiterate or lying to your face.


In 2012-2013, agencies made around 340,000 demands for this information from Telstra, Optus and the rest of the telecommunications industry, without the trouble of having to apply for a single warrant. Now, I do not have more recent numbers than that because the Attorney-General's Department is refusing to publish the report for the last financial year. Telecommunications regulator the ACMA reports 748,000 warrantless authorisations were received by carriers in 2013-14. Why do agencies do this? Here is NSA contractor Edward Snowden:


… metadata is extraordinarily intrusive. As an analyst, I'd prefer to be looking at metadata rather than content because it's quicker and it's easier and it doesn't lie.


Former General Counsel of the NSA, Stewart Baker, said:


If you have enough metadata, you don't really need content. 


And, just in case we were not completely clear, consider former CIA Director Michael Hayden's memorable boast of last May:


We kill people based on metadata …


This is a bill to entrench a system of passive mass surveillance. It is corrosive of the very freedoms that governments are elected to protect and it has no place in a democracy. Yet it is a democratically elected parliament that is probably about to enact it, and nothing I say in here this afternoon is likely to change the minds or the votes of the senators from the Liberal, National or Labor parties, who will file in here later this week and vote the way they have been told to vote. Many of them strongly disagree with the bill, and a small handful have spoken out; and a few—we will pay attention to who—will no doubt be absent when the vote is finally taken.


The Liberal Party: if you go to their website, under 'About' and then 'Our Beliefs'—I wonder when was the last time you checked this out, Senator Fifield—here is what it says: 




We Believe: 



In the inalienable rights and freedoms of all peoples; and we work towards a lean government that minimises interference in our daily lives; and maximises individual and private sector initiative 


That is why you have imposed a $400 million surveillance tax on the whole country! Well done!


The Labor Party: how apt that this week we are debating the return of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Presumably you are aware that this entity, which treated the blues as though they were something worse than terrorists, was doing warrantless metadata surveillance of trade union organisers in its previous incarnation—somewhere between a dozen and 30 warrantless requests per year until we closed it down. I am sure that those union members had nothing to hide and they therefore had nothing to fear from the ABCC.


And so it falls to the Greens and the crossbench to stand up and provide the opposition that this reckless and vicious government so desperately deserves. In this, we represent views that are entirely mainstream. Guess who described metadata retention as a 'sweeping and intrusive new power' when the Labor Party was toying with the idea in 2012?




Senator DI NATALE:
  Was it Malcolm?




Senator LUDLAM:
  Senator Di Natale has it in one. Who said the following? 


Leaving aside the central issue of the right to privacy, there are formidable practical objections. The carriers, including Telstra, have argued that the cost of complying with the new data retention regime would be very considerable with the consequence of higher charges for their customers. 


Yes, that was the Liberal member for Wentworth, Mr Turnbull, basically demolishing the case for this proposal—probably more eloquently than I am today. Who said: 'I think that this proposal is akin to tactics that we would have seen utilised by the Gestapo'? Well, that was the Liberal member for Moncrieff, Mr Steve Ciobo. When Labor does it, it reminds him of the Nazi secret state police; when Prime Minister Abbott and Senator George Brandis pick it up, it is just to keep us all safe and there is nothing to see here. The President of the Law Council of Australia, Mr Duncan McConnell, was a little less strident but still believed the following:


They propose that the bill be withdrawn, amended and released as exposure draft legislation for public consultation.


He goes on to explain why: because of 'concerns about the proportionality of the data retention regime, security of the retained data and the impact on privacy and confidential communications.' That is the Law Council. The CEO of the Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance, Paul Murphy, put it this way:


Any system with the capacity to go after confidential sources has a chilling effect on journalism because it targets whistleblowers who seek to expose wrongdoing, illegality, dishonesty, fraud, waste and corruption. If you are going after sources, then you are going after journalism.


This government appears to be enjoying something of a habit of going after journalists to find out who they are talking to when they print unpopular stories about things like the horrors of the prison camps that we maintain on Pacific islands. Nobody on that side of the chamber appears willing to make eye contact at the moment.


Do not say you were not warned: industry has been raising the flag, and so has the former Director-General of ASIO, Mr David Irvine. Telstra's chief information security officer, Mike Burgess, put it this way:


If [you were] that way inclined as a hacker, you would go for that system because it would give you the pot of gold, as opposed to working your way through our multitude of systems today to try and extract some data.


Of course, this $300 million or $400 million surveillance tax is going to build new data centres to store all this excess material that industry has not had to store before. But it is not just that, and I am not sure that it is well understood. It is about the systems that would allow the telcos on demand to very rapidly withdraw the material from their servers and provide it to these agencies on the basis of the rubber-stamped request, which means matching names and address types across all the various systems. It creates a huge new pool that will be entirely attractive for people with malicious intent. Do not say that you were not warned.


In the end it will be the Greens and the independent crossbenchers who provide the opposition—just as it was in the House of Representatives when this was committed to a vote last week—but anyone who can count understands that there will not be enough of us. We have seen this before—most vividly last year when the Australian government criminalised national security reporting. When Prime Minister Abbott wraps himself in the flag—no matter how much an object of desperate ridicule he has become—that is the signal for the Australian Labor Party to say something earnest about finding the balance and then to cave in. Those two words, 'national security', are all it takes for the Australian Labor Party to flop into defeated bipartisanship because they are terrified the Daily Telegraph will say mean things about them. 


If the bill passes, we know this will be just the beginning. It has scope creep written into its DNA. The Attorney-General can add new categories of data and new agencies to the list of people who can look through your stuff any time he likes. They propose that parliament should to ratify the Attorney-General's decision within 40 sitting days. Depending on the time of year, 40 days could be anything up to six months; and parliament will be expected to rubber-stamp the decision that the Attorney-General makes. The Victorian police wanted five years. There is no secret among some of the agencies pushing for this proposal that two years was the minimum, even though that is the maximum that has been applied anywhere else in the world. They will be pushing for five years, next time something awful happens somewhere in the world; then they will be pushing for it not to be deleted at all, because it has proven to be so valuable. Then they will be pushing for web traffic and session logs. Scope creep only operates one way: once you legislate this kind of system, it is immensely difficult to claw it back. 


The saddest thing about this policy debacle is that nobody can provide any evidence that it will reduce crime or make people safer. There are any number of anecdotes about the importance of metadata for investigations—I understand that it is used in slightly less than 100 per cent of investigations. I understand that it is valuable and I have no reason to believe that the anecdotes that are flipped out by people pursuing this policy are untrue. But where is the evidence that blanket surveillance of millions of innocent people helps reduce crime? In Europe, where a data retention regime was briefly implemented before being thrown out by the European Court of Justice as an abuse of human rights, the evidence is crystal clear in its absence—data retention had no impact whatsoever. President Obama's high-level panel on the NSA's surveillance abuses came to the same conclusion: targeted surveillance of criminal suspects and networks helps prevent and solve crime; mass surveillance of millions of innocent people does not. What an immense surprise that must be to all of us.


When I asked Senator Brandis last week in question time to provide evidence of how indiscriminate collection of the private phone and internet records of millions of innocent people helps make the country safer, instead of evidence, he referred me to an ASIO press conference—simply because ASIO says so, because they want it. Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Mr Tehan, has done much the same thing on many occasions. Of course, clandestine agencies and police authorities want more power. It is the job of the Attorney-General to keep them in check. If the Attorney-General ends up being too compliant to uphold this responsibility, then it falls to parliament. The Abbott-Shorten mass surveillance unity ticket sets this parliament up to fail. Instead we fall back on the dismal logic of 'nothing to hide, nothing to fear'. That is the logic of the police state: if you have done nothing wrong, then the police have no need to go through your stuff. Can anyone in here recall a bill passing where the government and opposition did not know to within the nearest $100 million how much it would cost? Last week an extraordinary letter was signed by the CEOs of the nation's major telecommunications providers, and I seek leave to table that letter now. It was circulated earlier with the consent of the whips.


Leave granted.




Senator LUDLAM:
  This is a letter that has been signed by the nation's telecommunications providers—from Telstra, Optus, Vodafone Hutchison, the M2 group, iiNet, Macquarie Telecom and a whole page of others—demanding to know who is going to pick up the tab for the 300 to 400 million dollars surveillance tax that the Liberal Party and the Labor Party are introducing today. They say in part:


We note that the Government has variously indicated it will make a ""reasonable"" or ""substantial"" contribution to these costs—


that is, out of taxpayers' money—


which might exceed $300 million—


but they do not know; they are guessing; they are as much in the dark as the rest of us—


according to estimates provided by the consultants commissioned by the Government. 


They have seen that document; this parliament has not, and neither has anybody in the public, because the government refuses to table it. The letter continues:


Our request to you is, we believe, relatively simple and reasonable.


It is that the Government provide to industry, the Parliament and the wider community a degree of certainty as to the size of the Government's planned contribution—


and how they plan on cutting up these funds. This is going to drive some of the smaller telecommunications carriers in this country to the wall. Telstra is not wild about this proposal, but it will be able to adapt and upgrade its systems—and it has said as much—which are very large and complex. But, of course, Telstra has pretty deep pockets and it is going to be able to accommodate a proposal such as this. What about the smaller providers, who are suddenly being forced to participate in the building of new data centres to help host this stuff or to farm it offshore to cloud providers who knows where?—maybe China. Best of luck hanging on to that material once it has left this country.


Having tabled that letter, I would also like to move my second reading amendment. The amendment adjourns the debate until after the matters raised in the letter by the CEOs have been resolved. I move:


At the end of the motion, add :


and, noting concerns about a lack of clarification from the Government about costs associated with this bill as strongly addressed in a letter to the Government signed by the chief executives of Telstra, Optus, Vodafone, iiNet and a number of other major telecommunications companies, further consideration of the bill should be made an order of the day for the day after the Government tables its response to the industry's concerns on cost.


On the understanding that the Abbott-Shorten surveillance unity ticket will override the better judgement of individual senators, who I know hold their own private misgivings about this bill, what happens next?


My words today are essentially for those outside the building, because, as it happens, there is plenty we can do: when the parliament fails in its fundamental job of constraining executive power, we can take our power back as citizens, as Australians, in many other ways. I want to thank everyone who called their Labour senators or who melted opposition leader Bill Shorten's phone over the last couple of weeks and everyone who hit up the Labor Party on social media. The injured tone of Senator Collins in introducing her remarks was readily apparent—I almost felt sorry for her. Forgive us for not expressing our gratitude to the Labor Party for caving in to Prime Minister Tony Abbott. It was very apparent from Senator Collins's tone that it has only just sunk in that the very medium that you are compromising with mandatory data retention is the same medium that you need to sell the rest of your agenda—and you wonder why people are not listening to you and why they are so angry.


It is entirely lawful—in fact, it is built into the bill—to circumvent mandatory data retention just by using overseas providers. If you do not want your email records kept under mandatory data retention, go with an overseas provider like Gmail or Yahoo! or Hotmail, if that is still around. Use Facebook Messenger. Use Twitter direct mail. I am not advocating that, of course, because that is extremely bad news for Australian telecommunications providers—that effectively the government is incentivising people to use offshore services. Well played; very, very smart; nicely supportive of Australian industry there! The government have had to do that, because of course there is no way of compelling overseas providers to hand over their records to an Australian data retention scheme. So, if you do not want your email records kept by this scheme, use Gmail or Hushmail or an overseas email provider. That is entirely legal. Any over-the-top service provider circumvents this bill: bravo, and well played!


Encryption is not illegal.  The United States went through a very damaging variant of this debate in the 1990s during the so-called crypto wars, which fundamentally established that everything from the global financial system to global diplomacy, business and global civil society actually depends on strong encryption, depends on privacy. That was a lesson that was only learned at some cost. Encryption is not illegal. Private-key cryptography—including the very phone apps that Mr Turnbull is using to orchestrate his takeover of the Prime Minister's office—keeps no metadata. These systems keep no metadata; they leave no trace. They will be completely beyond the reach of this data retention scheme—as Mr Turnbull, who introduced this bill, so helpfully explained a couple of weeks ago. Free services like TOR, the onion router, which allow you to use the internet anonymously, completely defeat the purpose of a mandatory data retention scheme—and everybody knows this. Virtual private networks, available at a very reasonable subscription rate, make it impossible to tell where in the world who are when you are using the internet—also not illegal. Anonymity is not illegal, circumvention is not illegal and cryptography is not illegal. 


So what I am proposing now is that we take our power back from a government that quite clearly has drunk the surveillance Kool-Aid, even though there is abundant evidence that it will do nothing at all to keep people safe or to reduce crime. If you are unhappy, perhaps most of all, with the dismal arithmetic of this place, then change the balance of numbers in your parliament in 2016, and replace major party politicians with people who have the capacity to think and vote independently on issues like this, rather than just sucking it up from the leader's office. If you have a few moments to spare, call opposition leader Bill Shorten. His number is (02)62774022. Maybe just make that call now—you will feel better; I can guarantee it. 


We will not forget what the major parties have done this week and we will not forgive them when the inevitable privacy breaches occur down the track. This measure will be repealed at some stage in the future, either repealed or rendered obsolete as technology marches forward. If you are listening to this debate and you wish it were to end differently, change the way parliament operates and help break the two-party system once and for all.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-03-24,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (13:13):  I rise to speak against the passage of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014. As my colleague Senator Ludlam has so eloquently and persistently demonstrated, this bill poses an unprecedented invasion of the privacy of all Australians, and it comes at an unjustified and horrendously large financial cost. By shepherding in a new age of mass surveillance, this bill looks set to go down in history as the moment when Australia lost sight of some its most fundamental values and freedoms—and it greatly regrets me to have to say that. 


As the Australian Greens spokesperson for legal affairs, and a lawyer myself, I want to use this opportunity to talk about the broader impact this bill will have on the legal rights and freedoms that, until now, Australians have largely taken for granted. To borrow the words of refugee advocate David Manne, this bill takes 'the law out of the law'. It sets up a framework that requires telcos to keep everyone's personal data and authorises law enforcement and intelligence bodies to collect, use and share this data without us knowing and without seeking approval from any court or independent authority.


The Attorney, with his opaque descriptions of metadata, has tried in vain to convince the community that this bill is about the collection of benign, depersonalised computer-speak. But make no mistake: this bill will require the storage of personal, private information about where you are and who you communicate with. As the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights describes the effects of this bill, metadata can reveal quite personal information about an individual even without the content of the data being made available by revealing who a person is in contact with, how often and where. This in turn could reveal, for example, the person's political opinions, sexual habits, religion or medical concerns. As my colleague Senator Ludlam has said, it is a map of your social life—who you are close to, who you are fond of and who you contact a lot. And it is a map of your physical movements—everywhere you take your phone.


The implications of this scheme for individual rights are truly disturbing, and not just in terms of the disproportionate impact on our recognised right to privacy—a right that is recognised in domestic law and international law. For example, the right to be presumed innocent is a basic principle of common law and an internationally recognised human right. But by requiring telcos to store everyone's data for possible access by law enforcement and intelligence agencies, regardless of whether or not a person is suspected of any criminal offence at all or is a risk to national security, the bill undermines this fundamental notion of the presumption of innocence. Instead of presuming innocence, this sets up a system where everyone is a potential suspect.


This is an issue which has also been of grave concern to other countries around the world. We need look only at the very substantial body of law in Europe, where courts have consistently said that treating everyone as a suspect is profoundly disproportionate to the needs of law enforcement and national security, to see that. This concern has also given rise to the recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights of this parliament that access to data should only be available if it can be shown to be necessary for the investigation of a serious criminal offence. Unfortunately, this recommendation has not been adopted by the government.


As a result, under this bill, everyone's data will be retained for two years. This data will be able to be accessed by a range of law enforcement agencies where it is 'reasonably necessary' for a legitimate investigation—very broad terms, indeed. Although privacy concerns and the seriousness of the offence can be taken into account, there is no requirement that such access be limited. In fact, the bill allows the minister to add new agencies to the list of those who can access data, which makes it difficult to predict where the boundaries on access will be drawn in the future. There is a need to ensure the bill limits access, and this is reflected in amendments which will be moved by my Greens colleague Senator Ludlam.


This bill also extends the system of authorisation for data access in a way that offends traditional notions of the separation of powers. In Australia we have a concept enshrined in the Australian Constitution of three separate branches of government—the courts, the parliament and the executive. This is designed to provide important checks on the use of government power and the concentration of power in any one institution. This system guards against the unjustified intrusion into the rights of individuals—something that we have previously long held dear in Australia. This is called 'the separation of powers' and is fundamental to a legal system that respects the rule of law. Over recent times, there has been a very disturbing trend away from these rule-of-law principles. This has been evident in many other recent government reforms. This bill is an example of that trend.


The power given to the executive government—the Prime Minister and his or her ministers and their agencies—to interfere with the rights of individuals should be subject to oversight by the second arm of government, the courts. But this bill allows law enforcement and intelligence agencies to effectively authorise themselves to have secret access to our highly sensitive personal information. The frightening and risky result is a system at constant risk of overuse, misuse or arbitrary use by the executive branch of government and its agencies. There is absolutely no independent check that happens before data is accessed under this bill, and this should be of grave concern to all of us. It certainly was of concern to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. In its recent report, which included an examination of this bill, the committee made it clear that the human right of privacy is seriously at risk here and that this bill will limit that right significantly 


People might be asking, 'Why is privacy so important?' Clearly, for some people, the right to privacy—to not have your movements, your contacts, your associations and your communications tracked by someone else, someone potentially in government and in a position of great power—is hugely important on its own. But it is important to understand, too, that privacy actually underpins other extremely important human rights, such as the right to freedom of religion, the right to freedom of association—the people you mix with, meet with and associate with of your own choosing—and the right to freedom of political expression. These fundamental human rights are so much more easily undermined or threatened if the state is able to breach our privacy and potentially know about these aspects of our lives. It does not take much imagination or paranoia, given world history, to understand that totalitarian states elsewhere have benefited or would benefit hugely from regimes like this.


The Australian Greens agree with many others who understand the implications of data surveillance that this bill should be amended so that access to retained data can be granted when there is a warrant approved by a court or independent administrative tribunal. In other words, it should be required that a judge or tribunal member has to give the okay before data is accessed by law enforcement or intelligence bodies. This requirement is also reflected in an Australian Greens amendment to the bill.


It is astonishing that both the old parties agree that this type of rule-of-law protection should be available to journalists under the bill but would deny the same protection to ordinary Australians or anyone else, even members in this place. That means that my data and the data of all my colleagues—and all of us, potentially—will be stored and accessed without a warrant, except in circumstances where doing so would impact on the work of a journalist. Even where a journalist is involved, the protections offered by this bill are hollow. For example, in a case where ASIO has access to data, the protection is limited to the granting of a warrant being made by the minister rather than by an independent court or tribunal. This gives rise to ongoing concerns about a lack of independent oversight of this access. 


In addition, under this new part of the bill, the journalists themselves will not be informed of, or be able to challenge, the warrant application. Instead, the issuing authority will be left to make a decision on the basis of information provided by the very agency seeking access and by public-interest advocates who have been chosen by the Prime Minister. The result is a bill that not only fails to adequately protect whistleblowers and journalists' sources but also openly acknowledges that the conventional safeguards for this kind of intrusive invasion into individual rights are only available to a very limited category of people. 


That is not the end of the incongruent amendments made to this bill by the government and the opposition, however. By seeking—largely unsuccessfully—to appease journalists, it has become even more clear just how these amendments fail to include other confidential communications that should be protected from the data retention and access scheme contemplated by this bill: those sorts of confidential communications that have been traditionally highly protected under our common law and legislative systems in Australia. Communications between doctor and patient, or lawyer and client, also fall within a category that has historically attracted the protection of the law—protections that have been wholesale abandoned under this bill. 


As the Law Council of Australia has explained, under this law, data will be retained under this scheme even if it relates to communications that are protected from use. This is a grave concern because of the special relationship between lawyers and their clients, which is protected by legal professional privilege. It is a relationship which is rightly regarded as a critical protection of the rule of law and which must not be put in any way at risk. 


We have had a last-minute deal struck between the old parties to amend this bill. Responding to news of the deal, the Law Council's president, Mr Duncan McConnel, noted:


There is no apparent public policy basis for recognising the need to safeguard confidential journalists' sources, while not also protecting confidential and privileged information between lawyers and their clients.


Indeed, the selective protection of a journalist's interests gives rise to a range of concerning questions, such as these questions posed by Mr McConnel: 


… what would happen if a whistle-blower seeks legal advice prior to, or during communication with a journalist? Under the proposed amendments, the journalist's communication may be confidential, but what of the communications between a journalist or the journalist's source and the lawyer?


Data could allow inferences to be drawn from whether a lawyer has been contacted; the identity and location of the client, lawyer and witnesses; the number of communications and type of communications between a lawyer and a client, witnesses and the duration of these communications.


That was set out in the Law Council's media release of 20 March this year, clearly delineating their grave concerns about the effect on legal professional privilege of this bill. 


Like the Law Council, the Australian Greens recognise the confidentiality of client-lawyer communication as a long held common law right and a right recognised under international human rights law. This was also recognised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights—a committee of this parliament. While views differed on how this right should be protected in the bill, it is my view that the protection of legal professional privilege can only be assured if the bill is amended to ensure that all content of communications that may be subject to legal professional privilege is excluded from the proposed data retention scheme.


When it comes to privileged communications, it is critically important that the community can have confidence that they will remain confidential.    It is not enough to cross our fingers and hope that this is not the type of thing that the Attorney means when he talks about data. As we know, the Attorney-General has been infamously confused about the meaning of metadata in the past. No amount of assurance that legal professional privilege will be protected in the bill is sufficient to alleviate these concerns. The law must clearly and explicitly protect these communications and, as currently drafted, this bill fails to do this. There is no excuse for that. These concerns are reflected in the amendments that will be moved by the Australian Greens.


As well as being the Australian Greens' spokesperson for legal affairs, I am also the spokesperson for mental health. This bill also gives rise to serious concerns in that portfolio area. More and more people around Australia are accessing health services, including mental-health services, online. The benefits of online support and information are very well known: it enables access for people in rural, regional and remote areas who do not have access to face-to-face services; it also allows access to those wanting confidential support and assistance; and it is often free. There is increasing evidence of the number of young people who access online mental-health services from the privacy of their own bedroom late at night when they do not feel able to reach out to other people at that time. With that increasing use of online services for mental health, there is a serious risk that this bill will undermine people's trust in these online services, with a flow-on risk to access to mental-health services and to mental health generally. 


Under this bill, people cannot have confidence that where they go, what they say and who they talk to online will remain private. It may be that content of communications is intended to be excluded from retention under this bill. But, unless and until this term is comprehensively defined in the act, the community cannot have confidence about precisely what it is that authorities in Australia will be storing and collecting. Indeed, regardless of the definitions of 'content' and 'data', the fact that data can tell so much about a person's online activity means that this bill will have a chilling effect on whether and how people access confidential services online. 


Of course, these concerns are not just confined to mental health services; they relate to any online activity that a person engages in that needs to be kept private. This could include any activity that people listening to or reading this debate can imagine being involved in. It could involve accessing information or joining in discussions about sex, sexual identity, gender diversity or getting advice about how to escape domestic violence. It is too early to see what impact this Bill will have on Australians' online activity and on their interaction with online services, but in my view any measure that risks turning those most in need away from potentially lifesaving services should not be pursued.


These are just a few of the very serious problems the Australian Greens have identified with this bill. Like my colleague, Senator Ludlam, I lament the deal done between the old parties that has truncated parliamentary debate on this bill. It has also ignored the concerns based on evidence which have been expressed by a broad cross-section of the community.


When future generations look back to see how and why mass surveillance became legal in Australia, I believe the Australian Greens will stand out as the only party that was prepared to fight for the privacy and legal rights of ordinary Australians. I urge the Senate not to pass this bill and, if this course of action is rejected, to at least adopt the amendments to make the bill safer proposed by the Australian Greens.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2015-03-24,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:31):  I rise today to speak on the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014. I would like to address some of the more general arguments and accusations that have been made by some members of this chamber.


I would like to talk first about what the philosopher John Locke called the social contract. It is a philosophy that underpins many democratic governments, particularly those in Europe and here in Australia. Locke's view is that the preservation of the security and the safety of the citizenry is not only a primary obligation of government; it is the source of its legitimacy. Under the social contract citizens notionally agree to forsake certain freedoms in exchange for the government assuring their security and safety on the basis of mutually acceptable moral principles. This is described as the consent of the governed.


In the Second Treatise of Civil Government, John Locke wrote:


The great end of men's entering into society, being the enjoyment of their properties in peace and safety, and the great instrument and means of that being the laws established in that society …


The government is there to support society in peace and safety. Even more so: as John Locke says, a government's legitimacy rests on its ability to secure the conditions for society to flourish freely and safely. This is what we are debating here today.


Our great country can only be so if we are safe. Our great country can only be so if we ensure as best we can a peaceful place for our citizens to flourish. There is a balance between freedoms of the individual and the freedom to live in safety. This is a balance that all government's and responsible oppositions must weigh up when it comes to questions of national security. It is easy for some in this place who sit outside government and the responsibilities it holds to pursue the populist route. It is also easy to quote Benjamin Franklin and claim that if somehow there is a balance between freedom of the individual and the safety of society then the terrorists win. To do so does this place a disservice.


Australia is not the United States. Unlike in the United States, the right to bear arms, thankfully, is not written into our Constitution. In Australia there is agreement that the primary role of government is to keep a society safe, whether it is the environment, whether it is labelling laws to ensure that we are not poisoned by foods, all of which get debated in this chamber on a regular basis. National security issues, the safety of people to go about their business in the streets or buy a coffee in a cafe in Sydney—all of these issues deserve to be and should be debated in this chamber. But to assert that the prime obligation is the freedom of the individual at the expense of all else is to walk away from the Lockean social contract, to walk away from the consent of the governed. There is always a balance between freedom and safety. It is a balance that all democratic and responsible governments have to grapple with.


So this bill comes to the Senate having been—and I stress this—heavily amended in the other place. It was the subject of a rigorous inquiry and report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. It is fair to say that this bill is wholly different from what the government originally proposed. The opposition is determined to ensure that our national security and law enforcement agencies have the powers that are necessary to keep Australians safe.


In recent times the Senate has dealt with three bills concerning national security. Like with the other bills relating to national security, Labor supports this bill, continuing our bipartisanship on national security matters. As well as defending our nation's security, Labor also strongly believes in the importance of upholding the rights and freedoms that define us as a democratic nation living under the rule of law. 


This bill, it should be stressed, goes beyond matters of national security, though it does have an important national security dimension. Data retention is a tool used, in the main, for the ordinary enforcement of criminal law. It is essential that in passing these laws designed to protect the Australian community, we strike that balance between these freedoms, and Labor has approached this bill on that basis. Labor is determined to ensure that our national security and law enforcement agencies absolutely have the powers that are necessary to keep Australians safe. I will say that over and over again.


We understand, however, that this is controversial legislation. I understand why some people are concerned about it. But we need to be clear that data retention is not new. Data retained by private companies is already accessible without a warrant by a range of agencies under a scheme that has not been significantly reformed since 1979. Meta data has been collected and stored by telecommunications companies for many years. The fact is that many of the organisations that hold and manage our data for us already keep it. Some keep it for a week and others for up to seven years. They keep it in an environment that is loosely regulated with few rules and little oversight.


Also, there has been concern expressed by law enforcement agencies that technological changes and changing practices are seeing less data retained by telcos over time. This bill looks to resolve that by regulating the storage and access of metadata, including for our security agencies. As I have stated, access to metadata is currently allowed under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. Police and other organisations access this data right now. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security heard evidence that last year Australian telcos had received more than half a million applications by law enforcement agencies to access metadata. The committee also heard that less data may be retained by some companies in future. We want to ensure that telecommunications data remains a reliable tool available to law enforcement and national security agencies where appropriate.


But we also want to tighten the regulation and supervision of that access ensuring Australians' safety is an objective that everyone in this parliament shares. Typically this means that proposals regarding national security are addressed in the spirit of bipartisanship. This does not mean, however, that the opposition will simply agree with all of the government's proposals no matter what. Instead, bipartisanship means the opposition will engage constructively with the government to ensure their proposals meet national interests. By way of example, while the opposition ultimately supported the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1), the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 and the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014 last year, it was Labor that insisted that these bills be referred for scrutiny to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.


The very substantial amendments agreed to by the government on the foreign fighters bill are an example of this proper scrutiny. On this bill, Labor has argued for and achieved a number of significant improvements to the original bill. For example, Labor argued for improved oversight of the scheme by two independent Commonwealth agencies: the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Labor also argued that the bill should provide for the intelligence committees to have an operational oversight of security agencies under the data retention scheme.


Further, Labor argued for amending the bill so that an agency must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that interference with the privacy of any person is justifiable and proportionate. All of these are the recommendations from the committee that the government has accepted. In all, the committee made 38 substantive recommendations to the original bill. Labor insisted the government implement each and every one of them, and the bill was amended as required in the other place. As a result, the bill that we debate in this chamber is of a wholly different character to that introduced into the House last October. 




Senator Ludlam:
  That is rubbish.




Senator CONROY:
  Most notably, the committee recommended and successfully implemented changes—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Order!




Senator CONROY:
  It is like you actually think you live in the United States. You guys are an offshoot of the Republican Party nowadays—seriously. You are up there with the GOP.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Conroy, I remind you to address your comments through the chair.




Senator CONROY:
  My apologies. I am being harangued by your colleagues in your party—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am aware of that.




Senator CONROY:
  But I did not notice you mention them in that little admonishment that I received.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I would ask you to come to order, Senator Conroy.




Senator CONROY:
  Most notably, the committee recommended and successfully implemented changes to the bill that gave journalists and their sources some protection from this bill. The committee recommended that the Ombudsman, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the committee itself be notified where retained data was accessed to identify a journalist's source. This was a worthy measure, but it was not enough. It took Labor writing to the Prime Minister to force the government into creating a warrant regime to protect journalists and their sources. I am not standing here to score points. I welcome this change of heart, and I hope that it gives the media and the broader community some reassurance.


This amendment includes the creation of a Public Interest Advocate, the PIA, which is likely to be a senior barrister or barristers, that must be notified whenever an application for a warrant is made. The PIA will be empowered to stand in the shoes of the journalist and argue why it is contrary to the public interest to issue the warrant. These changes mean much stronger protections for journalists and their sources, certainly much stronger than the government originally proposed. This is a crucial improvement on the bill as originally introduced. 


While this bill is largely different from what was originally put forward by the government, there remains some unfinished business. For instance, Labor remains concerned about whether companies should be obliged to store data in Australia. The former director-general of ASIO, David Irvine, recently said that he would be concerned about the security of retained data if it were stored overseas—because it would be 'governed by someone else's sovereign legislative system'. 



Senator Ludlam interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  This matter is currently being examined as part of the telecommunications sector security reform process. This is a process that Labor started in government and which the Abbott government says will be completed well before the end of the data retention scheme implementation period. This is an issue that Labor will have strong views on and will continue to watch with interest. 


Our security agencies have requested changes to these laws to support their work in fighting terrorism and organised crime. Labor has held the government to account during this process, as is appropriate—and the bill we debate today is, despite the protestations from my left, of a wholly different character to that which was first introduced into the House in October. Labor will always work to keep Australians safe and, at the same time, to get the balance right in upholding the rights and freedoms enjoyed by all Australians. Getting this balance right can be a challenging task, but it is a task that Labor undertakes seriously and diligently. 


It may come as a surprise to some of those in the chamber who have been interjecting, but I when I opened by referring to 'some of the more general arguments and accusations that have been made by some members of this chamber', I was not actually talking about them—until they self-selected by intruding into my contribution. I was referring more to one of our New South Wales colleagues. But by interjecting you have emphasised the stark contrast between your position and that of the Labor Party on this legislation. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2015-03-24,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (13:46):  The Australian Greens oppose the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014. Several of my Greens colleagues have already commented on this piece of legislation: on how risky, unnecessary and dangerous it is for everyday Australians—not to mention for Australian journalists. This bill is an unnecessary, disproportionate and ineffective means of achieving its stated objective of protecting Australia's national security. 


I know that national security is the hot topic in this place—it always is when a Prime Minister is polling badly. It staggers me that the Labor Party has reached the point where they are prepared to stand here and try to sell a position that we all know is more about wanting to show that there is not a glimmer of difference between them and the government on national security issues than it is about proper scrutiny of the legislation—a piece of legislation that is going to fundamentally change the way we assess and manage people's personal data.


This bill risks undermining fundamental aspects of our free society. It jeopardises the ability of journalists to protect their sources from intimidation, from blackmail and from being hunted down because the government of the day does not like the fact that they have blown the whistle. It also provides easy access for hackers to treasure troves of the most private details of people's everyday lives. In the name of protecting them, this legislation is actually putting Australians more at risk. These risks are very real and very serious.


This bill will turn all Australians into suspects by forcing telecommunications companies to store data pertaining to all Australians' telephone calls, emails and other data for two years. The legislation will not require the storage of the content of phone calls and emails—calls will not be recorded, the content of emails will not be recorded and the content of SMS messages will not be recorded—however, the legislation will require telecommunications companies to store the so-called metadata. For example, the legislation will require the storage of details of who you called, when and from where—the physical location and which mobile phone you used at that place. It will store details of who you emailed and when. Make no mistake: if this bill becomes law, it risks fundamentally changing what we understand today to be a free society.


Australians' private lives will become, to a large degree, public. This bill makes a disingenuous distinction between metadata and the substance or content of communications. As experts have made abundantly clear throughout the committee process for this bill—my colleague Senator Ludlam has participated wholeheartedly in that process; he is probably the leading expert on these issues in this place—this is a false dichotomy. Metadata may have been a useful term in the days when telephony made up the lion's share of electronic communication, but, in an age when most Australians live their lives on smartphones, tablets and PCs, that is no longer the case. The details that can be obtained by examining the so-called metadata on a person's electronic device, particularly if you can look at all the metadata from a continuous two-year period, are extraordinary. It is intrusive, it may be embarrassing for some people and it may risk—if that information were to fall into the wrong hands—damage to the person. It may affect their friendships, their working relationships, their employment, their employment prospects and their standing in Australia's online and real-life communities. Evidence of current metadata requests under the current regime shows that a massive number have nothing to do with solving serious crime but instead relate to petty requests by agencies such as the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Human Services to track what ordinary Australians—people not suspected of any serious crime—are doing. 


So, why the red flag on national security?—because that, of course, pushes buttons. But knowing where a Centrelink recipient is at a particular time when they make a phone call, and knowing who they make it to, is the type of information that we are talking about. And that type of exposure of individuals' private lives is at risk.


Under the new legislation, the Attorney-General will be able to add agencies to the list of agencies able to access metadata. Further, history shows that the data will be hacked and leaked to the internet—there is no way that the government can pretend that they can guarantee that that would not happen—leading to massive privacy breaches. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection have been involved in one of their own scandals of breaching privacy of data, when they accidentally released the names, the numbers, the addresses, the ages and the nationalities of over 10,000 asylum seekers here in Australia. 


Who, overwhelmingly, accessed that data?—governments and sources with international IP addresses. That put those 10,000 people who were seeking asylum and protection from their own countries at even more risk because it revealed that they were in Australia seeking protection. That is just one example of a current system that has gone wrong, not to mention what will happen when every single Australian will be subjected to having their metadata stored for two years. Just imagine the risk there would be if that type of information fell into the wrong hands.


There is a real risk—there has been some talk about this recently—that this legislation will lead to undermining the anonymity of journalists' sources. In this context, I am particularly concerned about the effect that this legislation will have on the vital work being done by whistleblowers in Australia's detention centres, including our offshore detention centres. As recently as last week, the Moss review demonstrated that the Australian government cannot be trusted to protect asylum seekers and refugees from abuses; nor can the government be trusted to tell the truth about what is going on. This government have already proven that they are more interested in shooting the whistleblower and covering up the crime than in dealing with the issue at hand. This government cannot be trusted with this level of sensitivity of information and data. 


The government cannot be trusted to be transparent and accountable with what goes on within government departments. They cannot be trusted—at least, from what we know from the Moss review—to know about and to be in control of what is going on in their own detention centres. Employees working in our abusive and shambolic detention centres, both here and offshore, are already subject to very tight employment contracts and to confidentiality clauses gagging them from disclosing the truth. 


The government system forces those people, even when they see wrongdoing, to be quiet about it—to shush and not to speak up—and the only way through this cloud of secrecy is to blow the whistle. And what happens when you blow the whistle? The government puts the AFP onto you and you start being investigated for blowing the whistle—for example, for blowing the whistle on abuse claims in detention centres. That is what we have seen happen as recently as the last few weeks. This government has proven themselves already to be obsessed with secrecy and cover-up. They cannot be trusted to tell the truth. Even when they have the information they cannot be trusted to keep it secure. 


If Australian expats working in offshore detention centres cannot be safe from the abuse of surveillance and cannot be protected when they blow the whistle or stand up and report crimes, how on earth can we trust that this government is going to treat the Australian public here on the mainland properly with this type of invasive collection of personal data? These risks are simply unacceptable. They are disproportionate to achieving the bill's objectives. This is because, while ordinary Australian's will be subject to the draconian intrusion into their private lives created by this bill, those who set out to do Australia harm—who really want to talk about national security—will easily remain undetected because they will be able to avoid this type of surveillance. 


It staggers me that this piece of legislation is an unsafe and risky joke of the government's. They set out to say that it is about protecting the Australian people. We have no trust that they are able to do that. In fact, the very people that the Australian government tells us we need to be protected from are going to be able to work their way around this legislation in seconds. It is a false dream that is being sold by this government. There is no protection of ordinary Australians from the awful things that somebody might want to unleash on our communities. This does not keep us protected, but it weakens not only the freedoms in our society but the protections for people who have legitimate reason for leaking information, blowing the whistle and calling out bad government decisions.


We know that the Australian government—the immigration department in particular—has already got a number of witch-hunts underway in relation to whistleblowers who work in Australian detention centres. Why on earth they are spending energy on that rather than on the people that the government suggests we need to be protected from is beyond me. This bill does not make Australians safer. This bill puts Australians' lives at further risk. It weakens our ability to have an independent, robust and free society that is underpinned by the ability of journalists, in particular, to keep their sources private, protected and free of intimidation.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) and the Assistant Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) to questions without notice asked by Senators Singh and O'Neill today relating to funding for foreign aid and disability education.


In particular, I would like to highlight the fact that Senator Cormann did not rule out cuts to health and education. He could have done so, but he clearly chose not to. He has left the door wide open to further cuts to health and education. This is already on top of the broken promises that were made after the last election where the Prime Minister said at the time that there would be no cuts to health and education. No cuts to health, no cuts to education is what he said. But we know now that he has broken that promise, like so many others, with $30 billion of cuts to schools, the scrapping of the Gonski reforms and the abandoning of needs based funding.


That needs based funding goes to the heart of the question asked by Senator O'Neill when we asked specifically about the effect that this government's funding cuts to education is having on students with a disability. We know today the effect of those cuts, and it is clearly reported in The Australian, among other media outlets. Principals have made it very clear that they are facing an urgent crisis in schools because of this government's cuts to education when it comes to providing the needs based funding to students with disability. But it is fine for Senator Cormann because he is looking after the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Despite any assertion elsewhere, that is clearly what he is doing as a protector of that minister. Forget about every other policy area. That is the one that he has perhaps used the Prime Minister's captain's pick of today.


Let us just have a look at what Senator Cormann is protecting. The government promised not to touch the aid budget before, and we know how it treats its promises. We know that in the health space. We know that in the education space. But last year in October the Minister for Foreign Affairs said there would be no more cuts to foreign aid. But in December we know what happened. Senator Cormann knows clearly what happened. There was a $3.7 billion cut from the aid budget in the mid-year economic update. So Minister Bishop may act outraged, but it is she who signed off on that cut. It is she who signed off on the deepest ever cut to the aid program in Australia's history. This minister has confiscated $11 billion from Australia's aid budget. So whilst we already know the deep and hurting cuts in health and the deep and hurting cuts in education, we know that already there have been very deep and hurting cuts—the biggest in Australia's history—in our foreign aid budget. She may mock the Treasurer, but she cannot roll her eyes while shirking her responsibility for these cuts that have already occurred in the foreign aid budget.


The Australian Council for International Development has said that if there were any further cuts to the aid program it will not be credible, it will not be effective. We have known that for some time. The minister knows that, and she knows Australia has got the weakest and the most depleted aid program in Australia's history. Hence her being so alarmed at the Treasurer's attempt to make an even deeper cut, and hence Senator Cormann coming to her rescue. Senator Cormann has not come to anyone's rescue. He was quite happy to have $11 billion cut out of the foreign aid budget last December. He is quite happy, as he has given in his answer today, to not rule out any further cuts to health, to not rule out any further cuts to education, and we know what effect that is having right now on students with disability, let alone all the other students who need decent quality education in our country, which only comes from decent funding of those critical government services. Labor of course contributed to official development assistance funding in every budget. We have a high record when it comes to foreign aid funding and when it comes to health and education, because our core values demand it. That is what we believe is the right way for Australia, not this government's awful— (Time expired)

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-03-24,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:07):  I wonder what the Labor Party's values are that Senator Singh finished on there and what they meant in foreign aid, because it is interesting that Australia became, I think, the third biggest recipient of foreign aid in our region under the former, Labor government, under their shambolic policies. They so badly lost control of the borders and lost control of the budget that we became the third largest recipient of Australian aid in the region in relation to border protection policies or so-called border protection policies under the former, Labor government. That was their idea of a sustainable aid budget. I think that Senator Singh should reflect on that fact—whether that was actually a good outcome when we saw the Labor Party lose control of the budget, lose control of the borders and make Australia the third largest recipient of Australian aid. Does that fit with the Labor Party values that Senator Singh was referring to at the end of her contribution?


I would say that the Labor Party values reflected in today's question time are mainly about deceit—mainly about trying to mislead the Australian people with some of their questioning. I am not surprised that Senator Cameron's question has not been taken note of, because of the embarrassment when he got the answers from the Attorney-General. I am not surprised they did not go to Senator Cameron's question. But that was along the same lines: he was asking a question and making assertions which were false, absolutely false. 


Let us deal with the other questions that we are taking note of today. Firstly, in terms of school funding, the coalition is delivering, in the four-year budget period, $1.2 billion more in school funding than the Labor Party were going to. That is a fact.




Senator O'Neill:
  That was just a shift from youth funding.




Senator SESELJA:
  That is a fact.




Senator O'Neill:
  That was just a shift over from youth funding.




Senator SESELJA:
  It is $1.2 billion more than they were going to. So not only does it increase every year—




Senator O'Neill:
  That's not true. 




Senator Bushby:
  That's true.




Senator SESELJA:
  Not only does it increase every year—




Senator O'Neill:
  You cut $30 billion.




Senator SESELJA:
  Not only does it increase every year, Senator O'Neill—




Senator Bushby:
  It's $1.2 billion more than you.




Senator SESELJA:
  So it is going up significantly every year. We committed to that four-year funding. But the Labor Party decided, before the election, to rip out $1.2 billion and not tell anyone about it. So we have had to restore the $1.2 billion that they ripped out, whilst increasing the funding in the four-year funding period. So, that is another scare campaign that is completely false that was in this question time. We had Senator Cameron with his embarrassing effort in relation to Aboriginal legal services, which was false—




Senator Lines:
  That is not false—




Senator SESELJA:
  We had the issues around schools.




Senator Lines:
  it's true.




Senator SESELJA:
  Senator Lines interjects because—




Senator Lines:
  Because I'm telling the truth.




Senator SESELJA:
  She thinks that, if she squawks just that little bit louder, somehow what she says will be true. Well, it is not true. Those are the facts.




Senator Lines:
  Nothing that you're saying is true.




Senator SESELJA:
  Those are the facts, Senator Lines. 




Senator Lines:
  No, they're not.




Senator SESELJA:
  You ripped out $1.2 billion. We restored it. We not only increased funding to schools every year; we restored the $1.2 billion you ripped out when you were trying to repair the debt and deficit that you left us. I would say that that is a very, very good start.



Senator O'Neill interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  Let's go to the issue, Senator O'Neill, of disability funding, which you also raised. I think the AEU and Senator Wright have sunk to a new low today, shamelessly creating fear over funding for disabled school students—which Senator O'Neill has taken up. So here are some facts. There is a needs-based disability loading. It was introduced by this government in 2014 as part of the new school-funding arrangements. The loading is based on the current state and territory definitions of 'disabled student', and so every student who meets this definition attracts the loading. There has been no cut to Australian government support for students with disability. In fact, there is more funding—



Senator O'Neill interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  for students with disability than ever before. The government is providing $5.2 billion for students with disability over the period 2014 to 2017, including over $1.2 billion for students with disability in 2015 alone.


On all of these issues, the Labor Party is not telling the truth. At least Senator Cameron, in his embarrassment, managed to acknowledge that he was not telling the truth. I hope Senator O'Neill, when she gets up, will make the same recognition—that she has gotten it wrong. (Time expired)

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:12):  What we just heard there from Senator Seselja was a dismissal of parents who have travelled across the country to be here today with their children who have a disability. Essentially, they have been called liars in that contribution from Senator Seselja. 


That is what is happening in every single portfolio area that the government touches. They say one thing, they deliver the other and then they try to convince you that black is blue. People are onto them, though. The joke is up, because it is not a very funny joke. When you absolutely reject the reality of people's lived experiences, when you reject the parents of children with disabilities and when you reject the children with disabilities who are here to tell their stories and have the truth told, you are sinking to a new low. 


Before the election, Tony Abbott said he was on a unity ticket with Labor on school funding. That was an absolute misrepresentation of the truth. Mr Pyne said:


… you can vote Liberal or Labor and you'll get exactly the same amount of funding for your school ... 


Well, that is 'exactly' not true. He did not deliver that. And we can see a $30 billion cut to education over the next 10 years, from this government. This is the same Liberal government that announced in last year's budget it was not going to fund years 5 and 6 of the Gonski reforms. It has taken $30 billion out.


The urgent question today is: what is Tony Abbott going to do about the funding for students with disability and funding for years 5 and 6 of the reforms? The Labor Gonski reforms are all about making sure every student and every school gets the support they need to achieve their best. Australians already understand: Gonski is the fair path. This government pretended it was onside with Gonski and then rejected Gonski the minute it got into office. A central plank of the Gonski model is a national needs-based loading for students with disability so every student gets the education that they deserve.


What Labor is here fighting for today and every day is fairness for every Australian—not just some Australians. Before the election the Abbott government promised to deliver on that unity ticket, especially in the area of disability funding. From 2015, they said, there would be more funding for people with disability through the disability loading in 2015. It is 2015; they have not delivered. Yet they stand in this chamber and pretend that they are honouring those promises. Day after day, misrepresentation after misrepresentation—I am not allowed to use the 'l' word—this government have betrayed students with disability. They have betrayed parents; they have betrayed the truth. Too many students with disabilities are missing out on things that other students take for granted. We have heard from parents that sometimes their kids cannot attend school all day; they can only go part time because that is as much as the school can provide; they are so resource poor. 


I want to point to the report brought to the parliament today, called 'State of our schools' by the AEU. In that they talk about the resources that are lacking—assistance for teachers in classrooms, specialist support, funding to pay for the professional development of teachers, dedicated programs, appropriate learning spaces, insufficient teachers, inadequate equipment. These are basic things that people should expect to find in schools, especially if they have a child with a disability. When children are born in Australia—the kind of Australia I believe in—they have the right to an education, whether they have a disability or not. We need to be responding to that, and this government is not doing it.


The really disgraceful thing that I want to put on the record is that, when Labor came in, we tried to get a national definition of disability and so we undertook research. That research went out into the disability sector. In contrast, since this government came in, they have failed to put very important reports on the public record. On 5 March, when I tried to table a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers on additional resourcing provided for students with disability, the Liberal members of that committee used their numbers to prevent me from making this document public. This government is a disgrace; they are keeping vital information from the sector, from parents and teachers. They cut them out of the conversation and assume that they have a right to rule from on high and, when they had the chance to be transparent, they walked away from the opportunity that Labor provided them to do the right thing. Instead, they shut down debate. They have not delivered funding in 2015; they have not committed to year 5 and year 6 of the Gonski funding. This government cannot be trusted in any policy area.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (15:17):  Through you, Mr Deputy President, what I think is a disgrace is that the Australian Labor Party are abusing the vulnerabilities of parents of children with disabilities to say things that are simply not true. There is a disability loading right now.




Senator O'Neill:
  Defend your policy.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Senator O'Neill, I have actually been to a school in the last couple of months. I am sure you have too, but you did not refer to any evidence on the ground in your contribution. I went to one in Bundaberg during the state election campaign with the state member, Stephen Bennett. During 2014 that school received hundreds of thousands dollars more to provide more disability services. That was rolled out through what we here call Gonski, but in Queensland I think they call it the Better Schools program. It was focused on providing disabled students with more services, more resources and more teacher time. That amounted to $1.2 billion this year alone in funding for disabled students. Is that enough? I do not know. Perhaps we always need more money to help disabled children. But, Senator O'Neill, what I have a problem with is that we had a bipartisan agreement to do more on the NDIS and to put more money—




Senator O'Neill:
  We had a unity ticket on Gonski.




Senator CANAVAN:
  And you on that side do not want to contribute and do not want to cooperate on something that we all agree must happen. You just want to play politics. You want to play politics with people's lives and disabled children's lives, and I find that disgraceful. I find it absolutely disgraceful, because this year we are providing $1.2 billion more, and that is funding more services. I am sure more can be done, but when I hear the arguments from the other side I am reminded of my kids. 


My kids are just like the Labor Party—they want everything. They want to eat lollies for afternoon tea; they want to play computer games all night. When I go home, I am going to build a new computer with my son, and he will want to play computer games all weekend. I am going to have a monumental battle with him when I tell him: 'No, you can only play four hours at a time. You have to do your homework and other things as well.' That is what responsible people do. They say: 'Yes, you can have fun every now and again. Yes, you can have a few sweets every now and again, but you also have to worry about your weight. You also have to study for your future and put away for a rainy day.' 


But the Labor Party does not think like that; they act like kids in this place. They want to have everything. They want to have more money to spend on services for disabled children—a noble cause—but we do not have an unlimited amount of money. They want to spend more money on the NDIS. We heard Senator Singh say they want more money for foreign aid. How are they going to fund all of this? The reason we have had to make some tough decisions—




Senator Lines:
  You're funding it through cutting pensions.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator CANAVAN:
  The reason we have had to make those tough decisions is because you guys wasted all the money. You spent billions and billions of dollars on things we could not afford and now we do not have money in the bank to do all the things we would like to do.




Senator O'Neill:
  It's never been lower. It's a national shame.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Senator O'Neill, you are complaining about cuts to the foreign aid, but that is exactly what you did in your last budget—it may have been in your second last budget, 2012-13. You cut $2.9 billion from the foreign aid budget in that year and now you come in here, with no sign of hypocrisy, and sanctimoniously say, 'Oh, isn't it terrible that we're not spending more money on foreign aid.' You did it! You did it two years ago. It is unfortunate that we cannot give more money to the people overseas who need it, but we cannot give it because of the spending decisions you made when you were in government. You wasted billions and billions of dollars. We heard in question time from Senator Cash that in just one area we wasted $11 billion on processing offshore arrivals—a problem that was created entirely by the policies of the Australian Labor Party.


Wouldn't it have been nice to have had $11 billion to spend on services for disabled children? Wouldn't it have been nice to not have to cut our foreign aid budget as much as we have had to do if we had had that $11 billion? But you did that. And we cannot get that money back now; we have to pay it back. We have to pay it back to those overseas whom we borrowed money from—to the Chinese government, to oil barons in the Middle East. That is who we borrowed money from. All that money that you wasted has to be repaid now. Unfortunately, that means that we cannot fund all of the things that we would like to do, including in the disabled space, the health space and the education space.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (15:22):  I rise to speak on the motion to take note of answers to questions about cuts to disability and education funding. Despite the questions that Labor asked in question time today, the question which the apprentice working under 'the fixer', Senator Birmingham, could not answer was: 'Why are parents of children with disability here in the parliament today?' I can answer that question. They are here because funding has been cut to their children's schools and to their education. And, if we want equality of opportunity, it means that some people need more support to get through the education system than others—and that is a fair thing, because we do want all of our children, regardless of their circumstance, to succeed at school.


When Labor was in government, we achieved a bipartisan commitment to the introduction of a disability loading as part of the national education reform, and that was for the 2015 school year. This promise reflected Australia's commitment to progressing the rights and equal opportunities of people with disability. Of course, because the Abbott team was so desperate to get elected, they made promise after promise, none of which have been kept, all of which have been broken. The promise of bipartisanship on funding to students with disabilities went by the wayside. It just disappeared. That is why parents are here today with their children—to really push home the message to the Abbott government that this is not fair, that the funding that was promised, the bipartisanship that was promised, should be something the government commits to. There will be weasel words and they will wriggle and they will carry on and they will talk about Labor. They cannot talk about their own policies, because their own policies clearly are about cuts. Otherwise, why would parents be here today? They are here because they are seeing firsthand that that bipartisan approach is now broken. Like the PM's promise, it is broken. It will affect around 100,000 students. 


Why would the Abbott government disadvantage 100,000 students in getting a good education? They are just pawns in the game, like everyone else: pensioners, our health system, and on and on the list goes. Children with disability are the latest pawns in the Abbott government's litany of broken promises. Of course children with disability face severe disadvantage at school: a limited choice of school, discrimination, bullying, limited or no funding for support and resources, sometimes not appropriate access to trained staff, and having to contend with the culture of low expectations. And where will the money come from to support those children at school? Does the Abbott government seriously think that parents have to put their hand in their pocket or that somehow there are schools that can twist their funding and put a little bit more money the way of children with disabilities? Is that what the coalition government expects? 


Certainly in my state of Western Australia, where the state government has imposed the most severe cuts we have seen in the history of education in Western Australia, this puts those students with disadvantage in a much worse position. In Western Australia we have high schools that have lost $1 million in funding and primary schools in the most disadvantaged areas that have lost half a million dollars. Of course that equates to staff numbers. Of course that equates to the amount of time that you can give to children with disability, or to any other disadvantaged group in a school. And now, on top of this, we have the broken promise from the Abbott government. 


Throwing away bipartisanship in relation to children with disability is part of a legacy that will take years and years to address in my state of Western Australia—and I imagine right across the country. That is the reason we have parents in the parliament today. That is the reason we have children with disability here today, staring the Abbott government in the face, making sure that the Abbott government absolutely understands that its broken promise on education— (Time expired)

This was a comprehensive inquiry that consulted extensively across Australia, meeting over 140 stakeholders face to face and considering in excess of 189 written submissions, including from businesses, unions, industry bodies and academics. 


The government has announced that it will act on recommendations of the independent review to strengthen integrity, ensure that Australian workers have priority and support employers with genuine skills shortages. The independent panel found no evidence of widespread rorting.

Senator FIFIELD:
  This motion is an example of the Greens' hypocrisy. The previous government, which the Greens supported, spent $500 million on advertising from 2017 to 2013, including $20 million on the Gonski campaign alone before it was legislated. The government has conducted extensive market research which showed that many students and parents thought HECS was being abolished and students would have to pay fees up-front. It is crucial that prospective students know that HECS will remain and they will not have to pay a cent up-front or pay anything until they earn over $50,000 a year. This is a crucial message of the information campaign on higher education. Meanwhile, both Labor and the Greens are still operating websites which contain false and absurd claims about fees. This is the height of dishonesty and irresponsibility. It is all about politics. It is nothing to do with students or the quality of university education.

Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator MARSHALL:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This report addresses a number of matters that have been considered by the Procedure Committee over the past few months, but it makes only one recommendation. 


In the context of recent changes to the security environment in and around Parliament House, the committee is of the view that it would be prudent to strengthen the role of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee in maintaining a capacity to oversee security matters that affect the Senate and senators. While the Appropriations and Staffing Committee already has responsibility to consider the administration and funding of security measures affecting the Senate and to advise the President and the Senate, the committee considered that it would be appropriate for that responsibility to extend to security operations affecting the Senate.


This change mirrors a change being made to the terms of reference of the Security Management Board by the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2014, scheduled for consideration by the Senate this forthcoming Thursday. Accordingly, at the conclusion of my speech, I will be seeking leave to continue my remarks and to move a motion to provide for consideration of the report to be listed as a Business of the Senate order of the day for tomorrow. This will allow the Senate to consider the proposal and to adopt the recommendation before the bill is dealt with on Thursday.


The committee also recommends that the ex officio membership of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee should include both the President and Deputy President and that its name should be changed to the Appropriations, Staffing and Security Committee.


 The other matters dealt with in the report all relate to the operation of the rules of debate. The committee has considered whether there is a need for the chair to have the power to suspend a senator temporarily but has concluded that this should be left to existing practice.


Likewise, in response to concerns expressed about the use of politically charged or inflammatory language to raise matters under standing order 75, the committee considers that existing practices are appropriate. The committee will continue to monitor the operation of recent changes in relation to estimates hearings and will continue to consider matters raised by crossbench senators about the order of the call.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-24,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (15:57):  I will speak to the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, which I chaired: Comprehensive revision of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. This report has been 15 months in the making. We kicked this off in November or December 2013. It has proven to be quite appropriate that we are tabling it as the Senate has begun consideration of the mandatory data retention legislation. It has been so long in the making.


This matter, however, is a little bit different. Senators would, no doubt, be aware in the second reading contributions that I, Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Wright have made thus far that we are dead against the government's proposed mandatory data retention scheme and cannot for the life of us understand why the Labor Party has caved in and given Prime Minister Abbott the surveillance lifeline. However, it is not enough to simply put on record what it is that we oppose. This report gives some guidance as to what we support. 


I guess I should break it to the Senate at this stage that, although there is a consensus document and a majority report here, it contains largely uncontroversial matters related to the warranted surveillance regime in Australia. That is, roughly 4,700-odd warrants that are issued for intercepts or for reading stored communications, such as emails. Then of course we parted ways. 


The opposition has tabled additional comments and I believe government senators have done so as well. So anybody listening to this debate will need to draw their own conclusions as to where different parties landed on the issue.


It is clear to everybody, from the former secretary of the Attorney-General's Department down, that the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act is in urgent need of reform. That does not mean the kind of tinkering around the edges that we have seen repeatedly in recent decades. The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act was written in 1979, when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister, when the internet had not emerged into public consciousness and mobile phones did not exist. Yet we are still dealing, in my estimation, with a system that has failed to keep up with the march of technology.


This report effectively breaks out into a couple of different sections, and the first part, which is the consensus view of the committee, goes through ways that we could appreciably streamline the existing warranted telecommunications regime. The second part, which I guess then goes to the chair's minority additional comments, goes through the regime of access to metadata. Here our recommendation could not be more clear: if an interception warrant is required to listen to someone's phone call, if a warrant is required to read someone's email, a warrant should be required to gather bulk metadata, telecommunications data—also known as the private records of your location and of your social network; everybody you are in touch with and many other details of your life. We propose effectively a streamlining of the process. At the moment there are a number of different warrants that agencies need to apply for, and agencies made the case in my view—it was not an uncontested case—that this regime needs to be streamlined and slimmed down somewhat. 


We have proposed, cautiously, what is known as an attribute based warrant and the introduction of a public interest monitor similar to that which exists in Queensland and Victoria. From the evidence we took, it is working reasonably well. The things this proposal does are twofold: It streamlines the process for which warrants can be sought and granted but it also places between the agencies and the granting of that warrant a public interest advocate whose job it is to contest—not to simply roll over, but to contest. You have to imagine that, if such an entity had existed in New South Wales, perhaps the police surveillance scandal that is unfolding at the moment might have been prevented. We had very strong evidence that such a public interest monitor should exist at the Commonwealth level, and for me these two recommendations go together—rolling the various kinds of warrants in with attribute based warrants on one hand, and introducing a public interest monitor to provide that contestability is equally important.


The other recommendation I want to draw senators' attention to is that warrants should be sought for bulk metadata. That is effectively updating our surveillance laws and our interception regime to take into account the huge changes that have occurred in technology since 1979. When those early drafters under the Fraser government identified that agencies would need to seek a warrant to intercept a phone call or read a message—not that email really existed in any sort of form at that stage—I think it would also have occurred to them that being able to track someone's location everywhere they go should require warranted access as well. That is one of the key recommendations we have made here—but not for everything. It was not the view of many witnesses that reading the white pages should require a warrant, so basic subscriber data identifying who was the subscriber to a particular account or a particular handset would continue to be applicable under the existing authorisations regime, although we do propose some additional safeguards—but bulk metadata of an invasive kind should require a warrant. We also believe that the act should have an objects clause, which may seem a little bit obscure to those without a legal background, but the fact is that the word 'privacy' is barely mentioned in our Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act. We believe an objects clause modelled on article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the privacy principles contained in Australia's own Privacy Act 1988 should be baked into telecommunications interception legislation here in Australia.


We also pointed very briefly to international experience. Despite the fact that the government appears to believe that precisely the opposite is occurring, in Europe the mandatory data retention regime, which provided for three months to an upper limit of two years of mandatory data retention, was struck out by the European Court of Justice on the grounds that it was offensive to principles of privacy and in fact offended human rights. That is remarkable and it seems to have gone completely over the head of Senator Brandis and Prime Minister Tony Abbott, because on more than one occasion they have tried to persuade people that international practice is moving in this direction when in fact it is moving in precisely the opposite direction. On figures provided to the committee, many jurisdictions in Europe—nearly a dozen—have some form of judicial oversight over access to telecommunications data—that is, for some or all of this material you need to go to a judge and get a warrant. That is the kind of international best practice that we believe Australia should be heading towards. The situation in the United States is obviously much less clear, but the debate that has unfolded there since the revelations of Mr Edward Snowden has created some rather unusual allies across the United States political spectrum who are seeking to have the powers returned to that which are necessary and proportionate and which indeed are in accord with the United States Constitution and their Bill of Rights.


This report is extremely timely. Those who understand that the Australian Greens are opposed to mandatory data retention can find in this document what it is that we support and the kind of reforms we believe would bring our telecommunications interception regime into line with the way technology and expectations of the public have emerged in the early years of the 21st century. We could not have done this without the secretariat and we also could not have done it without the hard work of Senate colleagues from across the political spectrum. Chairing this inquiry was not always easy—it was sometimes arduous—but everybody did apply themselves over a period of time. To my great surprise, Senator Ian Macdonald, who will willingly profess his ignorance of these matters, applied himself to the task with quite a lot of dedication. He asked hard questions and did not take anything for granted, and I found myself surprised from time to time by the degree to which Senator Macdonald in particular and also Senator Reynolds, when she joined the work of the committee in its later phases, did apply themselves with diligence. Nonetheless, politics and party discipline have regrettably prevailed and that is why we see a splintering of minority reports and additional comments reflecting the views of the leadership. 


We simply could not have done this work without the hard work of the secretariat who do their work behind the scenes, particularly Ms Sophie Dunstone and Ms Sandra Kennedy—who regrettably the Senate has lost to the House of Representatives committee system. To those two in particular, and to Ms Jo-Anne Holmes, on behalf of the committee I thank them for their extraordinary work.

Although many of these issues have been, and will be, dealt with during the Senate's consideration of the data retention bill, I too would like to thank the secretariat for the work put into this inquiry and the production of the report. I also thank the chair for dealing with the matter under somewhat difficult circumstances. 


I too joined this inquiry in its later phases, but I would like to highlight that the comments from opposition senators highlight the broader context in which this inquiry was conducted. We remind people following the course of these considerations that, although a 2013 report from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security regarding the act was unanimous and included the current Attorney-General as one of its members at the time, the Abbott government has still not responded to those recommendations in chapter 2, let alone commenced the considerable work outlined under recommendation 18, which relate directly to the process suggested to update this act.


As I said in my contribution on the data retention bill, this has been most unfortunate for public policy and sensible consideration of these issues. Perhaps that is the one point that I will take issue with the chair, Senator Ludlam, here. In one breath he suggested that people looking at this report will draw their own conclusions, once they look at the various positions addressed in the report; in an earlier, more hysterical breath he referred to Labor having 'caved in' on these issues. I remind senators and anyone listening to this debate that, whilst we have not been happy with the way the Abbott government has progressed not only modernising this act but also the broader data retention issues, there is significant change in the bill that was first presented to the House of Representatives by Malcolm Turnbull. There were 38 substantive recommendations that came out of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. As many would be aware, there was then further movement from the government amounting to, roughly, 75 amendments to ensure that what progresses in the Senate is a far more comprehensive, substantial and balanced approach to the data retention matter. That more balanced approach meets our requirements that we address oversight and privacy issues when considering how, under more appropriate arrangements, we deal with metadata. 


I reminded senators earlier today of the unfortunate approach that the Abbott government took when the previous Labor government asked the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to address many issues. Had the minister of the day, Senator Brandis, taken the committee's advice and proceeded down the way that was recommended—particularly in its recommendation 18—we would, and the government would, probably be in quite a different space. There has been a measured and balanced consideration of these issues and significant changes to how the government first proposed we work with the data retention issues as one element of this report. In terms of a comprehensive review of the act, there is still much more that needs to be done. The government would be wise to reflect on the previous recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security.


We have reminded senators in our report of what those recommendations are. For instance, recommendation 7 covers some of the issues around the specific attributes of communications and the attribute based interception issues. Some of what has been considered by this Senate committee is not necessarily new; it has been previously addressed by the joint parliamentary committee. But we felt it was appropriate to have a process that enabled crossbench senators to participate as well, as they are not presently represented on the joint parliamentary process. I hope Senator Ludlam appreciates that the Greens have had an opportunity to call before the parliamentary committee—the Senate committee—the witnesses that we had called upon the government to engage with, before designing this bill, in relation to data retention.


The Labor senators' contributions to this report put the report as a whole in a broader context of how it might better have been dealt with—not only data retention but also the modernisation of the TIA Act overall. We highlight some of the outstanding issues that the Senate needs to be mindful of. There is the issue of data storage, which has not yet been resolved, and the issues about strengthening oversight of our broader national security framework. Senator Faulkner commenced the process, but Labor will be keen to ensure progress in the context of any further work around the TIA Act and the broader national security issues.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-24,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (15:57):  I will speak to the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, which I chaired: Comprehensive revision of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. This report has been 15 months in the making. We kicked this off in November or December 2013. It has proven to be quite appropriate that we are tabling it as the Senate has begun consideration of the mandatory data retention legislation. It has been so long in the making.


This matter, however, is a little bit different. Senators would, no doubt, be aware in the second reading contributions that I, Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Wright have made thus far that we are dead against the government's proposed mandatory data retention scheme and cannot for the life of us understand why the Labor Party has caved in and given Prime Minister Abbott the surveillance lifeline. However, it is not enough to simply put on record what it is that we oppose. This report gives some guidance as to what we support. 


I guess I should break it to the Senate at this stage that, although there is a consensus document and a majority report here, it contains largely uncontroversial matters related to the warranted surveillance regime in Australia. That is, roughly 4,700-odd warrants that are issued for intercepts or for reading stored communications, such as emails. Then of course we parted ways. 


The opposition has tabled additional comments and I believe government senators have done so as well. So anybody listening to this debate will need to draw their own conclusions as to where different parties landed on the issue.


It is clear to everybody, from the former secretary of the Attorney-General's Department down, that the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act is in urgent need of reform. That does not mean the kind of tinkering around the edges that we have seen repeatedly in recent decades. The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act was written in 1979, when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister, when the internet had not emerged into public consciousness and mobile phones did not exist. Yet we are still dealing, in my estimation, with a system that has failed to keep up with the march of technology.


This report effectively breaks out into a couple of different sections, and the first part, which is the consensus view of the committee, goes through ways that we could appreciably streamline the existing warranted telecommunications regime. The second part, which I guess then goes to the chair's minority additional comments, goes through the regime of access to metadata. Here our recommendation could not be more clear: if an interception warrant is required to listen to someone's phone call, if a warrant is required to read someone's email, a warrant should be required to gather bulk metadata, telecommunications data—also known as the private records of your location and of your social network; everybody you are in touch with and many other details of your life. We propose effectively a streamlining of the process. At the moment there are a number of different warrants that agencies need to apply for, and agencies made the case in my view—it was not an uncontested case—that this regime needs to be streamlined and slimmed down somewhat. 


We have proposed, cautiously, what is known as an attribute based warrant and the introduction of a public interest monitor similar to that which exists in Queensland and Victoria. From the evidence we took, it is working reasonably well. The things this proposal does are twofold: It streamlines the process for which warrants can be sought and granted but it also places between the agencies and the granting of that warrant a public interest advocate whose job it is to contest—not to simply roll over, but to contest. You have to imagine that, if such an entity had existed in New South Wales, perhaps the police surveillance scandal that is unfolding at the moment might have been prevented. We had very strong evidence that such a public interest monitor should exist at the Commonwealth level, and for me these two recommendations go together—rolling the various kinds of warrants in with attribute based warrants on one hand, and introducing a public interest monitor to provide that contestability is equally important.


The other recommendation I want to draw senators' attention to is that warrants should be sought for bulk metadata. That is effectively updating our surveillance laws and our interception regime to take into account the huge changes that have occurred in technology since 1979. When those early drafters under the Fraser government identified that agencies would need to seek a warrant to intercept a phone call or read a message—not that email really existed in any sort of form at that stage—I think it would also have occurred to them that being able to track someone's location everywhere they go should require warranted access as well. That is one of the key recommendations we have made here—but not for everything. It was not the view of many witnesses that reading the white pages should require a warrant, so basic subscriber data identifying who was the subscriber to a particular account or a particular handset would continue to be applicable under the existing authorisations regime, although we do propose some additional safeguards—but bulk metadata of an invasive kind should require a warrant. We also believe that the act should have an objects clause, which may seem a little bit obscure to those without a legal background, but the fact is that the word 'privacy' is barely mentioned in our Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act. We believe an objects clause modelled on article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the privacy principles contained in Australia's own Privacy Act 1988 should be baked into telecommunications interception legislation here in Australia.


We also pointed very briefly to international experience. Despite the fact that the government appears to believe that precisely the opposite is occurring, in Europe the mandatory data retention regime, which provided for three months to an upper limit of two years of mandatory data retention, was struck out by the European Court of Justice on the grounds that it was offensive to principles of privacy and in fact offended human rights. That is remarkable and it seems to have gone completely over the head of Senator Brandis and Prime Minister Tony Abbott, because on more than one occasion they have tried to persuade people that international practice is moving in this direction when in fact it is moving in precisely the opposite direction. On figures provided to the committee, many jurisdictions in Europe—nearly a dozen—have some form of judicial oversight over access to telecommunications data—that is, for some or all of this material you need to go to a judge and get a warrant. That is the kind of international best practice that we believe Australia should be heading towards. The situation in the United States is obviously much less clear, but the debate that has unfolded there since the revelations of Mr Edward Snowden has created some rather unusual allies across the United States political spectrum who are seeking to have the powers returned to that which are necessary and proportionate and which indeed are in accord with the United States Constitution and their Bill of Rights.


This report is extremely timely. Those who understand that the Australian Greens are opposed to mandatory data retention can find in this document what it is that we support and the kind of reforms we believe would bring our telecommunications interception regime into line with the way technology and expectations of the public have emerged in the early years of the 21st century. We could not have done this without the secretariat and we also could not have done it without the hard work of Senate colleagues from across the political spectrum. Chairing this inquiry was not always easy—it was sometimes arduous—but everybody did apply themselves over a period of time. To my great surprise, Senator Ian Macdonald, who will willingly profess his ignorance of these matters, applied himself to the task with quite a lot of dedication. He asked hard questions and did not take anything for granted, and I found myself surprised from time to time by the degree to which Senator Macdonald in particular and also Senator Reynolds, when she joined the work of the committee in its later phases, did apply themselves with diligence. Nonetheless, politics and party discipline have regrettably prevailed and that is why we see a splintering of minority reports and additional comments reflecting the views of the leadership. 


We simply could not have done this work without the hard work of the secretariat who do their work behind the scenes, particularly Ms Sophie Dunstone and Ms Sandra Kennedy—who regrettably the Senate has lost to the House of Representatives committee system. To those two in particular, and to Ms Jo-Anne Holmes, on behalf of the committee I thank them for their extraordinary work.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2015-03-24,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (16:44):  I would like to note at the outset, that this bill is invaluably complex—particularly the provisions on the data retention scheme. A number of factors have been considered by various committees and amendments have now been made to this bill. As I indicated, the bill differs greatly from the original bill introduced by the government, but this bill proposes to introduce mandatory data retention scheme, which was explored in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in its 2013 report of the inquiry into potential reforms of Australia's national security legislation. At over 300 pages, the PJCIS report provides extensive analysis of, and commentary on, the bill and the proposed scheme more generally. 


Some of the concerns raised by the PJCIS about the bill include: the appropriateness of using regulations to specify the definition and scope of data that must be retained; expansion of the category of services that will be subject to the data retention obligations; expansion of the number of criminal law enforcement and other enforcement agencies that can access the retained metadata; the length of time metadata is to be retained; the cost of the scheme; access to, and use of, retained metadata by civil litigants; the application of the Privacy Act of 1988 to all service providers covered by the scheme; the application of the scheme to offshore and over-the-top providers; and evaluation of the effectiveness of the scheme using retained metadata to identify journalists' sources. This unanimous and bipartisan report by the PJCIS made a total of 38 recommendations, and the government has accepted all of them—after what I could only refer to as the assistance of the Labor Party. There are significant recommendations in the report which provide for greater safeguards to the community.


Before I go to the detail, I would like to reflect on Senator Collins's contribution to this second reading debate. Senator Collins observed that Senator Ludlam and the Greens had launched what could only be described as a deliberately misleading and irresponsible scare campaign against this bill for what could only be considered as political purposes. Their campaign has been described by some as 'hysterical'—it is not the language I generally use—but I do think it clouds the proper debate on this bill. The criticism did provoke much excitement from Greens senators, and Senator Ludlam indicated that he disagreed with the assessment of his campaign. I share the view that Senator Ludlam's campaign against data retention has been over the top and has not always relied on facts. Perhaps the best example of Senator Ludlam's hysteria is a rap video that he appeared in regarding data retention. This video claimed that data retention was—




Senator Cameron:
  A rap video?




Senator LUDWIG:
  Yes, it was part of a conspiracy designed to coincide with last year's meeting of the G20 in Brisbane, which the video described as 'an event at which the captains of the world's most powerful states gather to plan a planetary fascist…' and it goes on with a phrase that I do not want to go to.




Senator Ludlam:
  Rap it for us.




Senator LUDWIG:
  I am no rapper, but can I say that this video was not entertaining to me in the slightest. The language was over the top; I would even say that at times I was surprised that Senator Ludlam could use such language. Senator Ludlam threatened to go 'full Gandalf' to stop the parliament passing the bill—a reference to a character from the fantasy novel, The Lord of the Rings. This is another thing I am not generally familiar with but, nonetheless, Senator Ludlam is always able to pursue ways of attracting attention to his particular interests. I think ultimately it was a most undignified and perhaps even an inelegant production—that is probably the best way I can describe it. I would like to acknowledge, though, that Senator Ludlam does take telecommunications interception seriously and has done so for many years in this parliament. The video did seem to depart from what I would call his usual approach to things. We can always depart from the usual path, and perhaps I can put it down to that in this instance. 


I do worry that we then miss the whole debate proper and the need for it. My own view of this type of political campaigning is that you have to be very careful that you do not sacrifice your dignity for the sake of a few votes but, of course, I always leave that to the judgement of individual senators in this place. I will not go to other elements of Senator Ludlam's argument; I will only say that Senator Collins provided a note of congratulations to Mr David Speers for his Walkley-award-winning interrogation of Senator Brandis on metadata. From Labor's perspective, I did find that extremely amusing. It was reported on the Sky News website today that Mr Speers has been nominated for a Gold Logie for this interview. As Senator Collins noted, this interview was not the high-water mark of public policy. Indeed, it has been variously described as a train wreck, embarrassing and humiliating, but it was a fine example of good journalism in action, and I join with Senator Collins in congratulating Mr Speers on his achievements. To be fair in this place, yes, I have criticised perhaps what Senator Ludlam might say is unfair, but also the person who has brought this legislation forward. Perhaps if it had been made in a much more considered way, we would not have had a report which required so many amendments, which the government then had to accept. Why? Because it was a significant improvement to the legislation, in truth. The committee made a substantial number of recommendations. I will not go into them all. That did provide a vastly better bill. 


The reality is that the opposition to this bill has been unjustified. I worry that the Greens do not support the retention of any metadata, even the existing arrangements. I think that colour came through, not because in this instance it will put regulations and safeguards on the collection and retention of metadata but because they simply do not support this type of legislation in any shape or form.


What astounded me the most was not the video but that, with respect to the legislation as it was originally introduced, the Abbott government and the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, did not take with sufficient seriousness the safeguards that needed to be put in place to ensure it was effective and would garner the support of the Senate. The original version of this bill was severely lacking in the protections that the community and business would have expected. The bill gave a disproportionate amount of power to the Attorney-General to make decisions, with no parliamentary oversight. It placed fundamental provisions into regulations instead of into the primary legislation and provided no protection to journalists or their resources. 


The introduction of the bill in its original form showed the lack of thought given to the privacy of our citizens and the integrity and freedom of the media. It is only thanks to Labor and members of the PJCIS, who pursued these common-sense, important and numerous amendments to the legislation, that this bill strikes the right balance between ensuring that there are sufficient tools available to our law enforcement agencies and that there are privacy protections. The requirement for a journalists information warrant was initially rejected by the government, but after a sustained public campaign the Abbott government finally succumbed to reason and commonsense and included the warrant provisions.


Our law enforcement and national security agencies should have the power they need to protect Australia from the threats of crime and terrorism. However, we also believe in the importance of protecting the fundamental freedoms that define Australia as a democratic nation. It is critical that we get the balance right between keeping people safe and protecting our civil liberties. There is nothing new about the collection of metadata. It has occurred for many years and it has been accessed by government agencies for many years with insufficient safeguards to protect personal privacy. Data being collected in huge volumes in an unregulated manner is what this bill aims to remedy. 


The bill in fact aims to provide more security and confidence to the community about the reasons for and the manner in which this data can be accessed. It puts a greater burden on government agencies to prove the need for this information. This data has been accessed by many dozens of state, federal and territory agencies, including local councils, and that does beg that we require sufficient safeguards to ensure this legislation meets and demands the protection of personal privacy. Labor's approach to this bill is an opportunity to regulate and improve the use of data for law enforcement and counter-terrorism purposes while at the same time introducing safeguards that will greatly improve the transparency and accountability of storage and access to that data. We cannot overlook the fact that access to metadata is vital to the work of our law enforcement and national security agencies. 


The bill was introduced into parliament late last year. It was inadequate at that time. In particular, safeguards were insufficient. Labor made sure that the bill would be sent to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for proper scrutiny and to allow the public to have their input into the bill. As a result, the government has accepted many amendments to improve the bill to better balance the importance of upholding our fundamental democratic freedoms, with national security concerns addressed. In particular, Labor believes that freedom of the press is one of the most fundamental elements of our democracy and we will always continue to argue for its protection. Labor forced the Abbott government to accept a regime where it will be illegal for agencies to access metadata for the purposes of identifying a journalist's source unless they first obtain a warrant from a court. Agencies will be prohibited from accessing metadata to identify a journalist's source unless they obtain a journalists information warrant. Consistent with other warrants under the T(IA) Act, law enforcement agencies will seek warrants from a judge or an AAT member. ASIO will seek warrants from the Attorney-General. There will be a presumption against the issuing of the warrant, and agencies must prove that the public interest in issuing the warrant outweighs the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the identity of the journalist's source and having regard to, among other things, the importance of personal privacy, whether the agency has made reasonable attempts to obtain the information sought by other means, the importance of the matter being investigated, the extent to which the metadata sought would assist an investigation and any submissions made by the public interest advocate. There will always be a presumption against issuing the warrant, and agencies will need to prove that the public interest in obtaining the information sought under the warrant outweighs the public interest in protecting journalists' sources, which is essential to the freedom of the press.

What astounded me the most was not the video but that, with respect to the legislation as it was originally introduced, the Abbott government and the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, did not take with sufficient seriousness the safeguards that needed to be put in place to ensure it was effective and would garner the support of the Senate. The original version of this bill was severely lacking in the protections that the community and business would have expected. The bill gave a disproportionate amount of power to the Attorney-General to make decisions, with no parliamentary oversight. It placed fundamental provisions into regulations instead of into the primary legislation and provided no protection to journalists or their resources. 


The introduction of the bill in its original form showed the lack of thought given to the privacy of our citizens and the integrity and freedom of the media. It is only thanks to Labor and members of the PJCIS, who pursued these common-sense, important and numerous amendments to the legislation, that this bill strikes the right balance between ensuring that there are sufficient tools available to our law enforcement agencies and that there are privacy protections. The requirement for a journalists information warrant was initially rejected by the government, but after a sustained public campaign the Abbott government finally succumbed to reason and commonsense and included the warrant provisions.


Our law enforcement and national security agencies should have the power they need to protect Australia from the threats of crime and terrorism. However, we also believe in the importance of protecting the fundamental freedoms that define Australia as a democratic nation. It is critical that we get the balance right between keeping people safe and protecting our civil liberties. There is nothing new about the collection of metadata. It has occurred for many years and it has been accessed by government agencies for many years with insufficient safeguards to protect personal privacy. Data being collected in huge volumes in an unregulated manner is what this bill aims to remedy. 


The bill in fact aims to provide more security and confidence to the community about the reasons for and the manner in which this data can be accessed. It puts a greater burden on government agencies to prove the need for this information. This data has been accessed by many dozens of state, federal and territory agencies, including local councils, and that does beg that we require sufficient safeguards to ensure this legislation meets and demands the protection of personal privacy. Labor's approach to this bill is an opportunity to regulate and improve the use of data for law enforcement and counter-terrorism purposes while at the same time introducing safeguards that will greatly improve the transparency and accountability of storage and access to that data. We cannot overlook the fact that access to metadata is vital to the work of our law enforcement and national security agencies. 


The bill was introduced into parliament late last year. It was inadequate at that time. In particular, safeguards were insufficient. Labor made sure that the bill would be sent to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for proper scrutiny and to allow the public to have their input into the bill. As a result, the government has accepted many amendments to improve the bill to better balance the importance of upholding our fundamental democratic freedoms, with national security concerns addressed. In particular, Labor believes that freedom of the press is one of the most fundamental elements of our democracy and we will always continue to argue for its protection. Labor forced the Abbott government to accept a regime where it will be illegal for agencies to access metadata for the purposes of identifying a journalist's source unless they first obtain a warrant from a court. Agencies will be prohibited from accessing metadata to identify a journalist's source unless they obtain a journalists information warrant. Consistent with other warrants under the T(IA) Act, law enforcement agencies will seek warrants from a judge or an AAT member. ASIO will seek warrants from the Attorney-General. There will be a presumption against the issuing of the warrant, and agencies must prove that the public interest in issuing the warrant outweighs the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the identity of the journalist's source and having regard to, among other things, the importance of personal privacy, whether the agency has made reasonable attempts to obtain the information sought by other means, the importance of the matter being investigated, the extent to which the metadata sought would assist an investigation and any submissions made by the public interest advocate. There will always be a presumption against issuing the warrant, and agencies will need to prove that the public interest in obtaining the information sought under the warrant outweighs the public interest in protecting journalists' sources, which is essential to the freedom of the press.



The PRESIDENT:  Pursuant to the order of the Senate agreed to earlier today, the Senate will now move to valedictory statements.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,24,2
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-03-24,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:03):  I feel as if the parliament is playing catch-up—and not doing it terribly well—with what is in fact a revolution. The revolution, or the major transformation, is in big data. We have now reached the point where the revolution is not in the machines that calculate the data—something which has been our lived experience and which Senator Kate Lundy just spoke about in her valedictory remarks—it is now in the data itself.


I am strongly opposing the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014 because I think the overwhelming majority of people in this parliament have no idea about what the retention of data actually means for the Australian community and for society in general—or what it could mean in the longer term. Up until now, because we could only deal with relatively small datasets, we have always looked for evidence, analysis and causation. We have looked at the dataset, looked at the evidence, tried to work out the causes and tried to extrapolate that to support evidence based decision making. Causation was where our focus was. Now the whole world is going to be shifting. We are going to be exchanging causality for correlations—in other words, no longer actually needing to know why, just focusing on what.


You get the correlation in the data and that gives you information about where people go, what they eat, who they see, which doctor they go to and so on. What does the information mean? There is nothing about causation, nothing about evidence—it is just about the correlation. It has reached the point where, with that data, the more you know about people—where they go, what they do, what their health is—the more valuable that data is to various businesses. The problem we have is that, if you collect data on people, no matter what the primary purpose of collecting it is, you do not know how, in two years time, that data might be used. It might be used for something entirely different. The data itself is now the product that is valuable to corporations, to governments or to anyone who gets hold of it. It enables them to make decisions; it enables them to develop and sell goods and services. The book, Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work and Think, tells us:


Mobile operators have long been loath to monetize that information for fear of running afoul of privacy regulations. But they are starting to soften their stance as their financial fortunes flounder and they regard their data as a potential source of income. In 2012, the large Spanish and international operators Telefonica went so far as to create a separate company, called Telefonica Digital Insights, to sell anonymous and aggregated subscriber-location data to retailers and others. 


So that is the new market for people who have the data—to on-sell it to other people for profit, and basically to use that data about people. The argument will be that you can make it anonymous. You cannot. It is clear that even if you try to make it anonymous you cannot, because the dataset will match somebody. And inevitably that person will be locatable. That is one of the big problems. 


So here we have a parliament which is deciding to legislate to allow the data about every Australian to be kept by telecommunications companies for two years. That is incredibly invasive. The data is going to tell you everything about that person—where they have been, the fact that they used their phone and who they spoke to, for how long they spoke and then the network of people that those people have spoken to. There will be a whole set of data built up about a person.


Who is going to have access to that data? There is no saying in this legislation that that data is going to be held and controlled by these corporations in Australia, under Australian privacy law. What is to stop one of these providers, who will store this information for two years, storing it in another country, where the privacy laws are not the same as Australia's and that—as Telefonica has done—they will allow access to that data to medical insurance companies, for example, who might decide that they want to determine whether they should give someone health insurance or adjust the cost of that health insurance over time? 


There was an extraordinary example that I read about, where a car company is designing the most up-to-date seats. When you buy or get the car you can log in the impression of your body as you sit upright in the seat of that car. It will then program the car so that if you slump over the wheel or start going to sleep, the car will wake you up. It is meant to be a safety device, but the data is owned by the company. The company can then make that data available to law enforcement agencies or insurance companies, in the case of an accident, to say that you went to sleep at the wheel of that car or that you were distracted, leaning across or whatever you were doing, because of the physical imprint of you sitting in the seat. If you were not sitting up, that information can be made available and you could find that the data will get you, in the end.  


We are getting to the point where people are making themselves vulnerable to the data collection agencies that hold the data. They could on-sell it or make it available. They could be vulnerable to being hacked. Yet this parliament is saying that 23 million Australian people are going to have all their data stored somewhere. The government and Labor think that it is perfectly all right to do that. 


Already up to 80 agencies are able to access people's data. That is going to be pared down in this legislation, but the big flaw is that all those agencies have to do is to apply to the Attorney-General, and he or she can then allow those new agencies to be on the list of agencies that can collect the data. We have no idea what the Attorney-General of the day will rubber-stamp in terms of saying that any of these agencies can have access to the data. 


Of course we know that ASIO, the police and all of the law enforcement agencies will want this. It is being dressed up to look as if it is to deal with terrorism. Nothing could be further from the truth. These agencies—up to 80 agencies now—want this data because it makes it easier to track down information about people or to engage in audits of compliance, enforcement and the like. It is a matter of considerable concern that these agencies wanted data to be stored for five years. They are not going to get it; they are getting two years—but that is, in fact, too many. There is a real concern here about what is going to happen to information that pertains to all Australians. 


And, as I said, what about confidentiality? The Labor Party seems to think that it has made some very thin confidentiality arrangements to protect journalists and their sources—I will come back to that; it does not protect journalists' sources—but what about doctors and lawyer groups? What about any of those organisations which require and demand privacy of information? They will no longer have that privacy, because there is only one group of people protected through this fairly thin provision for a new public interest advocate. What about the people who provide the information? What about doctors? What about lawyers? They are not covered. 


In fact, any information about any individual can be uploaded and held for two years. There are no confidentiality provisions. This legislation undermines everything we have understood about the rule of law and about professions that are protected in terms of the information that they hold. As I said, the idea of causality has gone; we now have the idea of correlation. Correlation allows people to work out probability. So we are going to get profiling of people and communities as being likely suspects in particular crimes—these groups of people have a greater probability, according to the data, of committing a crime. It does not allow for individuals in the community or for any analysis of other things in the community. So you are going to get additional policing and surveillance put into those areas, and that is completely unnecessary.  


We are not saying—and I heard a few comments earlier to this effect earlier—that the Greens do not want to see adequate surveillance from police and law enforcement organisations dealing with terrorism. Of course we do. And that is why there are data preservation orders. If they have reason to suspect that somebody is likely to be involved in criminal matters then they can get a data preservation order. So 'targeted' is one thing; indiscriminate surveillance of an entire population under the guise of terrorism and national security is quite wrong. This has been on the agenda for a long time. Under the shadow of terrorism, we have had Labor roll over, go and join up with the government, and agree to legislation that will lead to surveillance of all Australians.


I just want to go to this public interest advocate that has been set up to oversee the metadata searches on journalists. There are a number of problems with that. There are no rules requiring the Attorney-General to seek the views of the public interest advocate to argue against warrants being issued for journalists' metadata. In addition, it will be an offence involving two years' jail for anyone to disclose that a warrant for metadata has been requested or applied. So the journalists will not be able to contest the idea that this has actually occurred.


Testimony from the Attorney-General's Department, combined with evidence from countries which have enacted data retention, has shown that there is no evidence of improved crime resolution statistics once data retention is enacted. Law enforcement agencies have consistently claimed that the extra powers are needed, but they have failed to provide any concrete examples of why it is needed—and in fact it is to the contrary.


I was surprised to see that the Attorney-General was going on about how this is the way that Western nations are going. No, it is not. Western nations are actually going in the opposite direction. That is why I said in my opening remarks that this parliament is playing catch-up. The fact of the matter is: the European Union had a data retention directive on this in 2006. In 2006, John Howard was Australia's Prime Minister. I do not think he would even have had any idea of what data was doing at that particular time in terms of retention or in terms of the transformation of what it would do. That was in 2006. Since then, countries have been winding it back. In fact, the European Court of Justice found it is unconstitutional. Austria has used it—for theft, for drugs, for stalking, but not for terrorism. Poland has used the data, mostly for civil disputes and to assist in divorce cases. In Denmark it was given up in June this year. And Germany abandoned the legislation in 2010.


So it is not about national security. It is about collecting data on every Australian, for every law enforcement agency and regulatory compliance agency to use. You will get this surveillance capacity and this data being used for everything from crime to trivial infractions of various things, for the tax office, the ACCC, ASIC, fisheries, health compliance agencies, local government and even the RSPCA. There are any number of organisations which have accessed data for various reasons. That is where we will actually end up in this country. Once you are identified, once your data is there, it will be used. We cannot even know now what the secondary use of that data will be, either next week, next year or in two years' time—how you might be able to use that data or what it is actually for.


Then we go to the cost of it. This is an extraordinary thing—that we have the Labor Party agreeing with the Abbott government that we go ahead and conduct the collection of data on every Australian for two years, and we have no idea what it is going to cost and no evidence that it actually assists in doing anything about terrorism. This is an extraordinary lie to the Australian people that is being perpetrated.


Let us go to cost for a moment. We have no idea what it is going to cost. The companies and government agencies not only will need to store the data but have to ensure it is stored safely. As I said before, how do we know that it is even going to end up being stored here?


It will be very attractive, for the reasons I indicated earlier, to hackers, and I want to know how the government is going to guarantee, if the data is not stored in Australia, how it will meet Australian privacy laws or will be protected from hacking. But let us go to the actual cost. What is it likely to cost a year? We have had all this talk. We had a budget emergency; now we do not have a budget emergency. Last year's budget was to fix the emergency; this year's budget is going to be dull. It is very interesting the way that the news about the budget travels. But what is the cost? Australians deserve to know how much the government intends to contribute to the mass surveillance of the Australian population. How much money are we going to put up to have this surveillance on ourselves? Surely the parliament deserves to get an answer to that question. We do not have an answer to that question. And it is fundamentally wrong.


Then we get to this idea that, if you are not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to hide. That is what the Stasi said in East Germany as well. And it is what every police state has to say: 'We will follow you. We will do surveillance on you. But do not worry about it; if you have nothing to hide, it won't be a problem for you.' Well, we saw what happened with the Stasi in East Germany and we know about the chilling effect that this will have on people. It will mean, for example, that you will know who attends a protest rally, for example, anywhere; you will have their location, if they make a call or have their phone on them while they are there, as they attend that rally. What is it worth to a foreign government to know who has been there and which of their overseas students was at a rally against human rights abuses, for example? Who knows how anyone is going to use this data on particular individuals. So this idea that if you are not doing anything wrong you have nothing to hide is no excuse whatsoever for this invasion of people's privacy.


When you get to the issue of trusting our government bureaucracies and intelligence agencies, what about the scrutiny? What about the oversight that we need? You know that if there is not proper oversight you will have corruption and you will have creep in what this data will be used for. Today people are deciding which agencies can access it but, as I indicated, the Attorney-General can change that anytime—add new agencies add different levels of surveillance—and that is where we will end up on this. 


When we get to looking at this as an overall objective in Australia, I think it is really sad that we have got to the point that we are legislating without evidence. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,26,1
"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-03-24,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (18:23):  I rise to speak to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015. The current bill has brought deep concern to many Australians—and rightly so, because it raises complex and concerning issues, especially in relation to privacy, freedom of expression and media freedom. 


I have had my own deep concerns about this legislation and I know some of my Labor colleagues—such as the member for Chifley, the member for Fremantle, the member for Charlton and other Labor colleagues as well—have had similarly deep concerns. I have wrestled with these issues, because data retention is a complex global issue but an issue that has to be dealt with in this era of advanced technology. 


It is not a surprise that these are concerning issues. Communications data can reveal quite personal information about an individual. Without the content of the data being made available, it can reveal who a person is in contact with, how often and where. But we are informed that this bill is needed to ensure that our law enforcement agencies can keep pace with the rapidly evolving telecommunications technology and services. 


I agree wholeheartedly with the comments of former Senator John Faulkner who said:


The Australian Parliament's … must ensure our intelligence and security agencies have the necessary powers and resources to protect Australian citizens and Australian interests. However, these powers can impinge on the values and freedoms on which our democracy is founded … which Australian citizens rightly expect Parliament to protect.


So Parliament must strike a balance between our security imperatives and our liberties and freedoms.


Key to achieving this balance is strong and effective accountability.


Therein lies the essence of what this debate is all about and what we as parliamentarians must try and strive to achieve.


So what we have before us now follows amendments that were brought through the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. They have done a great deal of work to improve the bill the government presented last year—which I think can be regarded as a shell of a bill—making it into something which now is trying very hard to get that balance right. 


On that, I would like to thank my Labor colleagues for their work. They have closely reviewed and rewritten this legislation. After months of work, their approach to the issue has led to a much improved piece of legislation being presented for debate, and that is what we have currently before us here in the Senate: significant minor, technical and consequential amendments to clarify the intent of the bill; limiting the dataset required to be retained under the scheme to that which is prescribed in the bill itself, rather than allowing the dataset to be prescribed by regulation. These are just some of the things my Labor colleagues achieved through that joint committee. 


Labor has insisted on significant improvements to oversight and transparency through the PJCIS inquiry into this bill, and the work of that Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has led of course to the 38 recommendations for inclusion in this legislation. These amendments, including protections for journalists, have been absolutely crucial to the substance of this bill. 


The work of the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for communications, the shadow Attorney-General and my Labor colleagues in pursuing the government for these amendments to be included has meant that today we are debating legislation of a much greater quality than what we saw last year. So I thank them wholeheartedly for the work they have done but also for their consultative approach to this issue, which has been part of our Labor caucus. 


Looking at the substantive matter of this bill, examining the issues seriously and exploring all the options available to achieve a balance between the public interest in granting access to metadata and the protection of privacy rights, has been critical. In fact that is the critical factor when we debate this bill. That has been the focus from the outset for the Labor opposition. 


The storage of data onshore, protections for journalists to ensure freedom of speech is preserved, the inclusion of privacy alerts and the importance of oversight have helped shape my position from one of having great concern to one where I am comfortable with the outcomes that have been now delivered through that process and into this legislation. As I said at the outset, it was a difficult issue at the beginning, but what we have before us now is a much more substantial bill than that which was provided to the parliament last year.

Senator SINGH:
  I return to highlight the important factors that have helped to shape my position on this piece of legislation, and I want to list the improvements that have been made through Labor's input and through the process of the PJCIS inquiry. They include: listing of dataset in the bill so that we know what data is retained; limiting access to telecommunications data to those enforcement agencies specified in the bill; oversight of the operational use of this legislation by parliament's intelligence committee, the first time that committee has been given this power; authorising ASIC and the ACCC to access telecommunications data to assist in the investigation and prosecution of white-collar crime; requiring telecommunications companies to provide customers access to their own telecommunications data upon request; requiring stored data to be encrypted to protect the security and the integrity of personal information; prohibiting access to telecommunications data for the purpose of civil proceedings, such as preventing its use in copyright enforcement; requiring the mandatory data breach notification scheme to ensure telecommunications companies notify consumers if the security of their telecommunications data is breached—I currently have a private senator's bill in this place on this very matter. Other improvements are: increasing the resources of the Ombudsman to strengthen the oversight of the mandatory data retention scheme; and a mandatory review of the data retention scheme by no later than four years from the commencement of this legislation. All these factors are improvements that have helped to shape my position.


I do want to go into some further detail on a number of those issues, and the first of them relates to data storage. Protecting the cloud of data collected under this legislation is critical to the privacy of individuals. The storage of data needs to remain under Australia's jurisdiction to ensure that it is regulated by Australian law. On the eve of the data retention changes being reintroduced into the parliament, the former Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Mr David Irvine, voiced his concerns clearly about where Australians' data should be stored in the cloud. He described himself as a 'cyber nationalist' when it came to the position of the cloud. He is correct: metadata provides knowledge of an individual whom this country has a duty to protect. In that sense I also describe myself as a 'cyber nationalist'. The issue of the location of stored data is one of concern not just to myself or not just to Labor, but to the broader Australian public as well. I am pleased that this matter is currently being examined as part of the telecommunications sector security reform, TSSR.


Mr Irvine said there had to be awareness in government, business and with private individuals of the fact that the internet world had brought huge benefits but it had created all sorts of vulnerabilities. He said:


We should be trying to develop for Australia, particularly for government and industry, the ability to manage national data on a national basis, with international hook-ups of course, but then it can be subject to national law, which can be privacy law and national security considerations. 


He also said:


Our ability to use metadata is just as important in eliminating people from suspicion as it is from incriminating them.


I think that really highlights the importance of onshore data storage. 


We are informed that this bill is going through another process to address that important issue. This bill raises another issue—which may come as a surprise to many Australian citizens—about who has access to data. There are currently more than 80 agencies, including many local councils and other organisations that can already access data without a warrant, and that is of quite grave concern. My understanding is that access to this data has grown over the years and now the types of agencies which can apply to access this data include Centrelink, the RSPCA and even Harness Racing New South Wales. Not many Australians would be aware of that. This bill addresses the issue and confines access to law enforcement agencies, and that is an important improvement that has been made in this bill. Having such a broad definition of the agencies that can authorise themselves to access your metadata, my metadata, I think is a problem. This bill very much deals with that issue. Limiting access to criminal law enforcement agencies specifically prescribed in the bill, rather than by an open-ended definition, and authorising ASIC and the ACCC to access metadata to facilitate the prosecution of white-collar crime I think is a better outcome. As I have said, Labor's position is that there should be onshore data storage of that metadata. 


Another improvement made to this bill is in relation to the protection of journalists. The protection of journalists and their sources along with freedom of the press have been issues of particular concern to Labor. The Australian Federal Police have confirmed for the first time that they have accessed journalists' telecommunications metadata in the past 18 months, but said that the requests were 'rare'. Under the new laws, a public interest advocate, who will be able to contest police applications for warrants to identify a journalist's source, will be created. That is a great improvement to the current regime. Allowing a list of security-cleared barristers to argue the public interest case before judges deciding whether government agencies should be allowed to access journalists' metadata is important—and to argue the public interest case as a judge weighs that consideration against national security interests in deciding whether to issue such a warrant is the substance of it. Of course, there will be a presumption against issuing the warrant, and agencies must prove that the public interest in issuing the warrant outweighs the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the identity of the journalist's source.


One other issue I want to highlight is that Labor has advocated for the inclusion of a system of mandatory notifications of data breaches or privacy alerts, a system of mandatory notifications similar to those contained in the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill, which I introduced into the Senate in 2014 on behalf of the Labor Party. I am pleased that that system, introducing a new consumer privacy protection for Australians that will keep their personal information more secure in this digital age, forms part of this bill. Time and time again, we have heard examples of data breaches like that by the immigration department, where some 10,000 asylum seekers' details were accidentally breached as far as their security was concerned. It is important that, following the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in 2008, those changes will finally be addressed in this bill. At the time we were debating my private senator's bill in this place, I was disappointed that it seemed that government senators were not going to support it. I am glad that they have seen the light.


I have raised a number of other aspects of this legislation that are great improvements. But, overall, regardless of those improvements—and they are very good—this bill was introduced very speedily and the government showed too little concern for the substance of the bill and the importance of getting it right. That is clearly on record with the bill that the government first introduced late last year. The government should have taken a different approach to this important piece of national reform dealing with security, privacy and our freedoms. There should have been a review of the data access regime, for example. Investigation should have been undertaken into whether warrantless access should have been allowed to continue at all. There has not been time to debate and go further into those issues because this government rushed this legislation into the parliament last year and has continued to rush it through the parliament this week. What we do have has gone through a very careful improvement in its design, due to the fact that my Labor colleagues on the PJCIS put in the effort and paid it the concern that was needed. 


I will finish with a comment by former Senator John Faulkner, a former defence minister and someone who has very strong values in relation to freedom and privacy issues. He said that parliament must always strike the right balance between our security imperatives and our liberties and freedoms. That is what this bill should achieve.  With any review in the future, that must always be at the forefront.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,26,1
"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2015-03-24,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (19:13):  The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015 should not be passed. My colleagues Greens senators Scott Ludlam, Christine Milne and Penny Wright have set out a very clear case as to why this bill should not be passed. The way in which the Liberal, National and Labor parties have colluded to rush through parliament this bill, which creates the government's mass surveillance regime, is a disgrace. It is a result of an ugly backroom deal between these parties. 


By the government's own admission, mandatory data retention alters the balance between government and individuals when it comes to their right to privacy. The best the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have come up with to justify their antidemocratic deal on internet and smartphone surveillance laws is to say, 'Just trust us.' They want us to trust a government which has broken election promise after election promise. They want us to trust a government which has shouted down any attempt to hold it to account and which has publicly savaged statutory bodies and human rights watchdogs for simply doing their job. We have to ask: why do Labor want us to trust this Liberal-National government? Our colleagues in the House of Representatives were contemptuously given just 30 minutes to debate 74 amendments, denying the public and parliament a chance to scrutinise this backroom deal between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and opposition leader Bill Shorten.


The bill now before this chamber should hold the government to account, but, no, instead it effectively waves through mass surveillance of Australian citizens. We know that because we have heard the opposition and the government saying, 'It'll be right. Just trust us.' There are a number of questions that remain unanswered as the government tries to ram these changes through.


There has been a lot of hyperventilating and hyperbole from the Prime Minister, who has all but claimed that law enforcement will halt without warrantless access to metadata and mass surveillance of our citizens. That is clearly ridiculous. It is just a new form of the law-and-order campaign that we have seen wheeled out by conservative governments, particularly at a state level but increasingly at a federal level, on national security. They are now using metadata in a similar way.


It is clear that the amendments agreed to by the Prime Minister and the opposition leader do not implement the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security or address the concerns that have been raised. Labor rolled over. Why? We still have not got to the bottom of that. On an issue as serious as giving security agencies additional rights and powers over people's smartphones and internet records, the Labor, Liberal and National parties, as I said before, are saying, 'Just trust us.' But that raises a number of key questions. Where will the data be stored? Will it be subject to foreign laws? How does the government define a journalist and a journalist's source? Will the data be deleted after the mandatory period? If so, how? Will the data be secure from cyberattacks? But the answer we are getting is, 'Just trust us.'


We have already seen how this sort of metadata can be abused. The existing Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act allows law enforcement authorities in Australia to access some categories of metadata from certain ISPs and telcos. However, a laundry list of other organisations have gained access to the metadata for undisclosed purposes, including Centrelink, the Western Australian Department of Fisheries, Racing Queensland, the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission, the Victorian taxi directorate, various local councils, the RSPCA and the Office of Environment and Heritage. I will come to the issue to do with the ABCC shortly.


It is open season on metadata already. Already under the current law there is the ability to do so much of what the government says that it needs to achieve. Three hundred and forty thousand warrantless accesses took place in the 2012-13 financial year, and that was before a mandatory data retention regime was in place. My colleague Senator Scott Ludlam set out very clearly the issue about the number of warrants that are out there. The evidence about metadata requests under the current regime shows that a massive number have nothing to do with solving serious crime but instead relate to petty requests by agencies, including the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink, to track what ordinary Australians not suspected of any serious crime are doing. Again, this highlights the dangerous territory the Labor, Liberal and National parties are taking us into.


The Attorney-General has pointed out that this bill does not change the existing arrangements, and that is precisely the problem. It welds on two years worth of additional data which can be indiscriminately accessed by agencies. This is despite the fact that evidence shows that most law enforcement metadata requests are for short-term data, meaning within three months rather than two years. Now, under the new legislation, the Attorney-General will also be able to add to the list of agencies with access to our data. Senator Ludlam called this 'scope creep', and that is what you see all over this legislation.


Very relevant to the debate is to note that the now-defunct Australian Building and Construction Commission received a total of 77 authorisations for data through the T(IA) Act between 2007 and 2012. The Fair Work Building and Construction agency, which replaced the ABCC following a successful union campaign, received one authorisation in the 2012-13 financial year. We know the Abbott government is trying to reinstate the ABCC. That is one of the issues right at the top of its agenda. It also flagged in November 2014 that it is considering another agency with similar powers to ASIC dedicated to monitoring unions. Both of these organisations, like the ABCC before them, may be able to access the metadata of union officials and union members. This is a very frightening aspect of the bill. Again, what Labor have signed off on, considering they say they are so deeply against the ABCC, is very troubling. We need to look at these bills together and what this government is up to. As I said, it is a frightening aspect of this bill that the government will supercharge its anti-union attack legislation with these anti-democratic measures that we are making tonight. Again, that has to be emphasised so strongly—that Labor are hand in hand with this government in bringing forward legislation that, as we look into it more and more, we can see is like a twin of the ABCC legislation.


The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance has voiced concerns on behalf of its members on the chilling effect that the Abbott-Shorten deal will have on journalism in this country. While the Labor Party has claimed it wants to protect journalists and their sources, its deal with the government fails to deliver on this. As the MEAA has said, the requirement to get a warrant to access data of journalists still ignores the key ethical obligation of journalists to not allow their confidential sources to be revealed. While journalists worldwide have faced jail in upholding this obligation, mandatory data retention means it is no longer their decision. Journalists in Australia can no longer guarantee their sources and whistleblowers that they will be protected. Journalists, understandably, are concerned that this law is anti investigative journalism and anti whistleblowers.


I think we need to take a pause here. We need to consider what this means for investigative journalism and a free and open media in this country. So often we hear people in this place espousing the importance of a free media, but this bill puts that at threat. Again, this is a key consideration that should be at the top of this debate. We do not need to wait until we see whistleblowers hauled before courts for exposing dishonesty, fraud, waste or corruption to know that this bill is wrong. Investigations will not go ahead. Whistleblowers will hesitate. Courageous public servants will wonder if they should speak out. Reporters will decide that they do not want to put the people they depend on for their stories at risk. That is how we expect this to play out. 


The public-interest advocate, which is to be set up to oversee metadata searches on journalists' data, is no solution. For example, there are no rules requiring the Attorney-General to seek the views of the PIA or for the PIA to argue against warrants being issued for journalists' metadata. In addition, it is an offence involving two years jail for anyone to disclose that a warrant for metadata has been requested or applied. This is compounded by the fact that, in today's environment, we see a fragmentation of journalism and the greater need of protection for acts of journalism—acts by the likes of Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning. In fact, the protections—such as they are—may not apply to many of the new players in the media landscape, such as bloggers. 


This prompts the question: who is really protected by mandatory data retention? In the rush to pass data retention, the government has failed to demonstrate how it will achieve even its own stated goals. The Attorney-General's Department could provide no evidence from anywhere in the world that mandatory data retention improves community safety or helps reduce crime. There you have it: no proof that it will improve our safety or reduce crime. Why is this being done? That is why you have to go back and look at the organisations that will access this. 


The government still has not defined the metadata it wants industry to store, and it wants to change the definition on a whim. Law-enforcement agencies have consistently claimed that the extra powers are needed, without providing concrete examples of why they are needed. For example, why is it that we need to retain data for two years, when evidence shows that most law-enforcement metadata requests are for much shorter-term data, usually within three months? Evasion of the scheme is easy for anyone with ill intent. Virtual private networks are easy to set up and use, while something as simple as using a Gmail account can put one outside of the scheme jurisdiction. However, while those who may wish harm can easily bypass the scheme, all Australians will be subject to surveillance. It is wrong to assume that only those engaged in criminal activity will be affected by this surveillance. 


The recent New South Wales parliamentary inquiry into police surveillance of other police officers underlines how irresponsible this legislation is. We cannot rely on police to determine issues to do with the surveillance of the public, with no external oversight. The New South Wales inquiry has revealed extensive abuses of how surveillance warrants have been issued and abuses by police using their resources to spy on other police and journalists. The inquiry found that TV reporter Steve Barrett was targeted by crime agencies, with dozens of improperly obtained covert surveillance warrants, between 1999 and 2000. 


The inquiry uncovered a series of warrants rubber-stamped by the Supreme Court. In one case, there was zero supporting evidence for 46 of the 114 targets on a single covert surveillance warrant. A former judge admitted that that there was no way to properly check that the warrants were in order. He resorted to checking for obvious errors, like inclusion of the names 'M Mouse' or 'D Duck' before he signed off. That is serious; that is what he said. Despite an inundation of warrants, he could not remember refusing a single one. I set that out in detail because this is from an inquiry about police surveillance, where they could not get it right and where there was no accountability, standards or external involvement. It shows what we are walking into. Those abuses by police officers have been revealed, but did the Attorney-General take any notice or learn any lessons? Clearly, that has not occurred. The Attorney-General is ready to give police and security forces unprecedented access to endless quantities of data, to intensify surveillance in such an extreme way. 


Then there is the still unresolved issue of who will actually pay for this surveillance. Senator Ludlam set out this out very clearly. He detailed the important letter, which came just last week, from a number of telecommunication companies, setting out how much this is going to cost. That is a very relevant part of the debate. The Australian government will not say who will be paying this surveillance tax. What we do know is that the public will end up paying, either with higher data changes or through higher taxes. 


The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties is one of the many groups that have provided in-depth analysis on the dangers of this bill. They have stated in some of their material:


It is not acceptable for ASIO, the AFP, police forces and other agencies to be able to access the extensive metadata of citizens on their own internal authorisation. The bill allows them to do just this—albeit within some parameters. Legal experts and organisations, civil liberties, privacy and human rights groups among others, argued the need for a warrant system—a longstanding safeguard within our legal system. The intelligence and security agencies argued—successfully it seems—that any form of warrant system would impose too great a logistical and bureaucratic operational constraint.


It would seem the self-serve system is to continue and long standing safeguards to be sacrificed.


This is a mistake and will lead to misuse, abuse and overuse of this data. The post-hoc safeguards proposed will not be adequate to protect against these outcomes.


I do urge senators to look up, in full, the material on this issue from the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties.


Big Brother has become 'Big George' in this situation, and 'Big George' works hard to keep a straight face as he spouts his justification for these extreme laws, saying, 'Those who have nothing to hide, have nothing to fear.'




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: if 'Big George' refers to Senator Brandis, the senator should withdraw the remark, call the senator by his correct title and, if she feels so inclined, apologise.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Rhiannon, if you have been referring to the Attorney-General, I would invite you to refer to him by his correct title.




Senator RHIANNON:
  Thank you for the advice, Mr Acting Deputy President. With regard to the issue of collecting metadata, what the Attorney-General is doing to his own office is very concerning. The standing of the Attorney-General is very important to the whole nation in terms of the upholding of justice. We have already seen abuses of metadata. When the Australian intelligence agencies were interested in the phones of the former Indonesian President and his wife—leading figures in Indonesia—it was an issue of metadata. Again, that shows how these services have been abusing the use of that data.


Ever since the terrorist attack of September 2001, crime, spy and security agencies have been demanding more and more powers to reach into our private individual lives. This incursion for mandatory metadata retention will not make us safer or more secure. Mandatory data retention strikes at the very heart of the relationship between governments and the public. This bill, which is set to be passed on the combined vote of the Liberal, National and Labor parties, is an enormous setback as it delivers an increase in the power of the state over private individuals for indiscriminate surveillance. The campaign to stop this level of surveillance and to have this bill repealed is I believe set to become one of the most important issues in Australia.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-03-24,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (19:32):  I rise to oppose passage of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014. I do so despite the fact that there are 10 amendments circulating in my name. These amendments will do the following: (1) require a warrant not just for access to journalists' metadata but also for access to the metadata of lawyers and medical professionals—lawyers have expressed particular concern about threats to legal professional privilege; (2)  use the definition of 'journalist' in the Commonwealth Evidence Act so that freelancers are protected by Labor's warrants regime; (3) reduce the period of data retention from two years to three months, consistent with commercial practice among ISPs; (4) limit the use of retained data to serious criminal offences; (5) remove ASIC and the ACCC from the list of law enforcement agencies; (6) provide for a warrants regime that protects members of the general public; (7) ensure a definition of 'content' is included in the bill; (8) ensure that the most invasive parts of the bill will sunset rather than being merely reviewed by a committee that includes no crossbenchers or Greens; (9) prevent the addition of further agencies to the list of law enforcement agencies in order to halt creeping government overreach; and (10) provide that the penalty for disclosure of a warrant is reduced significantly from the current two years imprisonment and subject to a public interest test.


I wish to make it very clear that even if all my amendments were to pass—in addition to those proposed by Senators Ludlam, Xenophon and Wang—this would still be bad law. I recognise that I am on the losing side in this matter, so I propose to do two things here. First, I want to explain why one does not protect a free society by legislating liberty away. Secondly, since so few people seem to understand what this bill purports to do, I will explain exactly what it means in practical terms. Everyone has something to hide, and something to fear, from mandatory data retention. It is one thing to require monitoring of certain individuals where there is reasonable cause; but the idea that the government needs to store everyone's metadata without cause, including my 84-year-old mother's, should not be countenanced.


Data retention will do nothing to save us from terrorists. Paedophiles are already canny enough to use the 'dark net' and avoid it. Data retention instead places the entire population under surveillance no matter who they are or how blameless their lives. And thanks to its sheer volume, it will make terrorism harder, not easier, to track. This emerged in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in France; in fact, even real-time collection of targeted metadata was of no benefit to France's police. For the record, I have no problem with data retention when it comes to genuine suspects. But what the attacks in France show is that sifting through data is difficult. It places a significant burden on law enforcement. In France the perpetrators were dropped from watch lists. Finding a needle in a haystack is not made any easier by adding more hay to the stack.


ISPs such as iiNet, TPG and iPrimus, along with Telstra and Optus, will also be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in storage costs, which raises the obvious question: who pays? This bill, as amended—thanks to the PJCIS report—now provides for the Commonwealth to make financial assistance available to ISPs to help pay for this wretched scheme. When you hear the word 'Commonwealth', remember, it really means 'taxpayer'. Wonderful—we will pay for the privilege of being spied on through our phone bills and through our taxes! And we really are talking about everyone—Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, Chief of the Defence Force; Duncan Lewis, the head of ASIO; and Prime Minister Tony Abbott. And unless the bill is amended to ensure data is retained in Australia, it may be simpler to bundle up two years worth of all our personal information and send it directly to the Chinese. After all, cloud storage is cheaper over there and access will not be subject to Australian law.


Then there is the basic reality that the government already has substantial powers to deal with terrorists and paedophiles. Apart from the fact, as Bret Walker SC often points out, that violence and conspiracy to commit violence have always been crimes, Australia's security agencies have extensive surveillance powers. They can, for example, obtain data preservation orders, ensuring metadata is retained and an individual's activities on the internet are examined. They can obtain warrants to intercept phone calls. People can be held and compelled to answer questions. Preventative detention orders and control orders, without any crime having been committed, restrain people from leaving their homes, if it is suspected they may commit a crime in the future. Passports can be cancelled. These powers are already so over the top that there is a serious case to be made that they are incompatible with the rule of law in a liberal democracy. Preventative detention orders and control orders, for example, are a direct assault on the presumption of innocence. They allow people to be locked up without a finding of guilt. And this in 2015, the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, the source of the presumption of innocence at common law!


In preparing these remarks I tried to avoid references to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Too often banal developments are equated to this depressing future world. But in trying to describe the pervasive impact this law will have on our lives, there really is no better reference. In 1949, Orwell wrote of CCTV listening to our every word, in every room and alleyway. Had he imagined the advent of the internet and smartphones and the concept of metadata he would surely have written of the 'Ministry of Retention', tracking every step and every conversation with every device we use.


Government agencies already exploit the information they have about us in disturbing ways. In the year to June 2013, there were almost 320,000 authorisations to access telephone records, including 375 by Australia Post and 15 by Wyndham City Council, in Victoria. Stored data is a honeypot for intrusive snoops and bullies. And those are only the legal ones. That is why it is important to be aware that these immense data retention powers will not be used to fight terrorism. They are not really suited to that. As happened with the UK's Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, RIPA, it is likely they will be used for minor welfare fraud, unpaid parking fines and catching petrol stations engaging in the heinous crime of comparing petrol prices. The latter is especially likely now that the ACC and ASIC have been added to the list of law enforcement agencies.


The idea for data retention of this type came from Europe, which is why Europeans were the first to appreciate that its record in crime clear-up is poor. Germany's parliamentary research unit, for example, surveyed that country's crime statistics, between 2005 and 2010, and found no evidence to suggest that data retention helped solve serious crimes. It was marvellous, though, for catching people who did not pay their rates or who evaded road tolls.


In April last year, the European Court of Justice overturned the EU's Data Retention Directive, in large part because data retention makes life miserable for law-abiding citizens, while criminals dodge it.


 This bill shows government and opposition alike view ordinary people as criminals in waiting. Similar thinking in the past led to proposals for a national identity card to prove we officially exist and for national fingerprint and DNA databases to track us down when we inevitably offend.


What has been forgotten in all this is the fact that it is the state that poses the greatest threat to our freedom, not criminals and terrorists. It is the state that requires watching, not the people. We, the people, should hold the government to account. It is not a legitimate role of government to require us to account for ourselves, unless there is a reasonable suspicion that we have committed or are about to commit a crime.


For police forces across the land to so strongly support mandatory data retention, as their submissions to the PJCIS made clear, suggests they have all forgotten Peel's principles of policing, where the police are the public and the public are the police. ASIO's claim that data retention is justified, thanks to Edward Snowden's exposure of massive US government encroachment on privacy, is Orwellian.


And the claim by our own secret police, the Australian Crime Commission, that not having access to data is equivalent to having two hands tied behind their back, suggests the ACC is ineffectual and should be abolished. This would, of course, represent a considerable saving to the taxpayer.


It is high time that police and security agencies alike rediscovered their erstwhile status as public servants, not public masters. It would be helpful if they returned to real police work. It is legitimate to monitor the data of actual suspects, subject to appropriate oversight, as with traditional phone tapping, but it is not legitimate to treat every Australian as a potential criminal.


Now to my second point: what does mandatory data retention look like in practice? It has become clear to me that many people do not grasp just what this bill involves. Senator Ludlam has explained many of the technical aspects, and I mean no disrespect to him when I say that we need to better understand how it will work. Maybe what follows will convince a few brave souls to join those of us voting against this bill. And remember: mandatory data retention will apply to everyone, not just individuals of interest.


Late last year I undertook a controlled experiment. With the assistance of Mark White, of The Sydney Morning Herald, I had a technical firm record my metadata for a month to see what it revealed. This process deliberately avoided anything to do with my role as a senator. Before entering parliament I ran an agribusiness consulting company; I still have it. Data-monitoring equipment was installed in my business office and connected to the router. Because it only collected data relating to office traffic—my smartphone is tied to my job as a senator—there was no geographical information. This is important to bear in mind, because it was still spectacularly invasive. Without knowing any more than the company's name, in less than a day metadata revealed the business sector in which it operates. It was possible to work out which bank it uses, a record of its purchases, and a record of its staff's purchases—everything from furniture to renovations to compulsory third party insurance. Metadata also revealed how often and for how long staff used social media like Facebook, where they planned to go on holiday, what they wanted to buy for Christmas, and—chillingly—when a female member of staff knocked off early. As an employer, I have never been interested in monitoring people in this way. I have always taken a dim view of bosses who time their employees' loo and cigarette breaks. But at least a worker has a fighting chance of telling that person or company where to get off. Trying to tell the government—which is far more powerful than any employer, union, or professional association—where to get off is another kettle of fish completely.


Despite my desire to keep politics and business separate, metadata also revealed my membership of the Inner West Hunters Club and the subjects I and other members discussed in group emails, including gun law reform. I was not the only person identifiable, either—everyone who corresponded with me also had their identities revealed. It was possible to establish who was publicly in favour of gun law reform, and who was in favour of it privately but unwilling to say anything about the issue in public for, say, employment reasons. The possibilities for blackmail are obvious. Had the analysis included a smartphone, it would have been easy to leap to conclusions based on my location. What would a telephone call or Google search placed in front of a brothel, gay bar or abortion clinic reveal? That will be known from the metadata. Imagine if the caller were not me—with my classical liberal views—but a conservative Christian politician. What mischief could be had at his or her expense?


Yes, it is true that mandatory data retention is relatively easy to evade. My company could start using proxy servers, for example, and its staff could communicate with each other using wickr—which encrypts messages and destroys metadata—instead of normal text messaging. I have no doubt that many people—both criminal and not—will respond to passage of the bill in this way.


But why should a company concerned with the business of keeping animals healthy and crops productive be treated as though its employees are all potential criminals? Among other things, it has an interest in fertilisers. Terrorists use fertiliser. Do you see where this is leading? That is the nub of this issue. Mandatory data retention forces all of us to evade our own government. This is not how the system is supposed to work. What sets liberal democracies apart from authoritarian regimes of every stripe is the relationship between the citizen and the state. The citizen does not just enjoy the ability to 'kick the bums out' at election time. The citizen also has the capacity to hold the government to account, to reject its meddling in his or her life, to come and go as he or she pleases, to tell it where to get off, all subject to few or no controls. When we legislate those capacities away—allowing the state to hold the citizen to account, subjecting the citizen to state control—we then come to resemble the authoritarian regimes we are fond of criticising. Do we really wish to be spoken of in the same breath as Indonesia or Malaysia, whose citizens are monitored extensively and where there are widespread constraints on press freedom? And, make no mistake, these laws will persist, ripe and ready for future misuse by governments of every stripe.


This is bad law—law that compromises our rights and freedoms, treats us all as criminals-in-waiting, and invites abuse and overreach. It is wrong on every level. This bill should not be entertained in a liberal democracy such as ours.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-03-24,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (19:49):  I rise to briefly contribute to the debate on the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014. It is commonly known as the government bill which introduces the new metadata laws. I oppose this bill. The government has used the threat of a terrorist attack from Islamic State to grossly invade the privacy of every Australian. In an opinion piece in the Mercury newspaper Bruce Felmingham, the principal of a Tasmanian economic consulting firm, wrote:


There must be an exceptionally powerful argument for introducing such draconian laws in a pluralist, democratic society such as our own.


I agree with Mr Felmingham—and it is my view that the government has failed to make the argument for introduction of these draconian laws. It is my strong view that the government is misleading the Australian public over the government's capacity to respond to the threat posed by ISIS sympathisers and ISIS soldiers. This government already has the laws and the capacity to crack down on ISIS supporters if it chooses, and those laws are called sedition and treason. It is just that this government has chosen not to use existing laws to charge and put behind bars every Australian who assists in any way whatsoever our enemy the Islamic State and its members.


Why should the majority of law abiding Australians have their privacy invaded because a minority of our citizens have decided that their loyalties lay with a different country—with a different people? Why should the civil rights of law abiding Australians be lessened because some of our citizens decide to betray their country and give support and assistance to foreign powers that would do us harm? Instead of passing these laws, I am calling on this government to use the existing laws of sedition and treason to tackle terrorism—which I will turn to shortly.


I am also calling on this government, politicians and indeed all Australians to discriminate. My call to discriminate may alarm some, especially those who pride themselves on their level of political correctness, but the time has now come in Australia to discriminate against those whose loyalty is not 100 per cent to Australia. While I acknowledge that in Australia, by our law, you are not allowed to discriminate against anyone for his or her race, religion, ethnicity, sexuality and disabilities, it is a little known fact that Australian law—our Constitution—demands that we discriminate against citizens who are not 100 per cent loyal to this country. Senate Practice refers to section 44 of our Constitution, which indicates that anyone who has an allegiance to a foreign power—either formal or informal—is disqualified from standing for election to this place. Clearly, our Constitution and laws demand that even if your loyalty is divided between Australia and a friendly foreign power you are still legally discriminated against and you, correctly, are not allowed to stand for election in this place.


In order to stop the terrorist rot that has set into Australia it is time, firstly, to educate Australians. Rule No. 1: if you do not have 100 per cent loyalty to Australia and our democratic freedoms, rights and privileges then I will say it—and I will continue to say it—get out! As the Australian Constitution states, if you have an allegiance or loyalty to a foreign power not only should you be disqualified from standing for election to this parliament but also you should not be able to vote or to receive government benefits. If your allegiance happens to be with a hostile or foreign power—as is the allegiance of thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of Islamic Australians—then you should be charged with the high crimes of sedition and/or treason, depending on your level of support for our country's enemies. If the government were serious about stopping terrorist attacks on peace-loving, loyal Australians instead of introducing laws to take away our civil rights, then the government, through the Attorney-General, should enforce that every citizen who in any way assists the ISIS forces fighting our troops should face at least seven years maximum jail sentence for sedition.


I know this government is negligent by failing to use existing laws of sedition and treason. If you have the evidence to deny our citizens passports and travel, then you have the evidence to lay charges, at least, of sedition, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years in jail. If some of these young people who are running off to fight and assist ISIS were caught and made to face a serious charge, which carried a seven-year jail sentence, and they, their families and the communities they came from were made to think about the concept of 100 per cent loyalty to our country—a secular constitution and democratic government—then maybe we would be building a more tolerant, safe and free Australia for our children and grandchildren. That is the reverse of what this legislation is doing, which is taking away democratic civil rights and privileges and making us less safe from future home-grown tyrants.


The loyalty or not of citizens of Australia is an important part of the legislative and constitutional foundation of this nation. Those citizens with loyalties divided between Australia and foreign powers that are our enemies are a direct threat to our nation's peace and long-term survival. It is important to know that, in my view, you cannot be a 100 per cent loyal Australian with undivided loyalty if you support sharia law. If you support sharia law it is clear that your allegiance is, at the very least, with a foreign power—namely an overseas religious figure that exercises the powers of both state and church. At the very worst, if you support sharia law it is likely that your allegiance and loyalty is with an overseas religious figure who has declared war on Australia and every other Western democracy, simply because he wants to impose by force his religious rules and rules of state. 


If you do not believe me, just use your reason and look to countries which are ruled by sharia law. They are some of the most backward, violent, aggressive countries in the world, which have failed to separate church and state. They are ruled by religious dictators who promote the death penalty for crimes such as book burning, adultery, being gay and changing your religion. Some of those sharia governed countries may try and put up a window dressing of democracy. Countries like Iran might hold elections, but the reality is that all power—religious, state and military—rests in that one religious dictator who personally chooses all the candidates for the country's election. And God help the world if that Iranian leader is ever allowed to get his finger on a nuclear trigger! Confronting and admitting to ourselves the plain truth of the sharia ideology we are fighting will do more to make us and our children safe than will passing laws like this that will undermine the civil rights of all law-abiding Australians.


Introducing laws which reinstate the death penalty for terrorism and traitors who kill during their attacks will do more to prevent attacks against us from our enemies than this piece of rubbish legislation. If you disagree with that argument, I ask that you think about what would have happened if the Sydney ISIS terrorist had survived the Lindt Cafe siege after killing hostages. The worst our current legal system could have done is to have put him behind bars for life—a sentence he would have welcomed, I am sure, clapping gracefully. He would have been able to turn his jail cell into a terrorist-recruiting cell. Imposing the death penalty on terrorists and traitors who kill during their attacks on Australia will do more to protect the national security of Australia than this legislation will ever do. This legislation and the establishment of the capital equipment that stores the metadata will also cost the Australian taxpayer, and an unknown amount of money at that. Some people are saying it will be $400 million, but that does not appear to take into account the charges that will be levied on all Australian telecommunication users.


I have had community feedback and hundreds of people have contacted my office and expressed their opposition to this legislation. The following is an example of that opposition: 'Given that law-enforcement agencies are already able to apply for a warrant to access metadata for known suspects, I am curious to know just how mandatory data retention will be used.' 


Option 1: will the AFP or state police conduct random audits on Australian residents and citizens' metadata on the off-chance they find something suspicious? This clearly represents an unacceptable intrusion on the right to privacy and does not accord with a free and democratic country. It would be unacceptable to allow the police unfettered access to the metadata of people who are not engaged in or planning any criminal activity. 


Option 2: will the Australian federal police racially, religiously or culturally profile groups of people who they believe may be more likely to engage in terrorist-type activities or other criminal activities or people who are socially undesirable, and do regular checks on their metadata? All Australians, regardless of background and country of origin, should have a right to privacy. I would hope that the AFP and-or police would not engage in this kind of behaviour, but history has shown it to be inevitable. 


There are many examples of the police profiling groups of people based on who they are or their background and treating them unfavourably. For example, Indigenous people and those of ethnic origin are often treated worse than other Australians by the police, resulting in discrimination. If the coalition's proposed laws are passed, this will be a very real outcome of how the metadata will be used, leading to greater disunity in the community and further disenfranchising groups. Those who intend committing atrocities will find other ways to communicate or source information to get around any law change, and I fear that only innocent people will be affected.


Option 3: will the metadata be stored, at a huge cost to industry, until a suspect is identified and then that person's history for the past two years checked? This is the only option that I believe provides an acceptable use of the metadata. This option is already covered by existing laws. The Australian Federal Police and state police simply need to apply for a warrant before accessing the data.


I am struggling to think of any other ways that metadata may be used for law enforcement purposes. It may be noted that, internationally, mandatory data retention has not worked and no compelling arguments or evidence have been provided by the government as to why it would work in Australia. I would like to note that I find any act of terrorism devastating and fully support efforts to combat terrorist activities. However, any law change, particularly that which infringes on the rights of innocent people, must be backed up by evidence that it will actually bloody work. In the case of mandatory data retention, that is not the case.


In closing, it must be said that the mass storage of the metadata of all Australians is a huge invasion of the privacy of every Australian citizen. It is open to misuse and abuse, with no systems to monitor it or monitor whether other countries are hacking into storage facilities and using the data to spy on high-profile Australians and, even, the Australian government itself for both commercial and God knows what other reasons. This level of invasion of privacy, which will be committed on every Australian who uses online phone services, is completely over the top to achieve the purpose the government claims it will achieve. In order to catch a few hundred or thousand terrorists it wants essentially to search every Australian household in this nation via electronic devices.


Giving away this level of privacy of every Australian to that level of invasion by the government and its agencies no longer makes us a free society in my view and in the view of many courts and respected privacy advocates throughout the free world. I say this: I have a very, very strong suspicion that this is going to come back and bite the coalition. When it does there will be a few of us on this side standing up to say, 'I told you so!' I will be looking forward to that. I oppose this legislation.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-24,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (20:02):  I indicate my serious reservation about this legislation and its safeguards or, rather, its lack of adequate safeguards. We do have an existential threat in our nation with the threat of terrorism—I acknowledge that; I am acutely aware of it—but the issue is how you best tackle this threat. My concern is that this bill, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015, will have a number of consequences that will impact on the freedom of the press in this country, which will be unambiguously bad for our democracy. I am concerned that this bill will have the potential to cause serious harm to our democracy without appropriate checks and balances in place. I do recognise the need for legislation to adapt and change in response to new technologies, new political and social circumstances and, above all, threats to our security, but I believe such change should be measured, thought out and carefully considered. This is particularly the case when it comes to security and intelligence, which should have greater accountability and scrutiny than all others because of their greater capacity for abuse. It is interesting to reflect on remarks made by former Senator Faulkner, who put the very simple proposition when the counterterrorism legislation amendment, the foreign fighters bill, was in this place last year that enhanced power requires enhanced accountability. This is enhanced power because of the swoop of metadata storage. The capacity of the state to have everyone's online information, in terms of whom they have contacted, does carry with it a need for much greater scrutiny.


I am concerned in particular about the adverse impact of some of the measures in this legislation on journalists' ability to do their jobs. There is a line that has often been attributed to George Orwell:


Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed. The rest is public relations.


To me, this epitomises the essence of what journalism, at its very best, should be about. Journalism should provide the checks and balances, should hold public figures accountable for their actions and should inform the public and foster debate. There are countless examples of times when journalists have broken stories that were clearly in the public interest but those in power did not want that information to be disclosed. Look at Woodward and Bernstein's expose of Watergate; the Frost-Nixon interviews; the Spycatcher story, when our now Minister for Communications, as a barrister, very courageously defended Peter Wright; the coverage of detainees David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib; and the saga of Dr Mohamed Haneef. My concern is that the provisions in this bill will mean that journalists will no longer be able to investigate such stories because sources and whistleblowers will be too frightened to come forward and because, in some cases, to report on such things will be an offence punishable by imprisonment.


I acknowledge that the government and opposition attempted to address these concerns in relation to the access of journalists' metadata, but I must say I am very disappointed with the compromise that has been reached. The committee stage will give us an opportunity to explore that. With respect, the amendments moved in the House of Representatives do not go nearly far enough. We need to put this in the context that things go wrong. The authorities, our intelligence services, sometimes make mistakes and they need to be held accountable for that. For instance, on 18 February last year the Australian Federal Police raided the offices of the Seven Network in a very heavy-handed manner, as part of a proceeds-of-crime investigation related to a story on Schapelle Corby. Seven West Media chairman Kerry Stokes, the owner of the Seven Network, is big enough and, dare I say, ugly enough to look after himself. And he did, eventually getting an apology for his network from the AFP for executing search warrants, later quashed by the Federal Court, erroneously describing a Seven West lawyer a suspect in the case. But the botched raid shows that the authorities can make mistakes and that the ability for journalists to expose that may well be compromised by this.


The metadata bill will give the AFP and intelligence agencies very long arms to reach into our everyday lives to track our whereabouts and with whom we have been communicating. For journalists, they will require a warrant, but some fear it will be issued as a formality, and the very process of that warrant concerns me greatly. What kind of future are we ushering in for our democracy with this bill? I foreshadow that I will be moving some amendments in the committee stage in an attempt to fill a number of the gaps left by the government and opposition, and I will speak further on this at that stage.


I want to look at the intention of this bill as a whole. The Australian law has, in general, lagged far behind technological advancements. We see this in all sorts of areas, not just national security—the way we have failed to respond to regulation of online gambling, for example—but in this case the most significant matter we are looking at is the regulation of metadata. It is important to note that there is no legal definition of metadata in Australian law or, indeed, in this legislation. While it concerns metadata as it is generally understood, it outlines this under the term 'retained data'. In essence, metadata is everything but the content of a communication, so it includes the fact that I made a phone call at a certain time to a certain person but not what was said between the two parties. When you browse a webpage, however, the distinction between content and metadata disappears because it is all machine-produced and machine-understandable information about web resources. It is all metadata.


As Professor Clinton Fernandes from the University of New South Wales Centre for Cybersecurity said a few months ago: 'Metadata can be incredibly intrusive. For instance, if a woman rings her GP and then an abortion clinic and then her mum but not her boyfriend, you can probably figure out what's going on.' That is incredibly intrusive. Examples of metadata include the email address, the phone number, the voice over internet protocol number, the time and date of the communication, the general location of information such as cell tower data, information about the duration of the communication, and the names and addresses—home, postal and billing if they are different—of the parties.


Under current law, law enforcement agencies do not have to get a warrant to access metadata. They do, however, have to get a warrant to access content. Further, there are a huge number of organisations that can request metadata, and some of the examples that I have put out over the last couple of years include local councils, parking enforcement services and the RSPCA. I acknowledge that this bill tightens that access to law enforcement agencies, although organisations can come under that umbrella term if designated by the minister. But my question is: why shouldn't warrants be required for access to any metadata, but, more importantly, why shouldn't there be much stricter safeguards and protocols for journalists, who are an essential part of our democracy? A free press is at the very foundation of a democracy. Of course the police should be able to access metadata when investigating serious crimes or a terrorist plot in the making and, indeed, they should be able access that information quickly and efficiently, but why should journalists and whistleblowers, who invariably want to expose malfeasance, corruption or waste in government, be subject to the same rules as ISIS, or Daesh? Indeed, there are increasing calls from citizens around the country that the government should not have the right to access their data willy-nilly. That was the response that I got from an article that I wrote for The Drum not so long ago. The extent of information that can be gathered through metadata and the conclusions that can be drawn from it mean that, in some situations, content is almost superfluous.


The arguments put forward by some of my colleagues in this place, Senators Ludlam and Leyonhjelm in particular, have clearly dispelled the myth that metadata is less intrusive than content and so can safely be subject to a lesser level of control and scrutiny. The fact that both Senator Ludlam and Senator Leyonhjelm, on perhaps very different parts of the political spectrum, take this position indicates that this is an issue that goes beyond ideology. Many people are unaware of the scrutiny their information could be subject to both now and under this proposed legislation. The government are, in effect, asking the public to trust them with this information—to trust that it will not be misused or abused—even though there are not any measures to protect against this, as I see it. Historically, blind trust in government has not worked out well for democracy in general and individuals in particular.


The key potential drawbacks to the compromise that was reached between the government and the opposition on the public interest advocates are, firstly, that the public interest advocate cannot disclose any confidential information to the affected journalist or receive instructions from them about how to deal with it, thus limiting the journalist's ability to test any adverse evidence. Secondly, the playing field will be skewed in favour of the authorities. Unlike the authorities, such as the police, who have the resources, researchers and analysts, public interest advocates will lack the resources of an ordinary legal team for the purpose of mounting a proper case in secret. Thirdly, unlike that available to the police or those seeking the warrant on the journalist, who have a long corporate memory, the lack of a searchable database of secret judgements will mean that individual public interest advocates are unaware of what arguments are likely to sway the judge who decides whether to issue the warrant. Fourthly, public interest advocates may well have no power, as I see it, to call witnesses. Finally, the tactic that could be used of prejudicially late disclosure may eliminate the public interest advocate's practical ability to call evidence.


Contrast this bill with the approach in the United States of America, our closest ally. No-one can question their seriousness in tackling terrorism and threats to their citizens, particularly after the calamity of the terrorist attacks of 9/11. After a bungled attempt to obtain metadata from the Washington bureau of the Associated Press some two years ago, the US Attorney General, Eric Holder, issued comprehensive guidelines and protocols to protect journalists' sources. In the United States, media organisations and journalists are given advance notice of an attempt to obtain metadata and have the right to argue the public interest case before a decision is made. I will be moving amendments based on the American approach. Not only has this worked well but just two months ago Mr Holder, the US Attorney, issued new guidelines that further strengthened protections. Just this month, legislation was introduced to the UK's House of Commons which included draft codes of practice to protect journalists' sources where the public interest is also a primary consideration. Back home, it seems the approach to metadata by both the government and the opposition can be paraphrased this way, with apologies to Sting: every click you make, every keyboard stroke you take, the government will be watching you.


I just wanted to reflect briefly on the most recent terrorist attack that this country has had, the awful events of the Sydney siege. Some people say that Man Haron Monis was a madman. He may well have been a madman, but he was also a terrorist. He fulfilled the definition of a terrorist. I still do not understand why this man, with his appalling history of taunting the families of Australian soldiers who had died in service overseas, did not continue to be on a watch list; why this man, with a long history and string of sexual assault matters before the courts, was not still on the watch list; why this man, who was charged as an accessory before the fact of the murder of his wife, was still in the community; and why this man, who praised the work of ISIS and other terrorist groups and jihadists, was allowed on the streets. That does not involve metadata. That involves some decent intelligence work, some appropriate surveillance and, more importantly, information that should have been used and that should have been collated to prevent this man—both madman and terrorist—from doing the terrible harm that he did. Two innocent lives were lost, in my view, needlessly, and I will wait—of course, we need to wait—for what the New South Wales coroner will say.


These are important matters. The impact of this legislation on the free press in this country, in my view, will be chilling. We failed to have the same sorts of safeguards that the United States, our closest ally, has or, indeed, the broader safeguards that are in the process of being adopted in the United Kingdom. For that reason, I will be moving a number of amendments. I look forward to the committee stages of this bill. But I am deeply concerned that our democracy will be weakened as a result of the chilling impact this will have on journalists and their ability to do their valuable work.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-03-24,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (20:17):  I will take a moment to respond to the Greens second reading amendment before Senator Brandis winds up this debate. The Greens second reading amendment would defer consideration of this bill until the government provides a full response to the letter from the Communications Alliance tabled by Senator Ludlam today. That letter expressed concern about the government's contribution to costs of the scheme for industry. Labor does call on the government to work with industry to finalise arrangements around the costs of this scheme. We have been clear all along that the government should be transparent about the costs of this scheme with both industry and the public.


The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security made a number of recommendations about how costs would be met. Chief among them was that the government should meet a substantial proportion of those costs. However, there is no need to hold up this bill while final details of costs are settled. The government has assured us and the public that it will honour the committee's recommendations in full. I also note that the letter tabled by Senator Ludlam does not ask the government to delay this legislation.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (20:18):  In closing the second reading debate, I thank honourable senators for their contributions. In particular, I acknowledge the thoughtful contributions of Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Xenophon, and I will respond with particularity to certain of the issues which those two senators from the independent crossbench have raised. I see Senator Xenophon is still in the chamber. So let me say to you, Senator Xenophon, that anyone listening to the broadcast of this debate could be forgiven for thinking from some of the language that has fallen from the lips of Senator Xenophon or Senator Leyonhjelm and others who have spoken from the crossbench or from the Greens that this bill proposed an important or significant or even draconian new set of powers which the state would be able to exercise over the citizen. You would think that that was so from what those contributions suggested.


I can tell you and those who may be listening to this broadcast tonight that this bill contains no powers exercisable by the state over the citizen. Not one. The only change that this bill makes to the relationship between the state and the citizen is to introduce safeguards in relation to the access of law enforcement agencies to metadata which were not there before. That is the only change this bill introduces to the relationship between the state and the citizen. Senator Leyonhjelm, whose libertarian principles I greatly respect, would be reassured to know that, whereas under existing law some 85 government agencies and even local councils and NGOs can access metadata, as a result of the bill before the chamber this evening, that number of agencies has been reduced to 21. Those 21 agencies—all of them law enforcement agencies—are set out in the bill, and they cannot be added to except by regulation, which is disallowable by this chamber. So, far from expanding the power and the reach of the state, this bill very significantly reduces the power and reach of the state by reducing by three-quarters the number of bodies which can access metadata without a warrant. 


It would shock you, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, to learn of some of the agencies which today can access metadata but, as a result of this bill, will no longer be able to do so. Some eight Commonwealth departments will no longer be able to do so. Australia Post will no longer be able to do so. The Clean Energy Regulator; the Office of Environment and Heritage of the New South Wales government; and municipal authorities including the Ipswich City Council, the Knox City Council and the Wyndham City Council can today access metadata. As a result of this bill, they will no longer be able to do so.


Would you believe, Mr Acting Deputy President, that even the RSPCA can today access metadata? But, as a result of this bill, they will no longer be able to do so, because this bill, by proposed section 110A, limits the agencies which can access metadata specifically to law enforcement agencies: the Australian Federal Police and the state and territory police forces; the anticorruption authorities in the states; and the principal economic regulators—ASIC, the ATO and the ACCC. All of those agencies of course can access metadata today, as can another 60-odd agencies or entities; as a result of this bill, they will be prohibited from doing so. So, far from expanding the power of the state over the individual, Senator Xenophon and Senator Leyonhjelm, this bill actually does the opposite.


It also introduces a provision that is not part of our law at the moment—that is, a large and detailed architecture of protection for journalists. There are no protections for journalists under existing law. There are none to prevent access to metadata concerning journalists or their sources. But, as a result of this bill, there are protections. And I have heard your critique of them, Senator Xenophon; I will deal with it in particularity during the committee-stage debate. I simply make the broad proposition that, whereas under existing law there are no protections for journalists and their sources in relation to metadata, under this bill there will be. How this bill can then be described as having a 'chilling effect' on the freedom of the press, when it introduces a protection of the freedom of the press which forms no part of the existing law, escapes me. 


As well, there are other protective mechanisms, Senator Xenophon. There is, for example, a new role given to the Commonwealth Ombudsman which does not exist under existing law, to ensure that access to metadata is not abused. There are additional powers of oversight given to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security which do not exist under the current law, to ensure that access to metadata is not abused. So, far from this being a bill that introduces draconian new powers, it introduces no new powers but extensive new safeguards.


Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, let me explain very simply why both sides of politics, after long deliberation, have concluded that there is a need for this legislation. For more than 20 years or so, telecommunications service providers and ISPs have collected the metadata of their clients as a business record—as a business record—because they needed it for billing purposes. That is why the metadata was stored, and it has been accessed by the 85 or more agencies and entities that I mentioned before, essentially for law enforcement or regulatory purposes. But, with the evolution of technology, the retirement of legacy systems and, in particular, the change in the billing practices of the telcos, it is no longer necessary for them to retain that metadata, so they are not doing so. But, as a result, the capacity of the law enforcement agencies to conduct criminal investigations, which are materially assisted by access to metadata, has been degraded. So the core provision of this bill is to impose upon telecommunications companies an obligation to retain the metadata that they hitherto had retained anyway for two years. What the bill does, in effect, is freezes the status quo. 


So, not only does the bill contain no new powers of the state against the citizen, not only does the bill contain protections which do not exist under existing law; what the bill does in relation to the telcos is it freezes a status quo which has existed for the last two decades and about which we have heard no complaint from those who have suddenly and rhetorically seen fit to claim, erroneously, that the bill contains draconian new powers.


Let me turn to another error, which came from Senator Xenophon, I am sorry to say, and from others who have spoken in this debate—that, as a result of this bill, 'The government will hold our metadata.' No, it will not, Senator Xenophon. The government will not hold metadata as a result of this bill. What this bill does is mandates private industry to retain metadata that it currently retains. It is the private sector, not the government, that will retain the information, the metadata, that it actually currently retains. You praise the American system, Senator Xenophon, but you do not refer to the fact that, in the American system, government agencies hold metadata. But, under our system, no government agency holds metadata. The 21 agencies listed in proposed section 110A of the bill will have access to that metadata on the same basis that they currently do, but with additional safeguards. But that is all.


Let me turn to the claim that has been made, in particular in Senator Ludlam's contribution, that this legislation has been rushed and that there has been insufficient deliberation. Well, Senator Ludlam, I do not know what you think is rushed, but the process by which this legislation was developed was initiated in May 2012—almost three years ago—when my predecessor, then Attorney-General Roxon, sent a reference to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, asking it to review, among other things, the applicability in Australia of the European Data Protection Directive. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, of which I was a member during the last parliament, deliberated at great length throughout the rest of 2012 and the early months of 2013. In May 2013 it produced a unanimous report after a year of deliberation, in which there seemed to me to be endless hearings—the hearings are actually listed in the appendices to the report. It received thousands of pages of submissions. The PJCIS produced this unanimous report. Then, with the change of government and acting upon the unanimous report that was tabled during the period of the previous Labor government, my department developed this bill.


The bill was introduced by my colleague, Mr Malcolm Turnbull—who is not well-known for his authoritarian propensities, I might say—into the House of Representatives on 30 October last year. The bill was referred back to the same committee, which, now under the chairmanship of Mr Dan Tehan, the member for Wannon, deliberated at great length again—in particular during the Christmas period—and on 27 February produced a detailed report with 38 recommendations, many of which involved amendments to the bill, plus a 39th recommendation that the bill be passed. That report was also unanimous. The government, having considered that unanimous report of the PJCIS decided to adopt all of the recommendations of the report. We have the balance of this week—for many hours to come—to debate the bill in the committee stage. So far from being rushed, it cannot honestly be said that that is so, when this is the work of two parliaments, of two successive governments, of two long inquiries by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, spanning almost three years.


Let me, in the time left to me, turn to—though we will return to it more detail—the claim that we heard from Senator Xenophon that this will have a chill effect on freedom of the press. Well, Senator Xenophon, about a quarter of the bill, about 20 pages, is devoted to a very extensive architecture of protections of the very thing about which you claim to care but which under existing law has no protection is at all—none at all. Division 4C is devoted to the matter. To respond to your claims, Senator, that you fear that a rubber-stamp approach might be taken to approvals, we have a long series of criteria about which the minister must be satisfied and then a long series of criteria in relation to which a court must be satisfied and, uniquely in my experience in Commonwealth law, we have the creation of the special statutory office—a public-interest advocate who can appear and argue where appropriate that it is not in the public interest that a warrant be issued in relation to a journalist or a journalist's source. At the moment, access to metadata by some 85 agencies and entities is warrantless. This legislation introduces a requirement for a warrant, where none existed before; a more complex series of preconditions and the procedural steps and criteria for the issue of the warrant, where none existed before; and a unique provision for a public-interest advocate, which is unknown in any other area of Commonwealth law enforcement where warrants are required.


It is being claimed by some, particularly from the Greens, that metadata has no utility. Senator Leyonhjelm said the same thing: that the retention of metadata has no investigative significance. I note what you say, Senator Leyonhjelm and Senators from the Greens, but that is not the view of those who actually have the responsibility for carrying out these investigations. As I have done many times, I refer you to the view of the much-respected former Director-General of ASIO, Mr David Irvine, who, when asked about the importance of metadata in the investigation of terrorist crime and terrorist networks, said that it was 'absolutely crucial', a view shared by the current Director-General of ASIO, Duncan Lewis, and by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. You may have a scepticism about the law enforcement authorities being interested in accreting to themselves more power, but, as I have pointed out to you, they do not have any additional powers under these laws—none. I, with all due respect to my colleagues, would rather rely on the professional judgement and advice of those who actually have the responsibility than on the wild rhetorical claims of certain senators with no professional experience in the field at all. Metadata is in fact used in every significant criminal, organised criminal, paedophile and terrorist investigation.


Finally, let me address the issue of cost, and I note Senator Ludlam's second reading amendment, which, of course, the government will oppose. The question of cost is a matter of discussion, and has been for some months now a matter of discussion, between government and industry. The government announced, as Mr Turnbull made clear in his second reading speech in the House of Representatives on 30 October, that the government will make a substantial contribution to the capital costs of industry in establishing a retention regime. In relation to the ongoing costs, a PricewaterhouseCoopers review has estimated that, even if there were to be no government funding, the average cost over 10 years would equate to between $1.83 and $6.12 per customer per annum, with a median price of $3.98 per customer per annum. That is not, it seems to me, with all due respect, Senator, a vast cost for what this legislation seeks to do to preserve—not to extend; in fact, in important ways to limit—an important investigative capability.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Ludlam be agreed to.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be now read a second time.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:49):  I might start with a couple of quick general questions that relate to cost since that was the second reading vote that just went down. My first question to the honourable Attorney-General is to ask him to give a sense of how the government sees a couple of issues that I suspect are related. One is the location of storage. We suspect other crossbench senators also have an amendment that relates to where this data will be stored. Is there is a requirement—and I do not believe there is—in the bill that it be stored here in Australia? I would expect on advice from the sector that that would potentially raise costs. I understand that where the material should be stored is something that the government is giving some consideration to as well as how the costs should be apportioned—such as directly funding telecommunications providers as opposed to letting costs wash through and there being potentially increased data charges or potentially not.


I am interested to know, firstly—and the Attorney-General is welcome to take these questions together, if he wishes—how the government proposes to resolve issues of cost as relayed in the letter from the Communications Alliance and obviously representative of concerns of the CEOs of major and minor telecommunications companies. Secondly, how does the Attorney-General see the issue of where the data is to be hosted and how that may affect considerations of cost?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (20:50):  In relation to the issue of cost, as I said in my contribution on the second reading of the bill, there have been long discussions between government and industry. The government has indicated that it will make a substantial contribution to capital cost. I refer you to the estimate in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report as to the likely average cost per customer per annum. Those discussions have not been finalised. Ultimately, this is a matter that will be determined in the budget process.


In relation to the locality of hosting the storage of data, the bill does not mandate a particular locality. It casts, as you know, an obligation on the ISPs to retain metadata. It is really quite a simple requirement. How they retain the metadata and where they retain the metadata is a matter for them; it is not mandated by the bill. The only thing that is mandated is the type of metadata that is to be retained and the duration of the retention obligation. One would expect that the ISPs would retain metadata in a manner and at a locality which was least costly to them.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:52):  I thank the Attorney-General for his concise answers. I refer to comments that were made quite recently by somebody the Attorney quoted a couple of times during his second reading contribution, Mr David Irvine, the former director-general of ASIO. He declared himself a 'data nationalist'—I think that was the phrase he used. He said that it was his concern that the material be hosted in Australia precisely so that we are not exposed to data-privacy regimes or otherwise of other countries. For example, if smaller service providers choose a Chinese cloud-hosting provider because they offer, as you observe, the lowest costs, that is something that concerns many people. It certainly concerns me, and it appears to also concern Mr Irvine. 


I wonder whether you think that issue has any validity. In the course of the various reviews that are occurring into the way that this bill is going to operate, I wonder whether the government's mind is closed to a requirement, as Mr Irvine proposes in his comments, to adopt a position of data nationalism. It is not one that sits comfortably with me, but I am interested to know whether or not the government has a fixed view on this.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (20:53):  Senator Ludlam, I start by pointing out to you that Mr Irvine's views about the location of cloud storages have been misrepresented. There is no more enthusiastic supporter of the bill in its current form than Mr David Irvine. I do not think he would mind me telling you that, when the bill passed the House of Representatives last week, I received a message from Mr Irvine expressing his happiness and satisfaction with the fact that the bill was through the House of Representatives and looking forward to its passage through the Senate this week. I am not accusing you of misrepresenting him, but I think a remark that Mr Irvine made has been rather taken out of context and exaggerated. Mr Irvine wants legislators, senators, to know that he supports this bill in its current form and is very happy with it.


On the broader issue, the government does not have a closed mind. Australian law currently permits companies to store personal information in the cloud or offshore, provided that the appropriate risk-management strategies are in place. But they are subject—as I imagine you would know, Senator Ludlam—to some obligations, particularly under the Privacy Act. That act requires them to take reasonable steps to notify consumers if their information will be disclosed to an overseas recipient and the countries where the information will be held, and to ensure that any overseas recipient of personal information does not breach the Australian privacy principles. 


As well, Senator Ludlam, you would be familiar with recommendation 36 of the 2015 PJCIS report, which recommends that the government introduce the telecommunications sector security reforms promptly. In the latter part of this year, that legislation will be introduced. The telecommunications sector security reforms will contain protections. It would, in particular, operate to provide a statutory framework for security agencies to work with industry to identify and mitigate security risks. Carriers and carriage-service providers would be required to manage security risks, including outsourcing and offshoring, by demonstrating effective control and competent supervision of their networks, the data on them and their facilities. The security framework would be based on a government and industry partnership to effectively manage national security risks and protect data stored and carried across telecommunications networks. So that is the answer to your question. There are, at the moment, under the Privacy Act, obligations, and there is in prospect, later this year, under the telecommunications sector security reforms, additional safeguards.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:56):  Just to follow up on the answer from the Attorney-General, it interests me that you are bringing in legislation that deals with the security issues, after the fact. Why did we not do that first, before you brought that in as it currently stands? I particularly want to go to what you have just said: that the companies will be required to give an undertaking that, if they store the data offshore, it would be compliant with Australia's privacy requirements. I am interested to know what auditing or enforcement of compliance there will be. A company could easily say, 'Yes, we undertake to be in compliance with Australia's privacy laws,' but store the data offshore. Who is going to audit it? Who is going to enforce it? Where is the compliance?

 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (20:57):  Senator Milne, you should read the bill. If you want to participate in this debate, it would really be helpful if you read the bill. If you had read the bill, you would be aware that there is an 18-month implementation period for this metadata-storage regime. Well before that 18-month implementation period has run its course, the telecommunications sector security reform legislation will have been enacted—subject, of course, to the will of the Senate—because it will be introduced and deliberated upon before the end of this calendar year. That is the answer to your first question. In relation to the second question, I do not understand that there is an audit function or obligation under the Privacy Act but, in preparing the TSSR legislation, I will bear in mind the observation that you have made.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (20:58):  On this issue that has been raised by Senator Ludlam and Senator Milne, I accept what the Attorney has said—that Mr Irvine, a former director-general of ASIO, welcomes this legislation and congratulated the Attorney for its passing. But Mr Irvine did say in the media that he is a cybernationalist when it comes to where you position the cloud. In fact, I asked the Attorney questions about this in question time last week. I appreciate the context that there will be further legislation to deal with these issues, in terms of the implementation of metadata. I ask the Attorney this particular question: does he broadly agree with the concerns of Mr Irvine—someone that he and many others in the committee have enormous respect for—that it is preferable for the cloud, in a sense, to be hovering over Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide rather than over Shanghai or Bangalore?


As a general principle can the Attorney-General indicate at this stage whether there will be a preference, from a policy point of view, that any storage should be controlled here in Australia, by Australian providers, rather than being offshore?

In relation to the broader issue, I really cannot add to what I said in response to Senator Ludlam's intervention.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (21:02):  Senator Brandis, I am just wondering if you could explain the thinking behind requiring a warrant for journalists metadata but not the metadata of others who have particular concerns about the privacy of their relationships. I refer in particular to lawyers, and their clients, and medical professionals. I have received representations from quite a range of legal professionals, including the Law Society of New South Wales, expressing concern that their metadata will be exposed to this regime without the protection provided to journalists via a warrant system.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:03):  The blunt answer to your question is that the government did not consider that it was necessary to have a special regime for journalists because this law is not about journalists. As I said in an interview with a media organisation early last week, this is a law about terrorists, organised criminals, paedophiles and people who are likely to be the subject of investigation by the police. Frankly, I am not acquainted with any journalists who are terrorists, organised criminals or paedophiles—and I do not think there are any; I am sure there are none. The 20 pages that have been introduced into this bill have been introduced really to put to rest what I consider to have been a false issue. But people, in good faith, were troubled by this—including your good self—in my view unnecessarily and unwarrantedly. Nevertheless, we have introduced this into the legislation.


In relation to members of the legal professional, there is a pretty clear answer to your question. This is a bill about metadata; it is not about the content of a communication. I can understand the argument that the metadata of, for argument's sake, a telephone connection between a journalist and a telephone number could identify a source. But what the law regarding lawyer-client privilege protects is legal advice, which is, of its very nature, content. The law relating to lawyer-client privilege does not protect or prevent a person from being asked, for example, whether he had engaged a lawyer or whether he had had a communication with a lawyer. The interest, the confidential information that that legal principle protects, is what the lawyer advised the client or what the client may have told the lawyer in the course of seeking advice and representation. So the whole basis of this legislation, which excludes content, means that legal advice or what passes between a lawyer and his client could never be captured by it.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (21:06):  I will frame the question a little differently in the context of something that I hesitate to say I know more about—in theory at least—than lawyer-client confidentiality, and that is medical professional confidentiality. Yes, you are right in saying that the content is not the subject of this legislation; it is the metadata. But the metadata includes the heading, for example, in an email. Suppose a doctor emailed somebody, stating, 'Your venereal disease test results'—they did not state what those results were, just simply, 'Your venereal disease test results'—how could it not be a serious imposition on both the doctor and particularly the patient to have that kind of information available without a warrant?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:07):  Senator Leyonhjelm, the answer to your question is that your premise is wrong, because that would be content. And it is not correct to say that the heading line on an email would be caught by this legislation. It is not, because that is content. So that is the simple answer to your question. More broadly, except where the states and territories may have made specific statutory provision, of which I am unaware, the relationship between doctor and patient is not protected in the way that the relationship between lawyer and client has traditionally been protected. So, for example, a doctor called to give evidence in the witness box could be required to disclose matters about a patient, which he only knew by reason of a professional consultation, whereas a lawyer could not be asked a question obliging him to disclose information provided to him by a client. The conceptual bases of lawyer-client privilege are quite different from the reasons the law does or, in this case, does not protect other relationships which, in the public arena, are regarded as confidential. Bear in mind also of course, Senator Leyonhjelm, that lawyer-client privilege is really an aspect of the rules of evidence. It is an aspect of the admissibility or exclusion of evidence in a proceeding before a court.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-03-24,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (21:09):  Perhaps if I could follow up on that issue around lawyer-client privilege, which has been raised very firmly by various legal commentators in Australia, including the Law Council. I would just like to ask the Attorney-General to respond in a bit more detail about issues that have specifically been raised by Mr Duncan McConnel, President of the Australian Law Council, who says that some of this information in relation to lawyer-client communications may, potentially, be caught under the bill. Firstly, I will quote from Mr McConnell. He says:


It is not difficult to envisage situations where client/lawyer telecommunications data would reveal a range of information that could compromise confidentiality and even legal professional privilege.


For example, what would happen if a whistle-blower seeks legal advice prior to, or during communication with a journalist? Under the proposed amendments, the journalist's communication may be confidential, but what of the communications between a journalist or the journalist's source and the lawyer?


Data could allow inferences to be drawn from whether a lawyer has been contacted; the identity and location of the client, lawyer and witnesses; the number of communications and type of communications between a lawyer and a client, witnesses and the duration of these communications …


So they may not go to content, as we understand it at this point in time, but they certainly go to the relationship, the manner, the occurrence, the time, the length and the number of communications that have occurred. He goes on to say:


The Law Council's position is simple—lawyer communications deserve the same level of protection to that afforded to journalists …


I suppose my question is: is that a concern that has been consistently raised? There are really good policy reasons for protecting lawyer-client communications. Why is it, Attorney, that lawyer communications do not deserve the same level of protection as that afforded to journalists?

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-24,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:11):  Because, Senator, there is no possibility that the principles governing lawyer-client privilege could be violated by a bill that may not access or cause the disclosure of content. That which is protected is the lawyer-client relationship and what passes between a lawyer and the client in the course of that professional relationship. What the client tells his lawyer and the advice that the lawyer gives his client is content.


This bill, ex hypothesi, does not deal with content. It is defined specifically to ensure that it does not deal with content. So the mischief to which you refer could never arise. And, as I said to Senator Leyonhjelm, it is conceivable that a journalist's source could be disclosed by metadata. It is, at least theoretically, conceivable. Let me give you an example. Let us say a journalist's metadata was accessed and it appeared that the day before the journalist published a particular scoop, the journalist was ringing a particular telephone number and that was the telephone number of a person who was leaking confidential information to the journalist. That person could be identified and, by a process of inference, it might be concluded that the telephone communication between the journalist and the particular telephone number identified the source of the leak and therefore identified the source. This is the difference you have to understand, Senator Wright. Where we protect journalists' sources, we protect their identity. Where we protect lawyer-client confidentiality, we protect what passes between the lawyer and the client—not the identity of the lawyer or the client but what the client says to the lawyer and what advice the lawyer gives to the client. That is the difference.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (21:14):  I am trying to work out the potential implications of that. If, for instance, a government was minded to raid a lawyer's offices on the basis that it had suspicion that that lawyer had information that the government might be wishing to gain access to and the reason that the government might have that information might be related to identification of communications between that lawyer and a particular client, whether that particular client might also be considered to possibly be a whistleblower because they have talked to a journalist or had some other interest, that would not necessarily be in relation to the content of the communication between the client and the lawyer. But certainly that information about the contact, the number of contacts, the time of contact and the fact that communication was occurring would be relevant and could indeed be useful information for a government that was intending to do that kind of investigation such as visiting lawyers' premises and looking at their files and their records.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:15):  Senator Wright, I love this topic and I could talk to you about it for hours. Let me point out why the example you have given is not germane. In order to attract lawyer-client privilege, the relevant information has to be information arising during the course of the lawyer-client relationship. It has to be information arising or exchanged in the course of the lawyer's retainer. If a person happens to be a friend of a lawyer and visits them at their home for a barbecue, let us say, and they have a conversation, obviously what passes between the lawyer and the client during that social conversation is not protected by lawyer-client privilege merely because one of the interlocutors happens to be a lawyer and the other happens to be a client of his for other purposes.


With the example you have given, if a particular lawyer's client was a whistleblower, well, he was a whistleblower—it has nothing to do with the lawyer-client relationship, the terms of the retainer; the scope of that which is protected is confidential information arising in the course of that relationship.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:17):  Senator Leyonhjelm, I think you have some amendments in relation to this. The government is of the view that this limitation on the ordinary scope of the legislation should be confined to journalists working in the professional capacity of a journalist. That is a straightforward test currently used in division 119 of the Criminal Code. As we have the not unmixed pleasure of dealing with journalists ourselves in the course of our working day, we know there has been a debate about what are the metes and bounds of journalism, particularly in the era of so-called citizen journalism when there is a huge multiplicity of blogs written by people who would like to be protected by the privileges that protect journalists, but the decision the government has made has been to confine the definition of journalist to the narrow and traditional notion of a person engaged in the profession of journalism—or, to use a vernacular expression, a working journalist. 


As my colleague the Minister for Communications, of course a former journalist himself, said in the other place when dealing with this issue, a journalist is a person who is engaged in the collection and dissemination to the public of material in the form of news, current affairs or a documentary, or in commentary or an analysis of such material—and the bill is drafted to reflect that traditional and orthodox understanding of what the profession of journalism consists of.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (21:19):  I participated in some of the hearings of the Senate committee inquiring into revisions to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act. Some of the witnesses described how they were voluntarily retaining information about their customers in order to benefit those customers who made subsequent inquiries as to their data usage, essentially. It was not all of them—some of them were doing it. The maximum period that anyone was doing it for was three months. It would seem logical that if you are going to solve a crime three months of metadata would be fairly handy to have. I am just wondering whether consideration might have been given to having the retention period for three months and on what basis did the government decide not to limit it to that period?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:21):  Before I turn to that, Senator Leyonhjelm, let me add some information to my answer to your last question. I should point out to you that this issue of the definition of a journalist is also dealt with in the explanatory memorandum. I refer you to paragraph 443. It basically says what I just told you, but it sets it out a little more fully.


The selection of two years as the retention period was the conclusion to which the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security unanimously came. Of course, one must always make a judgement. The purpose for which this metadata is being retained is to facilitate and assist investigations. It is entirely possible that the retention of metadata for a longer period than two years might assist some investigations which would not be helped if the metadata is destroyed after two years. On the other hand, of course, there will be many investigations in which the relevant acts or events which might be disclosed by the metadata will have occurred much less than two years after the investigator seeks access to them. There is a degree of an arbitrary time limit here. All I can say to you is that two years was the period chosen by the PJCIS, on the advice of the agencies, as a reasonable period within which their investigative needs were—in most, though not necessarily all, cases—likely to be met.


In relation to the metadata-retention practices of ISPs, there is no common standard. It is one of the problems here—there is no common standard. I do not say they all retain metadata for precisely two years; some retain it for less; some retain it for longer, as a matter of fact. After long discussion, which I well remember, in particular with the intelligence agencies, it seemed in all the circumstances to be the right period to reconcile the need not to hold onto this material indefinitely with the need for it to be retained sufficiently long to be serviceable and useful to an investigation.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (21:24):  Attorney, the publicly stated justification for the data-retention system and obligation to retain data is to deal with terrorism and paedophilia.

But what will prevent them from using this for the quite wide range of relatively trivial offences that similar data retention involved in the United Kingdom?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:24):  I think you have to take a practical view of this. The resources of agencies, and police agencies in particular, are concentrated naturally on the most serious crime. The particular motive or reason or purpose of the government and the opposition—which at the time of the first PJCIS inquiry were, of course, themselves the government—in bringing this forward was to deal with terrorism. I make no apology for saying that. It is also true that access to metadata is not just useful for investigating terrorist networks. It is useful for investigating other, particularly networked, criminal groups: paedophilia, notoriously, which we know from investigations operates through networks and often over the internet; organised crime. Common or garden crime is less likely to involve reliance upon networks perhaps of people in different countries. 


So it is a question of judgement by the law-enforcement agencies. It is a question of how they allocate their resources. But we do know that some types of crime—terrorist related crime is one of them, organised transnational crime and transnational crime is another of them, and paedophilia is another of them—in which the modus operandi, as it were, of those involved peculiarly involves reliance upon networks. It is the mapping of those networks which is particularly important in locating and identifying the actors, and that is something that is facilitated by access to metadata.

My experience with ASIC is that if you do not lodge your annual return they are relentless—relentless—in pursuit of you. The ACCC recently took an egg producer to the Federal Court for not producing their eggs under what they thought were acceptable free-range conditions. In other words, they did not think they had enough space to be justifiably called free range. Can you give me a guarantee that the retained metadata will not be used by ASIC and ACCC and others of the less significant agencies for such types of infractions?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:28):  Let me say three things to you, Senator Leyonhjelm. First of all, I really admire your commitment to economic liberty. I really admire it, and I admire your scepticism about economic regulatory agencies and the risk of over-reach of their powers, so let me put that on the record. I am much of your mind. The second point I would make to you is that in the original draft of this bill, as it was introduced on 30 October last year, the ACCC and ASIC were not included in the list in section 110A of agencies that would have a right to access metadata. But the PJCIS, in recommendation 20 of its report, recommended that they be included. I think we do have to acknowledge that ASIC and the ACCC are the two most important economic regulators in this country. We have to acknowledge that there is a great deal of conduct, including criminal conduct, conduct such as cartel conduct and conduct such as market manipulation and other forms of commercial fraud, which it is the remit of the ACCC or ASIC, respectively, to investigate and to police. Although the primary target of this legislation is terrorism, organised crime and paedophilia networks, there will be circumstances in which it will be useful for ASIC and the ACCC to have access to metadata for those purposes. Although I cannot give you the guarantee you seek, I can tell you that under the existing law there is no limitation either. At worst, from your point of view, this law does not change anything for the worse. It does not change anything at all in relation to the capacity of the ACCC and ASIC to have access to this information.

I noted that in your remarks you said that in many respects this tightens up access to metadata and that many agencies do not have any restrictions on their access to metadata, which they will have under this legislation. The difference, of course, is that the ISPs in many cases do not store the metadata for those agencies to access. Under this legislation they will be required to store it for two years, as you know. What I would like from you is to explain whether that changes anything. What you are suggesting is that the situation will not be any worse. There will be two years of metadata available. If ASIC, the ACCC or one of the other agencies with lesser status, if you like, to ASIO, the AFP and so forth, who are chasing terrorists and paedophiles, have a mind to use it for trivial offences, and there is precedent for that overseas, is there anything actually to prevent them from doing so?

 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:32):  I would have hoped you might be rejoicing, libertarian as you are, that the number of agencies and entities which would access the metadata has been reduced from 85 to 21. That is a reduction by more than three-quarters. At the moment, as a result of this legislation, only the core law enforcement agencies—and the two main economic regulators, I will acknowledge—will have access. I think you need to be realistic, Senator Leyonhjelm. Police forces, but particularly the economic regulatory agencies, are resource constrained. They make judgements about the allocation of their own resources. I for many years used to act for the ACCC on a regular basis. I know them very well and I know that the enforcement committee, as it used to be called, makes judgements about which particular matters to pursue and which particular matters to let go. Those are a function, of course, of the severity and unlawfulness of the conduct involved, but they are also a function of the available resources. You would not expect, as a matter of common sense, an economic regulator to devote limited resources in the pursuit of trivial matters. I think it is that practical common-sense consideration, rather than any statutory guarantees, which should put your mind at ease.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:35):  In relation to the capital cost, there has been, as I said earlier in the debate, a quite long negotiation between government and industry, and there are very diverse estimates of the capital cost—I see you nodding—as I think you know. As to which of those within that diverse range the government will settle upon as a reasonable estimate of the capital cost across industry and as to the percentage contribution the government will make to that figure as its substantial contribution, as promised, to the capital cost, those are matters currently before the government. They are a matter of deliberation as part of the budget process, because there will be an outlay here, of course. Those matters, because they are part of the budget deliberations at the moment and are cabinet in confidence, I am not at liberty to share with you.

Senator LUDLAM

You do not know to within the nearest $100 million what it is going to cost. That is remarkable.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  I can finish, Senator Brandis; I am still going. It is remarkable that you would bring forward a bill without knowing how much it is going to cost or how you are going to evaluate the costs. A specific question: unless you are going to be walking something of a tightrope, the government are going to be facing claims by industry at very different scales, operating very different kinds of back-end systems, who are going to be putting all kinds of claims to you. Without casting aspersions on the telecommunications sector, you are going to be in a position of having to judge whether these are ambit claims or whether they are reasonable. Presumably, industry is not going to put cost claims to you that do not cover their costs. I understand it is going to have to be case by case, and maybe that is why you cannot give us an aggregate figure. What is your process going to be for assessing the fairness or otherwise of these cost claims by different providers?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:38):  To deal first with your first observation, I did not say that the government does not know what figure it is dealing with. I said there are a range of estimates and the government, as part of this process, will select what it considers to be the most reasonable and credible estimate and contribute a substantial proportion of that as its contribution to the capital costs of industry.


In relation to the other matters that you raise, a lot of the considerations that you have adverted to are, I think, very pertinent considerations. I do not cast aspersions on the telecommunications industry either, but the hazards that you identify in a negotiation of that kind are undoubtedly present and they are something that the government is seeking to guard against. That is why we have had the long consultation with industry, by the way. So that is the process. The process is the consultation with industry to satisfy ourselves—I think you would acknowledge that it can only be an estimate—what is the most reliable and credible estimate to use as our base figure for the proportionate contribution that we have promised to make. In that regard, I will not read it into the record because I do not want to prolong things, but recommendation 16 of the PJCIS report also specifically addresses the issue you raise and was adopted by the government.

 (New South Wales) (21:40):  Attorney, one of my concerns, I suppose, is that this bill has, like the previous national security legislation, had very limited scrutiny by anyone other than the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. As a consequence, I and the other crossbench senators have struggled, I suppose, to address its implications and, as a result, these committee phases of the bill's consideration by the Senate have been protracted and difficult and, I know, frustrating to you. I wonder whether you have any views as to what the process might be for when this bill is reviewed and whether or not that process might be broadened to include those who currently have had no opportunity to comment on this prior to seeing it in the Senate.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:41):  You are right when you say that the principal committee consideration of this bill has been by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The first report—that is, the report of the previous parliament—was prepared after there had been nine full hearing days, which is, by anyone's measure, a very long committee hearing process. The report of the PJCIS that was tabled on 27 February was also the subject of extensive hearings—in fact, public hearings.


Senator Leyonhjelm, it is the case that the PJCIS does not at the moment contain any members of the Senate crossbench. It is not a committee that excludes independent members of parliament. For instance, Mr Andrew Wilkie was a member of the PJCIS throughout the course of the entire inquiry during the last parliament, which was the genesis of this legislation. The composition of the PJCIS, like the composition of all parliamentary committees, whether joint or committees of either chamber, are a matter of deliberation between government, opposition and independents and crossbenchers. I do not, with respect, think it reflects poorly on the process that the members of the committee on this occasion did not include any of the Senate crossbenchers. As you rightly point out, we look like we are having a very long committee stage debate, in which I am available to you to respond to any questions you may have. But the composition of any parliamentary committee cannot guarantee that any individual minor party or independent member will be a member of that committee, and I think you understand that.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-24,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:44):  I will just put a general question to the Attorney-General, as this appears to be the appropriate time. There is a long piece on security issues called 'The whole haystack' by Mattathias Schwartz in the 26 January edition this year of The New Yorker. I know the Attorney-General has limited time to indulge in reading The New Yorker,but I will send it to him. He may find it of some interest. Essentially, the point made is that almost every major terrorist attack on Western soil in the past 15 years has been committed by people who are already known to law enforcement. A whole range of examples were given, such as that one of the gunmen in the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris had been sent to prison for recruiting jihadist fighters. He goes on and refers to the men who planned the Mumbai attacks in 2008, saying they were under electronic surveillance by the United States, the United Kingdom and India.


The point made is that, in each of these cases, the authorities were not wanting for data. What they failed to do was appreciate the significance of the data they already had. I appreciate what the Attorney-General said in his summing up speech about what he considers to be the breadth of this legislation. My question to the Attorney-General is: with this ability to access metadata, will there be a different approach to assessing that information to avoid the mistakes of intelligence agencies referred to overseas, where they failed to appreciate the significance of that data? General Keith Alexander, the former head of the National Security Agency, has called all this digital information 'the whole haystack'. How do we find the needles when the haystack seems to be so much bigger? I hope he understands the spirit in which I ask this question. It is not being provocative. How do we ensure that intelligence agencies are not swamped with so much information that they do not make a good analysis as to where the threats are?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:46):  I do not think you are being provocative, Senator Xenophon. I hope nothing I have said causes you to be fearful that I think you are being provocative. I think you are asking constructive questions in a genuine spirit of inquiry, if I may say so. I do not have much time to read The New Yorker. What little time I have to read magazines I devote to reading The Spectator. Therefore, I have not read the article to which you have referred in your question and I cannot comment on it.


You seem to be making two points, as I understand you. The first point is whether the fact that, in most terrorist outrages in recent years, the perpetrators were known to authorities means that access to metadata is not of utility. The answer to that question is that, although in some cases what you say is true, in other cases it is not true. For example, in the outrage that we suffered in Australia in Martin Place last December, Man Haron Monis was known to the authorities, but he was not known to the authorities as a terrorism suspect. He was not considered to be assessed by the authorities to be somebody who they appreciated was likely to commit a crime of the kind that he committed. So, although he was on their radar, it was not in that capacity, which is why he was not on a so-called watch list.




Senator Xenophon:
  But he was previously.




Senator BRANDIS:
  He was not on a so-called watch list at the time. The main point about metadata is it is primarily an investigative not a surveillance tool. It cannot be a surveillance tool, and I think, with respect, Senator Xenophon, you are confusing the American experience with the Australian experience. As I tried to explain to you before, in America the agencies collect the metadata, and I daresay some of the metadata held by the agencies in the United States are used for surveillance purposes. But in Australia no government agency collects metadata. It does not today and it will not as a result of this bill.


This is, as I say, a retention obligation imposed on the private sector, not an obligation to surrender that to a government agency. In a way, you can regard this bill as being as prosaic as a bill about business records. Just as, under the Taxation Administration Act, we oblige people to retain their tax records for five years, so we are obliging telcos to retain metadata for two years. This is a bill essentially about the retention of business records. But they are business records which potentially have a usefulness in an investigation. For that reason, ordinarily, the utility of this will be ex post facto for investigative purposes, rather than, as I said before, for surveillance purposes, which is not why it exists.


Coming to the second point I understand you to be making, I think we should leave it to the agencies to judge what information is useful to them because it is not the agencies that collect or hold this information. It is the agencies that seek the information, that require it to be provided to them by the ISPs that hold it. In making that request, as they do now, the agencies make a professional judgement as to what particular items of metadata are useful to an investigation.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-24,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:51):  I am grateful to the Attorney-General for his response, but I want to go back earlier to the issue of the PJCIS—the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Reference was made to my friend and fellow independent Andrew Wilkie, the member for Denison. I want to put on the record that there is a big difference between the PJCIS and the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. In the United States, the members of the Intelligence Committee are briefed on operational details. My understanding is that the PJCIS is banned from anything other than administration and the financing of agencies. It is much more circumscribed in terms of what it can look at than in the United States. So I worry that the charter of the PJCIS, compared to the United States committee, is much more limited. I will not labour the fact but I think that that distinction needs to be made. 


My final question—and I am grateful to the Attorney for his response—is: when you have obtained the whole haystack, does the fact that there is all this additional information in any way fetter the work of intelligence agencies, in that they are looking at that rather than focusing on risk assessment?


I take issue in relation to Man Haron Manis. He was on a watch list and he dropped off that watch list; and I know the Attorney has acknowledged that. I am not privy to the information, of course, that others would be, other than what I read in the media about this, but I still cannot understand to this day why that man, both madman and terrorist, was on the streets, given his extensive history. The issue is one of assessment by intelligence agencies. Whilst he was not regarded as a terrorist threat at the time of the Martin Place siege and the tragedy that unfolded, that it resulted in, I wonder whether that raises the issue of a failure of our intelligence services to appropriately assess him as a terrorist threat and the fact that, in my view and, I think, the view of many others, this man, with his extensive history, should not have been on the streets.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:53):  I do not want to revisit that, Senator Xenophon, other than to remind you that this matter was looked at very closely and promptly by the Thawley-Comley review, which was conducted by, respectively, the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the secretary of the Premier's department in New South Wales.


Senator Xenophon, you are right when you say that the Senate intelligence committee of the United States and the House of Representatives intelligence committee of the United States have more extensive oversight powers over the intelligence agencies in that country than does the PJCIS . When I was in Washington last year, I actually met with the then respective chairs of those committees, Senator Feinstein and Congressman Rogers. But I do not think we should fall into the trap, Senator Xenophon, of assuming that, just because the Americans do it in a particular way, that therefore represents some kind of gold standard. We in Australia have an office of Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, which does not exist in the American system, who has a very wide ranging statutory charter to investigate the conduct of the intelligence agencies, including a power to investigate the way in which they have conducted particular intelligence operations. Now, that is a function located in that official in the Australian system that does not exist in the American system.


Lastly, having served for a term during the term of the last parliament as a member of the PJCIS, I have to tell you, Senator Xenophon, your understanding of the scope of its capacity to inquire is too limited. The PJCIS, although it does not examine operational matters in granular detail, does nevertheless receive briefings—for example, from the director-general of ASIO or the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police—which are more than, as it were, auditing exercises. It is informed by the heads of the respective intelligence and policing agencies, in the broad, of the work they undertake, their assessment of risks and threats and where those risks and threats lie, and how the agencies are responding to them.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:56):  I appreciate the Attorney's response. Very briefly, in respect of IGIS I think it is fair to say that, whilst IGIS has extensive powers, very little information can be forthcoming, even through a Senate estimates process, which I think is quite unsatisfactory. But can the Attorney indicate whether, given these metadata laws or the regime that will be passed, along with other laws that have been passed in relation to counter-terrorism, the government has considered, is considering or will consider supporting a broadening of the powers of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to look more broadly at operational matters, similar to what the US Senate and US House of Representatives intelligence committees do? Is that on the radar for the government—considering giving them these broader powers?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (21:57):  This was looked by the PJCIS, actually, in considering this bill. Can I refer you, Senator Xenophon, to committee recommendation 34, which provides: 


The Committee recommends that the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014 be amended to provide that the Committee may inquire into any matter raised in the annual report prepared under proposed section 187P, including where this goes to a review of operational matters.


Legislative change to the Intelligence Services Act 2001 should be implemented to reflect this changed function.


The Committee further recommends that the Commonwealth Ombudsman and Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security provide notice to the Committee should either of them hold serious concerns about the purpose for, or the manner in which, retained data is being accessed.


The government responded positively to that recommendation. The government's response—let me read it to you—is this:


The Government considers there is benefit in conferring an appropriate function on the Committee for the purposes of establishing a further oversight mechanism for the operation of the data retention scheme.


Consistent with the focus of the PJCIS on non-operational matters concerning security and intelligence, the new function would enable the PJCIS to inquire into the effectiveness of the operation of the data retention scheme, with respect to the purpose and manner of access by ASIO and AFP (to the extent those agencies are the subject of PJCIS oversight).


So, that recommendation was adopted, at least in part, by conferring an additional power, and that is reflected in one of the clauses of the bill before the chamber. But the government has not gone the further step, for reasons that I have indicated, of modelling or remodelling the PJCIS along the lines of the US Senate or House intelligence committees.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:03):  I feel as if the parliament is playing catch-up—and not doing it terribly well—with what is in fact a revolution. The revolution, or the major transformation, is in big data. We have now reached the point where the revolution is not in the machines that calculate the data—something which has been our lived experience and which Senator Kate Lundy just spoke about in her valedictory remarks—it is now in the data itself.


I am strongly opposing the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014 because I think the overwhelming majority of people in this parliament have no idea about what the retention of data actually means for the Australian community and for society in general—or what it could mean in the longer term. Up until now, because we could only deal with relatively small datasets, we have always looked for evidence, analysis and causation. We have looked at the dataset, looked at the evidence, tried to work out the causes and tried to extrapolate that to support evidence based decision making. Causation was where our focus was. Now the whole world is going to be shifting. We are going to be exchanging causality for correlations—in other words, no longer actually needing to know why, just focusing on what.


You get the correlation in the data and that gives you information about where people go, what they eat, who they see, which doctor they go to and so on. What does the information mean? There is nothing about causation, nothing about evidence—it is just about the correlation. It has reached the point where, with that data, the more you know about people—where they go, what they do, what their health is—the more valuable that data is to various businesses. The problem we have is that, if you collect data on people, no matter what the primary purpose of collecting it is, you do not know how, in two years time, that data might be used. It might be used for something entirely different. The data itself is now the product that is valuable to corporations, to governments or to anyone who gets hold of it. It enables them to make decisions; it enables them to develop and sell goods and services. The book, Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work and Think, tells us:


Mobile operators have long been loath to monetize that information for fear of running afoul of privacy regulations. But they are starting to soften their stance as their financial fortunes flounder and they regard their data as a potential source of income. In 2012, the large Spanish and international operators Telefonica went so far as to create a separate company, called Telefonica Digital Insights, to sell anonymous and aggregated subscriber-location data to retailers and others. 


So that is the new market for people who have the data—to on-sell it to other people for profit, and basically to use that data about people. The argument will be that you can make it anonymous. You cannot. It is clear that even if you try to make it anonymous you cannot, because the dataset will match somebody. And inevitably that person will be locatable. That is one of the big problems. 


So here we have a parliament which is deciding to legislate to allow the data about every Australian to be kept by telecommunications companies for two years. That is incredibly invasive. The data is going to tell you everything about that person—where they have been, the fact that they used their phone and who they spoke to, for how long they spoke and then the network of people that those people have spoken to. There will be a whole set of data built up about a person.


Who is going to have access to that data? There is no saying in this legislation that that data is going to be held and controlled by these corporations in Australia, under Australian privacy law. What is to stop one of these providers, who will store this information for two years, storing it in another country, where the privacy laws are not the same as Australia's and that—as Telefonica has done—they will allow access to that data to medical insurance companies, for example, who might decide that they want to determine whether they should give someone health insurance or adjust the cost of that health insurance over time? 


There was an extraordinary example that I read about, where a car company is designing the most up-to-date seats. When you buy or get the car you can log in the impression of your body as you sit upright in the seat of that car. It will then program the car so that if you slump over the wheel or start going to sleep, the car will wake you up. It is meant to be a safety device, but the data is owned by the company. The company can then make that data available to law enforcement agencies or insurance companies, in the case of an accident, to say that you went to sleep at the wheel of that car or that you were distracted, leaning across or whatever you were doing, because of the physical imprint of you sitting in the seat. If you were not sitting up, that information can be made available and you could find that the data will get you, in the end.  


We are getting to the point where people are making themselves vulnerable to the data collection agencies that hold the data. They could on-sell it or make it available. They could be vulnerable to being hacked. Yet this parliament is saying that 23 million Australian people are going to have all their data stored somewhere. The government and Labor think that it is perfectly all right to do that. 


Already up to 80 agencies are able to access people's data. That is going to be pared down in this legislation, but the big flaw is that all those agencies have to do is to apply to the Attorney-General, and he or she can then allow those new agencies to be on the list of agencies that can collect the data. We have no idea what the Attorney-General of the day will rubber-stamp in terms of saying that any of these agencies can have access to the data. 


Of course we know that ASIO, the police and all of the law enforcement agencies will want this. It is being dressed up to look as if it is to deal with terrorism. Nothing could be further from the truth. These agencies—up to 80 agencies now—want this data because it makes it easier to track down information about people or to engage in audits of compliance, enforcement and the like. It is a matter of considerable concern that these agencies wanted data to be stored for five years. They are not going to get it; they are getting two years—but that is, in fact, too many. There is a real concern here about what is going to happen to information that pertains to all Australians. 


And, as I said, what about confidentiality? The Labor Party seems to think that it has made some very thin confidentiality arrangements to protect journalists and their sources—I will come back to that; it does not protect journalists' sources—but what about doctors and lawyer groups? What about any of those organisations which require and demand privacy of information? They will no longer have that privacy, because there is only one group of people protected through this fairly thin provision for a new public interest advocate. What about the people who provide the information? What about doctors? What about lawyers? They are not covered. 


In fact, any information about any individual can be uploaded and held for two years. There are no confidentiality provisions. This legislation undermines everything we have understood about the rule of law and about professions that are protected in terms of the information that they hold. As I said, the idea of causality has gone; we now have the idea of correlation. Correlation allows people to work out probability. So we are going to get profiling of people and communities as being likely suspects in particular crimes—these groups of people have a greater probability, according to the data, of committing a crime. It does not allow for individuals in the community or for any analysis of other things in the community. So you are going to get additional policing and surveillance put into those areas, and that is completely unnecessary.  


We are not saying—and I heard a few comments earlier to this effect earlier—that the Greens do not want to see adequate surveillance from police and law enforcement organisations dealing with terrorism. Of course we do. And that is why there are data preservation orders. If they have reason to suspect that somebody is likely to be involved in criminal matters then they can get a data preservation order. So 'targeted' is one thing; indiscriminate surveillance of an entire population under the guise of terrorism and national security is quite wrong. This has been on the agenda for a long time. Under the shadow of terrorism, we have had Labor roll over, go and join up with the government, and agree to legislation that will lead to surveillance of all Australians.


I just want to go to this public interest advocate that has been set up to oversee the metadata searches on journalists. There are a number of problems with that. There are no rules requiring the Attorney-General to seek the views of the public interest advocate to argue against warrants being issued for journalists' metadata. In addition, it will be an offence involving two years' jail for anyone to disclose that a warrant for metadata has been requested or applied. So the journalists will not be able to contest the idea that this has actually occurred.


Testimony from the Attorney-General's Department, combined with evidence from countries which have enacted data retention, has shown that there is no evidence of improved crime resolution statistics once data retention is enacted. Law enforcement agencies have consistently claimed that the extra powers are needed, but they have failed to provide any concrete examples of why it is needed—and in fact it is to the contrary.


I was surprised to see that the Attorney-General was going on about how this is the way that Western nations are going. No, it is not. Western nations are actually going in the opposite direction. That is why I said in my opening remarks that this parliament is playing catch-up. The fact of the matter is: the European Union had a data retention directive on this in 2006. In 2006, John Howard was Australia's Prime Minister. I do not think he would even have had any idea of what data was doing at that particular time in terms of retention or in terms of the transformation of what it would do. That was in 2006. Since then, countries have been winding it back. In fact, the European Court of Justice found it is unconstitutional. Austria has used it—for theft, for drugs, for stalking, but not for terrorism. Poland has used the data, mostly for civil disputes and to assist in divorce cases. In Denmark it was given up in June this year. And Germany abandoned the legislation in 2010.


So it is not about national security. It is about collecting data on every Australian, for every law enforcement agency and regulatory compliance agency to use. You will get this surveillance capacity and this data being used for everything from crime to trivial infractions of various things, for the tax office, the ACCC, ASIC, fisheries, health compliance agencies, local government and even the RSPCA. There are any number of organisations which have accessed data for various reasons. That is where we will actually end up in this country. Once you are identified, once your data is there, it will be used. We cannot even know now what the secondary use of that data will be, either next week, next year or in two years' time—how you might be able to use that data or what it is actually for.


Then we go to the cost of it. This is an extraordinary thing—that we have the Labor Party agreeing with the Abbott government that we go ahead and conduct the collection of data on every Australian for two years, and we have no idea what it is going to cost and no evidence that it actually assists in doing anything about terrorism. This is an extraordinary lie to the Australian people that is being perpetrated.


Let us go to cost for a moment. We have no idea what it is going to cost. The companies and government agencies not only will need to store the data but have to ensure it is stored safely. As I said before, how do we know that it is even going to end up being stored here?


It will be very attractive, for the reasons I indicated earlier, to hackers, and I want to know how the government is going to guarantee, if the data is not stored in Australia, how it will meet Australian privacy laws or will be protected from hacking. But let us go to the actual cost. What is it likely to cost a year? We have had all this talk. We had a budget emergency; now we do not have a budget emergency. Last year's budget was to fix the emergency; this year's budget is going to be dull. It is very interesting the way that the news about the budget travels. But what is the cost? Australians deserve to know how much the government intends to contribute to the mass surveillance of the Australian population. How much money are we going to put up to have this surveillance on ourselves? Surely the parliament deserves to get an answer to that question. We do not have an answer to that question. And it is fundamentally wrong.


Then we get to this idea that, if you are not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to hide. That is what the Stasi said in East Germany as well. And it is what every police state has to say: 'We will follow you. We will do surveillance on you. But do not worry about it; if you have nothing to hide, it won't be a problem for you.' Well, we saw what happened with the Stasi in East Germany and we know about the chilling effect that this will have on people. It will mean, for example, that you will know who attends a protest rally, for example, anywhere; you will have their location, if they make a call or have their phone on them while they are there, as they attend that rally. What is it worth to a foreign government to know who has been there and which of their overseas students was at a rally against human rights abuses, for example? Who knows how anyone is going to use this data on particular individuals. So this idea that if you are not doing anything wrong you have nothing to hide is no excuse whatsoever for this invasion of people's privacy.


When you get to the issue of trusting our government bureaucracies and intelligence agencies, what about the scrutiny? What about the oversight that we need? You know that if there is not proper oversight you will have corruption and you will have creep in what this data will be used for. Today people are deciding which agencies can access it but, as I indicated, the Attorney-General can change that anytime—add new agencies add different levels of surveillance—and that is where we will end up on this. 


When we get to looking at this as an overall objective in Australia, I think it is really sad that we have got to the point that we are legislating without evidence. (Time expired)

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-03-24,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (18:23):  I rise to speak to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015. The current bill has brought deep concern to many Australians—and rightly so, because it raises complex and concerning issues, especially in relation to privacy, freedom of expression and media freedom. 


I have had my own deep concerns about this legislation and I know some of my Labor colleagues—such as the member for Chifley, the member for Fremantle, the member for Charlton and other Labor colleagues as well—have had similarly deep concerns. I have wrestled with these issues, because data retention is a complex global issue but an issue that has to be dealt with in this era of advanced technology. 


It is not a surprise that these are concerning issues. Communications data can reveal quite personal information about an individual. Without the content of the data being made available, it can reveal who a person is in contact with, how often and where. But we are informed that this bill is needed to ensure that our law enforcement agencies can keep pace with the rapidly evolving telecommunications technology and services. 


I agree wholeheartedly with the comments of former Senator John Faulkner who said:


The Australian Parliament's … must ensure our intelligence and security agencies have the necessary powers and resources to protect Australian citizens and Australian interests. However, these powers can impinge on the values and freedoms on which our democracy is founded … which Australian citizens rightly expect Parliament to protect.


So Parliament must strike a balance between our security imperatives and our liberties and freedoms.


Key to achieving this balance is strong and effective accountability.


Therein lies the essence of what this debate is all about and what we as parliamentarians must try and strive to achieve.


So what we have before us now follows amendments that were brought through the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. They have done a great deal of work to improve the bill the government presented last year—which I think can be regarded as a shell of a bill—making it into something which now is trying very hard to get that balance right. 


On that, I would like to thank my Labor colleagues for their work. They have closely reviewed and rewritten this legislation. After months of work, their approach to the issue has led to a much improved piece of legislation being presented for debate, and that is what we have currently before us here in the Senate: significant minor, technical and consequential amendments to clarify the intent of the bill; limiting the dataset required to be retained under the scheme to that which is prescribed in the bill itself, rather than allowing the dataset to be prescribed by regulation. These are just some of the things my Labor colleagues achieved through that joint committee. 


Labor has insisted on significant improvements to oversight and transparency through the PJCIS inquiry into this bill, and the work of that Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has led of course to the 38 recommendations for inclusion in this legislation. These amendments, including protections for journalists, have been absolutely crucial to the substance of this bill. 


The work of the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for communications, the shadow Attorney-General and my Labor colleagues in pursuing the government for these amendments to be included has meant that today we are debating legislation of a much greater quality than what we saw last year. So I thank them wholeheartedly for the work they have done but also for their consultative approach to this issue, which has been part of our Labor caucus. 


Looking at the substantive matter of this bill, examining the issues seriously and exploring all the options available to achieve a balance between the public interest in granting access to metadata and the protection of privacy rights, has been critical. In fact that is the critical factor when we debate this bill. That has been the focus from the outset for the Labor opposition. 


The storage of data onshore, protections for journalists to ensure freedom of speech is preserved, the inclusion of privacy alerts and the importance of oversight have helped shape my position from one of having great concern to one where I am comfortable with the outcomes that have been now delivered through that process and into this legislation. As I said at the outset, it was a difficult issue at the beginning, but what we have before us now is a much more substantial bill than that which was provided to the parliament last year.

Senator SINGH:
  I return to highlight the important factors that have helped to shape my position on this piece of legislation, and I want to list the improvements that have been made through Labor's input and through the process of the PJCIS inquiry. They include: listing of dataset in the bill so that we know what data is retained; limiting access to telecommunications data to those enforcement agencies specified in the bill; oversight of the operational use of this legislation by parliament's intelligence committee, the first time that committee has been given this power; authorising ASIC and the ACCC to access telecommunications data to assist in the investigation and prosecution of white-collar crime; requiring telecommunications companies to provide customers access to their own telecommunications data upon request; requiring stored data to be encrypted to protect the security and the integrity of personal information; prohibiting access to telecommunications data for the purpose of civil proceedings, such as preventing its use in copyright enforcement; requiring the mandatory data breach notification scheme to ensure telecommunications companies notify consumers if the security of their telecommunications data is breached—I currently have a private senator's bill in this place on this very matter. Other improvements are: increasing the resources of the Ombudsman to strengthen the oversight of the mandatory data retention scheme; and a mandatory review of the data retention scheme by no later than four years from the commencement of this legislation. All these factors are improvements that have helped to shape my position.


I do want to go into some further detail on a number of those issues, and the first of them relates to data storage. Protecting the cloud of data collected under this legislation is critical to the privacy of individuals. The storage of data needs to remain under Australia's jurisdiction to ensure that it is regulated by Australian law. On the eve of the data retention changes being reintroduced into the parliament, the former Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Mr David Irvine, voiced his concerns clearly about where Australians' data should be stored in the cloud. He described himself as a 'cyber nationalist' when it came to the position of the cloud. He is correct: metadata provides knowledge of an individual whom this country has a duty to protect. In that sense I also describe myself as a 'cyber nationalist'. The issue of the location of stored data is one of concern not just to myself or not just to Labor, but to the broader Australian public as well. I am pleased that this matter is currently being examined as part of the telecommunications sector security reform, TSSR.


Mr Irvine said there had to be awareness in government, business and with private individuals of the fact that the internet world had brought huge benefits but it had created all sorts of vulnerabilities. He said:


We should be trying to develop for Australia, particularly for government and industry, the ability to manage national data on a national basis, with international hook-ups of course, but then it can be subject to national law, which can be privacy law and national security considerations. 


He also said:


Our ability to use metadata is just as important in eliminating people from suspicion as it is from incriminating them.


I think that really highlights the importance of onshore data storage. 


We are informed that this bill is going through another process to address that important issue. This bill raises another issue—which may come as a surprise to many Australian citizens—about who has access to data. There are currently more than 80 agencies, including many local councils and other organisations that can already access data without a warrant, and that is of quite grave concern. My understanding is that access to this data has grown over the years and now the types of agencies which can apply to access this data include Centrelink, the RSPCA and even Harness Racing New South Wales. Not many Australians would be aware of that. This bill addresses the issue and confines access to law enforcement agencies, and that is an important improvement that has been made in this bill. Having such a broad definition of the agencies that can authorise themselves to access your metadata, my metadata, I think is a problem. This bill very much deals with that issue. Limiting access to criminal law enforcement agencies specifically prescribed in the bill, rather than by an open-ended definition, and authorising ASIC and the ACCC to access metadata to facilitate the prosecution of white-collar crime I think is a better outcome. As I have said, Labor's position is that there should be onshore data storage of that metadata. 


Another improvement made to this bill is in relation to the protection of journalists. The protection of journalists and their sources along with freedom of the press have been issues of particular concern to Labor. The Australian Federal Police have confirmed for the first time that they have accessed journalists' telecommunications metadata in the past 18 months, but said that the requests were 'rare'. Under the new laws, a public interest advocate, who will be able to contest police applications for warrants to identify a journalist's source, will be created. That is a great improvement to the current regime. Allowing a list of security-cleared barristers to argue the public interest case before judges deciding whether government agencies should be allowed to access journalists' metadata is important—and to argue the public interest case as a judge weighs that consideration against national security interests in deciding whether to issue such a warrant is the substance of it. Of course, there will be a presumption against issuing the warrant, and agencies must prove that the public interest in issuing the warrant outweighs the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the identity of the journalist's source.


One other issue I want to highlight is that Labor has advocated for the inclusion of a system of mandatory notifications of data breaches or privacy alerts, a system of mandatory notifications similar to those contained in the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill, which I introduced into the Senate in 2014 on behalf of the Labor Party. I am pleased that that system, introducing a new consumer privacy protection for Australians that will keep their personal information more secure in this digital age, forms part of this bill. Time and time again, we have heard examples of data breaches like that by the immigration department, where some 10,000 asylum seekers' details were accidentally breached as far as their security was concerned. It is important that, following the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in 2008, those changes will finally be addressed in this bill. At the time we were debating my private senator's bill in this place, I was disappointed that it seemed that government senators were not going to support it. I am glad that they have seen the light.


I have raised a number of other aspects of this legislation that are great improvements. But, overall, regardless of those improvements—and they are very good—this bill was introduced very speedily and the government showed too little concern for the substance of the bill and the importance of getting it right. That is clearly on record with the bill that the government first introduced late last year. The government should have taken a different approach to this important piece of national reform dealing with security, privacy and our freedoms. There should have been a review of the data access regime, for example. Investigation should have been undertaken into whether warrantless access should have been allowed to continue at all. There has not been time to debate and go further into those issues because this government rushed this legislation into the parliament last year and has continued to rush it through the parliament this week. What we do have has gone through a very careful improvement in its design, due to the fact that my Labor colleagues on the PJCIS put in the effort and paid it the concern that was needed. 


I will finish with a comment by former Senator John Faulkner, a former defence minister and someone who has very strong values in relation to freedom and privacy issues. He said that parliament must always strike the right balance between our security imperatives and our liberties and freedoms. That is what this bill should achieve.  With any review in the future, that must always be at the forefront.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2015-03-24,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (19:13):  The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015 should not be passed. My colleagues Greens senators Scott Ludlam, Christine Milne and Penny Wright have set out a very clear case as to why this bill should not be passed. The way in which the Liberal, National and Labor parties have colluded to rush through parliament this bill, which creates the government's mass surveillance regime, is a disgrace. It is a result of an ugly backroom deal between these parties. 


By the government's own admission, mandatory data retention alters the balance between government and individuals when it comes to their right to privacy. The best the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have come up with to justify their antidemocratic deal on internet and smartphone surveillance laws is to say, 'Just trust us.' They want us to trust a government which has broken election promise after election promise. They want us to trust a government which has shouted down any attempt to hold it to account and which has publicly savaged statutory bodies and human rights watchdogs for simply doing their job. We have to ask: why do Labor want us to trust this Liberal-National government? Our colleagues in the House of Representatives were contemptuously given just 30 minutes to debate 74 amendments, denying the public and parliament a chance to scrutinise this backroom deal between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and opposition leader Bill Shorten.


The bill now before this chamber should hold the government to account, but, no, instead it effectively waves through mass surveillance of Australian citizens. We know that because we have heard the opposition and the government saying, 'It'll be right. Just trust us.' There are a number of questions that remain unanswered as the government tries to ram these changes through.


There has been a lot of hyperventilating and hyperbole from the Prime Minister, who has all but claimed that law enforcement will halt without warrantless access to metadata and mass surveillance of our citizens. That is clearly ridiculous. It is just a new form of the law-and-order campaign that we have seen wheeled out by conservative governments, particularly at a state level but increasingly at a federal level, on national security. They are now using metadata in a similar way.


It is clear that the amendments agreed to by the Prime Minister and the opposition leader do not implement the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security or address the concerns that have been raised. Labor rolled over. Why? We still have not got to the bottom of that. On an issue as serious as giving security agencies additional rights and powers over people's smartphones and internet records, the Labor, Liberal and National parties, as I said before, are saying, 'Just trust us.' But that raises a number of key questions. Where will the data be stored? Will it be subject to foreign laws? How does the government define a journalist and a journalist's source? Will the data be deleted after the mandatory period? If so, how? Will the data be secure from cyberattacks? But the answer we are getting is, 'Just trust us.'


We have already seen how this sort of metadata can be abused. The existing Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act allows law enforcement authorities in Australia to access some categories of metadata from certain ISPs and telcos. However, a laundry list of other organisations have gained access to the metadata for undisclosed purposes, including Centrelink, the Western Australian Department of Fisheries, Racing Queensland, the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission, the Victorian taxi directorate, various local councils, the RSPCA and the Office of Environment and Heritage. I will come to the issue to do with the ABCC shortly.


It is open season on metadata already. Already under the current law there is the ability to do so much of what the government says that it needs to achieve. Three hundred and forty thousand warrantless accesses took place in the 2012-13 financial year, and that was before a mandatory data retention regime was in place. My colleague Senator Scott Ludlam set out very clearly the issue about the number of warrants that are out there. The evidence about metadata requests under the current regime shows that a massive number have nothing to do with solving serious crime but instead relate to petty requests by agencies, including the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink, to track what ordinary Australians not suspected of any serious crime are doing. Again, this highlights the dangerous territory the Labor, Liberal and National parties are taking us into.


The Attorney-General has pointed out that this bill does not change the existing arrangements, and that is precisely the problem. It welds on two years worth of additional data which can be indiscriminately accessed by agencies. This is despite the fact that evidence shows that most law enforcement metadata requests are for short-term data, meaning within three months rather than two years. Now, under the new legislation, the Attorney-General will also be able to add to the list of agencies with access to our data. Senator Ludlam called this 'scope creep', and that is what you see all over this legislation.


Very relevant to the debate is to note that the now-defunct Australian Building and Construction Commission received a total of 77 authorisations for data through the T(IA) Act between 2007 and 2012. The Fair Work Building and Construction agency, which replaced the ABCC following a successful union campaign, received one authorisation in the 2012-13 financial year. We know the Abbott government is trying to reinstate the ABCC. That is one of the issues right at the top of its agenda. It also flagged in November 2014 that it is considering another agency with similar powers to ASIC dedicated to monitoring unions. Both of these organisations, like the ABCC before them, may be able to access the metadata of union officials and union members. This is a very frightening aspect of the bill. Again, what Labor have signed off on, considering they say they are so deeply against the ABCC, is very troubling. We need to look at these bills together and what this government is up to. As I said, it is a frightening aspect of this bill that the government will supercharge its anti-union attack legislation with these anti-democratic measures that we are making tonight. Again, that has to be emphasised so strongly—that Labor are hand in hand with this government in bringing forward legislation that, as we look into it more and more, we can see is like a twin of the ABCC legislation.


The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance has voiced concerns on behalf of its members on the chilling effect that the Abbott-Shorten deal will have on journalism in this country. While the Labor Party has claimed it wants to protect journalists and their sources, its deal with the government fails to deliver on this. As the MEAA has said, the requirement to get a warrant to access data of journalists still ignores the key ethical obligation of journalists to not allow their confidential sources to be revealed. While journalists worldwide have faced jail in upholding this obligation, mandatory data retention means it is no longer their decision. Journalists in Australia can no longer guarantee their sources and whistleblowers that they will be protected. Journalists, understandably, are concerned that this law is anti investigative journalism and anti whistleblowers.


I think we need to take a pause here. We need to consider what this means for investigative journalism and a free and open media in this country. So often we hear people in this place espousing the importance of a free media, but this bill puts that at threat. Again, this is a key consideration that should be at the top of this debate. We do not need to wait until we see whistleblowers hauled before courts for exposing dishonesty, fraud, waste or corruption to know that this bill is wrong. Investigations will not go ahead. Whistleblowers will hesitate. Courageous public servants will wonder if they should speak out. Reporters will decide that they do not want to put the people they depend on for their stories at risk. That is how we expect this to play out. 


The public-interest advocate, which is to be set up to oversee metadata searches on journalists' data, is no solution. For example, there are no rules requiring the Attorney-General to seek the views of the PIA or for the PIA to argue against warrants being issued for journalists' metadata. In addition, it is an offence involving two years jail for anyone to disclose that a warrant for metadata has been requested or applied. This is compounded by the fact that, in today's environment, we see a fragmentation of journalism and the greater need of protection for acts of journalism—acts by the likes of Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning. In fact, the protections—such as they are—may not apply to many of the new players in the media landscape, such as bloggers. 


This prompts the question: who is really protected by mandatory data retention? In the rush to pass data retention, the government has failed to demonstrate how it will achieve even its own stated goals. The Attorney-General's Department could provide no evidence from anywhere in the world that mandatory data retention improves community safety or helps reduce crime. There you have it: no proof that it will improve our safety or reduce crime. Why is this being done? That is why you have to go back and look at the organisations that will access this. 


The government still has not defined the metadata it wants industry to store, and it wants to change the definition on a whim. Law-enforcement agencies have consistently claimed that the extra powers are needed, without providing concrete examples of why they are needed. For example, why is it that we need to retain data for two years, when evidence shows that most law-enforcement metadata requests are for much shorter-term data, usually within three months? Evasion of the scheme is easy for anyone with ill intent. Virtual private networks are easy to set up and use, while something as simple as using a Gmail account can put one outside of the scheme jurisdiction. However, while those who may wish harm can easily bypass the scheme, all Australians will be subject to surveillance. It is wrong to assume that only those engaged in criminal activity will be affected by this surveillance. 


The recent New South Wales parliamentary inquiry into police surveillance of other police officers underlines how irresponsible this legislation is. We cannot rely on police to determine issues to do with the surveillance of the public, with no external oversight. The New South Wales inquiry has revealed extensive abuses of how surveillance warrants have been issued and abuses by police using their resources to spy on other police and journalists. The inquiry found that TV reporter Steve Barrett was targeted by crime agencies, with dozens of improperly obtained covert surveillance warrants, between 1999 and 2000. 


The inquiry uncovered a series of warrants rubber-stamped by the Supreme Court. In one case, there was zero supporting evidence for 46 of the 114 targets on a single covert surveillance warrant. A former judge admitted that that there was no way to properly check that the warrants were in order. He resorted to checking for obvious errors, like inclusion of the names 'M Mouse' or 'D Duck' before he signed off. That is serious; that is what he said. Despite an inundation of warrants, he could not remember refusing a single one. I set that out in detail because this is from an inquiry about police surveillance, where they could not get it right and where there was no accountability, standards or external involvement. It shows what we are walking into. Those abuses by police officers have been revealed, but did the Attorney-General take any notice or learn any lessons? Clearly, that has not occurred. The Attorney-General is ready to give police and security forces unprecedented access to endless quantities of data, to intensify surveillance in such an extreme way. 


Then there is the still unresolved issue of who will actually pay for this surveillance. Senator Ludlam set out this out very clearly. He detailed the important letter, which came just last week, from a number of telecommunication companies, setting out how much this is going to cost. That is a very relevant part of the debate. The Australian government will not say who will be paying this surveillance tax. What we do know is that the public will end up paying, either with higher data changes or through higher taxes. 


The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties is one of the many groups that have provided in-depth analysis on the dangers of this bill. They have stated in some of their material:


It is not acceptable for ASIO, the AFP, police forces and other agencies to be able to access the extensive metadata of citizens on their own internal authorisation. The bill allows them to do just this—albeit within some parameters. Legal experts and organisations, civil liberties, privacy and human rights groups among others, argued the need for a warrant system—a longstanding safeguard within our legal system. The intelligence and security agencies argued—successfully it seems—that any form of warrant system would impose too great a logistical and bureaucratic operational constraint.


It would seem the self-serve system is to continue and long standing safeguards to be sacrificed.


This is a mistake and will lead to misuse, abuse and overuse of this data. The post-hoc safeguards proposed will not be adequate to protect against these outcomes.


I do urge senators to look up, in full, the material on this issue from the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties.


Big Brother has become 'Big George' in this situation, and 'Big George' works hard to keep a straight face as he spouts his justification for these extreme laws, saying, 'Those who have nothing to hide, have nothing to fear.'




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: if 'Big George' refers to Senator Brandis, the senator should withdraw the remark, call the senator by his correct title and, if she feels so inclined, apologise.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Rhiannon, if you have been referring to the Attorney-General, I would invite you to refer to him by his correct title.




Senator RHIANNON:
  Thank you for the advice, Mr Acting Deputy President. With regard to the issue of collecting metadata, what the Attorney-General is doing to his own office is very concerning. The standing of the Attorney-General is very important to the whole nation in terms of the upholding of justice. We have already seen abuses of metadata. When the Australian intelligence agencies were interested in the phones of the former Indonesian President and his wife—leading figures in Indonesia—it was an issue of metadata. Again, that shows how these services have been abusing the use of that data.


Ever since the terrorist attack of September 2001, crime, spy and security agencies have been demanding more and more powers to reach into our private individual lives. This incursion for mandatory metadata retention will not make us safer or more secure. Mandatory data retention strikes at the very heart of the relationship between governments and the public. This bill, which is set to be passed on the combined vote of the Liberal, National and Labor parties, is an enormous setback as it delivers an increase in the power of the state over private individuals for indiscriminate surveillance. The campaign to stop this level of surveillance and to have this bill repealed is I believe set to become one of the most important issues in Australia.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-03-24,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (19:32):  I rise to oppose passage of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014. I do so despite the fact that there are 10 amendments circulating in my name. These amendments will do the following: (1) require a warrant not just for access to journalists' metadata but also for access to the metadata of lawyers and medical professionals—lawyers have expressed particular concern about threats to legal professional privilege; (2)  use the definition of 'journalist' in the Commonwealth Evidence Act so that freelancers are protected by Labor's warrants regime; (3) reduce the period of data retention from two years to three months, consistent with commercial practice among ISPs; (4) limit the use of retained data to serious criminal offences; (5) remove ASIC and the ACCC from the list of law enforcement agencies; (6) provide for a warrants regime that protects members of the general public; (7) ensure a definition of 'content' is included in the bill; (8) ensure that the most invasive parts of the bill will sunset rather than being merely reviewed by a committee that includes no crossbenchers or Greens; (9) prevent the addition of further agencies to the list of law enforcement agencies in order to halt creeping government overreach; and (10) provide that the penalty for disclosure of a warrant is reduced significantly from the current two years imprisonment and subject to a public interest test.


I wish to make it very clear that even if all my amendments were to pass—in addition to those proposed by Senators Ludlam, Xenophon and Wang—this would still be bad law. I recognise that I am on the losing side in this matter, so I propose to do two things here. First, I want to explain why one does not protect a free society by legislating liberty away. Secondly, since so few people seem to understand what this bill purports to do, I will explain exactly what it means in practical terms. Everyone has something to hide, and something to fear, from mandatory data retention. It is one thing to require monitoring of certain individuals where there is reasonable cause; but the idea that the government needs to store everyone's metadata without cause, including my 84-year-old mother's, should not be countenanced.


Data retention will do nothing to save us from terrorists. Paedophiles are already canny enough to use the 'dark net' and avoid it. Data retention instead places the entire population under surveillance no matter who they are or how blameless their lives. And thanks to its sheer volume, it will make terrorism harder, not easier, to track. This emerged in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in France; in fact, even real-time collection of targeted metadata was of no benefit to France's police. For the record, I have no problem with data retention when it comes to genuine suspects. But what the attacks in France show is that sifting through data is difficult. It places a significant burden on law enforcement. In France the perpetrators were dropped from watch lists. Finding a needle in a haystack is not made any easier by adding more hay to the stack.


ISPs such as iiNet, TPG and iPrimus, along with Telstra and Optus, will also be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in storage costs, which raises the obvious question: who pays? This bill, as amended—thanks to the PJCIS report—now provides for the Commonwealth to make financial assistance available to ISPs to help pay for this wretched scheme. When you hear the word 'Commonwealth', remember, it really means 'taxpayer'. Wonderful—we will pay for the privilege of being spied on through our phone bills and through our taxes! And we really are talking about everyone—Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, Chief of the Defence Force; Duncan Lewis, the head of ASIO; and Prime Minister Tony Abbott. And unless the bill is amended to ensure data is retained in Australia, it may be simpler to bundle up two years worth of all our personal information and send it directly to the Chinese. After all, cloud storage is cheaper over there and access will not be subject to Australian law.


Then there is the basic reality that the government already has substantial powers to deal with terrorists and paedophiles. Apart from the fact, as Bret Walker SC often points out, that violence and conspiracy to commit violence have always been crimes, Australia's security agencies have extensive surveillance powers. They can, for example, obtain data preservation orders, ensuring metadata is retained and an individual's activities on the internet are examined. They can obtain warrants to intercept phone calls. People can be held and compelled to answer questions. Preventative detention orders and control orders, without any crime having been committed, restrain people from leaving their homes, if it is suspected they may commit a crime in the future. Passports can be cancelled. These powers are already so over the top that there is a serious case to be made that they are incompatible with the rule of law in a liberal democracy. Preventative detention orders and control orders, for example, are a direct assault on the presumption of innocence. They allow people to be locked up without a finding of guilt. And this in 2015, the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, the source of the presumption of innocence at common law!


In preparing these remarks I tried to avoid references to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Too often banal developments are equated to this depressing future world. But in trying to describe the pervasive impact this law will have on our lives, there really is no better reference. In 1949, Orwell wrote of CCTV listening to our every word, in every room and alleyway. Had he imagined the advent of the internet and smartphones and the concept of metadata he would surely have written of the 'Ministry of Retention', tracking every step and every conversation with every device we use.


Government agencies already exploit the information they have about us in disturbing ways. In the year to June 2013, there were almost 320,000 authorisations to access telephone records, including 375 by Australia Post and 15 by Wyndham City Council, in Victoria. Stored data is a honeypot for intrusive snoops and bullies. And those are only the legal ones. That is why it is important to be aware that these immense data retention powers will not be used to fight terrorism. They are not really suited to that. As happened with the UK's Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, RIPA, it is likely they will be used for minor welfare fraud, unpaid parking fines and catching petrol stations engaging in the heinous crime of comparing petrol prices. The latter is especially likely now that the ACC and ASIC have been added to the list of law enforcement agencies.


The idea for data retention of this type came from Europe, which is why Europeans were the first to appreciate that its record in crime clear-up is poor. Germany's parliamentary research unit, for example, surveyed that country's crime statistics, between 2005 and 2010, and found no evidence to suggest that data retention helped solve serious crimes. It was marvellous, though, for catching people who did not pay their rates or who evaded road tolls.


In April last year, the European Court of Justice overturned the EU's Data Retention Directive, in large part because data retention makes life miserable for law-abiding citizens, while criminals dodge it.


 This bill shows government and opposition alike view ordinary people as criminals in waiting. Similar thinking in the past led to proposals for a national identity card to prove we officially exist and for national fingerprint and DNA databases to track us down when we inevitably offend.


What has been forgotten in all this is the fact that it is the state that poses the greatest threat to our freedom, not criminals and terrorists. It is the state that requires watching, not the people. We, the people, should hold the government to account. It is not a legitimate role of government to require us to account for ourselves, unless there is a reasonable suspicion that we have committed or are about to commit a crime.


For police forces across the land to so strongly support mandatory data retention, as their submissions to the PJCIS made clear, suggests they have all forgotten Peel's principles of policing, where the police are the public and the public are the police. ASIO's claim that data retention is justified, thanks to Edward Snowden's exposure of massive US government encroachment on privacy, is Orwellian.


And the claim by our own secret police, the Australian Crime Commission, that not having access to data is equivalent to having two hands tied behind their back, suggests the ACC is ineffectual and should be abolished. This would, of course, represent a considerable saving to the taxpayer.


It is high time that police and security agencies alike rediscovered their erstwhile status as public servants, not public masters. It would be helpful if they returned to real police work. It is legitimate to monitor the data of actual suspects, subject to appropriate oversight, as with traditional phone tapping, but it is not legitimate to treat every Australian as a potential criminal.


Now to my second point: what does mandatory data retention look like in practice? It has become clear to me that many people do not grasp just what this bill involves. Senator Ludlam has explained many of the technical aspects, and I mean no disrespect to him when I say that we need to better understand how it will work. Maybe what follows will convince a few brave souls to join those of us voting against this bill. And remember: mandatory data retention will apply to everyone, not just individuals of interest.


Late last year I undertook a controlled experiment. With the assistance of Mark White, of The Sydney Morning Herald, I had a technical firm record my metadata for a month to see what it revealed. This process deliberately avoided anything to do with my role as a senator. Before entering parliament I ran an agribusiness consulting company; I still have it. Data-monitoring equipment was installed in my business office and connected to the router. Because it only collected data relating to office traffic—my smartphone is tied to my job as a senator—there was no geographical information. This is important to bear in mind, because it was still spectacularly invasive. Without knowing any more than the company's name, in less than a day metadata revealed the business sector in which it operates. It was possible to work out which bank it uses, a record of its purchases, and a record of its staff's purchases—everything from furniture to renovations to compulsory third party insurance. Metadata also revealed how often and for how long staff used social media like Facebook, where they planned to go on holiday, what they wanted to buy for Christmas, and—chillingly—when a female member of staff knocked off early. As an employer, I have never been interested in monitoring people in this way. I have always taken a dim view of bosses who time their employees' loo and cigarette breaks. But at least a worker has a fighting chance of telling that person or company where to get off. Trying to tell the government—which is far more powerful than any employer, union, or professional association—where to get off is another kettle of fish completely.


Despite my desire to keep politics and business separate, metadata also revealed my membership of the Inner West Hunters Club and the subjects I and other members discussed in group emails, including gun law reform. I was not the only person identifiable, either—everyone who corresponded with me also had their identities revealed. It was possible to establish who was publicly in favour of gun law reform, and who was in favour of it privately but unwilling to say anything about the issue in public for, say, employment reasons. The possibilities for blackmail are obvious. Had the analysis included a smartphone, it would have been easy to leap to conclusions based on my location. What would a telephone call or Google search placed in front of a brothel, gay bar or abortion clinic reveal? That will be known from the metadata. Imagine if the caller were not me—with my classical liberal views—but a conservative Christian politician. What mischief could be had at his or her expense?


Yes, it is true that mandatory data retention is relatively easy to evade. My company could start using proxy servers, for example, and its staff could communicate with each other using wickr—which encrypts messages and destroys metadata—instead of normal text messaging. I have no doubt that many people—both criminal and not—will respond to passage of the bill in this way.


But why should a company concerned with the business of keeping animals healthy and crops productive be treated as though its employees are all potential criminals? Among other things, it has an interest in fertilisers. Terrorists use fertiliser. Do you see where this is leading? That is the nub of this issue. Mandatory data retention forces all of us to evade our own government. This is not how the system is supposed to work. What sets liberal democracies apart from authoritarian regimes of every stripe is the relationship between the citizen and the state. The citizen does not just enjoy the ability to 'kick the bums out' at election time. The citizen also has the capacity to hold the government to account, to reject its meddling in his or her life, to come and go as he or she pleases, to tell it where to get off, all subject to few or no controls. When we legislate those capacities away—allowing the state to hold the citizen to account, subjecting the citizen to state control—we then come to resemble the authoritarian regimes we are fond of criticising. Do we really wish to be spoken of in the same breath as Indonesia or Malaysia, whose citizens are monitored extensively and where there are widespread constraints on press freedom? And, make no mistake, these laws will persist, ripe and ready for future misuse by governments of every stripe.


This is bad law—law that compromises our rights and freedoms, treats us all as criminals-in-waiting, and invites abuse and overreach. It is wrong on every level. This bill should not be entertained in a liberal democracy such as ours.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-03-24,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (19:49):  I rise to briefly contribute to the debate on the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014. It is commonly known as the government bill which introduces the new metadata laws. I oppose this bill. The government has used the threat of a terrorist attack from Islamic State to grossly invade the privacy of every Australian. In an opinion piece in the Mercury newspaper Bruce Felmingham, the principal of a Tasmanian economic consulting firm, wrote:


There must be an exceptionally powerful argument for introducing such draconian laws in a pluralist, democratic society such as our own.


I agree with Mr Felmingham—and it is my view that the government has failed to make the argument for introduction of these draconian laws. It is my strong view that the government is misleading the Australian public over the government's capacity to respond to the threat posed by ISIS sympathisers and ISIS soldiers. This government already has the laws and the capacity to crack down on ISIS supporters if it chooses, and those laws are called sedition and treason. It is just that this government has chosen not to use existing laws to charge and put behind bars every Australian who assists in any way whatsoever our enemy the Islamic State and its members.


Why should the majority of law abiding Australians have their privacy invaded because a minority of our citizens have decided that their loyalties lay with a different country—with a different people? Why should the civil rights of law abiding Australians be lessened because some of our citizens decide to betray their country and give support and assistance to foreign powers that would do us harm? Instead of passing these laws, I am calling on this government to use the existing laws of sedition and treason to tackle terrorism—which I will turn to shortly.


I am also calling on this government, politicians and indeed all Australians to discriminate. My call to discriminate may alarm some, especially those who pride themselves on their level of political correctness, but the time has now come in Australia to discriminate against those whose loyalty is not 100 per cent to Australia. While I acknowledge that in Australia, by our law, you are not allowed to discriminate against anyone for his or her race, religion, ethnicity, sexuality and disabilities, it is a little known fact that Australian law—our Constitution—demands that we discriminate against citizens who are not 100 per cent loyal to this country. Senate Practice refers to section 44 of our Constitution, which indicates that anyone who has an allegiance to a foreign power—either formal or informal—is disqualified from standing for election to this place. Clearly, our Constitution and laws demand that even if your loyalty is divided between Australia and a friendly foreign power you are still legally discriminated against and you, correctly, are not allowed to stand for election in this place.


In order to stop the terrorist rot that has set into Australia it is time, firstly, to educate Australians. Rule No. 1: if you do not have 100 per cent loyalty to Australia and our democratic freedoms, rights and privileges then I will say it—and I will continue to say it—get out! As the Australian Constitution states, if you have an allegiance or loyalty to a foreign power not only should you be disqualified from standing for election to this parliament but also you should not be able to vote or to receive government benefits. If your allegiance happens to be with a hostile or foreign power—as is the allegiance of thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of Islamic Australians—then you should be charged with the high crimes of sedition and/or treason, depending on your level of support for our country's enemies. If the government were serious about stopping terrorist attacks on peace-loving, loyal Australians instead of introducing laws to take away our civil rights, then the government, through the Attorney-General, should enforce that every citizen who in any way assists the ISIS forces fighting our troops should face at least seven years maximum jail sentence for sedition.


I know this government is negligent by failing to use existing laws of sedition and treason. If you have the evidence to deny our citizens passports and travel, then you have the evidence to lay charges, at least, of sedition, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years in jail. If some of these young people who are running off to fight and assist ISIS were caught and made to face a serious charge, which carried a seven-year jail sentence, and they, their families and the communities they came from were made to think about the concept of 100 per cent loyalty to our country—a secular constitution and democratic government—then maybe we would be building a more tolerant, safe and free Australia for our children and grandchildren. That is the reverse of what this legislation is doing, which is taking away democratic civil rights and privileges and making us less safe from future home-grown tyrants.


The loyalty or not of citizens of Australia is an important part of the legislative and constitutional foundation of this nation. Those citizens with loyalties divided between Australia and foreign powers that are our enemies are a direct threat to our nation's peace and long-term survival. It is important to know that, in my view, you cannot be a 100 per cent loyal Australian with undivided loyalty if you support sharia law. If you support sharia law it is clear that your allegiance is, at the very least, with a foreign power—namely an overseas religious figure that exercises the powers of both state and church. At the very worst, if you support sharia law it is likely that your allegiance and loyalty is with an overseas religious figure who has declared war on Australia and every other Western democracy, simply because he wants to impose by force his religious rules and rules of state. 


If you do not believe me, just use your reason and look to countries which are ruled by sharia law. They are some of the most backward, violent, aggressive countries in the world, which have failed to separate church and state. They are ruled by religious dictators who promote the death penalty for crimes such as book burning, adultery, being gay and changing your religion. Some of those sharia governed countries may try and put up a window dressing of democracy. Countries like Iran might hold elections, but the reality is that all power—religious, state and military—rests in that one religious dictator who personally chooses all the candidates for the country's election. And God help the world if that Iranian leader is ever allowed to get his finger on a nuclear trigger! Confronting and admitting to ourselves the plain truth of the sharia ideology we are fighting will do more to make us and our children safe than will passing laws like this that will undermine the civil rights of all law-abiding Australians.


Introducing laws which reinstate the death penalty for terrorism and traitors who kill during their attacks will do more to prevent attacks against us from our enemies than this piece of rubbish legislation. If you disagree with that argument, I ask that you think about what would have happened if the Sydney ISIS terrorist had survived the Lindt Cafe siege after killing hostages. The worst our current legal system could have done is to have put him behind bars for life—a sentence he would have welcomed, I am sure, clapping gracefully. He would have been able to turn his jail cell into a terrorist-recruiting cell. Imposing the death penalty on terrorists and traitors who kill during their attacks on Australia will do more to protect the national security of Australia than this legislation will ever do. This legislation and the establishment of the capital equipment that stores the metadata will also cost the Australian taxpayer, and an unknown amount of money at that. Some people are saying it will be $400 million, but that does not appear to take into account the charges that will be levied on all Australian telecommunication users.


I have had community feedback and hundreds of people have contacted my office and expressed their opposition to this legislation. The following is an example of that opposition: 'Given that law-enforcement agencies are already able to apply for a warrant to access metadata for known suspects, I am curious to know just how mandatory data retention will be used.' 


Option 1: will the AFP or state police conduct random audits on Australian residents and citizens' metadata on the off-chance they find something suspicious? This clearly represents an unacceptable intrusion on the right to privacy and does not accord with a free and democratic country. It would be unacceptable to allow the police unfettered access to the metadata of people who are not engaged in or planning any criminal activity. 


Option 2: will the Australian federal police racially, religiously or culturally profile groups of people who they believe may be more likely to engage in terrorist-type activities or other criminal activities or people who are socially undesirable, and do regular checks on their metadata? All Australians, regardless of background and country of origin, should have a right to privacy. I would hope that the AFP and-or police would not engage in this kind of behaviour, but history has shown it to be inevitable. 


There are many examples of the police profiling groups of people based on who they are or their background and treating them unfavourably. For example, Indigenous people and those of ethnic origin are often treated worse than other Australians by the police, resulting in discrimination. If the coalition's proposed laws are passed, this will be a very real outcome of how the metadata will be used, leading to greater disunity in the community and further disenfranchising groups. Those who intend committing atrocities will find other ways to communicate or source information to get around any law change, and I fear that only innocent people will be affected.


Option 3: will the metadata be stored, at a huge cost to industry, until a suspect is identified and then that person's history for the past two years checked? This is the only option that I believe provides an acceptable use of the metadata. This option is already covered by existing laws. The Australian Federal Police and state police simply need to apply for a warrant before accessing the data.


I am struggling to think of any other ways that metadata may be used for law enforcement purposes. It may be noted that, internationally, mandatory data retention has not worked and no compelling arguments or evidence have been provided by the government as to why it would work in Australia. I would like to note that I find any act of terrorism devastating and fully support efforts to combat terrorist activities. However, any law change, particularly that which infringes on the rights of innocent people, must be backed up by evidence that it will actually bloody work. In the case of mandatory data retention, that is not the case.


In closing, it must be said that the mass storage of the metadata of all Australians is a huge invasion of the privacy of every Australian citizen. It is open to misuse and abuse, with no systems to monitor it or monitor whether other countries are hacking into storage facilities and using the data to spy on high-profile Australians and, even, the Australian government itself for both commercial and God knows what other reasons. This level of invasion of privacy, which will be committed on every Australian who uses online phone services, is completely over the top to achieve the purpose the government claims it will achieve. In order to catch a few hundred or thousand terrorists it wants essentially to search every Australian household in this nation via electronic devices.


Giving away this level of privacy of every Australian to that level of invasion by the government and its agencies no longer makes us a free society in my view and in the view of many courts and respected privacy advocates throughout the free world. I say this: I have a very, very strong suspicion that this is going to come back and bite the coalition. When it does there will be a few of us on this side standing up to say, 'I told you so!' I will be looking forward to that. I oppose this legislation.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-24,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (20:02):  I indicate my serious reservation about this legislation and its safeguards or, rather, its lack of adequate safeguards. We do have an existential threat in our nation with the threat of terrorism—I acknowledge that; I am acutely aware of it—but the issue is how you best tackle this threat. My concern is that this bill, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015, will have a number of consequences that will impact on the freedom of the press in this country, which will be unambiguously bad for our democracy. I am concerned that this bill will have the potential to cause serious harm to our democracy without appropriate checks and balances in place. I do recognise the need for legislation to adapt and change in response to new technologies, new political and social circumstances and, above all, threats to our security, but I believe such change should be measured, thought out and carefully considered. This is particularly the case when it comes to security and intelligence, which should have greater accountability and scrutiny than all others because of their greater capacity for abuse. It is interesting to reflect on remarks made by former Senator Faulkner, who put the very simple proposition when the counterterrorism legislation amendment, the foreign fighters bill, was in this place last year that enhanced power requires enhanced accountability. This is enhanced power because of the swoop of metadata storage. The capacity of the state to have everyone's online information, in terms of whom they have contacted, does carry with it a need for much greater scrutiny.


I am concerned in particular about the adverse impact of some of the measures in this legislation on journalists' ability to do their jobs. There is a line that has often been attributed to George Orwell:


Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed. The rest is public relations.


To me, this epitomises the essence of what journalism, at its very best, should be about. Journalism should provide the checks and balances, should hold public figures accountable for their actions and should inform the public and foster debate. There are countless examples of times when journalists have broken stories that were clearly in the public interest but those in power did not want that information to be disclosed. Look at Woodward and Bernstein's expose of Watergate; the Frost-Nixon interviews; the Spycatcher story, when our now Minister for Communications, as a barrister, very courageously defended Peter Wright; the coverage of detainees David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib; and the saga of Dr Mohamed Haneef. My concern is that the provisions in this bill will mean that journalists will no longer be able to investigate such stories because sources and whistleblowers will be too frightened to come forward and because, in some cases, to report on such things will be an offence punishable by imprisonment.


I acknowledge that the government and opposition attempted to address these concerns in relation to the access of journalists' metadata, but I must say I am very disappointed with the compromise that has been reached. The committee stage will give us an opportunity to explore that. With respect, the amendments moved in the House of Representatives do not go nearly far enough. We need to put this in the context that things go wrong. The authorities, our intelligence services, sometimes make mistakes and they need to be held accountable for that. For instance, on 18 February last year the Australian Federal Police raided the offices of the Seven Network in a very heavy-handed manner, as part of a proceeds-of-crime investigation related to a story on Schapelle Corby. Seven West Media chairman Kerry Stokes, the owner of the Seven Network, is big enough and, dare I say, ugly enough to look after himself. And he did, eventually getting an apology for his network from the AFP for executing search warrants, later quashed by the Federal Court, erroneously describing a Seven West lawyer a suspect in the case. But the botched raid shows that the authorities can make mistakes and that the ability for journalists to expose that may well be compromised by this.


The metadata bill will give the AFP and intelligence agencies very long arms to reach into our everyday lives to track our whereabouts and with whom we have been communicating. For journalists, they will require a warrant, but some fear it will be issued as a formality, and the very process of that warrant concerns me greatly. What kind of future are we ushering in for our democracy with this bill? I foreshadow that I will be moving some amendments in the committee stage in an attempt to fill a number of the gaps left by the government and opposition, and I will speak further on this at that stage.


I want to look at the intention of this bill as a whole. The Australian law has, in general, lagged far behind technological advancements. We see this in all sorts of areas, not just national security—the way we have failed to respond to regulation of online gambling, for example—but in this case the most significant matter we are looking at is the regulation of metadata. It is important to note that there is no legal definition of metadata in Australian law or, indeed, in this legislation. While it concerns metadata as it is generally understood, it outlines this under the term 'retained data'. In essence, metadata is everything but the content of a communication, so it includes the fact that I made a phone call at a certain time to a certain person but not what was said between the two parties. When you browse a webpage, however, the distinction between content and metadata disappears because it is all machine-produced and machine-understandable information about web resources. It is all metadata.


As Professor Clinton Fernandes from the University of New South Wales Centre for Cybersecurity said a few months ago: 'Metadata can be incredibly intrusive. For instance, if a woman rings her GP and then an abortion clinic and then her mum but not her boyfriend, you can probably figure out what's going on.' That is incredibly intrusive. Examples of metadata include the email address, the phone number, the voice over internet protocol number, the time and date of the communication, the general location of information such as cell tower data, information about the duration of the communication, and the names and addresses—home, postal and billing if they are different—of the parties.


Under current law, law enforcement agencies do not have to get a warrant to access metadata. They do, however, have to get a warrant to access content. Further, there are a huge number of organisations that can request metadata, and some of the examples that I have put out over the last couple of years include local councils, parking enforcement services and the RSPCA. I acknowledge that this bill tightens that access to law enforcement agencies, although organisations can come under that umbrella term if designated by the minister. But my question is: why shouldn't warrants be required for access to any metadata, but, more importantly, why shouldn't there be much stricter safeguards and protocols for journalists, who are an essential part of our democracy? A free press is at the very foundation of a democracy. Of course the police should be able to access metadata when investigating serious crimes or a terrorist plot in the making and, indeed, they should be able access that information quickly and efficiently, but why should journalists and whistleblowers, who invariably want to expose malfeasance, corruption or waste in government, be subject to the same rules as ISIS, or Daesh? Indeed, there are increasing calls from citizens around the country that the government should not have the right to access their data willy-nilly. That was the response that I got from an article that I wrote for The Drum not so long ago. The extent of information that can be gathered through metadata and the conclusions that can be drawn from it mean that, in some situations, content is almost superfluous.


The arguments put forward by some of my colleagues in this place, Senators Ludlam and Leyonhjelm in particular, have clearly dispelled the myth that metadata is less intrusive than content and so can safely be subject to a lesser level of control and scrutiny. The fact that both Senator Ludlam and Senator Leyonhjelm, on perhaps very different parts of the political spectrum, take this position indicates that this is an issue that goes beyond ideology. Many people are unaware of the scrutiny their information could be subject to both now and under this proposed legislation. The government are, in effect, asking the public to trust them with this information—to trust that it will not be misused or abused—even though there are not any measures to protect against this, as I see it. Historically, blind trust in government has not worked out well for democracy in general and individuals in particular.


The key potential drawbacks to the compromise that was reached between the government and the opposition on the public interest advocates are, firstly, that the public interest advocate cannot disclose any confidential information to the affected journalist or receive instructions from them about how to deal with it, thus limiting the journalist's ability to test any adverse evidence. Secondly, the playing field will be skewed in favour of the authorities. Unlike the authorities, such as the police, who have the resources, researchers and analysts, public interest advocates will lack the resources of an ordinary legal team for the purpose of mounting a proper case in secret. Thirdly, unlike that available to the police or those seeking the warrant on the journalist, who have a long corporate memory, the lack of a searchable database of secret judgements will mean that individual public interest advocates are unaware of what arguments are likely to sway the judge who decides whether to issue the warrant. Fourthly, public interest advocates may well have no power, as I see it, to call witnesses. Finally, the tactic that could be used of prejudicially late disclosure may eliminate the public interest advocate's practical ability to call evidence.


Contrast this bill with the approach in the United States of America, our closest ally. No-one can question their seriousness in tackling terrorism and threats to their citizens, particularly after the calamity of the terrorist attacks of 9/11. After a bungled attempt to obtain metadata from the Washington bureau of the Associated Press some two years ago, the US Attorney General, Eric Holder, issued comprehensive guidelines and protocols to protect journalists' sources. In the United States, media organisations and journalists are given advance notice of an attempt to obtain metadata and have the right to argue the public interest case before a decision is made. I will be moving amendments based on the American approach. Not only has this worked well but just two months ago Mr Holder, the US Attorney, issued new guidelines that further strengthened protections. Just this month, legislation was introduced to the UK's House of Commons which included draft codes of practice to protect journalists' sources where the public interest is also a primary consideration. Back home, it seems the approach to metadata by both the government and the opposition can be paraphrased this way, with apologies to Sting: every click you make, every keyboard stroke you take, the government will be watching you.


I just wanted to reflect briefly on the most recent terrorist attack that this country has had, the awful events of the Sydney siege. Some people say that Man Haron Monis was a madman. He may well have been a madman, but he was also a terrorist. He fulfilled the definition of a terrorist. I still do not understand why this man, with his appalling history of taunting the families of Australian soldiers who had died in service overseas, did not continue to be on a watch list; why this man, with a long history and string of sexual assault matters before the courts, was not still on the watch list; why this man, who was charged as an accessory before the fact of the murder of his wife, was still in the community; and why this man, who praised the work of ISIS and other terrorist groups and jihadists, was allowed on the streets. That does not involve metadata. That involves some decent intelligence work, some appropriate surveillance and, more importantly, information that should have been used and that should have been collated to prevent this man—both madman and terrorist—from doing the terrible harm that he did. Two innocent lives were lost, in my view, needlessly, and I will wait—of course, we need to wait—for what the New South Wales coroner will say.


These are important matters. The impact of this legislation on the free press in this country, in my view, will be chilling. We failed to have the same sorts of safeguards that the United States, our closest ally, has or, indeed, the broader safeguards that are in the process of being adopted in the United Kingdom. For that reason, I will be moving a number of amendments. I look forward to the committee stages of this bill. But I am deeply concerned that our democracy will be weakened as a result of the chilling impact this will have on journalists and their ability to do their valuable work.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (20:17):  I will take a moment to respond to the Greens second reading amendment before Senator Brandis winds up this debate. The Greens second reading amendment would defer consideration of this bill until the government provides a full response to the letter from the Communications Alliance tabled by Senator Ludlam today. That letter expressed concern about the government's contribution to costs of the scheme for industry. Labor does call on the government to work with industry to finalise arrangements around the costs of this scheme. We have been clear all along that the government should be transparent about the costs of this scheme with both industry and the public.


The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security made a number of recommendations about how costs would be met. Chief among them was that the government should meet a substantial proportion of those costs. However, there is no need to hold up this bill while final details of costs are settled. The government has assured us and the public that it will honour the committee's recommendations in full. I also note that the letter tabled by Senator Ludlam does not ask the government to delay this legislation.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-24,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (20:18):  In closing the second reading debate, I thank honourable senators for their contributions. In particular, I acknowledge the thoughtful contributions of Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Xenophon, and I will respond with particularity to certain of the issues which those two senators from the independent crossbench have raised. I see Senator Xenophon is still in the chamber. So let me say to you, Senator Xenophon, that anyone listening to the broadcast of this debate could be forgiven for thinking from some of the language that has fallen from the lips of Senator Xenophon or Senator Leyonhjelm and others who have spoken from the crossbench or from the Greens that this bill proposed an important or significant or even draconian new set of powers which the state would be able to exercise over the citizen. You would think that that was so from what those contributions suggested.


I can tell you and those who may be listening to this broadcast tonight that this bill contains no powers exercisable by the state over the citizen. Not one. The only change that this bill makes to the relationship between the state and the citizen is to introduce safeguards in relation to the access of law enforcement agencies to metadata which were not there before. That is the only change this bill introduces to the relationship between the state and the citizen. Senator Leyonhjelm, whose libertarian principles I greatly respect, would be reassured to know that, whereas under existing law some 85 government agencies and even local councils and NGOs can access metadata, as a result of the bill before the chamber this evening, that number of agencies has been reduced to 21. Those 21 agencies—all of them law enforcement agencies—are set out in the bill, and they cannot be added to except by regulation, which is disallowable by this chamber. So, far from expanding the power and the reach of the state, this bill very significantly reduces the power and reach of the state by reducing by three-quarters the number of bodies which can access metadata without a warrant. 


It would shock you, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, to learn of some of the agencies which today can access metadata but, as a result of this bill, will no longer be able to do so. Some eight Commonwealth departments will no longer be able to do so. Australia Post will no longer be able to do so. The Clean Energy Regulator; the Office of Environment and Heritage of the New South Wales government; and municipal authorities including the Ipswich City Council, the Knox City Council and the Wyndham City Council can today access metadata. As a result of this bill, they will no longer be able to do so.


Would you believe, Mr Acting Deputy President, that even the RSPCA can today access metadata? But, as a result of this bill, they will no longer be able to do so, because this bill, by proposed section 110A, limits the agencies which can access metadata specifically to law enforcement agencies: the Australian Federal Police and the state and territory police forces; the anticorruption authorities in the states; and the principal economic regulators—ASIC, the ATO and the ACCC. All of those agencies of course can access metadata today, as can another 60-odd agencies or entities; as a result of this bill, they will be prohibited from doing so. So, far from expanding the power of the state over the individual, Senator Xenophon and Senator Leyonhjelm, this bill actually does the opposite.


It also introduces a provision that is not part of our law at the moment—that is, a large and detailed architecture of protection for journalists. There are no protections for journalists under existing law. There are none to prevent access to metadata concerning journalists or their sources. But, as a result of this bill, there are protections. And I have heard your critique of them, Senator Xenophon; I will deal with it in particularity during the committee-stage debate. I simply make the broad proposition that, whereas under existing law there are no protections for journalists and their sources in relation to metadata, under this bill there will be. How this bill can then be described as having a 'chilling effect' on the freedom of the press, when it introduces a protection of the freedom of the press which forms no part of the existing law, escapes me. 


As well, there are other protective mechanisms, Senator Xenophon. There is, for example, a new role given to the Commonwealth Ombudsman which does not exist under existing law, to ensure that access to metadata is not abused. There are additional powers of oversight given to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security which do not exist under the current law, to ensure that access to metadata is not abused. So, far from this being a bill that introduces draconian new powers, it introduces no new powers but extensive new safeguards.


Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, let me explain very simply why both sides of politics, after long deliberation, have concluded that there is a need for this legislation. For more than 20 years or so, telecommunications service providers and ISPs have collected the metadata of their clients as a business record—as a business record—because they needed it for billing purposes. That is why the metadata was stored, and it has been accessed by the 85 or more agencies and entities that I mentioned before, essentially for law enforcement or regulatory purposes. But, with the evolution of technology, the retirement of legacy systems and, in particular, the change in the billing practices of the telcos, it is no longer necessary for them to retain that metadata, so they are not doing so. But, as a result, the capacity of the law enforcement agencies to conduct criminal investigations, which are materially assisted by access to metadata, has been degraded. So the core provision of this bill is to impose upon telecommunications companies an obligation to retain the metadata that they hitherto had retained anyway for two years. What the bill does, in effect, is freezes the status quo. 


So, not only does the bill contain no new powers of the state against the citizen, not only does the bill contain protections which do not exist under existing law; what the bill does in relation to the telcos is it freezes a status quo which has existed for the last two decades and about which we have heard no complaint from those who have suddenly and rhetorically seen fit to claim, erroneously, that the bill contains draconian new powers.


Let me turn to another error, which came from Senator Xenophon, I am sorry to say, and from others who have spoken in this debate—that, as a result of this bill, 'The government will hold our metadata.' No, it will not, Senator Xenophon. The government will not hold metadata as a result of this bill. What this bill does is mandates private industry to retain metadata that it currently retains. It is the private sector, not the government, that will retain the information, the metadata, that it actually currently retains. You praise the American system, Senator Xenophon, but you do not refer to the fact that, in the American system, government agencies hold metadata. But, under our system, no government agency holds metadata. The 21 agencies listed in proposed section 110A of the bill will have access to that metadata on the same basis that they currently do, but with additional safeguards. But that is all.


Let me turn to the claim that has been made, in particular in Senator Ludlam's contribution, that this legislation has been rushed and that there has been insufficient deliberation. Well, Senator Ludlam, I do not know what you think is rushed, but the process by which this legislation was developed was initiated in May 2012—almost three years ago—when my predecessor, then Attorney-General Roxon, sent a reference to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, asking it to review, among other things, the applicability in Australia of the European Data Protection Directive. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, of which I was a member during the last parliament, deliberated at great length throughout the rest of 2012 and the early months of 2013. In May 2013 it produced a unanimous report after a year of deliberation, in which there seemed to me to be endless hearings—the hearings are actually listed in the appendices to the report. It received thousands of pages of submissions. The PJCIS produced this unanimous report. Then, with the change of government and acting upon the unanimous report that was tabled during the period of the previous Labor government, my department developed this bill.


The bill was introduced by my colleague, Mr Malcolm Turnbull—who is not well-known for his authoritarian propensities, I might say—into the House of Representatives on 30 October last year. The bill was referred back to the same committee, which, now under the chairmanship of Mr Dan Tehan, the member for Wannon, deliberated at great length again—in particular during the Christmas period—and on 27 February produced a detailed report with 38 recommendations, many of which involved amendments to the bill, plus a 39th recommendation that the bill be passed. That report was also unanimous. The government, having considered that unanimous report of the PJCIS decided to adopt all of the recommendations of the report. We have the balance of this week—for many hours to come—to debate the bill in the committee stage. So far from being rushed, it cannot honestly be said that that is so, when this is the work of two parliaments, of two successive governments, of two long inquiries by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, spanning almost three years.


Let me, in the time left to me, turn to—though we will return to it more detail—the claim that we heard from Senator Xenophon that this will have a chill effect on freedom of the press. Well, Senator Xenophon, about a quarter of the bill, about 20 pages, is devoted to a very extensive architecture of protections of the very thing about which you claim to care but which under existing law has no protection is at all—none at all. Division 4C is devoted to the matter. To respond to your claims, Senator, that you fear that a rubber-stamp approach might be taken to approvals, we have a long series of criteria about which the minister must be satisfied and then a long series of criteria in relation to which a court must be satisfied and, uniquely in my experience in Commonwealth law, we have the creation of the special statutory office—a public-interest advocate who can appear and argue where appropriate that it is not in the public interest that a warrant be issued in relation to a journalist or a journalist's source. At the moment, access to metadata by some 85 agencies and entities is warrantless. This legislation introduces a requirement for a warrant, where none existed before; a more complex series of preconditions and the procedural steps and criteria for the issue of the warrant, where none existed before; and a unique provision for a public-interest advocate, which is unknown in any other area of Commonwealth law enforcement where warrants are required.


It is being claimed by some, particularly from the Greens, that metadata has no utility. Senator Leyonhjelm said the same thing: that the retention of metadata has no investigative significance. I note what you say, Senator Leyonhjelm and Senators from the Greens, but that is not the view of those who actually have the responsibility for carrying out these investigations. As I have done many times, I refer you to the view of the much-respected former Director-General of ASIO, Mr David Irvine, who, when asked about the importance of metadata in the investigation of terrorist crime and terrorist networks, said that it was 'absolutely crucial', a view shared by the current Director-General of ASIO, Duncan Lewis, and by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. You may have a scepticism about the law enforcement authorities being interested in accreting to themselves more power, but, as I have pointed out to you, they do not have any additional powers under these laws—none. I, with all due respect to my colleagues, would rather rely on the professional judgement and advice of those who actually have the responsibility than on the wild rhetorical claims of certain senators with no professional experience in the field at all. Metadata is in fact used in every significant criminal, organised criminal, paedophile and terrorist investigation.


Finally, let me address the issue of cost, and I note Senator Ludlam's second reading amendment, which, of course, the government will oppose. The question of cost is a matter of discussion, and has been for some months now a matter of discussion, between government and industry. The government announced, as Mr Turnbull made clear in his second reading speech in the House of Representatives on 30 October, that the government will make a substantial contribution to the capital costs of industry in establishing a retention regime. In relation to the ongoing costs, a PricewaterhouseCoopers review has estimated that, even if there were to be no government funding, the average cost over 10 years would equate to between $1.83 and $6.12 per customer per annum, with a median price of $3.98 per customer per annum. That is not, it seems to me, with all due respect, Senator, a vast cost for what this legislation seeks to do to preserve—not to extend; in fact, in important ways to limit—an important investigative capability.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Ludlam be agreed to.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be now read a second time.


Bill read a second time.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (22:00):  I am grateful for this opportunity this evening to rise and briefly acknowledge that today, 24 March, marks World Tuberculosis Day, which aims to raise awareness of the fact that, even in today's modern world, tuberculosis is a disease that causes the death of nearly 1.5 million people each year. The date for World Tuberculosis Day is chosen because 24 March marks the anniversary of the day in 1882 that German Nobel Laureate, Dr Robert Koch, discovered the bacterium which causes the disease.


I think most Australians would be surprised to learn of the prevalence of TB in today's world. Many of us think of it as a disease that has been consigned to history. But, in fact, the World Health Organisation estimates that around 9 million people contracted the disease in 2013 and, as I mentioned a moment ago, around 1.5 million lost their lives to TB in that year alone. The overwhelming bulk of these cases occur in developing nations. Further, the World Health Organisation estimates suggest around two billion of the world's citizens are infected with latent TB. That is almost one third of the world's population—and the chance of latent TB becoming active in a person's lifetime is around 10 per cent. Those at highest risk are those with compromised immune systems—people living with HIV, the undernourished and smokers are at particular risk. TB is ultimately responsible for around a quarter of all HIV-related deaths.


Last night, as chair of the Parliamentary Liaison Group for HIV/AIDS, Blood Borne Viruses and Sexually Transmitted Infections, I was pleased to join with a number of parliamentary colleagues from all parties, including Senator Moore who is in the chamber this evening, to attend an event here in Parliament House to launch the Australasian Tuberculosis Forum. We were joined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon. Julie Bishop, representing the Prime Minister, who announced that Australia will offer further support towards the eradication of tuberculosis and malaria in the Indo-Pacific region. This $30 million investment over three years will help with the introduction of new diagnostic tests and drugs to deal with the epidemic. When we say 'developing nations', many Australians automatically tend to think of the nations of Africa. But it is important to realise that this epidemic is one that that is very much occurring in our own region. More than half of global TB cases—around 56 per cent—occur in the Asia-Pacific, with our nearest neighbour, Papua New Guinea, being especially hard hit at present.


Last night's function was also addressed by the chair of the newly formed Australasian Tuberculosis Forum, Dr Justin Denholm, who offered some interesting historical analogies. In Australia, 100 years ago, TB was contracted by around 100 people in every 100,000—which is about the same as the rate as those affected today in Malaysia or Thailand. In Australia now, the infection rate is fewer than just six in every 100,000—meaning there has been roughly a 20-fold decrease in infections over the past century. That is, indeed, a very happy story. Our challenge is now to determine the best way to share that good fortune with our neighbours. Announcements such as the one made by Minister Bishop last night are an important part of the process.


Last evening's function also heard some harrowing personal stories, including one from Mrs Louie Zepeda, a young woman from the Philippines who was on her way to building a strong career as an architect before contracting tuberculosis meningitis. Regrettably, her condition worsened, with the effects including paralysis, insomnia and psychosis from the gruelling treatment regime that she undertook. Eventually, the treatment left Mrs Zepeda blind, thus ending her burgeoning career as an architect. Sadly, her story is just one of many similar tales.


Current tools for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of TB are outdated and have not really evolved from the time the test was first developed in 1882. It has a number of limitations, not least of which being that it only detects 45 to 60 per cent of active TB cases and is not able to detect multiple-drug resistant TB. The current TB vaccine was developed in 1921, but is largely ineffective in preventing adult TB, can wear off over time and does not offer adequate protection against TB of the lungs.


TB is one of the most serious public health challenges now affecting our region. It is my hope that Australia's ongoing efforts to provide support to nations in our region suffering through the epidemic will play a significant role in reducing the disease's impact in the years immediately ahead. In conclusion, I would like to extend my gratitude to Mrs Mary Moran and Ms Isabelle Brown of Policy Cures who first came to see me in my capacity as chair of the Parliamentary Liaison Group for HIV/AIDS, Blood Borne Viruses and Sexually Transmitted Infections. Their passion, their commitment and their conviction are very powerful tools for advocacy around TB issues. I am sure many of us would share their ambition for a modern cure for TB.
