Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (09:01):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Australia's strong economy and Australia's social safety nets are the envy of the world.


In this bill, we see Australia at its very best.


In this bill, we see that we still can be the strong, smart, fair Australia that created the age pension and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Medibank, Medicare and universal superannuation.


In this bill, we see that there is still a place for collective action to solve those great pressures of life that are too big and complex for individuals and families to solve alone.


In this bill, we see a nation united in a spirit of concern to strengthen and extend the fair go, to ensure no-one is left behind. We also see a parliament ready to put the national interest ahead of ideology.


To those who say Australian politics no longer works, I say simply: read the Medicare Levy Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill.


This is a united embrace of national responsibility and a great act of mutual care and solidarity.


Every week or fortnight, a sliver of the pay packet will go to DisabilityCare Australia: around a dollar a day for the average earner.


But all that money added together from every corner of the nation will be a mighty force for good.


Today we give an assurance to all Australians who live with disability and to those who care for them: DisabilityCare Australia will be here when you need it—election after election, decade after decade, generation after generation.


It is a new assurance for 410,000 Australians living with significant, permanent disability now and for their families and carers.


Today we also give a new assurance to all those Australians who do not have a disability today but who, through the vagaries of fortune, will come to have a significant, permanent disability in times to come.


For everyone who thinks, 'It couldn't happen to me—could it?' this bill brings peace of mind, it brings the knowledge that a scheme as well designed and stably funded as Medicare will be here when you need it.


Let me turn to the detail of the bill.


The bill will increase the Medicare levy by half a percentage point, from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent, from 1 July 2014.


The bill also makes consequential changes to the upper phase-in amount for low-income taxpayers with income between certain thresholds—as well as to the formula for calculating the amount of a person's Medicare levy liability where a person has a spouse or dependants.


These changes reflect the increase in the Medicare levy.


Low-income earners will continue to receive relief from the Medicare levy through the low-income thresholds for singles, families, seniors and pensioners.


The current exemptions from the Medicare levy will also remain in place, including for blind pensioners and sickness allowance recipients.


A number of other tax rates that include a component for the Medicare levy will also increase in line with this change—these include increases in the rate of fringe benefits tax and excess contributions tax.


These bills will be introduced by my ministers today and further details of these consequential increases are set out in the explanatory memorandum.


Every cent raised by the increase in the Medicare levy will be allocated to a special fund over the next decade—the DisabilityCare Australia Fund.


By law, the fund will only be spent on supporting people with disability through DisabilityCare Australia.


The DisabilityCare Australia Fund will be established by the DisabilityCare Australia Fund Bill 2013, which will be put before the House as part of this package.


Full details of this fund will be outlined in the explanatory memorandum to that bill which is to be tabled by the Deputy Prime Minister shortly.


Increasing the Medicare levy will raise approximately $20.4 billion between 2014-15 and 2018-19—amounting to approximately 55 per cent of the total cost of funding DisabilityCare Australia over that period.


The Commonwealth's share of the fund will go toward our additional contribution to DisabilityCare Australia.


This will cover around 60 per cent of the Australian government's new net spending on the scheme over the 10 years from 2014-15.


In last night's budget, the Deputy Prime Minister outlined that through this increased levy and other wise savings, DisabilityCare Australia is fully funded.


DisabilityCare Australia is designed to ensure every Australian with significant and permanent disability, regardless of where he or she lives, gets the care and support they need.


DisabilityCare Australia will end the notorious 'postcode lottery' for people with disabilities in this country.


I want no more of the unfairness and irrationality by which a person gets vastly different support merely because of where he or she lives or how a disability was acquired.


This requires the commitment and support of state and territory governments.


The government will assist the states and territories with funding their share of DisabilityCare Australia by setting aside some of the money going into the DisabilityCare Australia Fund.


Over the life of the fund, the states and territories will be allocated a total of $9.7 billion.


The states and territories will be able to draw down from the fund when they meet key conditions for implementation.


DisabilityCare Australia will have full coverage across the Australian Capital Territory by July 2016, in New South Wales and South Australia by July 2018, and Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory by July 2019.


These agreements will see the scheme cover around 90 per cent of the total Australian population.


The Western Australian allocation from the fund will be quarantined until we reach agreement with that state.


We encourage the Western Australian government to join the cause.


All our people deserve the best.


To ensure that DisabilityCare Australia is fully funded, the government has implemented a number of other savings measures.


Part of the savings from reforms to the government's assistance for private health insurance announced in the 2012-13 MYEFO which have not been allocated to the government's dental package will support DisabilityCare.


Funding will also come from reforms to retirement incomes policy, the phase-out of the net medical expenses tax offset and other long-term savings decisions now announced as part of the 2013-14 budget.


Making a new call upon the finances of Australians is not something that is done without care in this country. The fact is when a levy does happen, there is a very good reason for it and rightly so: Bob Hawke with the Medicare levy; John Howard with the levy for gun buy-backs; the government's flood levy which rebuilt Queensland; and, now, this increase in the Medicare levy to support DisabiltyCare.


Ours has been a fiscally-responsible government—offsetting all new spending since 2009, holding expenditure at a level lower than the average seen over the past 25 years.


A levy was not our first choice of funding vehicle for DisabilityCare.


But, with the high dollar and the historic anomaly of nominal GDP growth falling below real GDP growth for a sustained period, the revenue write-downs have been unprecedented: $17 billion for this financial year since the last budget update alone.


In short, the facts have changed.


I am also deeply conscious that the states and territories face their own fiscal pressures arising from these same complex economic circumstances.


So we want to be able to offer them more support to pay for the scheme, which is why a substantial share of funds raised by this levy will go to the states and territories.


Most importantly, we have listened to the sound case made by disability support groups for secure, ongoing funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


In a time of burden sharing and wise savings, they are right to want to ensure that DisabilityCare has a sustainable and stable funding stream, in order to guarantee the security DisabilityCare is designed to bring.


The President of People with Disability Australia, Craig Wallace, has summarised the argument well. The levy will be, in his words:


An insurance premium for good times and bad ... people's disabilities will not go away the next time we have a surplus.


That is the backdrop against which I introduce this bill.


That is why the government not only has bipartisan support for this bill; we have near-nationwide agreement on this scheme.


Following the groundbreaking agreement with New South Wales last December, the other jurisdictions have joined the cause, one by one: South Australia, the ACT, Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland and most recently the Northern Territory.


That means 90 per cent of Australians are now part of the plan, leaving only the people of Western Australia still waiting for a decision by their premier.


People with disabilities and their families have campaigned so long to design and fund a national disability insurance scheme.


Many of those advocates are watching here today, and they will be very focused on what is happening in this parliament. I want to take the time to welcome those in the gallery and so many beyond who are following proceedings today. I acknowledge you all now and I acknowledge, most importantly, the passion and dedication of so many people with disability, so many families and carers, who have brought the campaign to this point.


In recent weeks, as the momentum you have built has broken through, as we have struck agreements with states and territories and announced details of the funding, I have seen the hope and anticipation which Australians with disability, particularly young Australians, now share.


The Saturday before last, I travelled to Melbourne to meet with the Premier of Victoria and sign my state, the state in which I live, to DisabilityCare.


In Melbourne, I saw Sophie, a twelve-year-old girl who lives with Down syndrome.


As her parents describe her, Sophie 'reads and writes, mucks around on the monkey bars, can be well behaved and badly behaved, runs like a billy goat, and is a budding photographer'.


She took my photo while we were there.


Last week I travelled to Brisbane to meet Premier Newman and sign up Queensland to DisabilityCare.


While I was there, I met Sandy, who is 17 and lives with a physical disability similar to cerebral palsy.


Sandy has big dreams for his future, like any teenager, but his future also has some big needs: mobility aids that cost tens of thousands of dollars, personal care to maintain his hygiene and physical therapy to maintain his muscles and his health.


When I met this young man he handed me a card signed by him and his mates to say thanks for what we are doing for people with disability—a card illustrated by the photo Sophie had taken a week before.


In years to come, DisabilityCare Australia will ensure Sophie and Sandy and so many other young people with disability will have the security and dignity every Australian deserves.


This, above all, is why Australians are so overwhelmingly supportive of DisabilityCare.


Over the past six years, the idea of a national disability insurance scheme has found a place in our nation's hearts.


In March, we gave it a place in our nation's laws.


Today we inscribe it in our nation's finances.


The people who have gathered here today from around the country to witness this debate know what this means.


There will be no more 'in principle' and no more 'when circumstances permit'.


There will be launches, not trials; permanent care, not temporary help.


DisabilityCare starts in seven weeks' time, and there will be no turning back. 


I commend this bill to the House.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:58):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill implements one of the pillars of the government's $1 billion Plan for Australian Jobs.


It will improve access for Australian businesses to work on major investment projects, placing them into global supply chains and growing Australian jobs.


Together with the establishment of 10 industry and innovation precincts and increased support for the growth of Australian small- and medium-sized businesses, the Plan for Australian Jobs will grow industry, grow business opportunities and grow jobs.


Australia's economy is resilient.


The Labor government's economic management and the hard work of all Australians have delivered impressive growth, low unemployment and low inflation through a period which has seen the biggest global economic downturn since the Great Depression.


We are well placed to look to the future with confidence and we have continued to make the reforms that will support a strong and diverse economy into the future.


While the economy broadly is doing well, the high Australian dollar and difficult international conditions are putting pressure on many of our industries, particularly manufacturing.


The government's industry and innovation statement entitled A Plan for Australian Jobs is a detailed set of policies which addresses these pressures. It will ensure Australian industry is able to access and take advantage of opportunities, improve competitiveness through innovation and adapt to new economic realities.


The plan will ensure that Australians continue to have high skilled, well paid jobs in the advanced manufacturing industries that will be the backbone of the modern economy.


As part of this package of reforms, the government has introduced this bill, which will invest $98.2 million to strengthen the ability of Australian businesses to win work on major investment projects. This reform will deliver more jobs for Australians from the massive investment projects underway in our economy.


Through consultations with industry and others, it has become apparent that the increased use of global engineering and procurement firms has led to an increased reliance on the use of established global supply chains by major project proponents.


In order for Australian industry to grow in a global economy, access to these supply chains is crucial.


That is why under this bill any domestic project worth $500 million or more must demonstrate how it will provide opportunities to local businesses through an Australian Industry Participation (AIP) plan.


Success in supplying to major projects in Australia is a crucial way for Australian businesses to integrate into global supply chains. Australian businesses are being denied opportunities to win work across a range of sectors.


As well as the use of established supply chains by proponents, there are a variety of reasons why this is occurring, including the size of tender packages, specification of foreign standards in project requirements and a simple lack of information about local capabilities.


Analysis of publically available information on major projects indicates that more than half of the current major projects are currently not subject to AIP requirements.


The total value of these projects without an AIP plan is approximately $32 billion. Without a comprehensive and consistent approach to AIP, Australian industry participation in major projects will continue to decline.


This bill will require major projects, both private and public, with a capital expenditure of $500 million or more to develop an AIP plan. An AIP plan outlines the actions a project proponent will take to provide Australian businesses with full, fair and reasonable opportunity to participate in a major project.


This goes beyond the Commonwealth's existing mechanisms for an AIP plan through the Enhanced Project By-law Scheme and Commonwealth grants, procurement and loan arrangements.


Under this bill, AIP plans will be applied to initial project construction and to the initial operational phase of major projects if they involve a new facility. For the first time, this bill specifies consequences for AIP non-compliance.


These consequences include adverse publicity notices, naming a relevant person and the ability for the authority to seek performance and restraining injunctions to force compliance with the legislation.


The bill requires an AIP plan to be prepared at an appropriately early stage of project approval, such as events during the early design and development of the project.


This increases the chances of Australian entities winning work as tender specifications can be developed with Australian capabilities in mind, rather than having to comply with pre-existing specifications drawn up with overseas suppliers and established supply chains in mind. Those making procurement decisions on behalf of the project will be required to keep themselves informed of industry capability and capacity in relation to the major project prior to tendering.


A mandatory element of AIP plans will be information on standards to be used in the project. Design specifications should take Australian industry capabilities and capacity and Australian and international standards into account so that Australian entities are not 'designed out' of the project. 


In addressing this element, if the project proponent is not using Australian or international standards it will need to state why these standards are being used. The provision of information on standards will be material to AIP plan compliance.


The bill will apply to corporations and draw on the corporations power as defined in the Constitution to capture those organisations running major projects. 


The bill is designed to apply to projects that are at an early stage of development and that reach a trigger point for the legislation after it comes into effect and from then on.


The bill also creates a new Australian Industry Participation Authority to administer the new AIP requirements. 


The bill provides the authority with a sufficient range of powers to ensure compliance with the bill and to deliver a range of other initiatives aimed at building capability and capacity within local business and linking them with new opportunities. 


To maximise coordination and focus, all Australian government requirements for AIP plans and the related support activities that boost industry capability and capacity will be delivered by the authority.


The authority will evaluate, approve AIP plans, publish AIP plan summaries, monitor and report on the AIP plan implementation and impose administrative consequences for noncompliance.


The authority will also take responsibility for delivering support arrangements to help our businesses develop the capabilities and connections needed to capture these opportunities. 


The authority will improve coordination between the Buy Australian At Home and Abroad initiative and supplier advocates and other relevant parts of AusIndustry and Enterprise Connect. It will be a one-stop-shop for Australian entities seeking to build capability and capacity and link into new business opportunities. 


The work of supplier advocates is to use their professional networks, business experience and access to decision makers to increase the competitiveness and capacity of SMEs, and help them connect with new business opportunities. 


Advocates build on the activities of industry partners and government agencies, including Enterprise Connect, the Industry Capability Network Ltd, Austrade and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.


In addition to the recently announced Automotive Supplier Advocate, advocates currently work in the resources, rail, steel, information technology, clean technologies, water and textiles, clothing and footwear sectors. 


This bill represents a determined approach to helping Australian businesses develop the capabilities, experience and connections needed to capture opportunities from major projects, grow their businesses, enter global supply chains and create jobs.


In effect, the bill provides Australian firms with the same fair and reasonable opportunities afforded to the global supply chain partners of major project proponents. AIP plans are consistent with trade obligations, consistent with our values and an open dynamic economy and promote, not stifle, competition.


It has been estimated that this bill could bring in extra work worth between $1.6 billion and $6.4 billion per annum for local businesses. Winning work on these major projects not only has immediate benefits for local companies and their employees. 


It also allows them to gain experience, increase the scale of their operations and establish connections and commercial relationships with some of the largest multinational companies in the world. 


This will improve the prospects for Australian companies to win more work in the global supply chains of the large project investors and developers. 


In conclusion, the reforms contained within this bill will support the creation and retention of Australian jobs and will open up global supply chains so Australian business can access the opportunities that will underpin industry growth. I commend it to the House.


Debate adjourned.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (10:38):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, I present the following reports: Inquiry into the gathering and use of criminal intelligence, Examination of the Australian Crime Commission annual report 2011-12and Examination of the Australian Federal Police annual report 2011-12.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the reports were made Parliamentary Papers.




Mr HAYES:
  By leave—I support the three reports of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement. I will direct my remarks to the inquiry into criminal intelligence before addressing the committee's examination of the ACC and the AFP annual reports respectively.


The committee initiated an inquiry into the gathering and use of criminal intelligence in May 2012. During the course of the inquiry, the committee received evidence from all Commonwealth, state and territory agencies engaged in gathering and using criminal intelligence. On behalf of the committee, I thank all those agencies and individuals who contributed to the inquiry and specifically acknowledge the cooperation of the Australian Crime Commission and its chief executive officer, Mr John Lawler.


The scope of information gathered and shared by agencies is reflected in the fact that over 450,000 information and intelligence products were uploaded to the ACC's criminal intelligence database in 2010-11. In 2010, 1.7 million individual searches of companies were conducted on the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's database. Evidence to the committee suggested that the level of cooperation across agencies is as it has ever been. There are numerous challenges and impediments which, quite frankly, limit intelligence sharing.


The inquiry brought to light serious legislative, technological and other challenges to the flow of intelligence, which has produced unequal intelligence holdings and incomplete pictures of crime threats and has undermined stakeholder confidence. Criminal intelligence is currently stored in more than 30 systems operated by law enforcement, police, national security and other government agencies with limited interoperability between them. Without a single consistent methodology for criminal intelligence, different agencies apply different approaches and methods and are at different stages in developing their criminal intelligence capabilities. The siloing of intelligence brought about by these challenges and the absence of an agreement on a consistent way to collect, collate, analyse, store and disseminate criminal intelligence was identified by the ACC as a primary obstacle to producing an interoperable criminal intelligence system and a complete picture of the criminal threat in Australia.


In late 2012 the 15 ACC board agencies, together with CrimTrac and the Australia New Zealand Police Advisory Agency, endorsed a proposal to establish an Australian criminal intelligence model in response to these challenges. The model, ACIM, brings together for the first time 17 agencies from three different and distinct operating environments: serious and organised crime, national security, policing and community safety.


The model seeks to provide a consistent approach to managing national intelligence assets across these three environments through the establishment of common standards, protocols and processes. During the inquiry the committee focused its attention on the development of the ACIM and the role of the Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement agencies in relation to it. Matters raised concerned the appropriate handling and protection of intelligence shared from unauthorised disclosure and dealing with data duplication.


The committee made 12 recommendations relating to the use, gathering and sharing of criminal intelligence. These recommendations are directed at ensuring that the ACIM agencies are all accountable for the information and intelligence contributed to the national holding, which has in place a strong, accountable oversight regime. Amongst the recommendations, the committee supports the establishment of a national repository for criminal intelligence.


The committee highlighted the need to establish a repository that provides timely intelligence and interoperability across the respective agencies that complements the current databases as well as the information management systems operated by those agencies. The committee considered a number of options raised in the evidence in relation to a repository, including the establishment of the police Google system. The committee also highlighted the key determining factors for selecting the most appropriate repository including addressing legislative impediments, sovereignty, jurisdictional ownership and privacy considerations.


The committee considered a number of options raised in evidence in relation to a repository, including the establishment of a police Google system.


The committee also highlighted the key determining factors for selecting the most appropriate repository including the address of legislative impediments, sovereignty, jurisdictional ownership and privacy considerations.


The report goes into some detail about the determining factors raised in evidence which must be taken into consideration in the design of such a repository.


While the evidence brought to light the different systems, processes and approval mechanisms in place across law enforcement agencies, it also highlighted to the committee the complexities in establishing a national interoperable system.


However, while there were varying views about a national model and how it should be realised, no single agency or individual argued that the status quo provided an adequate criminal intelligence system.


The committee recognised that there are no quick fixes and the establishment of a national model is complex not least because cultural change is part of the solution. Flexibility and compromise will be required on the part of all involved agencies but there must be a risk appetite for and appreciation of the benefits from establishing these reforms.


The committee argues that it is critically important that all agencies invest in change, build on commonality and cooperate to provide full accountability and an interoperable national criminal intelligence model.




Examination of the ACC Annual Report 2011-12



I will now turn to the committee's report on the examination of the Australian Crime Commission's Annual Report. The committee has a statutory duty to examine the annual report of the Australian Crime Commission as well as the Australian Federal Police.


During its examination of the ACC Annual Report 2011-12, the committee focused its attentions on the ACC's key performance indicators and raised a number of concerns. Of a total of seven KPIs, three are quantitative measures of performance and the remainder are measured by stakeholder feedback.


The committee noted the complexities in measuring the ACC's results which have moved beyond the traditional methods of measuring law enforcement outcomes.


However, the committee recognised that the most useful of the ACC's KPIs would be enhanced if there were a balance between qualitative and quantitative indicators and targets against which to examine performance.


In addition, while the committee recognises that the stakeholder survey is an important means of gauging the ACC's performance, it should be used as one of a number of tools of performance measurement.


The committee recommends a focus on the KPIs and it encourages the ACC to continue working towards a greater balance between the qualitative and quantitative KPIs which can be measured over time. The committee also recommends that the 2012-13 ACC Annual Report detail progress made towards establishing such a balance.


In relation to the ACC's programs and activities in 2011-12, the committee acknowledged the important work that the ACC had undertaken and highlighted initiatives such as Task Force Galilee.


The task force was established in response to concerns about serious and organised investment fraud which cost 2,600 Australians more than $114 million over the last five years. In collaboration with 40 partners including industry organisations, the ACC engaged in identifying and disrupting these fraudulent activities.


The committee commends the ACC on its work in this area and its efforts in detecting and disrupting serious and organised crime.




Examination of the AFP Annual Report 2011-12



I now turn to the examination of the Australian Federal Police Annual Report 2011-12.


Newly introduced amendments in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 empowered the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce to commence and conduct proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act legislation.


As the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce commenced as a permanent taskforce in January 2012, the committee focused its examination on the AFP's activities around the proceeds of crime.


The first litigation to restrain assets was carried out under Operation Beaufighter. This joint investigation and operation dismantled a multimillion dollar tax evasion and money-laundering scheme. The Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce restrained more than $54 million in assets, including luxury cars and real estate. Operation Beaufighter comprised the largest tax fraud investigation since Project Wickenby was launched in 2006.


In relation to operations, investigations and improved efficiencies, the committee noted that the AFP had a most productive and successful year in 2011-12, and we commend Commissioner Negus and all officers of the AFP. The committee recognises that, by focusing its resources on building partnerships at the local and international level while also improving internal processes and procedures, the AFP met or exceeded its targets for all of its 33 KPIs and, for that, they should be congratulated.


Finally, I would also like to place on record my appreciation to the members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, of which Madam Deputy Speaker, you are a member. In my experience, this committee has exemplified the best of committee traditions in that it has operated in a bipartisan way to effect parliamentary scrutiny and cooperation in developing best practices in the Australian Crime Commission as well as the Australian Federal Police. In my humble opinion, this is a committee that has acted in a way that has enhanced the operations of those organisations, and it has indeed been my honour to chair that committee now for  a number of years. I commend: the secretary, Dr Jane Thomson; the acting secretary, Ms Fiona Bowring-Greer, who has been the secretary of that committee; and administrative officer, Rosalind McMahon, for their tireless work in supporting all the activities of the committee and its inquiries. Dr Thomson, Ms Fiona Bowring-Greer and Ms McMahon depict what is excellent within our Public Service. They show great initiative and, without putting too fine a point on it, they probably make us as a committee look better than what our actual contributions might suggest. I appreciate their professionalism and their dedication—and that goes to all the other public servants operating in this parliament.


I commend the reports to the House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson

In relation to the ACC's programs and activities in 2011-12, the committee acknowledged the important work that the ACC had undertaken and highlighted initiatives such as Task Force Galilee.


The task force was established in response to concerns about serious and organised investment fraud which cost 2,600 Australians more than $114 million over the last five years. In collaboration with 40 partners including industry organisations, the ACC engaged in identifying and disrupting these fraudulent activities.


The committee commends the ACC on its work in this area and its efforts in detecting and disrupting serious and organised crime.




Examination of the AFP Annual Report 2011-12



I now turn to the examination of the Australian Federal Police Annual Report 2011-12.


Newly introduced amendments in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 empowered the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce to commence and conduct proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act legislation.


As the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce commenced as a permanent taskforce in January 2012, the committee focused its examination on the AFP's activities around the proceeds of crime.


The first litigation to restrain assets was carried out under Operation Beaufighter. This joint investigation and operation dismantled a multimillion dollar tax evasion and money-laundering scheme. The Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce restrained more than $54 million in assets, including luxury cars and real estate. Operation Beaufighter comprised the largest tax fraud investigation since Project Wickenby was launched in 2006.


In relation to operations, investigations and improved efficiencies, the committee noted that the AFP had a most productive and successful year in 2011-12, and we commend Commissioner Negus and all officers of the AFP. The committee recognises that, by focusing its resources on building partnerships at the local and international level while also improving internal processes and procedures, the AFP met or exceeded its targets for all of its 33 KPIs and, for that, they should be congratulated.


Finally, I would also like to place on record my appreciation to the members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, of which Madam Deputy Speaker, you are a member. In my experience, this committee has exemplified the best of committee traditions in that it has operated in a bipartisan way to effect parliamentary scrutiny and cooperation in developing best practices in the Australian Crime Commission as well as the Australian Federal Police. In my humble opinion, this is a committee that has acted in a way that has enhanced the operations of those organisations, and it has indeed been my honour to chair that committee now for  a number of years. I commend: the secretary, Dr Jane Thomson; the acting secretary, Ms Fiona Bowring-Greer, who has been the secretary of that committee; and administrative officer, Rosalind McMahon, for their tireless work in supporting all the activities of the committee and its inquiries. Dr Thomson, Ms Fiona Bowring-Greer and Ms McMahon depict what is excellent within our Public Service. They show great initiative and, without putting too fine a point on it, they probably make us as a committee look better than what our actual contributions might suggest. I appreciate their professionalism and their dedication—and that goes to all the other public servants operating in this parliament.


I commend the reports to the House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson
):  Thank you, Member for Fowler. I certainly congratulate you on the conduct of the committee and endorse your support for our secretariat staff and our public servants, who are highly valued.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (11:05):  I rise to speak in continuation on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Service Providers and Other Governance Measures) Bill 2012. The last time that I was in the chamber addressing this bill I was able to refer to the previous time I spoke on this matter and that was at the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services report of the inquiry into the bill which we held in November 2012. Essentially, this bill deals with the fourth tranche of legislation implementing the MySuper and governance measures of the government's Stronger Super reforms and it is in this tranche that the government will further implement the recommendations of the very important Cooper review. Not only are we are going to make amendments to those first three tranches of legislation to enable them to operate more effectively; also in this piece of legislation we will respond to the recommendations that were made by the PJC and I am very pleased that the government saw the merit in the further consultations that we had.


Indeed, the whole of this process has been marked by a wonderful coalition of conversations about how to do the very, very best with these MySuper reforms. That was acknowledged by the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, who actually stated—and we were able to put this into our report—that they acknowledged the preparedness of the government and the Treasury to consult with the industry about all of the Stronger Super changes and in particular the matters that are contained within this bill and previous iterations of it. Obviously the consultation was reflected in changes between the consultation draft and the bill. This is reflected overwhelmingly in the positive comments that we and others have made about the legislation in our submissions. That consultation did continue after our report was handed down.


This bill is a set of amendments that represent a significant reform to Australia's superannuation system that is replacing existing default superannuation products with a simple, low-cost default superannuation. Thankfully, it is not called that anymore. It is simply called MySuper. What could be of more interest to Australians who are commencing or ending their working lives than what is going on with MySuper? That is why it is so appropriately named.


From 1 July this year superannuation funds will be able to offer MySuper, a product that is intended to improve the simplicity, the transparency and the comparability default superannuation products. From 1 October, employers must make contributions for employees who have not made a choice of fund to a fund that offers a MySuper product. They will need to do that in order to satisfy superannuation guarantee requirements.


To be more particular, this bill, and the amendments that are contained within it, respond to recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services in relation to a number of matters, firstly in relation to infringement notices and the use of service providers. The amendments will also allow a single cap to be applied to percentage based administration fees for MySuper products and clarify the application of the MySuper administration fee rules. The amendments to this bill will also, very importantly, make changes to the product dashboard requirements and delay the commencement of portfolio holdings disclosure requirements. The amendments will also clarify that no member who holds a MySuper product can actually be precluded from holding a choice product and vice versa. Finally, the other significant amendments will be consequential ones to reflect the change in the title of Fair Work Australia to the Fair Work Commission.


With regard to infringement notices, during the inquiry we heard that this is a method used by APRA in other situations. We heard that the sector saw that sometimes with the proposed infringement notice there would be inadequate information, so essentially this amendment fulfils the PJC recommendation that if APRA does issue an infringement notice, the notice should be giving some adequate detail about the alleged contravention, not only because that makes clearer what the transaction between the regulator and the person receiving the notice is but also because it is an opportunity for ongoing education about this new suite of legislation and making sure that the affected person absolutely understands the nature of the problem in their current practices that have brought on this infringement notice. With regard to infringement notices and the penalty amounts, the amendment before the House today also fulfils the PJC recommendation that for infringement notices that relate to civil penalty provisions the penalty amount under a notice should be one-fortieth of the maximum penalty a court could impose.


Further, the PJC recommended that the bill's provisions relating to the use of service providers be tightened up. The original bill avoided any provisions in a fund's governing rules that required a trustee to use a specified service provider, a specified investment entity or a specified financial product. The amendments limit this. It is very important so that a governing rule is only void to the extent that it is contrary to the prohibition of bill. The outcome of this—although the language around it is sometimes a little unclear—is essentially an improvement for members and trustees by an increase in the certainty with which they can look at these products. 


Administration fee caps is another area in which the PJC made a number of recommendations and we have made an amendment which will allow trustees to have a single fixed cap on percentage based administration fees. That will reduce the risk that members pay administration fees which outweigh the cost of administering their accounts. This was a key concern and it is at the heart of why this piece of legislation and the suite of reforms around it are so important. We believe in a fairer Australia, we believe in a stronger and smarter Australia. This legislation is part of ensuring fairness for people who have their money in super, that they are not being ripped off by people who are just taking fees out, lining their own pockets and taking it away from those people who have worked hard and deserve to have the fullness of that money in their account that they call appropriately MySuper—not somebody else's super, not my financial adviser's super, but MySuper as a worker. 


Critically, the product dashboard is another of the important tools that this government is establishing through this legislation and associated legislation so that people can basically do a comparison—what if I put my money in product A and product B? What would it look like? How is product A going? How is product B going? This is to take away some of the complexity and make it more transparent to be able to engage ordinary Aussies in improving their financial literacy and, through that, improving their understanding of their investment in their own future with their super. So the amendments here make information on the dashboard even simpler to understand and make it easier to compare performances across MySuper products. They also contain regulation-making power so that further amendments can be added to the dashboard in the future because the sector is working very hard to get this up and running. If they need to make small adjustments to ensure that it works even better as time proceeds, this amendment will allow that.


There is also a portfolio holding disclosure, deferring the date at which trustees will be required to make information regarding their portfolio holdings available, responding to industry feedback about implementation time frames, stretching that out from 31 December 2013 to 30 June 2014. With the MySuper and super choice products, the government has become aware of a fund that intended to structure the governing rules and prevent members from holding a MySuper and a choice product. This amendment will prohibit that.


Adopting these amendments will certainly increase the transparency and fairness for both members and trustees. The amendments will provide members with more meaningful information about MySuper products' performance portfolio holdings, with more information for affected persons in the event that APRA does issue them an infringement notice, with greater clarity about the penalties involved and with caps on percentage-based administration fees to prevent members from paying fees that are higher than the cost of administering their funds. They will prevent trustees from undermining the intent of MySuper and ensure that members can hold MySuper and choice products if they wish to do so.


These are reforms that are coming from a Labor government, because we are the party of superannuation. The coalition never have—and never will—supported superannuation in the way that a Labor government has done and will into the future. Thanks to far-sighted Labor reforms that were denied, decried and voted down by the other side as much as they possibly could workers have $1.5 trillion of retirement savings. The coalition have opposed every single increase in universal superannuation.


Further evidence of this is the fact that the Gillard government today introduced legislation which increases the concessional caps to $35,000 for Australians aged 60 and over from 1 July 2013 and extends this to Australians over 50 from 1 July 2014. To help those nearing retirement to build the adequacy of their retirement savings, the government is introducing a $35,000 cap for older Australians. This means Australians nearing retirement can contribute up to $10,000 more to their super at the concessional tax rate.


This Gillard government—this Labor government—believes that it is important to allow people who have not had the benefit of the superannuation guarantee for the whole of their working lives to contribute more to their super as they near retirement. Accordingly, the government will bring forward the start date for the new higher cap to 1 July 2013 for people aged 60 and over. Individuals aged 50 and over are going to be able to access that higher cap from 1 July 2014.


This is estimated to impact, in a very positive way, 171,000 people. Sadly, there is sometimes a gap in the work that we do here in the parliament. Sometimes it becomes about words, ideas and media stories, but the reality is this legislation is a powerful piece of work to impact positively the lives of 171,000 people when the new, higher cap is introduced for individuals aged over 60, and 363,000 Australians will benefit in 2014 when the eligibility is extended to individuals aged 50 and over.


In conclusion, this bill will complete the legislative architecture of the MySuper reforms. It will improve integrity and governance. It will increase efficiency and effectiveness of superannuation for all Australians, not just some. We are doing this because we as a Labor government believe in the establishment of structures that lead to a fairer Australia. Dignity in retirement at the end of a great working life is a right we believe is there for all Australians. This legislation does its work in leading to a fairer and stronger Australia. It is smart legislation, and it is secured to that fair future for Australians. I commend the bill to the House.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (11:18):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Service Providers and Other Governance Measures) Bill 2012. This is the fourth tranche of legislation implementing the MySuper proposals, which followed the Cooper review into Australia's superannuation system. In the brief time I have available today I want to make three points about this legislation.


The first is that to require four separate tranches of legislation really raises a question about the efficiency of this process. It has indeed been a chaotic process. The second point is that, while many of the measures themselves are not ones that are contested on this side of the House, there are some drafting issues which are worth raising. The third point is that this bill follows consultation processes in relation to earlier tranches of the legislation and in relation to the recommendations of the Cooper review. One area the Cooper review addressed—the need for reform of governance of superannuation funds—has been a glaring, continuing and serious omission in the four pieces of legislation that the minister has brought forward, and it is an omission that I wish to comment on today.


I turn firstly to the point that the legislation before us today, which, as we have heard, is the fourth tranche of the complex, meandering and often chaotic implementation process adopted by this government, raises serious questions of efficiency and process. Let me quote what one witness from the Law Council of Australia said when appearing before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services when it was considering an earlier tranche of this legislation. She had this to say about the committee that she serves on, which seeks to provide the input of the legal profession on complex legislative changes:


I will spend one minute on process. We, the committee, spend a lot of time trying to prepare careful responses to legislation and often the time period—and I know it is not just for us; it is for everybody—is just too short. It is not possible to prepare a well-reasoned and thought-through submission in a week. For the trustee obligations bill the submission timetable was shorter than the period within which the committee was meant to release its report. I suppose people have a lack of confidence in the system given this timing.


That is typical of the response of stakeholders to the inefficient and often chaotic process by which successive tranches of legislation in this area have been brought forward and the way that specific aspects of the provisions have been dealt with. Typically, we see last-minute amendments. And we frequently see in legislation regarding superannuation from this minister ill-judged measures introduced in one act that are subsequently reversed in later acts. In the case of the bill before the House today, we are seeing an example of such a reversal. The merits of the reversal we do not question—indeed, we welcome it—but we do highlight the fact that this is revealing of a very poor process. It would have been much better if the minister had not made the original policy error. I refer, of course, to the issue of caps on the fees being charged to members of superannuation funds.


In an earlier tranche of the MySuper legislation, there were absurd provisions included that would have forced superannuation funds to charge the same percentage administration fee on any account, regardless of how high the balance in that account was and even though the economic reality, as is widely acknowledged in the industry, is that costs are generally fixed rather than rising with the account balance. The standard response from fund managers to this problem, so as to avoid overcharging those with larger balances, is to set a cap on the fee that they charge as a percentage of the account balance. Extraordinarily, provisions in an earlier act as part of the MySuper legislation would have prevented funds from doing that; it would have mandated funds charging the same percentage amount regardless of the account balance. This would have meant that somebody with a balance of $500,000 would have paid an administration fee 100 times greater than somebody with a balance of $5,000. The coalition pointed out how absurd these provisions were and we circulated amendments that, I am pleased to note, the government has now effectively adopted. So the trustees will now have greater flexibility in the charging of their fees so that they may remain commensurate with actual costs. So, while we welcome the fact that this particular change suggested by the opposition has been accepted, it is a good example of just how chaotic and disorderly large parts of this MySuper process have been.


I also make the point that the multiple tranches of legislation dealing with MySuper are being introduced over the same period in which the superannuation sector is dealing with the SuperStream measures, which make it easier to move account balances between funds and in themselves are certainly sensible, and the Future of Financial Advice legislation, which imposes onerous new reporting requirements. The burden of these successive multiple changes in many aspects of the business which superannuation funds carry out in redesigning products, in retraining staff and in major changes to IT systems is very onerous. Last year, for example, AMP, one of the major players in the sector, informed the market that it expected the one-off cost of implementing the Future of Financial Advice, Stronger Super and other regulatory changes over the next 12 to 18 months to be in the range of $60 million to $75 million after tax—and no doubt its major competitors are exposed to similar expenses.


Let me turn, secondly, to the question of some specific measures in this bill, and I want to focus particularly on the provision which purports to respond to recommendation 2.14 of the Cooper review. The recommendation was:


The SIS Act—


the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act—


should be amended so as to override any provision in the governing rules of an APRA‐regulated fund that requires the trustee to use a specified service provider in relation to any services in respect of the fund.


The question I want to raise relates to the drafting of proposed section 58A, which gives effect to this recommendation because, as drafted, it would void any provision which says that a fund 'may or must' acquire services from a certain person. It is clear that a rule which says a fund must acquire services from a certain person is a rule that needs to be voided if the recommendation of the Cooper review is to be given effect to. But the question I want to raise is: why does the drafting extend to a rule which says a fund may acquire such services?


I want to turn, thirdly, to one area which is a glaring but, I am sorry to say, not unsurprising omission in the bill the minister has brought forward—that is, the complete silence regarding the reforms recommended in the Cooper review into the governance of superannuation funds. Today, under the so-called equal representation model, an industry fund or a public sector fund typically has up to half of its directors appointed by one or more unions. The equal representation arrangements were specifically designed into the industry superannuation fund system when it was set up by the Hawke-Keating Labor government. This had the effect of entrenching its friends in the union movement at the centre of the governance system of industry and public sector funds. This is a matter that was dealt with by the Cooper review, which had some very clear findings and recommendations. The Cooper review concluded that the equal representation system 'no longer seems to achieve its original stated objective'. The Cooper review noted that directors of superannuation funds are:


… not, in fact, elected by employers or members, but rather are nominated by third party organisations, such as employer associations and trade unions—


and in practice these organisations 'do not necessarily represent' the interests of all employers or employees. The system, according to the Cooper review, leaves significant groups 'unrepresented', including most obviously those who are retired and receiving benefit payments from the fund. And the Cooper review concluded that the equal representation model should no longer be mandated, and where it does apply at least one-third of representatives of both members and employers should be non-associated. This was recommendation 2.7.


Unfortunately, Minister Shorten has failed to act on these recommendations from the Cooper review. Of course the minister is a former secretary of the Australian Workers Union and a former director of the largest industry superannuation fund, AustralianSuper. He has enthusiastically used superannuation policy to bolster and benefit the union movement. Industry superannuation funds held assets of $250 billion in mid-2011, and by now they would hold more. In the 2009-10 financial year they received more than 31 per cent of the $78 billion contributed in that year to the superannuation sector, excluding self-managed funds.


This system serves the interests of the union movement very nicely. It means a large number of well-paid directorships to be allocated amongst union mates. I recently looked at the arrangements across 64 public sector and industry funds, with a total of more than $300 billion under management. I counted over 150 directors appointed by the unions, with a significant number of funds where the union appoints at least half the directors. These arrangements will give the unions a degree of control of superannuation that goes much further than the shrinking share of the workforce who are union members.


It is no coincidence that there is a close connection between a number of present and aspirant Labor parliamentarians and the industry super funds. I could note, for example, that in addition to the minister at the table, Minister Shorten, other Labor or aspirant Labor parliamentarians who are former directors of AustralianSuper include Labor senator Doug Cameron, the Labor member for Charlton and the Labor candidate for the seat of Melbourne in the 2010 election, Ms Cath Bowtell, who I understand has been preselected to contest that seat again.


It is perhaps not surprising that the unions hate the idea of not getting their automatic seats on the boards of industry superannuation funds. It is, therefore, accordingly also not surprising that this minister has chosen to ignore that particular recommendation from the Cooper review. The issue should not be what is in the interests of unions; the issue should be what is in the interests of Australians who are saving for their retirement through the superannuation system.


The coalition is determined to see modern governance standards brought to superannuation funds, not the current, cosy arrangements which the unions are so fond of. The coalition will, therefore, move amendments to require that superannuation boards contain one-third in number of independent directors. This, of course, would give effect to the recommendation in the Cooper review; the recommendation which the minister appears not to have noticed as he was flicking through that particular report.


It is time to bring a greater degree of independence to the boards of superannuation funds. Higher standards of corporate governance will help to deliver a more efficient and competitive superannuation system and the best possible value to superannuation fund members. Continuing to improve corporate governance in the superannuation industry will help to increase the level of confidence in the system and the willingness of Australians to make additional voluntary superannuation contributions.


The purpose of the superannuation system is to provide for the retirement savings of Australians, to assist them to provide for themselves in retirement by drawing on the balances they have accumulated in their superannuation accounts. The purpose of the system is not to provide cosy directorships for a range of union officials, and the coalition is determined to look after the interests of Australians who are saving for their retirement.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-05-15,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:33):  Since coming into government in 2007—and aren't many Australians ruing that day?—Labor has done nothing but constantly tinker with the superannuation scheme, despite the member for Griffith and the then opposition leader, Kevin Rudd, saying prior to the 2007 election that Labor would not change the system.


This Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Service Providers and Other Governance Measures) Bill 2012 is the fourth tranche of legislation implementing the MySuper proposals which followed the super system review, also known as the Cooper review, and the government's response to that review, Stronger Super. The measures contained in the bill are broadly supported across the superannuation industry, and the coalition does not oppose them. However, once again, this Labor government has been forced to bring in a raft of changes to its own legislation after it has been introduced—and haven't we seen that time and again in this parliament and the one before it?


The changes put forward by the government follow an inquiry by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which found a number of issues with this bill. It is good to see that the government has recognised its mistakes, at least in this legislation, and has adopted measures put forward by the coalition such as the cap on fees. We will not oppose these changes, and we will withdraw our amendments in relation to the fee caps. However, we still will need to move amendments to require superannuation boards to contain at least one-third independent directors or trustees. This was a recommendation of the Cooper review and will improve the governance on superannuation boards. This is most important: people need to know that their superannuation—their hard-earned savings; that nest egg that they and their businesses and, in some cases, the government have put away for their retirement needs—will be there when they need it most and not have been raided by a selfish debt-ridden government.


MySuper is a new, supposedly low-cost superannuation product which replaces existing default superannuation fund products. The bill changes governance arrangements and obligations in a number of areas. It will override superannuation fund's governing rules which mandate the use of specific service providers. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, will gain the power to issue infringement notices in certain circumstances, and super trustees will be required to give reasons for decisions in relation to complaints.


Additionally, the bill removes a regulatory exemption where a registrable superannuation entity also manages a non-super-managed investment scheme. Persons who have suffered damage due to a contravention of director's duties will be required to seek leave from the court before bringing action, and it provides a defence for trustees for a breach of a MySuper obligation. It will also make certain consequential amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993—the SI(S) act.


Recommendation 2.14 of the Cooper review was that the SI(S) Act be amended so as to override any provision in the governing rules of an APRA-regulated fund which requires the trustee to use a specified service provider in relation to any services in respect of the fund. The amendments in this bill will bring this recommendation into effect. The reasoning from the Cooper review was that a mandate in governing rules requiring the use of certain service providers must limit trustee ability to determine if such an arrangement were in the best interests of fund members. The review also noted that trustees should be able to appoint a named service provider if it is in the best interests of members but should not be bound to do so.


The Financial Services Council raised questions on the drafting of these amendments in their submission, stating: 


While we support the policy intent of the proposal, we are concerned that the scope of the changes under section 58A appear to be much wider than that, as any provision which specifies a person from whom the trustee “may or must” acquire a service or an entity or financial product in which the trustee “may or must” invest, will be void. Thus, the new provision seems to apply regardless of whether the clause is permissive or mandatory. We understand the intent to be that the prohibition should apply only where the requirement is mandated.


The Industry Super Network and the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees both put in their submissions the view that existing contracts which are not in the best interests of members should be terminated. 


Currently APRA has the power to issue infringement notices but only for the late lodgement of data returns. This legislation will amend the SI(S) Act to provide APRA with the power to issue infringement notices for certain breaches of the act as well. The Cooper review recommended that APRA be given the power to issue infringement notices and fines as an alternative to criminal prosecution for certain offences. The new power will apply to a range of existing breaches, including: not putting required contributions into a MySuper account, not notifying each beneficiary about an acting trustee's appointment as soon as is practicable, not having rules in place for the appointment of member or independent representatives where required to do so, not meeting APRA's deadline for the receipt of a report relating to an investigation, and funds accepting contributions by an employer sponsor contrary to the regulator's written notice to the fund's trustee. The purpose of these changes is to attempt to deter non-compliant behaviour without needing to move to criminal proceedings. 


The requirement for super trustees to give reasons for decisions in relation to complaints came from recommendation 5.7 of the Cooper review. The complainant will be required to make a request in writing, which must be provided within 28 days to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and may permit longer periods for reasons to be given in the case of death benefits complaints. Some registrable superannuation entity licensees, in addition to managing RSEs, are also the responsible entities of one or more non-superannuation registered managed investment schemes. Generally, the responsible entity controlling a managed investment scheme must comply with a range of general obligations in section 912A of the Corporations Act 2001. 


Currently, bodies regulated by APRA, including RSE licensees, are exempt from the requirements set out under sections 912A(1)(d) and (h) of the act. RSE licensees are required to satisfy risk management requirements and requirements for adequate resources—human, technological and financial—imposed under the SI(S) Act and SI(S) Regulations. However, these requirements are not designed to ensure that adequate resources or risk management systems are maintained in respect of the non-superannuation business of RSE licensees which also manage registered managed investment schemes. 


We have seen in the Riverina managed investment schemes and the threat that they can place on agriculture and other industries. That is something that really needs to be looked at into the future, because MISs are quite a threat to many people who want to conduct good businesses in opposition to these particular things, including in forestry and other sectors.


The Cooper review recommended dual regulated entities meet the Corporations Act financial resource requirements, and this amendment removes the regulatory exemption currently in place. Whilst there is general support for this change, some stakeholders expressed a desire to ensure this does not increase capital backing requirements through the duplication of responsibilities. 


Where a director is accused of having breached their duties under the SI(S) Act the amendments will require the complainant to seek leave from the court to bring such an action. In order to grant leave, the court must take into account whether the applicant is acting in good faith and there is a serious question to be heard. These amendments are designed to prevent frivolous and vexatious legal action being brought against directors. Directors will also be able to use a defence of having acted with 'reasonable precautions' or if a 'reasonable mistake' was made in relation to MySuper obligations. These defences are already available if directors act in contravention of a covenant.


In the amendments proposed by the Labor government, the final composition of the products dashboard is to be set by regulations. This acknowledges the government could not get consensus on what information would be given to consumers as a quick way of comparing funds. One of the measures removed by the amendments is a measure of liquidity. Industry super funds were opposed to this type of measure being included. If this does not appear in the regulations, the government will have some serious questions to answer, as the product selection cannot be about promoting the interests of one part of the industry in isolation.


The government has also adopted the coalition's stance to have a cap on percentage based administration fees. The first MySuper bill established core provisions for MySuper, including rules around the charging of fees in relation to member accounts. This included, in effect, a ban on caps for administration fees. The explanatory memorandum of the tranche 1 bill said:


For any fee that applies to all members of the MySuper product, such as an administration fee or an investment fee, each member is to be charged the fee under the same charging rule. For example, if one member is charged a percentage of their account balance in relation to the MySuper product as an administration fee, then each member of the MySuper product should be charged the same percentage of their account balance in relation to the MySuper product at the same point in time …


Understandably, this caused an adverse reaction amongst industry stakeholders and they, along with the coalition, were anticipating the government's current and final MySuper bill would include amendments to remove this unnecessary and counterproductive requirement. This amendment was not forthcoming until the last minute. This government has finally realised that anything which prevents the lowering of fees is not in the best interests of superannuants. The coalition members of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services made a number of recommendations in the report on the bill. 


The Cooper review also recommended an end to the equal representation model on superannuation boards. The government has failed to act on this. We believe superannuation boards should contain one-third in number of independent directors or trustees. Only the most efficient and competitive superannuation system with higher standards of corporate governance will deliver the best possible value to superannuation fund members. This is so important, given the fact that we have an ageing population and more people are going to be calling upon their super in the years ahead. Continuing to improve corporate governance in the superannuation industry will help to increase Australians' level of confidence in the system and willingness to make additional voluntary superannuation contributions. The time has come to bring a greater degree of independence to the boards of the union-dominated industry super funds.


As I have mentioned before, the bill before the House represents the government's fourth tranche of legislation implementing the MySuper proposals, which followed the Cooper review into superannuation handed down some 2½ years ago. The coalition has along the way sought to improve the government's legislation as it, quite frankly, was all over the place in implementing the findings of the review. The coalition has moved a number of amendments seeking to close anomalies and amending legislation to avoid unintended consequences because this government has rushed through these changes, as it did with e-health and so many of the other things that this government has introduced into this House in this 43rd Parliament. More recently, we scored a significant policy win by ensuring that Australians' choices were preserved and that their superannuation balances were not automatically transferred, without their prior approval, to a government-legislated MySuper account. On the issue of superannuation, the coalition has a good way forward for Australia. We have begun consulting with a broad cross-section of senior superannuation industry stakeholders and experts, and certainly in the Riverina I am constantly in consultation with financial planners and superannuation experts in Wagga Wagga, Griffith and other parts of my electorate.


The coalition is acutely aware of the threat that this government—because it is broke and has a $270 billion-plus debt—is planning to pose to the nation's retirement savings in the form of more new taxes on superannuation savings in order to help it plug its deteriorating budget. This Labor government has hit Australian savings with more than $8 billion in increased taxes and charges on superannuation over the past five years. Of this, $3.3 billion has come from the government's hit on low-income earners through its various reductions to the government super co-contributions established under the previous coalition government. The government reduced the contribution from $1,500 to just $500. The government is also lowering the thresholds at which the contributions are phased out.


A coalition government will look to provide certainty and stability in superannuation by not making unexpected, detrimental changes to the superannuation system—hopefully after 14 September. This will allow people to save for their retirement and to plan with confidence—and that is a word that this government does not seem to understand. There is a crisis in confidence in this country at the moment, but an incoming coalition government—and that may happen after 14 September—will provide certainty and confidence within business, within families and certainly within communities and among people who are planning on retiring. A coalition government plans to increase the compulsory superannuation contribution from nine to 12 per cent; improve corporate governance arrangements for superannuation; properly address the issue of excess contributions to make sure Australians saving for their retirement are not unfairly penalised for genuine, unintended mistakes; pursue opportunities to cut unnecessary red tape in superannuation; remove regulatory barriers currently restricting product innovation and improved options to manage financial risks in their retirement phase; and revisit concessional contribution caps and super co-contributions for lower income earners once the budget is strong enough to be back in surplus—a word that I think is not fully understood on that side of the House. Finally, a coalition government will conduct a financial systems inquiry which will include the superannuation industry. A coalition government will continue to consult with a broad cross-section of stakeholders in the superannuation industry in the lead-up to this year's election.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (11:48):  I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate—although I have to say the member for Riverina has not convinced me, with his anti-union bias, to support their amendments. I do think that occasionally the evidence and facts should come in, rather than letting prejudice, bias and anti-union bigotry overcome them. We need to have a debate about fact. Anyway, on the points on which the member for Riverina agreed with our bill, I obviously agree with him.




Mr McCormack:
  Good on you, Bill!




Mr SHORTEN:
  It is the least I could do! The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Service Providers and Other Governance Measures) Bill 2012 is the fourth and final tranche of legislation implementing the government's MySuper and governance reforms. These reforms originated from the groundbreaking work of the government-initiated Super System Review, led by Jeremy Cooper. I am pleased to confirm that Mr Cooper, whose report was so much quoted by those opposite, has in fact agreed to chair the government's superannuation charter group, which will assist in developing the government's proposed superannuation charter.


In support of the government's MySuper reforms, the Super System Review considered the governance, efficiency, structure and operation of Australia's superannuation system. It examined measures to remove unnecessary costs and better safeguard the retirement savings of all Australians. Among the review's findings were that fees and superannuation were too high and that choice of fund in superannuation had failed to deliver a competitive market that reduced costs for members. MySuper was at the heart of the review's recommendations and is designed to focus superannuation funds on the core purpose for which they exist: optimising retirement income for members.


This Labor government has already implemented three whole tranches in this area, and this bill finishes the job—brings home the bacon, as they say. It contains the remaining MySuper governance and transparency reform announced as part of the Stronger Super package in December 2010. From 1 July 2013 funds that have received the APRA authorisation will be able to offer MySuper products, and from 1 January 2014 employers will only be able to make default contributions to a fund that offers a compliant MySuper product. The industry recognises that the improvements in the transparency and consistency of disclosure will result in greater comparability, and it expects that this will result in lower fees. Indeed, we are already seeing MySuper putting downward pressure on superannuation fees and charges, which translates into more money in retirement for Australians. 


From 1 July 2013, the requirements for trustees of superannuation funds will rise and trustees will have new duties, including giving priority to beneficiaries over other persons. Also from 1 July, the reforms contained in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Act 2012 will ensure that the directors of super funds are appropriately accountable for meeting certain duties to members, including acting honestly, managing conflicts of interest and acting in the best interests of the members. These are good reforms on governance and I note for the record that those opposite—who want to talk about governance—choked when they had the chance to vote in favour of better governance and voted against it.


My thanks go to Jeremy Cooper and the members of the Super System Review Panel: Kevin Casey, Greg Evans, Sandy Grant, David Gruen, Meg Heffron, Ian Martin and Brian Wilson. The review was ably assisted by the secretariat, with staff drawn from Treasury, including Roger Brake and the superannuation unit; Roger Brown and Wilson Sy, who were seconded from APRA; Hilda Miller, Philip Russell and Sophie Trumble, who were seconded from ASIC; and Pedro Cafe, who was seconded from the ATO—sadly, he has passed away since the completion of the report. The secretariat also included representatives from the private sector: Scott Donald from the University of New South Wales; Peggy Haines from Freehills; Paul Murphy from UniSuper; and Brad Tallents on secondment from KPMG. I would also like to publicly acknowledge the work of the Stronger Super peak consultative group that provided advice on the design and implementation of these reforms. 


Thanks must also go to the superannuation industry, particularly the four superannuation associations—the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, the Financial Services Council and the Industry Super Network—for their invaluable contributions. I would like to publicly acknowledge the work of the regulators, both the APRA team led by Katrina Ellis and the ASIC team led by Alex Purvis. Finally, I would like to thank the team at Treasury including, but not limited to, Jonathan Rollings, Adam Hawkins, Alan Mallory and Melissa Bray for their work in developing these significant reforms.


This bill was introduced into the parliament in November 2012. It was then referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which reported on 5 February 2013. The committee made eight substantive recommendations, six of which will be implemented through amendments to this bill or otherwise. The government will also be making additional amendments to the bill following further industry consultation. Those opposite are sufficiently arrogant that they think that, when you amend a bill following consultation, it is a sign of weakness. To me that is a sign of flexibility, of pragmatism and of having listened. That is what we have been doing.


The bill includes the Cooper recommendation which will override any provision in a fund's governing rules that stipulates that a trustee may or must use specified service providers or only invest in or through specified entities. The bill also renders ineffective any provisions in a fund's governing rules that prohibit a director or an individual trustee from voting on a matter relevant to the fund. Limited exceptions will be allowed, such as when a conflict of interest or duty exists. This will ensure that a superannuation fund's governing rules operate in the best interests of its members.


This bill addresses a regulatory gap identified by the Cooper review by removing exemptions from certain Corporations Act resourcing requirements for entities that are regulated by both APRA under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993—the SI(S) Act—and by ASIC under the Corporations Act 2001. Under the bill, these entities will need to meet Corporations Act resources and risk management requirements in respect of their non-superannuation activities.


The bill increases the time limits for members and beneficiaries to lodge complaints with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal so these will be more closely aligned with the time limits of the courts and the Financial Ombudsman Service. Members will be able to obtain information from trustees in relation to the decisions that affect them, which will improve transparency and promote accountability among superannuation funds.


This bill responds to the views of the superannuation industry and concerns about director liabilities that were raised in relation to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Act 2012. Firstly, the bill inserts a requirement for persons seeking to take legal action against a director for the breach of their duties to initially seek leave from the court. Secondly, the bill extends the availability of the defence of directors and trustees that their breach was due to a reasonable mistake. This defence will now cover breaches of MySuper duties. A third change is being made, following consultation on exposure of this bill, to the defences in relation to investment and management of reserves; the changes will clarify the defences available where a trustee or director can establish compliance with the covenants and MySuper obligations that are relevant to the particular loss or damage suffered. These changes have been developed in consultation with industry and are designed to better balance the rights of super fund members and the protection of directors and trustees against frivolous or vexatious litigation.


The government will move two sheets of further amendments to this bill. These amendments respond to the parliamentary joint committee's recommendations and to further consultation with, and listening to, industry. These Stronger Super reforms deliver on our election commitment to provide a better deal for the many Australians who choose not to take an active role in the management of their superannuation but who instead rely on superannuation funds to act in their best interests. These reforms will also improve the governance, transparency and integrity of Australia's superannuation system.


More importantly, the MySuper reforms are a great example of the triumphant power of good ideas and the importance of looking forwards, not backwards. MySuper, this bill and the other bills show that ideas remain powerful in Australian politics—especially when they are backed by belief, listening and strength. The idea that Australians, irrespective of their level of engagement with their superannuation fund, deserve a better deal from their super fund is a powerful idea. The record will reflect that these ideas will become law. It has taken a lot of argument, persuasion and debate to get MySuper on the statute books but it will happen. As a result of this bill and the ones preceding it all Australians will retire with more superannuation, they will end up paying less fees and they will have a better standard of living in retirement to enjoy those 20, 30 and 40 years of retirement. This is an argument worth having in this parliament.


Labor is the party of superannuation. Every time the coalition have had an opportunity to vote to increase superannuation they have said no. Every time they have had a chance to promote mandatory universal superannuation, as the record reflects, they have voted against it. They voted against a rise from three per cent to nine per cent. Former Prime Minister Howard broke his promise to take superannuation to 15 per cent in 1996 and yet again, as recently as last year, when we proposed increasing superannuation from nine to 12 per cent, the coalition returned to their DNA and voted against it. But, nonetheless, the good ideas have triumphed over the bad ideas.


We believe fundamentally that, because of these reforms, we have a unique national institution of compulsory savings which puts us among the best in the world. The opposition have always reflexively voted against increasing compulsory superannuation. Only Labor has the conviction and the foresight to increase universal superannuation to 12 per cent. We are once again looking ahead—not to the next poll, but to the next generation—and planning for the future. We are advancing an idea to empower the ownership of superannuation policy by the people through a charter of superannuation overseen by a 100 per cent apolitical council of superannuation custodians.


The coalition have said, yet again, that they will not proceed with this very good idea. But we shall not relent on this argument either and eventually we will succeed. They would rather see superannuation stuck without a consistent regime, that does not prioritise the needs of adequacy, fairness, sustainability, longevity, certainty and prospectivity in our policies. We want to have a regime which looks over the 20-, 30- and 40-year horizon ahead. In a debate on superannuation and this bill, all of this amounts to one party looking forwards and one party looking backwards. Superannuants deserve better. Australians deserve better. I commend this bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

Application of amendment inserting section


58B



   The amendment made by item 72 of this Schedule, to the extent that it relates to proposed section 58B, applies in relation to things done on or after 1 July 2013.


This bill, which is the fourth and final tranche of legislation implementing the government's MySuper and governance reforms, was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on 29 November last year. On 5 February this year the PJC reported and made nine recommendations, eight substantive recommendations and a recommendation that the bill be passed after due consideration of the PJC's report.


The government has accepted six of the eight recommendations and this bill will implement four of them. A fifth will be implemented by upcoming regulations and a sixth does not require regulation. The changes recommended by the PJC will provide trustees with more information, in the event that APRA issues them with an infringement notice, and greater clarity about the penalties involved. The service provider provision will be amended so that a fund's governing rules would void only to the extent they compel a trustee to use a particular service provider.


In addition to these changes the government is introducing a number of other amendments, some of which have been suggested by industry, which will enhance the MySuper reforms and improve flexibility. The amendments will allow trustees to have a single fixed cap on percentage based administration fees. The cap will reduce the risk that some members could be charged significant amounts in administration fees which are likely to exceed the costs of administering the member's funds. Amendments will also prevent trustees from undermining the intent of MySuper by ensuring that members can hold both MySuper and choice products if they wish to do so.


Finally, the bill will make consequential amendments reflecting the change in title of Fair Work Australia to the Fair Work Commission. In addition, the amendments will improve the quality and relevance of information in the 'product dashboard' about a MySuper product's performance by providing for the details to be set out in regulations and by providing trustees with more time to prepare for the reporting of their portfolio holdings.


The government will also introduce further amendments in response to targeted industry consultation. These amendments will clarify that the legislation is not intended to prohibit the use of related parties, provided the trustee complies with the trustee covenants and other related legislation. These further amendments will also address concerns relating to the direction of contributions provisions by carving out certain existing products such as risk in capital guarantee products from the direction of contributions requirements in sections 29WA and 29WB, including regulation-making powers so that a direction given to the trustee of another fund can be relied upon by the trustee of a successor fund and amending the existing direction arrangements so that only directions given after 31 March 2013 are required to be in writing.


The government has chosen not to implement two recommendations of the PJC. The first is recommendation 1, in which the PJC suggested imposing time limits on a member's ability to request reasons for decisions from trustees in relation to a complaint made by that member. The PJC indicated that record-keeping and a trustee's ability to respond to a request for reasons would decline as time passed.


The government does not support this recommendation because it would mean that members could complain about decisions but could not have access to the reasons for those decisions. This is not consistent with the notion of procedural justice and fairness. In addition, as industry noted at the PJC hearings, there are already a range of record-keeping requirements in the superannuation sector and the bill, as introduced, does not impose an undue burden on trustees. Trustees are currently obliged to keep records and files for compliance with general trust law obligations, possible legal action and information-gathering powers of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. In that context, a requirement to provide members with reasons for decisions is appropriate and not burdensome.


The government also does not support recommendation 7 of the PJC. The PJC has suggested removing schedule 1, item 71, from the bill on the grounds that both it and item 70 make the same amendment to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 using slightly different numbering, so there might be a drafting error. However, this item is a contingent amendment and is required because another bill before the parliament, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012 seeks to amend the same section. Depending on which bill receives royal assent first, either item 70 or item 71 will amend the SI(S) Act. I commend the amendments to the House.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (12:05):  As I have already stated, the coalition will allow the government's amendments to pass through this parliament. However, as I said in my speech on the second reading on this bill, the government has once again been forced to bring in a raft of changes to its own legislation after it has been introduced. As I mentioned, the government's amendments follow the outcomes of the inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into this bill, which found many serious issues that the government had not dealt properly with. I recognise and welcome that industry input and coalition scrutiny have enhanced this bill. It is good to see that the government does occasionally recognise its mistakes and adopts the measures and good ideas put forward by the coalition, such as the cap on fees.


As I have stated in relation to the product dashboard, the coalition puts this government on notice that they have to be balanced in their approach when designing the regulations and not to favour their mates who are in industry superannuation funds. The coalition reserves the right to pursue amendments to the legislation to fix this issue, should the government not get the balance right.


Question agreed to.

The Cooper review recommended an end to the equal representation model on superannuation boards under which union and employer representatives dominate industry superannuation funds. For the record let me recap recommendation 2.7. It said:


For those boards that have equal representation because their company constitutions or other binding arrangements so require, the SIS Act should be amended so that no less than one‐third of the total number of member representative trustee‐directors must be non‐associated and no less than one‐third of employer representative trustee‐directors must be non‐associated.


This government has failed to act on this recommendation from its own, much-heralded Cooper review into superannuation.


On behalf of the coalition I am moving amendments which will enact the following principles: (1) that existing equal representation requirements in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and regulations be repealed; (2) that these be replaced by requirements which give effect to the principle that each affected trustee board or group of trustees at a minimum will contain one-third in number independent directors or trustees; (3) for the purpose of independents it will take the meaning of section 10 in the SI(S) Act; (4) the independence rule would only be applied to public offer funds. The coalition views this amendment to be serious in nature and, should our amendment not be successful here today, we will continue to push for this should we be offered the opportunity to form government for this great commonwealth, Australia, at the next election.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (12:09):  I always listen very carefully to the member for Dunkley because he puts his arguments in at least a pleasant fashion. Unfortunately, he has failed to persuade the government on this occasion, though not for want of trying.


The opposition has proposed an amendment to the bill which would require a minimum of one-third directors on public offer funds. The government considers the current arrangements requiring equal representation remain appropriate in ensuring members are able to participate in the management and protection of their retirement savings. One of the reasons we support this is that I do not believe there would be another sector of the Australian economy which is worth $450 billion where the ideologues of the far Right would say, 'Let us change the way they are working.' What is the case for change? The case was never made out other than that it was a recommendation in a particular review, but we never unpack it beyond that. Since that review was written we have given APRA the powers to look through the governance of individual funds, and they are able to do that. APRA have advised me that they are well satisfied with the powers they now enjoy courtesy of this government—which, incidentally, were voted against by those opposite.


So we have the regulator saying that the current system is working well. We have a sector of industry $450 billion large; but, because there is employee content, because sometimes there are union reps on it, the ideologues hear the dog whistle, start frothing and say, 'We must intervene in this sector of the economy because we don't like the fact that the workers sometimes have a voice in their superannuation.' This argument does not reflect well. Why tinker with a system that is not broken? There has never been any evidence that industry funds deserve any more bias, prejudice, bile and bigotry from the anti-union baiters opposite than any other set of funds.


If that does not convince you, let me now also advise you of the latest APRA data from June 2012: the annual statistics bulletin. We hear that dreadful word that must send the opposition bean counters into a state of panic: statistics. The super funds managed—and this is what the statistical record shows as opposed to the ideological polemic, bias and bigotry of some of those opposite; the rancid, turgid ongoing contributions we hear bagging unions; turgid and rancid, although admittedly pleasantly put by the member for Dunkley—



Mr Billson interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  I exempt the member for Dunkley from the references of 'turgid' and 'rancid'. But, having done that, no more leave passes for some of the others who have spoken. These statistics show—and I can see the opposition putting their hands over their ears like children before bedtime not wanting to hear the news—that super funds managed under the equal representation trustee system have on average outperformed the retail fund sector over the medium to long term. How can this be so if the governance structure which the opposition legislative helicopters want to invade and overturn, trashing in pursuit of their far-right ideology—if this structure is so bad and APRA says they have enough powers to look through the governance of funds—is outperforming the retail sector? This cannot be right. Black must be white! Rain must be sun! We do not know, but don't let a fact or statistic get in the way of the right-wing extremists!


The government has already made legislative changes which will apply from 1 July 2013. We have raised the obligations of directors to manage superannuation fund assets prudently in the best interests of members. We have made sure that directors have to give priority to beneficiaries. We have required the disclosure of directors' remuneration. From 1 July, APRA prudential standards will require funds to maintain registers of relevant duties and interests. Regulations will require mandatory disclosure of conflicts of interest. To get a lecture from those opposite saying, 'The Cooper review said recommendation X.Y; we must follow this and, if we don't follow this, it makes what we're doing wrong'—if they are such advocates of the Cooper review, why did they fight harder than anything we have seen since their attack on the carbon price? The Cooper report recommended that the opt-in requirement apply to the provision. The Cooper review recommended intrafund advice be provided. The opposition opposes Cooper review recommendations when it does not suit their ideology, but otherwise they would run amuck with $450 billion of workers' money. (Time expired)

 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (12:28):  Leave is not granted, and the reason is this. When the Leader of the House and I and the crossbenchers negotiated the reinventing the parliament agreement at the beginning of this parliament—



Mr Adams interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Lyons is also out of his seat. I am adamant at the moment: nobody should be interjecting on this unless they want to go and sit in their own seat—and then they would still be in trouble! The Manager of Opposition Business has the call.




Mr PYNE:
  Thank you for your protection, Madam Speaker. The reinventing the parliament agreement was not a legally binding document and has been departed from by the government and the crossbenchers on numerous occasions. So I will not have any hypocrisy from the crossbenchers or the government about the reinventing the parliament agreement. The only matters out of the reinventing the parliament agreement that were binding on this chamber were those that were transmuted to the standing orders. The Leader of the House has on several occasions relied on that to not abide by the reinventing the parliament agreement in this place. He might now rue the fact that on several occasions over the last three years he has said, if it is not in the standing orders, it does not stand for anything.


The truth is that the government, the opposition and the crossbenchers agreed that, if a member of parliament missed a division for an inadvertent but good reason, we would consider resubmitting a bill or an amendment to the chamber. Four Labor members of parliament, including one whip, failed to take their pagers, which tell us what is going on in the chamber, to the Great Hall, which is a matter of a few hundred metres away. That is not the kind of reason that was regarded as significant enough, even in the reinvented parliament agreement. We discussed at that time that this courtesy could be extended if a member was suddenly ill, was locked in a room and could not escape for whatever reason—as occurred on one occasion in this place some years ago—was in hospital or had an immediate family crisis which required their attention and they could not possibly come. It was not for situations where four members of parliament do not take their beepers to the Great Hall or pay attention to what was going on in the chamber.


For that reason, the coalition will not give leave for this motion. But, if the Leader of the House wants to withdraw his motion and negotiate with the opposition over the course of the rest of the day about this matter, we will listen to the arguments and do so in good faith.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (11:05):  I rise to speak in continuation on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Service Providers and Other Governance Measures) Bill 2012. The last time that I was in the chamber addressing this bill I was able to refer to the previous time I spoke on this matter and that was at the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services report of the inquiry into the bill which we held in November 2012. Essentially, this bill deals with the fourth tranche of legislation implementing the MySuper and governance measures of the government's Stronger Super reforms and it is in this tranche that the government will further implement the recommendations of the very important Cooper review. Not only are we are going to make amendments to those first three tranches of legislation to enable them to operate more effectively; also in this piece of legislation we will respond to the recommendations that were made by the PJC and I am very pleased that the government saw the merit in the further consultations that we had.


Indeed, the whole of this process has been marked by a wonderful coalition of conversations about how to do the very, very best with these MySuper reforms. That was acknowledged by the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, who actually stated—and we were able to put this into our report—that they acknowledged the preparedness of the government and the Treasury to consult with the industry about all of the Stronger Super changes and in particular the matters that are contained within this bill and previous iterations of it. Obviously the consultation was reflected in changes between the consultation draft and the bill. This is reflected overwhelmingly in the positive comments that we and others have made about the legislation in our submissions. That consultation did continue after our report was handed down.


This bill is a set of amendments that represent a significant reform to Australia's superannuation system that is replacing existing default superannuation products with a simple, low-cost default superannuation. Thankfully, it is not called that anymore. It is simply called MySuper. What could be of more interest to Australians who are commencing or ending their working lives than what is going on with MySuper? That is why it is so appropriately named.


From 1 July this year superannuation funds will be able to offer MySuper, a product that is intended to improve the simplicity, the transparency and the comparability default superannuation products. From 1 October, employers must make contributions for employees who have not made a choice of fund to a fund that offers a MySuper product. They will need to do that in order to satisfy superannuation guarantee requirements.


To be more particular, this bill, and the amendments that are contained within it, respond to recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services in relation to a number of matters, firstly in relation to infringement notices and the use of service providers. The amendments will also allow a single cap to be applied to percentage based administration fees for MySuper products and clarify the application of the MySuper administration fee rules. The amendments to this bill will also, very importantly, make changes to the product dashboard requirements and delay the commencement of portfolio holdings disclosure requirements. The amendments will also clarify that no member who holds a MySuper product can actually be precluded from holding a choice product and vice versa. Finally, the other significant amendments will be consequential ones to reflect the change in the title of Fair Work Australia to the Fair Work Commission.


With regard to infringement notices, during the inquiry we heard that this is a method used by APRA in other situations. We heard that the sector saw that sometimes with the proposed infringement notice there would be inadequate information, so essentially this amendment fulfils the PJC recommendation that if APRA does issue an infringement notice, the notice should be giving some adequate detail about the alleged contravention, not only because that makes clearer what the transaction between the regulator and the person receiving the notice is but also because it is an opportunity for ongoing education about this new suite of legislation and making sure that the affected person absolutely understands the nature of the problem in their current practices that have brought on this infringement notice. With regard to infringement notices and the penalty amounts, the amendment before the House today also fulfils the PJC recommendation that for infringement notices that relate to civil penalty provisions the penalty amount under a notice should be one-fortieth of the maximum penalty a court could impose.


Further, the PJC recommended that the bill's provisions relating to the use of service providers be tightened up. The original bill avoided any provisions in a fund's governing rules that required a trustee to use a specified service provider, a specified investment entity or a specified financial product. The amendments limit this. It is very important so that a governing rule is only void to the extent that it is contrary to the prohibition of bill. The outcome of this—although the language around it is sometimes a little unclear—is essentially an improvement for members and trustees by an increase in the certainty with which they can look at these products. 


Administration fee caps is another area in which the PJC made a number of recommendations and we have made an amendment which will allow trustees to have a single fixed cap on percentage based administration fees. That will reduce the risk that members pay administration fees which outweigh the cost of administering their accounts. This was a key concern and it is at the heart of why this piece of legislation and the suite of reforms around it are so important. We believe in a fairer Australia, we believe in a stronger and smarter Australia. This legislation is part of ensuring fairness for people who have their money in super, that they are not being ripped off by people who are just taking fees out, lining their own pockets and taking it away from those people who have worked hard and deserve to have the fullness of that money in their account that they call appropriately MySuper—not somebody else's super, not my financial adviser's super, but MySuper as a worker. 


Critically, the product dashboard is another of the important tools that this government is establishing through this legislation and associated legislation so that people can basically do a comparison—what if I put my money in product A and product B? What would it look like? How is product A going? How is product B going? This is to take away some of the complexity and make it more transparent to be able to engage ordinary Aussies in improving their financial literacy and, through that, improving their understanding of their investment in their own future with their super. So the amendments here make information on the dashboard even simpler to understand and make it easier to compare performances across MySuper products. They also contain regulation-making power so that further amendments can be added to the dashboard in the future because the sector is working very hard to get this up and running. If they need to make small adjustments to ensure that it works even better as time proceeds, this amendment will allow that.


There is also a portfolio holding disclosure, deferring the date at which trustees will be required to make information regarding their portfolio holdings available, responding to industry feedback about implementation time frames, stretching that out from 31 December 2013 to 30 June 2014. With the MySuper and super choice products, the government has become aware of a fund that intended to structure the governing rules and prevent members from holding a MySuper and a choice product. This amendment will prohibit that.


Adopting these amendments will certainly increase the transparency and fairness for both members and trustees. The amendments will provide members with more meaningful information about MySuper products' performance portfolio holdings, with more information for affected persons in the event that APRA does issue them an infringement notice, with greater clarity about the penalties involved and with caps on percentage-based administration fees to prevent members from paying fees that are higher than the cost of administering their funds. They will prevent trustees from undermining the intent of MySuper and ensure that members can hold MySuper and choice products if they wish to do so.


These are reforms that are coming from a Labor government, because we are the party of superannuation. The coalition never have—and never will—supported superannuation in the way that a Labor government has done and will into the future. Thanks to far-sighted Labor reforms that were denied, decried and voted down by the other side as much as they possibly could workers have $1.5 trillion of retirement savings. The coalition have opposed every single increase in universal superannuation.


Further evidence of this is the fact that the Gillard government today introduced legislation which increases the concessional caps to $35,000 for Australians aged 60 and over from 1 July 2013 and extends this to Australians over 50 from 1 July 2014. To help those nearing retirement to build the adequacy of their retirement savings, the government is introducing a $35,000 cap for older Australians. This means Australians nearing retirement can contribute up to $10,000 more to their super at the concessional tax rate.


This Gillard government—this Labor government—believes that it is important to allow people who have not had the benefit of the superannuation guarantee for the whole of their working lives to contribute more to their super as they near retirement. Accordingly, the government will bring forward the start date for the new higher cap to 1 July 2013 for people aged 60 and over. Individuals aged 50 and over are going to be able to access that higher cap from 1 July 2014.


This is estimated to impact, in a very positive way, 171,000 people. Sadly, there is sometimes a gap in the work that we do here in the parliament. Sometimes it becomes about words, ideas and media stories, but the reality is this legislation is a powerful piece of work to impact positively the lives of 171,000 people when the new, higher cap is introduced for individuals aged over 60, and 363,000 Australians will benefit in 2014 when the eligibility is extended to individuals aged 50 and over.


In conclusion, this bill will complete the legislative architecture of the MySuper reforms. It will improve integrity and governance. It will increase efficiency and effectiveness of superannuation for all Australians, not just some. We are doing this because we as a Labor government believe in the establishment of structures that lead to a fairer Australia. Dignity in retirement at the end of a great working life is a right we believe is there for all Australians. This legislation does its work in leading to a fairer and stronger Australia. It is smart legislation, and it is secured to that fair future for Australians. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (11:18):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Service Providers and Other Governance Measures) Bill 2012. This is the fourth tranche of legislation implementing the MySuper proposals, which followed the Cooper review into Australia's superannuation system. In the brief time I have available today I want to make three points about this legislation.


The first is that to require four separate tranches of legislation really raises a question about the efficiency of this process. It has indeed been a chaotic process. The second point is that, while many of the measures themselves are not ones that are contested on this side of the House, there are some drafting issues which are worth raising. The third point is that this bill follows consultation processes in relation to earlier tranches of the legislation and in relation to the recommendations of the Cooper review. One area the Cooper review addressed—the need for reform of governance of superannuation funds—has been a glaring, continuing and serious omission in the four pieces of legislation that the minister has brought forward, and it is an omission that I wish to comment on today.


I turn firstly to the point that the legislation before us today, which, as we have heard, is the fourth tranche of the complex, meandering and often chaotic implementation process adopted by this government, raises serious questions of efficiency and process. Let me quote what one witness from the Law Council of Australia said when appearing before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services when it was considering an earlier tranche of this legislation. She had this to say about the committee that she serves on, which seeks to provide the input of the legal profession on complex legislative changes:


I will spend one minute on process. We, the committee, spend a lot of time trying to prepare careful responses to legislation and often the time period—and I know it is not just for us; it is for everybody—is just too short. It is not possible to prepare a well-reasoned and thought-through submission in a week. For the trustee obligations bill the submission timetable was shorter than the period within which the committee was meant to release its report. I suppose people have a lack of confidence in the system given this timing.


That is typical of the response of stakeholders to the inefficient and often chaotic process by which successive tranches of legislation in this area have been brought forward and the way that specific aspects of the provisions have been dealt with. Typically, we see last-minute amendments. And we frequently see in legislation regarding superannuation from this minister ill-judged measures introduced in one act that are subsequently reversed in later acts. In the case of the bill before the House today, we are seeing an example of such a reversal. The merits of the reversal we do not question—indeed, we welcome it—but we do highlight the fact that this is revealing of a very poor process. It would have been much better if the minister had not made the original policy error. I refer, of course, to the issue of caps on the fees being charged to members of superannuation funds.


In an earlier tranche of the MySuper legislation, there were absurd provisions included that would have forced superannuation funds to charge the same percentage administration fee on any account, regardless of how high the balance in that account was and even though the economic reality, as is widely acknowledged in the industry, is that costs are generally fixed rather than rising with the account balance. The standard response from fund managers to this problem, so as to avoid overcharging those with larger balances, is to set a cap on the fee that they charge as a percentage of the account balance. Extraordinarily, provisions in an earlier act as part of the MySuper legislation would have prevented funds from doing that; it would have mandated funds charging the same percentage amount regardless of the account balance. This would have meant that somebody with a balance of $500,000 would have paid an administration fee 100 times greater than somebody with a balance of $5,000. The coalition pointed out how absurd these provisions were and we circulated amendments that, I am pleased to note, the government has now effectively adopted. So the trustees will now have greater flexibility in the charging of their fees so that they may remain commensurate with actual costs. So, while we welcome the fact that this particular change suggested by the opposition has been accepted, it is a good example of just how chaotic and disorderly large parts of this MySuper process have been.


I also make the point that the multiple tranches of legislation dealing with MySuper are being introduced over the same period in which the superannuation sector is dealing with the SuperStream measures, which make it easier to move account balances between funds and in themselves are certainly sensible, and the Future of Financial Advice legislation, which imposes onerous new reporting requirements. The burden of these successive multiple changes in many aspects of the business which superannuation funds carry out in redesigning products, in retraining staff and in major changes to IT systems is very onerous. Last year, for example, AMP, one of the major players in the sector, informed the market that it expected the one-off cost of implementing the Future of Financial Advice, Stronger Super and other regulatory changes over the next 12 to 18 months to be in the range of $60 million to $75 million after tax—and no doubt its major competitors are exposed to similar expenses.


Let me turn, secondly, to the question of some specific measures in this bill, and I want to focus particularly on the provision which purports to respond to recommendation 2.14 of the Cooper review. The recommendation was:


The SIS Act—


the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act—


should be amended so as to override any provision in the governing rules of an APRA‐regulated fund that requires the trustee to use a specified service provider in relation to any services in respect of the fund.


The question I want to raise relates to the drafting of proposed section 58A, which gives effect to this recommendation because, as drafted, it would void any provision which says that a fund 'may or must' acquire services from a certain person. It is clear that a rule which says a fund must acquire services from a certain person is a rule that needs to be voided if the recommendation of the Cooper review is to be given effect to. But the question I want to raise is: why does the drafting extend to a rule which says a fund may acquire such services?


I want to turn, thirdly, to one area which is a glaring but, I am sorry to say, not unsurprising omission in the bill the minister has brought forward—that is, the complete silence regarding the reforms recommended in the Cooper review into the governance of superannuation funds. Today, under the so-called equal representation model, an industry fund or a public sector fund typically has up to half of its directors appointed by one or more unions. The equal representation arrangements were specifically designed into the industry superannuation fund system when it was set up by the Hawke-Keating Labor government. This had the effect of entrenching its friends in the union movement at the centre of the governance system of industry and public sector funds. This is a matter that was dealt with by the Cooper review, which had some very clear findings and recommendations. The Cooper review concluded that the equal representation system 'no longer seems to achieve its original stated objective'. The Cooper review noted that directors of superannuation funds are:


… not, in fact, elected by employers or members, but rather are nominated by third party organisations, such as employer associations and trade unions—


and in practice these organisations 'do not necessarily represent' the interests of all employers or employees. The system, according to the Cooper review, leaves significant groups 'unrepresented', including most obviously those who are retired and receiving benefit payments from the fund. And the Cooper review concluded that the equal representation model should no longer be mandated, and where it does apply at least one-third of representatives of both members and employers should be non-associated. This was recommendation 2.7.


Unfortunately, Minister Shorten has failed to act on these recommendations from the Cooper review. Of course the minister is a former secretary of the Australian Workers Union and a former director of the largest industry superannuation fund, AustralianSuper. He has enthusiastically used superannuation policy to bolster and benefit the union movement. Industry superannuation funds held assets of $250 billion in mid-2011, and by now they would hold more. In the 2009-10 financial year they received more than 31 per cent of the $78 billion contributed in that year to the superannuation sector, excluding self-managed funds.


This system serves the interests of the union movement very nicely. It means a large number of well-paid directorships to be allocated amongst union mates. I recently looked at the arrangements across 64 public sector and industry funds, with a total of more than $300 billion under management. I counted over 150 directors appointed by the unions, with a significant number of funds where the union appoints at least half the directors. These arrangements will give the unions a degree of control of superannuation that goes much further than the shrinking share of the workforce who are union members.


It is no coincidence that there is a close connection between a number of present and aspirant Labor parliamentarians and the industry super funds. I could note, for example, that in addition to the minister at the table, Minister Shorten, other Labor or aspirant Labor parliamentarians who are former directors of AustralianSuper include Labor senator Doug Cameron, the Labor member for Charlton and the Labor candidate for the seat of Melbourne in the 2010 election, Ms Cath Bowtell, who I understand has been preselected to contest that seat again.


It is perhaps not surprising that the unions hate the idea of not getting their automatic seats on the boards of industry superannuation funds. It is, therefore, accordingly also not surprising that this minister has chosen to ignore that particular recommendation from the Cooper review. The issue should not be what is in the interests of unions; the issue should be what is in the interests of Australians who are saving for their retirement through the superannuation system.


The coalition is determined to see modern governance standards brought to superannuation funds, not the current, cosy arrangements which the unions are so fond of. The coalition will, therefore, move amendments to require that superannuation boards contain one-third in number of independent directors. This, of course, would give effect to the recommendation in the Cooper review; the recommendation which the minister appears not to have noticed as he was flicking through that particular report.


It is time to bring a greater degree of independence to the boards of superannuation funds. Higher standards of corporate governance will help to deliver a more efficient and competitive superannuation system and the best possible value to superannuation fund members. Continuing to improve corporate governance in the superannuation industry will help to increase the level of confidence in the system and the willingness of Australians to make additional voluntary superannuation contributions.


The purpose of the superannuation system is to provide for the retirement savings of Australians, to assist them to provide for themselves in retirement by drawing on the balances they have accumulated in their superannuation accounts. The purpose of the system is not to provide cosy directorships for a range of union officials, and the coalition is determined to look after the interests of Australians who are saving for their retirement.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-05-15,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:33):  Since coming into government in 2007—and aren't many Australians ruing that day?—Labor has done nothing but constantly tinker with the superannuation scheme, despite the member for Griffith and the then opposition leader, Kevin Rudd, saying prior to the 2007 election that Labor would not change the system.


This Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Service Providers and Other Governance Measures) Bill 2012 is the fourth tranche of legislation implementing the MySuper proposals which followed the super system review, also known as the Cooper review, and the government's response to that review, Stronger Super. The measures contained in the bill are broadly supported across the superannuation industry, and the coalition does not oppose them. However, once again, this Labor government has been forced to bring in a raft of changes to its own legislation after it has been introduced—and haven't we seen that time and again in this parliament and the one before it?


The changes put forward by the government follow an inquiry by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which found a number of issues with this bill. It is good to see that the government has recognised its mistakes, at least in this legislation, and has adopted measures put forward by the coalition such as the cap on fees. We will not oppose these changes, and we will withdraw our amendments in relation to the fee caps. However, we still will need to move amendments to require superannuation boards to contain at least one-third independent directors or trustees. This was a recommendation of the Cooper review and will improve the governance on superannuation boards. This is most important: people need to know that their superannuation—their hard-earned savings; that nest egg that they and their businesses and, in some cases, the government have put away for their retirement needs—will be there when they need it most and not have been raided by a selfish debt-ridden government.


MySuper is a new, supposedly low-cost superannuation product which replaces existing default superannuation fund products. The bill changes governance arrangements and obligations in a number of areas. It will override superannuation fund's governing rules which mandate the use of specific service providers. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, will gain the power to issue infringement notices in certain circumstances, and super trustees will be required to give reasons for decisions in relation to complaints.


Additionally, the bill removes a regulatory exemption where a registrable superannuation entity also manages a non-super-managed investment scheme. Persons who have suffered damage due to a contravention of director's duties will be required to seek leave from the court before bringing action, and it provides a defence for trustees for a breach of a MySuper obligation. It will also make certain consequential amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993—the SI(S) act.


Recommendation 2.14 of the Cooper review was that the SI(S) Act be amended so as to override any provision in the governing rules of an APRA-regulated fund which requires the trustee to use a specified service provider in relation to any services in respect of the fund. The amendments in this bill will bring this recommendation into effect. The reasoning from the Cooper review was that a mandate in governing rules requiring the use of certain service providers must limit trustee ability to determine if such an arrangement were in the best interests of fund members. The review also noted that trustees should be able to appoint a named service provider if it is in the best interests of members but should not be bound to do so.


The Financial Services Council raised questions on the drafting of these amendments in their submission, stating: 


While we support the policy intent of the proposal, we are concerned that the scope of the changes under section 58A appear to be much wider than that, as any provision which specifies a person from whom the trustee “may or must” acquire a service or an entity or financial product in which the trustee “may or must” invest, will be void. Thus, the new provision seems to apply regardless of whether the clause is permissive or mandatory. We understand the intent to be that the prohibition should apply only where the requirement is mandated.


The Industry Super Network and the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees both put in their submissions the view that existing contracts which are not in the best interests of members should be terminated. 


Currently APRA has the power to issue infringement notices but only for the late lodgement of data returns. This legislation will amend the SI(S) Act to provide APRA with the power to issue infringement notices for certain breaches of the act as well. The Cooper review recommended that APRA be given the power to issue infringement notices and fines as an alternative to criminal prosecution for certain offences. The new power will apply to a range of existing breaches, including: not putting required contributions into a MySuper account, not notifying each beneficiary about an acting trustee's appointment as soon as is practicable, not having rules in place for the appointment of member or independent representatives where required to do so, not meeting APRA's deadline for the receipt of a report relating to an investigation, and funds accepting contributions by an employer sponsor contrary to the regulator's written notice to the fund's trustee. The purpose of these changes is to attempt to deter non-compliant behaviour without needing to move to criminal proceedings. 


The requirement for super trustees to give reasons for decisions in relation to complaints came from recommendation 5.7 of the Cooper review. The complainant will be required to make a request in writing, which must be provided within 28 days to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and may permit longer periods for reasons to be given in the case of death benefits complaints. Some registrable superannuation entity licensees, in addition to managing RSEs, are also the responsible entities of one or more non-superannuation registered managed investment schemes. Generally, the responsible entity controlling a managed investment scheme must comply with a range of general obligations in section 912A of the Corporations Act 2001. 


Currently, bodies regulated by APRA, including RSE licensees, are exempt from the requirements set out under sections 912A(1)(d) and (h) of the act. RSE licensees are required to satisfy risk management requirements and requirements for adequate resources—human, technological and financial—imposed under the SI(S) Act and SI(S) Regulations. However, these requirements are not designed to ensure that adequate resources or risk management systems are maintained in respect of the non-superannuation business of RSE licensees which also manage registered managed investment schemes. 


We have seen in the Riverina managed investment schemes and the threat that they can place on agriculture and other industries. That is something that really needs to be looked at into the future, because MISs are quite a threat to many people who want to conduct good businesses in opposition to these particular things, including in forestry and other sectors.


The Cooper review recommended dual regulated entities meet the Corporations Act financial resource requirements, and this amendment removes the regulatory exemption currently in place. Whilst there is general support for this change, some stakeholders expressed a desire to ensure this does not increase capital backing requirements through the duplication of responsibilities. 


Where a director is accused of having breached their duties under the SI(S) Act the amendments will require the complainant to seek leave from the court to bring such an action. In order to grant leave, the court must take into account whether the applicant is acting in good faith and there is a serious question to be heard. These amendments are designed to prevent frivolous and vexatious legal action being brought against directors. Directors will also be able to use a defence of having acted with 'reasonable precautions' or if a 'reasonable mistake' was made in relation to MySuper obligations. These defences are already available if directors act in contravention of a covenant.


In the amendments proposed by the Labor government, the final composition of the products dashboard is to be set by regulations. This acknowledges the government could not get consensus on what information would be given to consumers as a quick way of comparing funds. One of the measures removed by the amendments is a measure of liquidity. Industry super funds were opposed to this type of measure being included. If this does not appear in the regulations, the government will have some serious questions to answer, as the product selection cannot be about promoting the interests of one part of the industry in isolation.


The government has also adopted the coalition's stance to have a cap on percentage based administration fees. The first MySuper bill established core provisions for MySuper, including rules around the charging of fees in relation to member accounts. This included, in effect, a ban on caps for administration fees. The explanatory memorandum of the tranche 1 bill said:


For any fee that applies to all members of the MySuper product, such as an administration fee or an investment fee, each member is to be charged the fee under the same charging rule. For example, if one member is charged a percentage of their account balance in relation to the MySuper product as an administration fee, then each member of the MySuper product should be charged the same percentage of their account balance in relation to the MySuper product at the same point in time …


Understandably, this caused an adverse reaction amongst industry stakeholders and they, along with the coalition, were anticipating the government's current and final MySuper bill would include amendments to remove this unnecessary and counterproductive requirement. This amendment was not forthcoming until the last minute. This government has finally realised that anything which prevents the lowering of fees is not in the best interests of superannuants. The coalition members of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services made a number of recommendations in the report on the bill. 


The Cooper review also recommended an end to the equal representation model on superannuation boards. The government has failed to act on this. We believe superannuation boards should contain one-third in number of independent directors or trustees. Only the most efficient and competitive superannuation system with higher standards of corporate governance will deliver the best possible value to superannuation fund members. This is so important, given the fact that we have an ageing population and more people are going to be calling upon their super in the years ahead. Continuing to improve corporate governance in the superannuation industry will help to increase Australians' level of confidence in the system and willingness to make additional voluntary superannuation contributions. The time has come to bring a greater degree of independence to the boards of the union-dominated industry super funds.


As I have mentioned before, the bill before the House represents the government's fourth tranche of legislation implementing the MySuper proposals, which followed the Cooper review into superannuation handed down some 2½ years ago. The coalition has along the way sought to improve the government's legislation as it, quite frankly, was all over the place in implementing the findings of the review. The coalition has moved a number of amendments seeking to close anomalies and amending legislation to avoid unintended consequences because this government has rushed through these changes, as it did with e-health and so many of the other things that this government has introduced into this House in this 43rd Parliament. More recently, we scored a significant policy win by ensuring that Australians' choices were preserved and that their superannuation balances were not automatically transferred, without their prior approval, to a government-legislated MySuper account. On the issue of superannuation, the coalition has a good way forward for Australia. We have begun consulting with a broad cross-section of senior superannuation industry stakeholders and experts, and certainly in the Riverina I am constantly in consultation with financial planners and superannuation experts in Wagga Wagga, Griffith and other parts of my electorate.


The coalition is acutely aware of the threat that this government—because it is broke and has a $270 billion-plus debt—is planning to pose to the nation's retirement savings in the form of more new taxes on superannuation savings in order to help it plug its deteriorating budget. This Labor government has hit Australian savings with more than $8 billion in increased taxes and charges on superannuation over the past five years. Of this, $3.3 billion has come from the government's hit on low-income earners through its various reductions to the government super co-contributions established under the previous coalition government. The government reduced the contribution from $1,500 to just $500. The government is also lowering the thresholds at which the contributions are phased out.


A coalition government will look to provide certainty and stability in superannuation by not making unexpected, detrimental changes to the superannuation system—hopefully after 14 September. This will allow people to save for their retirement and to plan with confidence—and that is a word that this government does not seem to understand. There is a crisis in confidence in this country at the moment, but an incoming coalition government—and that may happen after 14 September—will provide certainty and confidence within business, within families and certainly within communities and among people who are planning on retiring. A coalition government plans to increase the compulsory superannuation contribution from nine to 12 per cent; improve corporate governance arrangements for superannuation; properly address the issue of excess contributions to make sure Australians saving for their retirement are not unfairly penalised for genuine, unintended mistakes; pursue opportunities to cut unnecessary red tape in superannuation; remove regulatory barriers currently restricting product innovation and improved options to manage financial risks in their retirement phase; and revisit concessional contribution caps and super co-contributions for lower income earners once the budget is strong enough to be back in surplus—a word that I think is not fully understood on that side of the House. Finally, a coalition government will conduct a financial systems inquiry which will include the superannuation industry. A coalition government will continue to consult with a broad cross-section of stakeholders in the superannuation industry in the lead-up to this year's election.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (11:48):  I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate—although I have to say the member for Riverina has not convinced me, with his anti-union bias, to support their amendments. I do think that occasionally the evidence and facts should come in, rather than letting prejudice, bias and anti-union bigotry overcome them. We need to have a debate about fact. Anyway, on the points on which the member for Riverina agreed with our bill, I obviously agree with him.




Mr McCormack:
  Good on you, Bill!




Mr SHORTEN:
  It is the least I could do! The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Service Providers and Other Governance Measures) Bill 2012 is the fourth and final tranche of legislation implementing the government's MySuper and governance reforms. These reforms originated from the groundbreaking work of the government-initiated Super System Review, led by Jeremy Cooper. I am pleased to confirm that Mr Cooper, whose report was so much quoted by those opposite, has in fact agreed to chair the government's superannuation charter group, which will assist in developing the government's proposed superannuation charter.


In support of the government's MySuper reforms, the Super System Review considered the governance, efficiency, structure and operation of Australia's superannuation system. It examined measures to remove unnecessary costs and better safeguard the retirement savings of all Australians. Among the review's findings were that fees and superannuation were too high and that choice of fund in superannuation had failed to deliver a competitive market that reduced costs for members. MySuper was at the heart of the review's recommendations and is designed to focus superannuation funds on the core purpose for which they exist: optimising retirement income for members.


This Labor government has already implemented three whole tranches in this area, and this bill finishes the job—brings home the bacon, as they say. It contains the remaining MySuper governance and transparency reform announced as part of the Stronger Super package in December 2010. From 1 July 2013 funds that have received the APRA authorisation will be able to offer MySuper products, and from 1 January 2014 employers will only be able to make default contributions to a fund that offers a compliant MySuper product. The industry recognises that the improvements in the transparency and consistency of disclosure will result in greater comparability, and it expects that this will result in lower fees. Indeed, we are already seeing MySuper putting downward pressure on superannuation fees and charges, which translates into more money in retirement for Australians. 


From 1 July 2013, the requirements for trustees of superannuation funds will rise and trustees will have new duties, including giving priority to beneficiaries over other persons. Also from 1 July, the reforms contained in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Act 2012 will ensure that the directors of super funds are appropriately accountable for meeting certain duties to members, including acting honestly, managing conflicts of interest and acting in the best interests of the members. These are good reforms on governance and I note for the record that those opposite—who want to talk about governance—choked when they had the chance to vote in favour of better governance and voted against it.


My thanks go to Jeremy Cooper and the members of the Super System Review Panel: Kevin Casey, Greg Evans, Sandy Grant, David Gruen, Meg Heffron, Ian Martin and Brian Wilson. The review was ably assisted by the secretariat, with staff drawn from Treasury, including Roger Brake and the superannuation unit; Roger Brown and Wilson Sy, who were seconded from APRA; Hilda Miller, Philip Russell and Sophie Trumble, who were seconded from ASIC; and Pedro Cafe, who was seconded from the ATO—sadly, he has passed away since the completion of the report. The secretariat also included representatives from the private sector: Scott Donald from the University of New South Wales; Peggy Haines from Freehills; Paul Murphy from UniSuper; and Brad Tallents on secondment from KPMG. I would also like to publicly acknowledge the work of the Stronger Super peak consultative group that provided advice on the design and implementation of these reforms. 


Thanks must also go to the superannuation industry, particularly the four superannuation associations—the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, the Financial Services Council and the Industry Super Network—for their invaluable contributions. I would like to publicly acknowledge the work of the regulators, both the APRA team led by Katrina Ellis and the ASIC team led by Alex Purvis. Finally, I would like to thank the team at Treasury including, but not limited to, Jonathan Rollings, Adam Hawkins, Alan Mallory and Melissa Bray for their work in developing these significant reforms.


This bill was introduced into the parliament in November 2012. It was then referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which reported on 5 February 2013. The committee made eight substantive recommendations, six of which will be implemented through amendments to this bill or otherwise. The government will also be making additional amendments to the bill following further industry consultation. Those opposite are sufficiently arrogant that they think that, when you amend a bill following consultation, it is a sign of weakness. To me that is a sign of flexibility, of pragmatism and of having listened. That is what we have been doing.


The bill includes the Cooper recommendation which will override any provision in a fund's governing rules that stipulates that a trustee may or must use specified service providers or only invest in or through specified entities. The bill also renders ineffective any provisions in a fund's governing rules that prohibit a director or an individual trustee from voting on a matter relevant to the fund. Limited exceptions will be allowed, such as when a conflict of interest or duty exists. This will ensure that a superannuation fund's governing rules operate in the best interests of its members.


This bill addresses a regulatory gap identified by the Cooper review by removing exemptions from certain Corporations Act resourcing requirements for entities that are regulated by both APRA under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993—the SI(S) Act—and by ASIC under the Corporations Act 2001. Under the bill, these entities will need to meet Corporations Act resources and risk management requirements in respect of their non-superannuation activities.


The bill increases the time limits for members and beneficiaries to lodge complaints with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal so these will be more closely aligned with the time limits of the courts and the Financial Ombudsman Service. Members will be able to obtain information from trustees in relation to the decisions that affect them, which will improve transparency and promote accountability among superannuation funds.


This bill responds to the views of the superannuation industry and concerns about director liabilities that were raised in relation to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Act 2012. Firstly, the bill inserts a requirement for persons seeking to take legal action against a director for the breach of their duties to initially seek leave from the court. Secondly, the bill extends the availability of the defence of directors and trustees that their breach was due to a reasonable mistake. This defence will now cover breaches of MySuper duties. A third change is being made, following consultation on exposure of this bill, to the defences in relation to investment and management of reserves; the changes will clarify the defences available where a trustee or director can establish compliance with the covenants and MySuper obligations that are relevant to the particular loss or damage suffered. These changes have been developed in consultation with industry and are designed to better balance the rights of super fund members and the protection of directors and trustees against frivolous or vexatious litigation.


The government will move two sheets of further amendments to this bill. These amendments respond to the parliamentary joint committee's recommendations and to further consultation with, and listening to, industry. These Stronger Super reforms deliver on our election commitment to provide a better deal for the many Australians who choose not to take an active role in the management of their superannuation but who instead rely on superannuation funds to act in their best interests. These reforms will also improve the governance, transparency and integrity of Australia's superannuation system.


More importantly, the MySuper reforms are a great example of the triumphant power of good ideas and the importance of looking forwards, not backwards. MySuper, this bill and the other bills show that ideas remain powerful in Australian politics—especially when they are backed by belief, listening and strength. The idea that Australians, irrespective of their level of engagement with their superannuation fund, deserve a better deal from their super fund is a powerful idea. The record will reflect that these ideas will become law. It has taken a lot of argument, persuasion and debate to get MySuper on the statute books but it will happen. As a result of this bill and the ones preceding it all Australians will retire with more superannuation, they will end up paying less fees and they will have a better standard of living in retirement to enjoy those 20, 30 and 40 years of retirement. This is an argument worth having in this parliament.


Labor is the party of superannuation. Every time the coalition have had an opportunity to vote to increase superannuation they have said no. Every time they have had a chance to promote mandatory universal superannuation, as the record reflects, they have voted against it. They voted against a rise from three per cent to nine per cent. Former Prime Minister Howard broke his promise to take superannuation to 15 per cent in 1996 and yet again, as recently as last year, when we proposed increasing superannuation from nine to 12 per cent, the coalition returned to their DNA and voted against it. But, nonetheless, the good ideas have triumphed over the bad ideas.


We believe fundamentally that, because of these reforms, we have a unique national institution of compulsory savings which puts us among the best in the world. The opposition have always reflexively voted against increasing compulsory superannuation. Only Labor has the conviction and the foresight to increase universal superannuation to 12 per cent. We are once again looking ahead—not to the next poll, but to the next generation—and planning for the future. We are advancing an idea to empower the ownership of superannuation policy by the people through a charter of superannuation overseen by a 100 per cent apolitical council of superannuation custodians.


The coalition have said, yet again, that they will not proceed with this very good idea. But we shall not relent on this argument either and eventually we will succeed. They would rather see superannuation stuck without a consistent regime, that does not prioritise the needs of adequacy, fairness, sustainability, longevity, certainty and prospectivity in our policies. We want to have a regime which looks over the 20-, 30- and 40-year horizon ahead. In a debate on superannuation and this bill, all of this amounts to one party looking forwards and one party looking backwards. Superannuants deserve better. Australians deserve better. I commend this bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (13:50):  Last week, former Australian tennis player Brad Drewett, lost his fight to the cruellest of opponents, motor neurone disease. Brad had twice been Australian Junior Champion, represented Australia in the Davis Cup and at 17 won his way through to the quarter finals of the Australian Open to play his idol, Ken Rosewall. Brad lost the match but won a lifelong friend. Last Friday Ken was at Brad's funeral, along with his childhood coach, Keith Walker; the Chairman of the All England Club at Wimbledon; his schoolhood friend, Phil Gardner; and a thousand other friends.


As president and executive chairman of the ATP, Brad earned the respect of all players. On learning of his passing, the world of tennis stopped in silence. In Barcelona, Rafael Nadal stood alongside Roger Federer, Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova and all other competing players to pay their respects to their friend and their champion.


Brad was great company. He was passionate: he loved wine and music with his friends. Most of all, he loved Jo and their beautiful children: Jack, Alice, Joseph and Thomas. Brad was a champion player, but a greater champion to players. He was a champion friend and, most of all, a champion husband and father. Whilst we, his friends, might selfishly miss him, this does not bear comparison to the loss suffered by Jo and their children.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:11):  I confess that I genuinely wanted last night's budget to be a good budget. After five budgets of overblown rhetoric and broken promises from this Labor government, I believed that Australia's finances were in a mess. I wanted the Treasurer's sixth budget to set us straight. I expected he would come clean about the state of play. I expected that he would identify the reasons why the budget was in a mess and would admit that he had basically got the numbers very wrong—very wrong last year and the year before and the year before and the year before. I expected he would lay down a believable pathway to surplus, that he, as Treasurer, would restore the sustainability of the nation's finances. But I was disappointed, and I think many Australians were disappointed. I do not have any confidence that the numbers and the promises in the Treasurer's sixth budget are any more believable than they were in his previous five budgets.


Last week, the Leader of the Opposition and I laid out benchmarks for what we believe would make a good budget. The first requirement was honesty. But straight-up in his budget speech last night, the Treasurer began the spin and excuses. Faced with his broken promise to deliver a surplus this year, he talked about the high Australian dollar 'weighing more heavily than expected on tax receipts'. As I said before, the one assumption the Treasurer got right in last year's budget papers was the Australian dollar. In last year's budget the four-year assumption that underpinned the numbers was an Australian dollar of US103c, and it has remained around there. In the previous budget it was a four-year assumption of 107c. In MYEFO, released last October, when he was still predicting a surplus, the Treasurer said:


The exchange rate is assumed to remain around its recent average level … a [US] dollar exchange rate of around 102 US cents.


The Australian dollar has subsequently been little different to the forecast—today it is actually weaker, under parity with the US dollar—so the Treasurer cannot use the Australian dollar as an excuse for his budget chaos. His own budget papers also show there is no shortfall in revenue. Next year revenue will be $80 billion higher than the last year of the coalition government—no shortage there—but spending will be $120 billion higher than the last year of the coalition. But in real terms, the fact is that in last year's budget revenue rose six per cent; this year it is projected to rise seven per cent; next year it is projected to rise 6½ per cent and so on. With any business that is having a six to seven per cent increase in revenue and is still under water, surely the directors would be sacked? But the government keeps overestimating revenue.


Last year I described revenue forecasts as a 'magic carpet ride' in my address to the Press Club: an estimated $39 billion increase in revenue that would turn a $44 billion deficit into a $1.5 billion surplus. Of course, the government were wrong. Now they are basing forward estimates for revenue from the carbon tax and the mining tax on equally ridiculous assumptions. Net receipts from the MRRT are forecast to be just $200 million this year. That is less than 10 per cent of the $3 billion forecast in last year's budget. But, despite this massive shortfall and widespread views that the commodity price boom is fading, MRRT revenue is forecast to rise strongly over the forward estimates to $2.2 billion in 2017. So the government wants us to believe that revenue will be less than 10 per cent of the forecast this year but then will rise by a factor of 10 over the next four years.


The forecasts for the carbon price also stretch credibility. The carbon price scheme links to the European system from 1 July 2015. Overnight, forward prices for European carbon permits in 2016 were at $5.57 at current exchange rates. The carbon tax revenue is based on $12.10 in 2016, a marked reduction from the originally forecast $29 a tonne. That looks pretty high. Surely, if you were preparing your budget numbers you would do it on the basis of what appears to be the most likely price today. Even stranger: the carbon price is projected to rise in a linear fashion to $18.60 in 2017 and back up to the model price of $38 per tonne by 2020.




Mr Briggs:
  That's a floating price!




Mr HOCKEY:
  That is meant to be the floating price! But what is patently clear is that if they do not have a satisfactory floating market-based price they are going to reintroduce the tax! That is what their budget assumes. Fundamentally, they are changing policy in the budget. Spending relative to GDP will be higher in every year of the forward estimates than it was in the final two years of the coalition government. So the picture is clear: the government does not have a revenue problem; it has a spending problem.


There is more. The Treasurer has made jobs and growth the centrepiece of his budget. He said:


Two simple but powerful words are at the heart of our approach—jobs and growth.


And yet, his own budget forecasts show the opposite. Real GDP growth is forecast in his budget to slow down to 2.75 per cent in 2014 and from three per cent this year. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 5.75 per cent in the first two years, from 5.5 per cent today. So the budget comes along, and then he says: 'What spin am I going to put on it? Oh—jobs and growth!' The problem is that when he defined the spin he did not actually look at the budget, because the budget goes in absolutely the opposite direction! So promising jobs and then not delivering goes to the heart of the uncertainty facing so many families in Australia today.


The forecasts for growth in nominal GDP also look optimistic. This goes to the heart of revenue. Nominal growth is forecast at five per cent in 2013 and 2014, and then even stronger—at 5.25 per cent—in the next two years. This is a much stronger rate of growth than has been delivered in the past year or so. But the Treasurer says, 'No, no—it's a hit on our revenues.' For example, the forecast for this financial year is growth of 3.25 per cent, and over the year to the December quarter nominal growth was only two per cent.


If you bear with me, Madam Speaker, I need to get a little bit technical. Real GDP shows the volume of goods and services produced and then consumed in the economy in any given period. Nominal GDP shows the value of goods and services produced and consumed. The difference is the rate of growth of prices, measured in the case of a GDP deflator. The GDP deflator is different from our more commonly used price indicators, such as the CPI—the consumer price index—because, amongst other things, it takes into account the prices of exports. So forecasts of the prices of exports and the terms of trade are critical input into the forecasts of nominal GDP. What is surprising is that the budget forecasts the terms of trade to remain at very high levels over the next two years, with a negligible decline. I remind everyone that even at their lowest point under this government, the terms of trade are going to be much higher than they were at any time under the coalition.


So the government's claims seem odd, because the terms of trade peaked in the September quarter of 2011 and have declined in every quarter since. They were 17 per cent below the peak in the December quarter last year. So while commodity prices picked up in the March quarter, showing that there are always swings and roundabouts, they have begun falling again. Many analysts suggest that the commodity price boom is now coming off the boil. In fact, in the budget papers they identified that iron ore prices are coming down to around $100 a tonne in the next two years in response to the increased supply of commodities in the global market. Yet, the government believes that this overall decline in prices will conveniently come to an end after two years.


Why is this important? It is important because the assumption of continued high terms of trade feeds into the higher forecasts for nominal GDP. This, in turn, allows higher forecasts of company profits and taxes and, therefore, a better estimate of revenue for the budget bottom line. So, while the budget does not provide four years of forecasts of the terms of trade but it gives 15 years of expenditure in various areas, the robust near-term forecasts are a key determinant of the projected surpluses in the final years of the forward estimates.


So the forecasts are very finely balanced. Sensitivity analysis suggests that a one per cent fall in nominal GDP owing to a fall in the terms of trade of just four per cent would wipe out any—any—budget surpluses this mob are claiming. That is the bottom line, and that is the risk in this budget. That is why we do not believe the numbers announced last night.


The second requirement the Leader of the Opposition and I had was a realistic medium-term budget strategy within achievable fiscal rules. The core of the government's medium-term fiscal strategy is to achieve budget surpluses on average over the medium term. It is a worthwhile goal. However, the Treasurer has not told anyone what the medium term is. With seven years of deficits in prospect, what is the medium term? It may be a decade, two decades, a century, a millennium! We don't know. What we do know is that the two promised surpluses in the final years of the forward estimates are tiny: $850 million and $6.6 billion. And, as I have said, they are based on heroic assumptions. So his claim of a credible pathway to surplus is not honest with the Australian people.


The third criterion laid down by the Leader of the Opposition and me was that the Treasurer must present a believable strategy for stabilising and then repaying the massive Labor debt. Unfortunately, the budget papers show that the debt continues to rise. The headline cash balance, which includes the NBN and the CEFC, remains in deficit throughout the forward estimates. We never had any project anything like what they are trying to offload off budget. This means that the government will continue to borrow more and more money over the next four years, totalling around $58.2 billion. With the expected face value of Commonwealth securities on issue of $256 billion as at June 2013, it suggests gross debt is likely to exceed the $300 billion limit not only within the forward estimates but probably in the next two years. This has been confirmed by third parties such as the National Australia Bank and UBS Australia. Yet we had the charade of the Treasurer in this place trying to compare apples with oranges and alleging that we were being misleading for the Australian people. Previously he has fronted this place and given a gross debt value, a gross debt level, according to the rules of the debt cap. Today he did not have the guts to do it. Why? He doesn't know or else he is deliberately misleading the Australian people.


If this Treasurer does not know what the debt level is of this government, he is not fit to be the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. The government has flagged that it will legislate to increase the debt limit 'as it becomes necessary'. So they do not have the courage to front up with their budget papers that increase the debt without coming to this parliament and saying they are going to increase the debt level. What we do know is that the interest bill on this debt will peak at $13 billion a year—$35 million a day. That would cover the full cost of the DisabilityCare Australia program when it is fully operational.


Fourth, the Treasurer must come clean on the taxation burden he is imposing. In the range of taxation measures announced last night, 60 per cent of the so-called policy savings over the forward estimates are in fact new or increased taxes. This government maintains the fantasy that it is a low-taxing government. But the fact is there are shortfalls in revenue thanks to the incompetence of the government and it is also added to by the massive borrowings and non-tax revenue. The average call on resources of this Labor government since its election will be 25.2 per cent of GDP. That is, it is utilising more than a quarter of the nation's output. That is big government. In contrast, our call on resources as a coalition was significantly less, at 23.4 per cent, because we did not borrow tomorrow's taxes to spend today. We didn't do that. We didn't borrow money like this mob. Therefore, we weren't leaving our children with the pain.



This budget is flawed. This budget does not tell the truth. This budget is leaving a legacy of debt and deficit the likes of which Australia has never seen. Everything the Treasurer says and everything the Treasurer does is as unbelievable as all his previous budgets. Unfortunately, all Australia will have to pay. (Time expired)

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (15:26):  It is great to be able to contribute to this MPI debate, albeit to the very flawed the proposition that has been brought forward by the member for North Sydney. The member for North Sydney asserts that the failure of the government to properly manage the budget should be the topic of discussion. It is extraordinary that, in the circumstances of the strength and the resilience of the Australian economy, the member for North Sydney, who has been prone to come into this place and go anywhere in the country to talk down the economy, would choose to do that once more. He wants to talk about confidence, yet in every utterance that comes out of his mouth he talks down the economy. Let us have a look at the Australian economy and the resilience of the Australian economy.


We are 13 per cent larger today than we were before the global financial crisis. There is no major advanced economy in the world that has grown in that order of magnitude in that period of time. In fact, countries like the UK still have not got back to the starting line. They are in negative territory. Many comparable countries around the world have experienced consecutive quarters of negative growth. Here in Australia we continue to move ahead—21 years of continuous economic growth.


When it comes to employment, we have created more than 960,000 jobs since we have been in office. The Leader of the Opposition says he has a plan. He doesn't have a plan; he's got a little blue book. For some reason, someone in a focus group somewhere told him, 'Whenever you are doing an interview, stick it up under your chin.' It does not add any economic ability to someone whose former boss said was economically illiterate. It adds no credibility whatsoever. The Leader of the Opposition is out there saying, 'If we get elected, in five years we will deliver a million jobs.' I have got to point out to him that in just over five years that is what we have delivered—and we had a global financial crisis, where around the world we are looking at about 30 million jobs having been lost. Here in Australia we have created almost a million jobs in that period. We did that because we took the right decisions at the right time. We stepped up to the mark and we invested in stimulus activity to keep people in jobs. The Leader of the Opposition, we all remember, was not even in the chamber. He was, in fact, asleep on the lounge in his office. The biggest economic challenge to face this country in a generation and where was the Leader of the Opposition? He wasn't the Leader of the Opposition at the time, but he was asleep on the lounge in his office. He did not even vote on it. So unlike some of his colleagues, like the member for Goldstein, who runs around when it suits him and says, 'Well, I voted against the stimulus,' the Leader of the Opposition cannot even say that, because he did not turn up; he did not vote. And this is the bloke that wants to stand up and ask the Australian people to give him the privilege of managing the Australian economy as the Prime Minister.


We have outperformed every major advanced economy, whether in growth or in employment. Our unemployment rate is at 5.5 per cent. In fact, do not listen to me; listen to the former Prime Minister John Howard, who recently said:


We are still fortunate that we have an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. I wouldn't have thought that was going to be possible a few years ago, and I don't think many people would.


This is a ringing endorsement from the former Prime Minister John Howard, the man whose economic credibility the opposition say they want to reclaim—the mantle of economic credibility that he once had, as they suggest. He says the Australian economy is doing well. When it comes to overall performance, he says:


When the prime minister and the treasurer and others tell you that the Australian economy is doing better than most, they are right.


'They are right,' he says. Do not listen to the opposition when it comes to the strength of the Australian economy. In fact, you do not even have to listen to us. Listen to the former Prime Minister John Howard—or, more importantly, listen to some independent voices in this debate. Have a look at what the ratings agencies have to say: a AAA credit rating from all three major global ratings agencies delivered under this government and reaffirmed in response to our budget handed down last night—never achieved under the former government. For all the talk about how good they were as economic managers in government, they could not achieve the trifecta of AAAs. We have got it, we have done it and it is about time it was recognised, because we have managed the Australian economy not just to deliver the sort of strength of performance reflected in those figures but to make sure that people have jobs and that the economy grows.


Let us look at what some other commentators have had to say about the budget. ANZ have said, 'As was already well known, the deterioration in federal finances has largely been due to lower than expected revenues'—as we all know, except for the member for North Sydney. He reckons there is some mysterious explanation other than a deterioration in revenue. 'ANZ's assessment is that this is a budget broadly appropriate for the economic cycle. The substantial tightening of fiscal policy that would have been required to return the budget to surplus any earlier than outlined tonight would be too damaging to an already somewhat vulnerable Australian economy.' There you have it—ANZ. That sounded like a pretty strong endorsement of the budget to me.


Do not listen to the member for North Sydney, the man who talks big when it comes to the age of entitlement. When he had his chance to confront a measure that we had taken in relation to trimming the baby bonus for second and subsequent children, he got rolled. Maybe the member for Goldstein, when he gets up and gives us his usual contribution, would like to tell us whether he was right there behind Joe. Were you right behind Joe? Did you help him out or did you get rolled too? If they could not make a responsible decision in relation to a modest trimming of the baby bonus, you have to ask yourself what hope they have.


I could go through other commentators. Westpac said:


The improvement in the budget position is appropriately gradual over the four years.


…   …   …


The Commonwealth Government's net debt position remains extremely manageable.


It was not just Westpac that said that our debt position was manageable. I will just go back to former Prime Minister John Howard for one moment:


And our debt to GDP ratio, the amount of money we owe, to the strength of our economy, is still a lot better than most other countries.


In fact, if you look at the budget papers, our net government debt is about an eighth of the average among comparable major advanced economies in the world. So, when those on the other side come forward and want to start talking down the economy and the debt that we are lumbering future generations with, just remember that the whole world went through the global financial crisis. That is why it was called the global financial crisis. So you have to have a look at what happened across the globe. When you look at what happened across the globe, you can see that we came through stronger than anyone else. We punched through stronger than anyone else, and we are 13 per cent larger today than we were then, while others are struggling to get back to whether they were. We are creating more jobs, and now we are investing in the programs of the future.

Opposition members interjecting
—





Mr BRADBURY:
  Look, at least the member for North Sydney went into the shadow cabinet and put the case. He got rolled, but he put the case. The member for Flinders does not even know what he stands for. The bloke went through three years putting together a thesis. I would hate to think what he got for a mark, but he put in three years of effort and his conclusion was that, if you want to do this, the most effective and efficient way is to price carbon. Most people stick their hand up and run for parliament because they want to make a difference. They want to take their values and enshrine them in the law of the land. But some people—




Mr Ian Macfarlane:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I am reluctant to do this, but the reality is that the MPI is about the budget, and this stream of personal attacks by the Assistant Treasurer has nothing to do with the MPI.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  I thank the member for Groom for his point of order. I was myself on the point of bringing the minister back to the MPI before the House.




Mr Hunt:
  This is the best you can do? Hey, mate, it was an undergraduate thesis on zinc, cadmium and lead—undergrad on zinc, cadmium and lead. So you've just misled.




Mr BRADBURY:
  Matters that go to carbon pricing are very adequately set out in the budget. I thank the member for Flinders for his suggestion that this has been an undergraduate contribution. I will get back to his postgraduate contribution, which was back when he believed in actually doing something to tackle the problems of the planet. But now he is more interested in self-promotion, and that means within the Liberal Party that you do not get ahead if you assert the valid view that you tackle climate change by pricing carbon. So he has put his own interests and self-advancement ahead of the duty that each and every one of us in this place has to bring the values that we believe in, enshrine them in the laws of the land and make this country a better place. That is what we have done on this side.


When it comes to economic management, I have to say that, for all the facts and figures that the member for North Sydney wants to blurt out, you did not hear him talk about the tax-to-GDP ratio. The tax-to-GDP ratio, where we look at the size of the economy and the tax that the government is collecting as a percentage of the size of the economy, is the best measure of the tax burden. It is considerably lower today than it was when we came to office. It was 23.7 per cent when we came to office; that is what the Howard government was taxing people at. It is 21.5 per cent in the current year. They talk about the tax burden. As a percentage of the economy, this government is collecting less than 22 per cent of GDP in tax collection; they were collecting almost 24 per cent. If we were taxing at the same rate as they were when they left office we would be in a comfortable surplus, but the reality is there have been revenue write-downs and cyclical and structural factors that we face.


In terms of some of the structural factors, we have put in place a proposal to tackle some of the profit-shifting activity that has been going on, where big multinationals shift profits into low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions to avoid paying their fair share. I speak to many of these companies and they point out: 'This is not a question of morality; we are doing what is legal.' I say, 'Well, I don't think it's very moral.' They say, 'If you don't think it's very moral, you're the law-maker—change the laws.' You know what? That is what we are proposing: to change the laws so that we can make sure that multinational enterprises, which are some of the most profitable enterprises in the globe and profiting from economic activity occurring here in Australia, are paying their fair share—like all the mums and dads that head off to Penrith station in my electorate at five o'clock in the morning to head into the city to work each day. They pay their fair share of tax. The small, home based business in Glenmore Park is paying its fair share of tax, but these big multinationals often locate their profits in tax havens or low-tax jurisdictions and avoid their obligations.


We want to stop it. But every time we have brought an amendment into this place—and we have brought $11 billion worth of them—what have those opposite done? They have voted against it. If there is a rort, a rip-off or a loophole they will be in there trying to protect it. This goes to a question of values. We believe we have to crack down on these loopholes and that is what we are doing.


I do not have a lot of time left and in the time left to me I must take the opportunity to talk about the high-taxing ways of those opposite, and the latest iteration of their high-taxing tendencies is this paid parental leave tax. Tony Abbott is a man who can absolutely be believed on parental leave questions because, when he was last in office as a minister of the Crown and had a chance to do something, he said, 'When it comes to parental leave it will happen over my dead body.' Over my dead body! What a commitment he had to parental leave when he last had a chance. But now he has this you-beaut, mickey mouse, Rolls Royce version where a woman on $1 million a year can take $75,000 for that period while she is on leave. There are people all around the country who will never earn $75,000 a year.


And who is going to pay for it? Companies. Remember: this is the mob that told you, 'It is a great, big, new tax and when you tax a big company it's going to flow through and be passed on in higher prices and we'll all pay, so you don't tax big companies—you actually tax all of us.' That is what they told us, but all of a sudden they are proposing a great, big, new tax. They say it is fully funded. A 1½ per cent levy on 3,000 companies will not fully fund their program. They are going to have to jack up that tax or spread it on to more and more people. See the member for Goldstein—body language is a great thing!—as he starts to have that nervous itch and twitch. He knows that this is a shambolic policy. He knows it is a sham and that, if they are going to deliver it, they are going to have to jack up taxes by more than 1½ per cent on those businesses and that will mean higher costs for consumers.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (15:41):  That was another very cerebral contribution by the Assistant Treasurer, I do not think. There is an old rule: when you are incapable of defending your position, go the man. We just had 15 minutes of that. You would think, after the presentation of the budget, you would get something more substantive than what we have just heard from the Assistant Treasurer, but you cannot blame him. The Treasurer never fronts to these debates. He is incapable of defending himself so we have just had that contribution.


This budget is a sea of red ink. For this reason it carries no hope—a failing compounded by the thread of fundamental dishonesty running through this budget document. This budget is built on shifting sands because it continues the practice of recent years of being blatantly overoptimistic about revenue forecasts. For several years now we have seen the government basically assuming that the terms of trade would stay at these 150-year historic levels. They have consistently created estimates which are unrealistic and overstated. Then they spend that money and, when that revenue is not realised, they say they have to fix the books—that they have been whacked in their revenue forecasts; they have had a hit to revenue.


The surpluses are a mirage—simply not believable—because once again they have blatantly overestimated the revenue forecast. The budget assumes that the terms of trade are basically going to flatline. The terms of trade are still at very historically-high levels. They are still 15 percentage points above their highest point under the Howard government—the golden years, as we are often told by those opposite. But the terms of trade are still 15 per cent higher. I have spent half my life in the commodity markets and I know what goes up, comes down. What this government has assumed for years now is what goes up does not come down—and yet commodity prices will not collapse but will start to head back to more normal levels. This budget ignores that fundamental reality of the market, that commodity prices will start to head back to more normal levels. As a consequence, those surpluses are meaningless and are, once again, built on quite false and overoptimistic forecasts.


This budget is built on shifting sands, because it grossly misrepresents the cause of the budget blow-outs. All through the budget papers the Treasurer blames the high Australian dollar and low commodity prices for the budget blow-out and for the so-called 'hit to revenue'. We hear it again on the radio, we see it in the papers, we hear it on the television—the high dollar taking a sledgehammer to their revenues. We hear the endless rhetoric about how their revenues have been hit to leg by a high dollar and commodity prices coming off. 


As the shadow Treasurer mentioned in his remarks, the fact of the matter is that about the only thing that the budget last year accurately forecast was that the dollar would stay high, at around $1.03, and that the trade-weighted index would be around 77. In other words, quite clearly, the government anticipated 12 months ago what would be the exchange rate all year and what would be the trade-weighted index all year. Those numbers were exactly what the Treasurer and the Treasury thought they would be. So how can you now claim that the dollar and commodity prices have hit their revenue to leg?



Mr Ewen Jones interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  It is the spin—it is the disingenuous way in which this budget presents its numbers and its arguments. So all the breast-beating by the Treasurer about the 'huge revenue whacks out of the blue' and about the 'doggedly high dollar taking a sledgehammer to revenue' is all a fabrication, designed to avoid blame for Labor's real problem, namely, the profligate spending of this government. The revenue this year is $80 billion greater than that of the last year of the Howard government, yet spending this year is $120 billion greater than that of the last year of the Howard government. That says it all! This government does not have a revenue problem—revenue is going up seven per cent—it has a spending problem. I would like to see any household that would not be happy with a seven per cent year-on-year increase in revenue. I would like to see any business that would not be happy with a seven per cent year-on-year increase in revenue.


The budget is built on shifting sands, because it has embedded within it a debt landmine—a rate of growth of debt that will threaten our AAA credit rating, a rating that was so hard won by the Howard government and a rating and an economy that got this country through the global financial crisis in good order. That is what got us through the global financial crisis: an economy that was inherited by those opposite, an economy which had no debt and which had money in the bank, an economy which had unemployment with a four in front of it, and an economy which had people who had had a 22 per cent increase in real wages over the previous 11 years. The economy was in an unprecedented position. That is what got you through the global financial crisis, along with the automatic stabilisers.


Now we have a debt landmine, five years later, buried inside the budget. We have a rate of growth that will threaten our AAA credit rating, a rating threatened by the sea of red ink represented in this budget, which will push gross debt through the $300 billion debt ceiling, as confirmed by the Treasurer this afternoon. This budget is built on shifting sands, because it is a budget which greatly underestimates, by many billions, the real loss of revenue of various measures, such as the cost of dealing with illegal boat arrivals under Labor's policies and the loss of revenue through the collapse of the carbon price and the mining tax revenue. 


Labor claim that their asylum budget costs will fall by 50 per cent over the forward estimates to less than $1.5 billion under their failed policies. That is clearly absurd. If Labor simply spend what they budgeted for next year over the forward estimates there would be an additional blow-out of $4 billion. Once again, they are just making it up. The numbers of boat arrivals grow every week and every month. What Labor have allowed for in the current budget is inadequate, given a blow-out of $4 billion this year with respect to boat arrivals. They have consistently underestimated, and again in this budget, so many of the costs in so many areas. This budget is built on shifting sands and it houses fundamental dishonesty about so many things. It is why the business sector sees it as a budget which embodies no coherent strategy to create jobs and growth or to provide certainty, nothing to restore an appetite for risk and investment and nothing to restore consumer and investor confidence. 


Consumers and business people alike know that continuing on with our fragile budgetary and debt position exposes Australia to any hard landing in China, which could feed quickly through to export earnings, unemployment, defaults and difficulties with bank financing, foreign investor confidence and Australia's debt levels. It is why this debt, this constant sea of red ink, is undermining confidence. It is why people are not spending and why investors are not investing. It is why there is great nervousness about unemployment and the future.


There is another way: the government must stop taxing, borrowing, spending and regulating and start living within its means. The growth and the role of big government that we saw in this budget last night must be displaced by fostering robust growth of our millions of small and large businesses and by restoring consumer confidence to spend. Government must, once again, provide a measure of certainty and stability.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business) (15:51):  This budget is all about choices and responsibility. This budget keeps our economy strong, makes smart investments for our future and ensures every Australian gets a fair go. It is about supporting jobs and supporting growth, and we are doing that by investing in infrastructure, investing in the real economy, investing in people, investing in the things that make a difference, investing in the things that keep the Australian economy ahead of other economies, investing in the things that give us a future and put this budget on a sustainable path to surplus. That is what this budget is about. It is an honest budget about where we sit in the global economy, about what has happened over the past five years with our fiscal position—where Australia is in terms of its revenue base. We have made the structural changes, the big reforms. We have taken responsibility. We have made the hard decisions—not always politically palatable, not always the sorts of things you do in your own political interest but the things you do in the national interest, the things that have to be done. That should always be the measure of a government. It should always be the measure of a budget—doing the right thing by the economy, doing the right thing by Australians, doing the right thing by our kids in terms of education, looking after the most vulnerable in society through DisabilityCare, making the tough choices.


There is one thing that always comes to mind. When tough choices have needed to be made, no matter where the economy was at, no matter what time period it was in Australian history, it was always left to Labor governments to make those decisions. There was never going to be a good time for universal superannuation, but Labor did it because it was the right thing to do by the economy and the right thing to do by workers. On every other call, on every other hard decision, it is always us who are left with the responsibility—which we take—to make those tough decisions. We saw it again last night in the budget. We saw the tough decisions.


It does not matter who is in government; the revenue write-downs will be exactly the same. The difference here is the choices you make. That is why this budget is about choices. That number will be the same whether it is us or them getting that information from Treasury. It will be the same Treasury officials, the same Treasury, the exact same people who provided the Howard government with their figures, data and analysis for 11 years. But the choices will be different because we have stepped up to the plate and put a stronger economy, jobs and growth first.


If people have a job, they have a chance. That is why there is hope. That is why we still have a good economy. I actually say to people that is why we have an economy. I talk, as most people do, with people from all walks of life and international visitors who come to this country, and they cannot believe it. They look at our economy and say, 'We would give our right arm for an economy like yours.' A strong economy where unemployment is around five per cent is not good enough but certainly good in the current global environment. It was once considered full employment. I would like to think that means a lot of people are still in jobs.


Since we came to government, our economy has grown by 13 per cent. Compare that to every other economy in the world: the United States, Japan, Germany, France and anyone in the EU. Their economies have grown by barely one per cent over that same period. Ours is 13—hence why we still have jobs and economy, hence why interest rates are at historic lows in this country. I will never forget that when the Howard government was sitting on this side of the table they promised that interest rates would always be lower under a Liberal government. Wrong. That has not been the case. They are lower under us.


We have kept the economy strong and we have kept interest rates low. We have also kept inflation under control. Inflation is low as well. How does that translate to the ordinary person in the street? It means they have a job. Their mortgage is less. It means there is more investment in their children's future and their families because we support them through the money we have spent in education. We support them through better quality infrastructure in schools which everyone can see every day. It means we have paid for more, better quality teachers, for more programs and for special assistance where kids need a hand up because some kids do it a bit tougher than other kids. We have put money there as well. It is about delivering a fairer economy, not just a stronger economy. Plenty of people can look after themselves, but a government's responsibility is to everybody, not just the strong. It has to be fair as well, and that is what we have done.


So, yes, it is a tough budget. Yes, we have had to make the tough calls on savings—$42 billion worth of savings at the same time that revenue write-downs are around $60 billion over the forward estimates. That is a lot of money to make up, but we have stepped up to that challenge. We have made the necessary savings. We are not going to cut to the bone. We are going to pull up short of where the mob on the other side want to go, and that is cutting to the bone.


We have seen it in Liberal state governments. We have seen it in my state of Queensland, and that is easy to translate on the ground into massive, instant job losses and a stop in investment. Ports that were about to be built were stopped. No-one wants to pay for them anymore. There is no leveraging of government funds to leverage the private sector to invest in ports. Instead you just see a halt. At the same time that we see commodity prices coming off and a need for government to step up to the plate, what does the Queensland Liberal state government do? It stops the investment. It halts the growth. It cuts the jobs. It does the exact opposite of what you need to do. You need to invest in your people. You need to invest in skills. You need to invest in jobs and growth. And it is not just rhetoric; you do it through budgets. You do it through programs, through skilling Australia.


What did we do when we came to government in 2007? Some of the very first things are two that I am really proud of. One is that we made our first major investment in people who receive the age pension. We accepted and recognised that they were falling massively behind and we made a massive structural change, indexing age pensions properly, not handing out $500 cheques before an election, not piecemeal payments to people who have worked all their lives for Australia, for the economy, making a contribution. We did it properly so it would be indexed and permanent, and no government in the future can take it away.


The other major thing we did to keep the economy strong is invest in infrastructure. We set up the Building Australia Fund. We set up Infrastructure Australia. We did not just talk about it; we actually built roads. We actually build rail. We actually build ports. My good friend the member for Blair reminds me of the Ipswich Motorway—not that I need reminding of the Ipswich Motorway! But the reality is that we fought tooth and nail for over a decade to get that project up. In 2007 there was a local referendum on a lot of things, but there was one in particular on that road. It was: 'You vote for Labor; you get the road. You vote for the Liberals; you get nothing.' You get a pipe dream of some alternative bypass which was uncosted, unfunded and engineers were telling me was going to cost twice as much if it ever got built. And we have a good news story to tell. We have a further good news story to tell in this fiscally responsible budget. We have put more money on the table. We are signing an agreement with the Queensland state government. I do not care what colour they are; I want to deliver for the people of Queensland, and we are going to put $290 million to finish off the Ipswich Motorway job. Yes, it is tough times, yes, you have got to make savings, yes, you have got to cut in the right areas, but you need to invest in the right areas at the same time. That is stronger, with jobs and growth; that is smarter, by investing in schools and education and investing in our future; and that is fairer, because DisabilityCare—just like we did with Medicare—is looking after the most vulnerable in society and making sure that we have got a fair economy that delivers for everybody. That is what we are doing. 


What an absolute sham it is when the other side come in here with this disingenuous matter of public importance: 'The failure of the government to manage the economy.' What did they do to manage the economy when it was their opportunity to step up to the block? Let me tell you what they did during the GFC: they opposed every single measure that the government put forward to support jobs and families. Every time they were dragged kicked and screaming, but opposed every single measure to keep jobs. Since we were elected to government, 960,000 jobs have been created in this economy. Every other economy in the world has lost jobs—globally it is millions of jobs—but in Australia we bucked the trend because government had the tenacity to make the investments. Yes, that does mean borrowing. It is good borrowing, and our national net debt position is a healthy one. It is as simple as that. It is around 11 per cent and it is affordable; we can afford that. 



Where are we spending that money? We are spending it on ensuring that we have a strong economy, a fair economy and a smarter economy. I will never begrudge the money where we have spent it: on kids, education, infrastructure and jobs. It has been spent on making sure that we actually have a path to the future, a path to surplus—delayed, yes, but a path to surplus. The only time a AAA rating has happened is under a Labor government—with all three ratings agencies, AAA. The big test was last night: what were they going to say about our budget when it was analysed at an international level? They retained our AAA ratings across the board because it is a strong budget, a responsible budget, a fair budget, a smart budget and it helps people get through the global crisis we are all facing.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:01):  This matter of public importance on the budget, on the day after the budget, now follows a new pattern in the House of Representatives. We have a Treasurer who will not front for the MPI. We have a Treasurer who will not front to the parliament and will not front to defend his budget. This is a curious thing. As I was watching the Assistant Treasurer front for the Treasurer, who does not deign to come to this place to talk about a matter of public importance, I wondered: is it because he thinks his budget is of no public importance? Is it that he just does not want to talk about his budget to the parliament? This Treasurer, year after year, refuses to debate his budget as a matter of public importance the day after the budget.


The interesting thing is that—as someone reminded me—when he was the shadow Treasurer he did not want to move the MPI either. One year, famously, on the day after Peter Costello's budget there was no MPI on the budget. You do not need to take my word for it because, thanks to the former Chief Government Whip—the member for Hunter, Mr Fitzgibbon—we know about this. He told his then friend Mark Latham, who wrote about it. He wrote about how, in 2005, Wayne Swan as shadow Treasurer refused to move the matter of public importance the day after the budget because he was—too nervous, or too busy? It became a big talking point, and now he is the Treasurer he will not come in for the MPI.


Here we are debating his budget. It is a budget that strings together one aspect of consistency, I have to say, and that is that every year, with this Treasurer, the question is: how much will he miss by? My friend the member for Wannon has heard me recite how much he has missed by on every deficit projection. I will not labour the point. The only thing you can say with this budget is that people are already looking back and seeing how much he missed by, and looking ahead and asking the question: how much will he miss by again? What is that mathematical calculation you should factor in—the Swan factor—to adjust immediately every figure he puts out and everything he says. As the shadow Treasurer said, in rough terms it is about $20 billion on the budget. That is basically the miss. In the year gone, as we all know, the deficit was $44 billion. A year before he said it would be $22 billion. This year we were told on 360 or more occasions that there would be a small surplus and, of course, there is about a $20 billion deficit.


As the shadow Treasurer pointed out, this government does not have a revenue problem. Its problem has been that it has overforecast. That is his problem. As the shadow Treasurer and the member for Goldstein pointed out, revenue is going up this year. It is going up six per cent, it is projected to rise seven per cent in the following year and nearly seven per cent in the year after. It is worth actually looking back at their overoptimistic projections. Before I forget, just today the member for Hunter said, 'It has always been my approach to underpromise and overdeliver,' in reference to the Treasurer, who does precisely the opposite.


But let us nail this absolute falsehood from this government that they have had a reduction in revenue. They have had an increase in revenue. The problem is that their overoptimistic forecast was not that they waited to see, but that they spent all the money. If you look back at last year's budget—and it is a good table to look at because it gives a very factual account, and the Prime Minister says that she likes to talk about facts—at what they promised and what happened, if you were to believe the government you would be looking for this decline in revenue. 


In the 2012-13 budget the 2011-12 estimated outcome was about $330 billion for receipts, and for the 2012-13 year the Treasurer thought that the increase in revenue would be about $36 billion—which would go up to about $368 billion. It did not stay at $330 billion. It has not declined from $330 million. It went to about $350 billion. It increased by quite a bit. As the member for Goldstein said, this government does not have a revenue problem; it has got a spending problem, and if you look at what they said they would spend and what they actually spent, the figures tell the story. They have spent more than they said they would, and I will not bore the House with every single figure.


The problem with the Treasurer is that he is about to do it all again. His exhibit A is his mining tax, the mining tax that in the first six months collected about $120 million when it was going to bring in billions. We found out last night that it will raise $200 million. As my friend and colleague in the other place the shadow Assistant Treasurer pointed out, that is an incredible 95 per cent below the Treasurer's original $4 billion revenue forecast that he issued before the last election.


Having missed it by that much—and as I have said before, you can only imagine the word pictures that this Treasurer presents on missing targets—what this budget says is that in about four years time, it will bring in about $2.2 billion. That is the year he says we will return to surplus. This Treasurer's past is his future and it is this government's pattern. All the time it leads to deficit upon deficit, a promised surplus that is a broken promise, replaced with a promise of being achieved in a few years time. As long as this Treasurer is in office, it will always be in four years time until he takes all the steps to ensure that it is pushed out and out and out. The upshot is more deficits and more taxes to try to fill the hole he has created and of course much, much more debt. 


Net debt was not zero. It was $45 billion in the bank when this Treasurer began. We are now seeing in the budget papers the $147 billion peak that we used to talk about becoming the peak net debt in 2015-16 being close to $191 billion. Add $45 billion to that and he is on his way to a quarter of a million turnaround. This is a failed budget with a Treasurer that will not even front.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (16:12):  It is my pleasure to rise on this matter of public importance to speak about the strength of the Australian economy and the important choices that this budget makes. The Australian economy is performing strongly by international standards. As previous speakers have noted, we have grown 13 per cent since 2007. It is a period when the United States has only grown a couple of per cent and when all of Europe has actually shrunk. The European economy is smaller now than it was then. Australia's economy has moved up the rankings from being the 15th largest to the 12th largest in the world. We have seen faster productivity growth over recent years than we saw under Work Choices, giving the lie to the notion that all that stands between Australia and stellar productivity performance is cutting back workers' entitlements. We have seen the sharemarket up. In fact the sharemarket is up more than 10 per cent just this year.


You do not have to take my word for that. As former Prime Minister John Howard has noted:


… our debt to GDP ratio, the amount of money we owe, to the strength of our economy, is still a lot better than most other countries.


Former Prime Minister Howard has been willing to speak the truth on this. While the member for North Sydney used question time to fearmonger about debt, former Prime Minister John Howard has acknowledged that Australian debt levels are low. In fact the Leader of the Opposition himself has a debt to income ratio well over 200 per cent, so it is hard to see why he would envisage a debt to income ratio of 11 per cent as being unsustainable.


If we go back to 2009, we had the Leader of the Opposition telling Lateline that Labor's stimulus package was 'not going to stop the recession being long and deep'. He was of course completely wrong about that. Thanks to the stimulus package, Australia avoided going into recession entirely. We did that because we did not cut back on government spending when the private sector turned bad. Two-thirds of the debt that Australia took on was due to revenue write-downs with just one-third being due to the stimulus spending we put in place. So when you hear those opposite fearmongering about debt, they are really saying that the Australian government should have cut back when the private sector was cutting back. That would have led to a long and deep recession of the kind the Leader of the Opposition forecast incorrectly in 2009.


Mr Deputy Speaker, if you believe those opposite, you would believe that coalition governments spend more, tax less and have less debt than this government. Indeed, I even heard a voice from one of those opposite. 'Yes, we can do that,' they said. The problem is it is mathematically impossible. You have got to make choices. You actually have to make choices—and our budget does that. We make difficult choices but they are responsible savings measures: $430 billion in savings adding up to $180 billion in savings under this government. We understand those trade-offs. It is not sure those opposite do. Those opposite have a fiscal crater which was $70 billion before the revenue write-downs and now, with nearly $20 billion of revenue write-downs, it must surely be in the order of $90 billion.


Part of the reason they have that is their unfair paid parental leave scheme, which gives the most to those who have the most. Of course, you do not need to hear my criticisms of this scheme, which may cost between $12 billion and $17 billion over four years, as you can simply go to those opposite. The member for Mitchell said it did 'not pass the fair-go test'. The member for Tangney said he was 'aware of a number of colleagues that have similar concerns on this policy'. The member for Moore said, 'The Labor Party scheme is quite good.' He said he was not sure 'why it is necessary to go to this level and how it will assist productivity'. The member for Wentworth said he was 'not going to comment on whether it should be reviewed or not'. Senator Cormann said that he is yet to announce how they will fund it, and they have not released the costings yet. Peter Reith goes further. He just says 'it is obviously bad policy'. Nick Minchin: 'I have been on the record many, many times as saying that I'm not a supporter of the paid parental leave scheme of the opposition.' He says, 'I think Tony and the opposition should now put that in the aspirational category.' And Peter Costello says, 'My view is that it is a very generous scheme.' Well, yes, it is generous, but it is generous to the most affluent; it is not generous to the neediest.


The opposition leader claims that he can pay for paid parental leave with a 1.5 per cent impost on Coles and Woolies customers. The trouble is that was predicated on company tax revenues being up and we have seen company tax revenues being written down, so 1½ per cent likely does not cover the cost of the opposition's unfair paid parental leave scheme. It is likely they would have to increase company taxes and therefore increase grocery prices by even more.


They have claimed that the tax increase combined with parental leave could even save the affected businesses money. But, unfortunately, business leaders have quickly come out to say that this did not fit the mathematical test—again similar to the claim that they can increase spending, cut taxes and pay down the debt faster. The opposition leader could not name a single business that would be better off under his parental leave scheme, because there is not one. It is no wonder that former Liberal leader John Hewson said the opposition leader has no interest in economics and called him 'innumerate'.


That brings me to the opposition's soil magic plan, a direct action plan which they originally said would cost $3 billion over four years and now will cost $2 billion over three years. But that is at odds with the costings of independent experts. The Grattan Institute say that it will cost $100 billion to achieve the coalition's emissions reduction target via soil magic, with $1,300 in new taxes because the opposition will not deal with foreigners in order to combat climate change and that again drives up the cost. If they were serious about this policy, they would submit it to the Parliamentary Budget Office for scrutiny. They would come clean with the Australian people. They would not go around making statements like the Leader of the Opposition has made that 'we will spend no more and no less on reducing emissions than we allocate'. The fact is that something has to give. Clearly the opposition cannot both meet its budgetary targets and meet its emissions reductions targets. It will have to do one or the other.


Then there is the coalition's $30 billion policy to construct dams. That shows the priorities of the coalition: $30 billion on a very odd dam scheme which seems to bear a curious resemblance to a major coalition backer's plans to develop the north. But there are no plans for investing in the education of Australia's children and no plans for paying for disability care. The opposition want to spend $1½ billion on drones, another thought bubble. When I first heard of this policy I thought we should just remind them that their coalition with the Nationals still remains strong. So there is $1½ billion on drones apparently and there is $10 million for upgrades to the opposition leader's football club, Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, and there is $400 million for a green army.


I could go on all day but the coalition's fiscal woes are the result of saying yes to every special interest and no to every sensible revenue-raising measure. What the opposition leader must do tomorrow night is come into this place and back Labor's responsible saves. He must come into this place and he must say that he backs our revenue measures, because if he does not then all he has done is dig deeper into his $70 billion crater—and, as advice goes, when you are down deep the best thing you can do is stop digging. The opposition leader could stop digging by backing Labor' measures to get rid of the baby bonus and replace it with a targeted $2,000 for those on family tax benefit part A. He could back our company tax changes which see a fairer and more responsible company tax system being put into place. He could back the series of these measures but then he would still have to make swingeing cuts. When he is asked about his cuts he likes to speak about the cuts that he will make in my electorate of Fraser and the 20,000 Canberra public servants that he will get rid of. But that is only a small drop in the ocean compared to the budget gap that the coalition leader finds himself in. He wants to give tax cuts to big miners and big polluters. They have been guaranteed. But he does not want to provide tax cuts to the Australians who are at the bottom of the income spectrum. He is going to reverse Labor's cuts to superannuation contributions taxation for low-income earners. He is going to reverse our tripling of the tax-free threshold. Both are policies that will disproportionately hit women. Budgets are about priorities and values. It is time for the opposition leader to show tomorrow night where his are.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2013-05-15,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (16:22):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance in relation to the 2013-14 budget announced by the Treasurer last night. This is a budget that does nothing for regional Australia. What last night's budget speech confirmed to all Australians is that this government is in chaos. It has no credibility and it has no plan for the future of Australia. Despite all the government finger-pointing and spin about why their budget is in tatters, the reality is the responsibility for the chaos which has engulfed this government rests with the government itself.


Over the past five years federal Labor have borrowed more than $260 billion and saddled future generations with a mountain of debt. They have lost control of our borders which is costing Australian taxpayers billions of dollars each and every year. They have wasted billions on school halls, pink batts and the rollout of broadband infrastructure. As a result of this waste and mismanagement, last year we saw the Treasurer desperately attempt to lay out the government's plan for a future return to surplus. Indeed it was a very wafer thin surplus. The plan was based on assumptions that no credible commentator accepted and that most Australians just did not believe.


As the member for North Sydney highlighted this time last year, the federal Labor government will never deliver a budget surplus because what we know about federal Labor governments is that they have no respect for taxpayers' money and they do not know how to manage programs. It therefore came as no surprise when, less than six months into the current financial year, the Treasurer broke another promise and dropped the government's commitment to return to surplus. Since then the forecast deficit has continued to rise as cost blow-outs and further economic mismanagement paralyse the government's leadership. Any inkling of credibility that remained soon evaporated as the government's deficit forecasts continued to rise in the lead-up to last night's government Swan song.


Despite manipulating the figures and using every trick in the budget book last night, the government confirmed that the $1.5 billion surplus was now a $19.4 billion deficit—a $21 billion turnaround which came on the back of deficits under this government of $27 billion in 2008-09, $54 billion in 2009-10, $47.5 billion in 2010-11 and $43.4 billion in 2011-12. Yet, despite this, the Treasurer last night stood up in this place for the second consecutive year and claimed the government had a new road map of how to return to surplus. It will not happen this financial year. It will not happen next year. This financial year we have an $18 billion deficit forecast. But apparently through the magic of manipulation the Treasurer wants the Australian people to believe that a small surplus of  $800 million will be delivered in 2015-16. The truth is that no-one honestly believes this government and no-one honestly believes the assumptions that this government has based its claim on that the budget will eventually return to surplus in 2015-16.


The majority of Australians know they simply cannot trust this government, and today I would like to demonstrate how last night's budget confirms why. Last night we again saw the government making all sorts of wild claims about funding for the Pacific Highway. Minister Albanese distributed a media release claiming that over the next 12 months work would commence on at least five new projects on the Pacific Highway. These five projects were in addition to existing projects. The new projects had a cumulative cost of more than $3 billion. Such a substantial commitment would be very welcome, if only it could be believed. Despite Minister Albanese's media release, when you go through last night's budget papers there is not one mention of the Pacific Highway and not one extra dollar of funding detailed in the 2013-14 budget papers. There is not one mention of the Pacific Highway in the budget papers, yet there is a media release from the minister claiming that more than $3 3 billion in projects is set to commence.


The government is treating North Coast residents as mugs. They are playing with people's lives, all for the sake of a headline. This is symbolic of what is wrong with this government and why they are in such a mess. Their addiction to policy by press release has got them into all sorts of trouble and this is just another example. The truth is that funding for future projects on the highway is in limbo because of a stand-off between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales government. When the O'Farrell government was elected to office, the federal minister, Minister Albanese, immediately tore up the 80:20 Pacific Highway funding model which had previously existed between federal Labor and the state Labor government. Instead the minister began insisting on fifty:fifty funding and as a result there is a $4 billion funding black hole which has to be filled if the road's duplication is to be completed.


Since changing the funding arrangements we have seen the federal government concoct all sorts of excuses for changing the funding model. The most recent came from the federal member for Page, who was put on the spot after the Gillard government announced that it would fund upgrades to the Bruce Highway based on the 80:20 model with the Queensland government. When the member for Page was asked why the same funding formula did not apply in New South Wales, this is what she told Prime Television News on 30 April:


It is not part of the Australian National Network, that the Bruce Highway is, and to those highways the contribution (from the State) is 20 per cent, but it is 50/50 for the Pacific Highway.


The member for Page either does not understand the existing classification of the Pacific Highway or she is deliberately misleading her constituents because the Pacific Highway has been included in the National Transport Network since 2005. This map here in my hand clearly illustrates that fact. I would like to table that document in due course. As the map shows, the National Land Transport Corridor clearly does include the Pacific Highway, as it does the New England Highway. 


As a result of the 2005 determination by the Howard government to include the Pacific Highway on the national network, billions of dollars in federal funding have been invested in the duplication of that road. So the member for Page needs to explain to North Coast residents why she is not being honest about the status of the highway. The extent that the government is going to in order to mislead North Coast residents is a clear concern. When you look at the member for Page's lame excuse, then you witness the spin and deception which has emanated from this government, North Coast residents have every right to be concerned about the Gillard government's commitment to completing the highway upgrade. The real fear here is that behind all the spin the government actually intends to either cut funding for the highway or defer the funding for the highway. The member for Page and the member for Lyne, who have been conspicuous with their silence about the absence of any mention of the highway in the 2013-14 budget papers, must give North Coast residents a guarantee that funding for the highway will not be cut or deferred. They should explain how each project, which the minister claims are set to commence, will be funded in the next financial year.


Despite the chaos from the government, I am pleased to say that there is a better way. The coalition, if elected, will provide the strong economic management that the residents on the North Coast of New South Wales are seeking and we will also deliver the funding required to complete the duplication of the highway. We have announced and are committed to $5.6 billion. When combined with the New South Wales government's commitment of $1.5 billion that will deliver the funding necessary to complete the duplication of the road. That is $4 billion more than could possibly be delivered under the current funding arrangements.


Australians know they simply cannot trust anything this government says. They clearly understand, as businesses clearly understand, that they expect governments to live within their means. Last night's speech by the Treasurer was essentially a summary of all of the government's broken promises and a display of all of the incompetence involved in getting from the position that this government inherited—a budget surplus, money in the bank—to a situation where a budget is being delivered that provides deficits as far as the eye can see.


The 2013-14 budget papers show that this government has failed to detail a credible plan for our nation's future, and they really clearly show why this government is regarded widely as the worst government in this nation's history. Whether it is cost of living, border protection or the Pacific Highway, this government has simply run out of ideas and excuses as to how to address its policy failings. The sad reality is that all Australians are paying the price for this government's incompetence.

Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (16:32):  On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, I present the committee's report on the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's annual report 2011-12, the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities' annual report 2011-12, Caring for our Country and Landcare, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. 


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper. 




Mr ADAMS:
  by leave—In considering these annual reports, the committee was particularly interested in the Caring for our Country initiative, which is jointly administered by both departments. The operation of the community based natural resource management program Landcare was also considered by the committee.


Caring for our Country is a large and complex program designed to assist in the management of natural resources. The program receives substantial funding from the Australian government. Phase 1 of the program was established in 2008. At the conclusion of this first phase a review was undertaken in 2012. The results of stakeholder feedback, as part of the review, were considered when developing the second phase of the program. This second phase, supported by $2 billion of Commonwealth funding, is due to commence in July 2013.


In implementing phase 2, the Australian government has sought to improve the clarity of program administration and decision making by channelling the initiative into two separately administered streams: an agricultural sustainability stream and an environmental stream. The committee focused on the review of the program released in 2012. The review, while largely positive, found a number of areas that could be improved, including the monitoring, evaluation, reporting and improvement framework. It also found that additional consultation is needed in the setting of outcomes and targets. These should consider scientific and community experiences and account for the knowledge and expertise of regional natural resource management organisations.


Ongoing management of natural resources is a critical investment in Australia's future. The need to manage pests and weeds in natural environments also warrants priority attention. It is also vital that natural resource management projects be monitored to enable resources to be spent wisely. In this regard, we examined aspects of the National Reserve System—Australia's network of protected areas. The inquiry focussed on joint land acquisition arrangements for the scheme where the Commonwealth provides two-thirds of the purchase price and the land manager provides the remainder. Our report calls for clarity in circumstances where a land manager becomes unable to discharge their contractual obligations to conserve the designated land.


Community engagement in the decision-making process underpins natural resource management. Local communities and those with local knowledge play a vital role in the identification of weeds and pests and identify potential new conservation projects. The community should also play a role in how resources are allocated to identify those projects.


The report also encourages an improvement in mechanisms for sharing project outcomes. The provision of this shared knowledge should ensure that future natural resource management projects are better assessed and managed.


The committee made one recommendation, calling on both agencies to inform the committee once the new Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting and Improvement Strategy relating to the Caring for our Country initiative has been published. We look forward to examining the new strategy and hope the agencies will also note the committee's comments through the rest of the report.


On a final note, we were pleased to see the departments embracing the use of new technology. In particular, the use of mobile devices to engage with communities to identify potential projects was commendable. Such initiatives should continue and be improved as technology continues to develop. I would like to thank the members of the committee for their work in relation to the inquiry—the member for Bass on my left; the member for Hume, the deputy chair—the committee staff for their assistance in preparing the report, and I also thank the departments for their cooperation. I commend the report to the House.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (16:46):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services I present the committee's advisory reports together with the evidence gathered by the committee on the following bills: Corporations and Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 and Corporations Amendment (Simple Corporate Bonds and Other Measures) Bill 2013, incorporating a dissenting report.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the reports were made parliamentary papers.




Ms O'NEILL:
  by leave—I commence my remarks by addressing the Corporations Amendment (Simple Corporate Bonds and Other Measures) Bill.


On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's report on the Corporations Amendment (Simple Corporate Bonds and Other Measures) Bill 2013, together with the evidence received by the committee.


This bill has two distinct schedules that deal with, firstly, simple corporate bonds, and secondly, with the use of the terms 'financial planner' and 'financial adviser'. I will address simple corporate bonds first.


In November 2009, the Johnson report, titled Australia as a financial centre—building on our strengths, identified the lack of liquidity and diversity in Australia's corporate bond market as a weakness in Australia's financial system. To assist in the development of the retail corporate bond market, the Johnson report recommended a reduction in the regulatory requirements on corporate debt issuance to retail investors.


In December 2010, the government announced the Competitive and Sustainable Banking System package that identified the bond market as a key element of the long-term safety and sustainability of the financial system. In 2012, parliament passed the Commonwealth Government Securities Legislation Amendment (Retail Trading) Bill 2012. The legislation enables retail trading in Commonwealth government securities depositary interests on the public exchange in order to foster the development of the retail debt market.


This bill continues the development of the retail debt market by reducing the regulatory requirements on issuing simple corporate bonds identified in the Johnson report, while also retaining appropriate investor safeguards.


The bill will make three changes to the current arrangements for issuing corporate bonds. First, the bill offers a streamlined disclosure process through a two-part prospectus for corporate bodies wishing to issue simple corporate bonds.


Second, the bill allows simple corporate bonds to be traded on the ASX, using the same depositary interests mechanism that exists for Commonwealth government securities.


Third, the bill removes deemed civil liability for directors in relation to simple corporate bonds. This removes the need for directors to carry out due diligence on the two-part prospectus used to issue simple corporate bonds, and therefore reduces the costs involved with a bond issue. Importantly, investor safeguards are maintained by ensuring that simple corporate bonds adhere to a set of qualification criteria that ensure they are long-term, low-risk, and relatively stable sources of income for investors.


Another measure in the bill clarifies the due diligence defence that is available to directors in respect of criminal liability regarding the offering of all securities.


This bill will benefit Australian businesses by making it easier to access alternatives sources for raising funds within the domestic market, and it will benefit retail investors by allowing them to diversify their portfolios with bonds that provide relatively safe and stable returns.


The second part of the bill complements the government's Future of Financial Advice (FOFA) reforms that aim to improve the quality of financial advice, and protect consumers.


The bill addresses concerns that consumers may be influenced by unprofessional and inappropriate advice from unlicensed persons such as 'property spruikers'. The bill strengthens protections for consumers by enshrining in law the terms 'financial planner' and 'financial adviser' and restricting the use of those terms to those persons that offer personal financial advice in relation to designated financial products and that operate under an Australian Financial Services Licence.


The bill makes it an offence for unlicensed persons to portray themselves as financial planners or financial advisers, and enables ASIC to take action against unlicensed persons using the defined terms. In effect, the bill will help consumers by clarifying where they can go to get personal financial advice, and it will improve consumer confidence in the financial advising industry.


Both sections of this bill received broad support from industry.


The committee recommends that the House passes the bill.


I would like to thank the industry bodies and the officers of the Treasury who assisted the committee during the inquiry. I commend that bill to the House.


I now turn to the tabling of the report into the inquiry into the Corporations and Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. This is a response to the 2008 financial crisis, which prompted calls for financial regulators to review the regulatory framework underpinning domestic and global economies. A central cause of the crisis was the largely unregulated derivatives market, which had grown rapidly. This market was conducted on both public stock exchanges and in private through over-the-counter derivative transactions.


In 2009, the G20 agreed to progress measures to strengthen the international financial regulatory system. As a follow-up to its G20 commitments, the government asked the Council of Financial Regulators to undertake a consultation and review of the existing regulatory framework. The Corporations Legislation Amendment (Derivative Transactions) Act 2012, known as the DT act, was enacted in December 2012 to implement the Council of Financial Regulator's recommendations and to address Australia's G20 commitments. The DT act provides a high degree of flexibility to facilitate the adjustment of Australia's over-the-counter derivative requirements in response to international regulatory developments. Under the framework, obligations may be imposed through delegated legislation and regulatory rules.


The bill complements this framework by amending a variety of acts to introduce a range of miscellaneous measures related to the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives and other financial products.


First, the bill would amend the Payment Systems and Netting Act 1998 to provide legal certainty in the event of a default or insolvency of a trade participant. In those circumstances, a central counterparty may protect itself against the consequences of default by moving the transaction of a failed participant to another, solvent participant. This process is known as 'porting'. Without the amendments, insolvency law would allow an external administrator to intervene and stop or unwind porting transfers. The measures provide legal certainty to these transactions, which will generally be required in crisis situations. These amendments ensure that the Australian legislative framework is consistent with international developments, including in the United Kingdom, and are intended to increase the stability of the financial system.


The second measure in the bill would provide some discretion to ASIC and the RBA in terms of reviewing certain licence holders, while also prescribing specific licence holders for ASIC and the RBA to assess annually. During the committee's inquiry, stakeholders noted that the proposed amendments would allow ASIC and the RBA to better prioritise resources and ensure that attention is directed to primary areas of focus, including large retail markets.


The third measure in the bill would enable ASIC to share information with pan-European regulators, putting beyond doubt ASIC's ability to render assistance to those regulators in their administration and enforcement of foreign business laws. The intention is to promote better enforcement outcomes in Australia and abroad, and this is consistent with our G20 commitments. These commitments require countries to adopt harmonised and cooperative arrangements to ensure transparency and to manage risk in financial markets.


Other measures in the bill would formalise ASIC's annual reporting commitments in relation to its use of information-gathering powers. These amendments are intended to broadly align ASIC's reporting obligations with those of other regulators, such as the ACC. 


The bill also proposes measures that would assist RBA officers to share protected information for regulatory purposes and allow the RBA to impose confidentiality restrictions on persons to whom protected information is provided. These amendments are intended to assist the RBA in collaborating with domestic and international regulators and are modelled on the provisions available to APRA in its legislation. Stakeholders noted that due to the increasing globalisation of markets, effective sharing of information is necessary, both in normal operations and in times of crisis, and at a domestic level and an international level.


Another measure in the bill would enable the Clean Energy Regulator to share protected information with licensed and prescribed trade repositories. These amendments are intended to promote transparency and to assist with the operation of markets on which carbon credit units may be traded.


The committee acknowledges that there remains significant scope for Australia to implement the 2009 G20 commitments further. This includes increases in trade reporting, central clearing, and exchange and electronic platform trading. The committee also recognises the ongoing consultation being conducted by the Australian regulators and commends them for their very strategic approach.


The committee views the measures in this bill as representing practical steps towards implementing Australia's G20 commitments regarding over-the-counter derivatives. The measures are broadly supported by the Australian regulators and financial industry.


The committee recommends that the House pass the bill.


On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the industry bodies and experts, and the officers of the Treasury, the RBA and ASIC that assisted the committee during this inquiry.


Given the significant numbers of pieces of legislation in this area that have been referred to the joint parliamentary committee, I would also like to thank the members of the committee secretariat who worked on this inquiry: Dr Richard Grant, Alistair Cadman, Madeleine Willis and Kate Campbell—and Patrick Hodda, of course who made a fantastic contribution.


I commend the reports to the House.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Report from Committee</title>,BILLS,19,2
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (17:04):  I ask leave of the House to move a motion to suspend standing orders to enable the House to divide again on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Service Providers and Other Governance Measures) Bill 2012.


Leave not granted.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I move:


That in accordance with standing order 132, standing and sessional orders be suspended to enable the House to divide again on the question viz.: That the Opposition amendments be agreed to.


I move this motion consistent with the positions that were put in place as part of parliamentary reform in what is an unusual parliament in terms of Australia's historical position. Historically, of course, governments have had absolute majorities on the floor of the House of Representatives. When the Australian people made their determination in August 2010, they chose that that would not be the case. As a result, discussions took place in good faith between the government, the opposition and crossbench members—particularly the member for Lyne—about parliamentary reform ensuring that proper functioning could occur. Members would be aware that in the Senate, because of the nature of the Senate, where the government party has historically—with some brief exceptions, which is why we got Work Choices—not had a majority on the floor, an arrangement exists whereby, if someone inadvertently misses a division, there is a recommittal. It happens without fuss. It happens as a matter of course. In fact, it happens pretty regularly.


In this parliament we unanimously chose to alter the standing orders to allow, through standing order 132, for a recommittal to be put if a member is accidentally absent. There is a very sensible reason why this is the case. That is because, were it not to be, the views of this parliament—this House of Representatives—could be distorted by misadventure or someone simply missing a vote. Therefore it was determined that, if that occurred, the bill would be recommitted. It was stated very clearly in the parliamentary reform agreement. It was put in the standing orders and understood that this would be the case, in a similar way to the way in which the operation of pairs ensures the principle that a result should not be distorted because of a member's absence from parliament. Were this not to be implemented it would lead to an outcome whereby the proper determination of a majority of members of this House is not put into the law of the land. That is why I am moving this recommittal motion.


I am frankly surprised that the Manager of Opposition Business is not simply supporting this. We had very clear discussions, which included the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Lyne and others, about the circumstances in which this could occur. We explicitly discussed that an explanation should be given to the parliament of why people have missed a division. Today, as part of the budget process, the Treasurer addressed the National Press Club in the Great Hall of Parliament. This is a procedure that in the past has occurred at the National Press Club but in recent times has been moved to the Great Hall in order to accommodate the numbers of members of the community who want to participate. There were four government members—the member for Chifley, the member for Eden-Monaro, the member for Moreton and the member for Brand—who attended that function where the bells did not ring because they were turned off, one would assume as a result of the fact that it was broadcast live as a National Press Club activity. It was unfortunate—and I have communicated to the four members, very directly, that they were perhaps amiss in absenting themselves from that division—but it clearly falls within the parameters which were envisaged.


In addition to this, the member for New England was in the Senate where he did not hear the bells. He also expected to vote in that division. I, of course, am not in a position to communicate in the same direct way with the member for New England as I do with my friends and colleagues on the Labor benches but in terms of—




Mrs Mirabella:
  You should be nicer to him!




Mr ALBANESE:
  You should try it sometime, I say to the member for Indi. She is on to us! I am nice to the member for New England because he is a good bloke.


We have circumstances here that are precisely those circumstances that were envisaged, covered and signed off in the agreement for parliamentary reform. They are covered by the standing orders before the parliament and, in terms of process, we should really not be wasting the parliament's time. There should be an automatic recommittal as long as people are prepared to put on the record the reason for their absence. I have done that in an appropriate way on behalf of the five members who were absent from the division. It is appropriate that that be done but these are circumstances which are clearly understandable given the fact that, if you are in this building, it is a normal expectation that you will hear the bells ring. 


It is also the case, in terms of the procedure, that the standing order which is relevant—standing order 132—was unanimously adopted by this House. No-one has said that it should not be so. No-one has said that it is inappropriate. Indeed, I am somewhat surprised because I expected this would happen automatically. The Manager of Opposition Business knows that if you have a majority for a particular proposition you can achieve an outcome—so it can be done more quickly or it can be done more slowly, in terms of the process, if you have a majority.


In terms of this legislation the opposition amendment does not have a majority of members of the House of Representatives and the bill does have majority support of the House of Representatives. If those are the circumstances and you have support for that, then we can either do it the easier way or do it in a much more prolonged way to achieve the same outcome. That is why the standing orders reflect this change. I commend the motion to the House.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (17:15):  The relevant section of the standing order that deals with the recommittal of motions is section 132(b) of the standing orders, which states:


If a division has miscarried through misadventure caused by a Member being accidentally absent or some similar incident, any Member may move, without notice and without the need for a seconder, 'That standing orders be suspended to enable the House to divide again'.


That is what the Leader of the House has done. That standing order is designed to ensure that, if a member is unable to be present for a serious reason, the House will recommit in good faith a vote to reflect the wishes of the House. When this matter was debated in 2010 by me, the crossbenchers and the Leader of the House we envisaged that such occasions were when a member had a very unfortunate health incident that caused them not to be able to get here, when they might be locked inadvertently in a room in the building and not be able to escape, and when they might have had a family emergency which caused them to not be able to leave their office or attend the chamber. But it did not envisage, in this case, three members being in the Great Hall having lunch, listening to the Treasurer's National Press Club speech; not having taken their pagers with them, which all members are supposed to carry at all times; not keeping their eye on the coloured lights in the building that are designed to alert us when a division occurs; and a fourth member who was simply doing a radio interview and did not want to be interrupted. A cabinet minister, the Minister for Resources and Energy, did not want to interrupt a radio interview to vote in the House on behalf of his party.


The member for Eden-Monaro, the member for Chifley and the member for Moreton were just having lunch, on the people's time, at the National Press Club address in the Great Hall and they did not want to be interrupted. They wanted to hang around the Treasurer and listen to his speech. They did not want to come into the chamber and vote on a very important bill.


So the opposition is not of a mind to support the suspension of standing orders because we expect members of parliament, when they are in this building, to be aware of what is happening in the chamber. There may be only five weeks left of this parliament and members might be looking for another job if they are going to lose their seats or they might be planning what they will do in the 44th Parliament. But they are still required, five weeks from the end of this parliamentary sitting period, to keep an eye on what is going on in this chamber, especially on important bills. If any members had a health issue, a family emergency or been inadvertently imprisoned in the building, then of course the opposition would have been more than happy to recommit this motion. But none of those things occurred. Instead, three of the members were lunching in the Great Hall, a few hundred metres from where we stand today. Other members of parliament who were at the same luncheon had no difficulty in getting to the chamber. They were carrying their pagers, watching the lights. Many members of parliament even have their staff be aware of what is going on in the chamber so that if there is a division they can be alerted and make their way to the chamber.


You would think that the member for Brand, a cabinet minister, who is the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Small Business, and the member for Eden-Monaro, also a cabinet minister, who is the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, with their legions of staff, would have had at least one person in their office keeping an eye on the chamber so that their boss did not make a mistake and miss a vote.


Four members of the Labor Party could not be bothered turning up for a very important amendment, an amendment that requires three independent directors to be appointed to industry superannuation funds. The opposition likes this amendment. It is a good amendment and we are delighted that the parliament voted for it. It did not win by one vote; it won by four votes. It was a clear and emphatic victory: 72 to 68. This amendment improves the bill. Now that the amendment has been carried by a democratic vote of the House, it should be put to the parliament as the final bill and should be carried in the best interests of industry super funds.


The opposition will not be supporting the suspension of standing orders. It is important for the House tonight that the parliament gets 76 votes for this amendment to be recommitted. One member of the government is not able to be here for very good reason. Of course, as you would expect, he has been paired by the opposition, in tragic circumstances. But one of our members on this side of the House, the member for Fairfax, went home this afternoon, in Canberra, because he is ill and the government has broken the pair.



Mr Albanese interjecting—




Mr PYNE:
  You should check with your chief whip, such as he is! He could not keep his own whip in the House. The member for Moreton is a recently appointed whip and he could not even be in the House for a vote. That is who the caucus voted for.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  Order! Could I remind members that the discussion is through the chair, not between one another.




Mr PYNE:
  The minister for tertiary education is paired with another member of the opposition and arrangements had been made for another member of the opposition well in advance of this vote. The government does not get to choose our pairs. The simple truth is: the minister for tertiary education is paired with another member of the opposition in a longstanding arrangement made today and we are not breaking that pair, because our view is that that would be the wrong thing to do. But the government is breaking the pair with this side of the House when one of our members, the member for Fairfax, is ill.



Mr Albanese interjecting—




Mr PYNE:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, should I respond to him or will you ask him to—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The chamber is far too noisy. 




Mr PYNE:
  It is. You are in charge of it, Mr Deputy Speaker. You should get him back to order.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I ask members to resist from interjecting across the chamber. The member for Sturt has the call.




Mr PYNE:
  I would urge the Leader of the House to speak to his chief whip, who I think is the member for Werriwa, and ask him if it is true that the government intends to break the pair for the member for Fairfax in order to achieve 76 votes. The Independents need to think very carefully whether they are prepared to sign up to the government breaking the pair of the member for Fairfax, who is ill and has returned home, by all voting with the government to recommit this bill. The right thing to do if they had any integrity at all would be for one of them to absent themselves from that vote or vote with the opposition to ensure that the member for Fairfax is paired. If the crossbenchers were acting with integrity, one of them would pair themselves with Alex Somlyay, the member for Fairfax—




Mr Oakeshott:
  After three years of no pairs! That is golden!




Mr PYNE:
  That is your problem, mate, not mine. They would pair themselves with the member for Fairfax to ensure that his vote is not counted on the side of the government in spite of the fact that he is not well enough to be here. So I call on one of them to do it—not necessarily the two in the chamber; maybe the member for New England. Obviously the member for Lyne is showing his true colours. But there are others: the member for Denison, the member for Kennedy, the member for Melbourne, the member for Fisher. They may well want to pair themselves with the member for Fairfax in order to ensure that this vote is not counted, because he has returned home. He is ill. He is incapable of being here, and the government has broken that pair in order to ensure that they get to 76 votes. I ask them to think very carefully about doing that.


The opposition will not support the suspension of standing orders. We support the bill and the amendment that has been made, moved by the shadow minister for small business, the member for Dunkley. We believe that a vote should be recommitted on the basis that a member has missed the vote for a very serious reason. In this case four members of the Labor government did not miss it for a very serious reason, and so I urge the House to reject the suspension of standing orders and one of the crossbenchers to do the right thing and absent themselves from the vote in order to ensure that the member for Fairfax is correctly paired.

"Oakeshott, Robert, MP",Ind.,2013-05-15,"



Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (17:24):  To start on the issue of pairing, which has very little to do with this debate and this suspension of standing orders: I have given it due consideration from my perspective, and the answer is no. The answer, very simply, is no because for three years the question of pairing of crossbenchers has been a very real issue within a parliament where all members surely should be entitled to the same rights. At times when requests for family reasons, for health reasons and for any number of reasons that pairing exists for members of political parties, that pairing arrangement has been denied. So it is a little bit rich for the Manager of Opposition Business now, when it is convenient for the claim being made under this debate of section 132, to make a request to the good conscience of the crossbench to stand by and do the right thing on pairing arrangements which for crossbenchers effectively do not exist. I say: welcome to our world. From my point of view, no pairing arrangements exist.


On the issue of section 132 for the shadow minister in the chair and for all members of this chamber: thank goodness that three years ago there was some foresight that in a parliament like this accidents would happen. This is the second such example where this has happened, the first time over a year ago when the member for Cowper had a piece of legislation to do with bats at one of his local schools. I think it was the Maclean High School that had some bats coming in. He was putting through a private member's bill from an opposition position in this parliament and I think was successful in getting that piece of legislation through this chamber. That is something for reflection for all members in this chamber: anyone can stump up and put a good idea into this chamber and on merit be successful. But there was an issue of a member of parliament being accidentally absent and a tied vote. The record was corrected under section 132.


So the events of today are not unusual. They have happened before and were dealt with in a sensible way to the benefit of the opposition in the passing of an amendment to a piece of legislation carried through this chamber by a private member, the member for Cowper. Now, again, because it is not convenient for the Manager of Opposition Business, we seem to be arguing the toss over some very clear wording from section 132 and from those discussions with foresight—and with a little group hug at the end—from the very start of this parliament. That foresight was to recognise that in an incredibly tight parliament people will miss votes and, if we are going to reflect the true will of the House, there is going to be a moment where you have to correct people who are absent or who accidentally miss votes. It is incorrect for the reinterpretation of history from those discussions to be that it was only for health, for family, for sickness or—I enjoyed this one—for inadvertent imprisonment in the parliamentary precinct. If that were the case, it would have been explicit in those terms in section 132. It was purposely kept loose and broad as 'accidentally absent or some similar incident'. That is a pretty broad and loose definition, in a lively working parliament, of pretty well any series of events that happen by accident, without intention and maybe leading to the true will of the House not being reflected in a vote. So 132 is very clear.



Another point of interest for the walk down memory lane is that this was actually the one point of dispute in the parliamentary agreement reached across party lines making its way into the standing orders. Yes, we lost a whole range of issues— (Time expired)

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (17:56):  It is a great pleasure to speak on this bill. The bill contains two separate measures. The first part of the bill implements recommendations that have been made by Joint Task Force Polaris and the parliamentary joint committee on law enforcement's report following its inquiry into the adequacy of aviation and maritime security measures to combat serious and organised crime. The second part of the bill will remove a prohibition on the Deputy Speaker of the House and the Deputy Speaker of the Senate being members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity.


I will speak about those measures shortly, although relatively briefly. However, I first want to touch on an issue that this bill covers, and that is the very serious issue of organised criminal activity on our wharves and at our airports. The opposition believes that law and order should be a significant national priority. Unfortunately the government does not share this view and they have systematically attacked Australia's law enforcement capabilities since they came to government. We have seen latterly a road to Damascus style version, where the Prime Minister certainly believes that law and order should be a significant national priority. She has gone out into Western Sydney with her minister and announced some measures that they are taking to involve the Commonwealth more in this area. Unfortunately the record of the Labor Party since they came to office has been to systematically attack and degrade the Commonwealth's law enforcement capabilities in a way that I want to outline before I move onto the actual substantive part of the bill.


It is unfortunate that the budget cuts that have been inflicted on our law enforcement and border enforcement agencies are going to have the result of giving criminals a better chance of getting guns and drugs onto our streets. This has been compounded thanks to the reduction in funding and personnel to law enforcement bodies such as the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the Australian Federal Police. This government has savaged Customs in particular, the agency tasked with stopping illegal goods flowing through our borders. Astonishingly, after a record of five budgets that have attacked the Commonwealth's law enforcement capability in every single Commonwealth law enforcement agency, we saw again last night the Labor Party attacking our law enforcement capabilities. They again savaged the Australian Crime Commission, Customs and the Australian Federal Police. Last night's budget confirmed what we already knew: that this government is not pulling its weight in this area. In fact, they have gone out of their way to systematically degrade the Commonwealth's ability to help states in their joint law and order responsibilities.


I will firstly deal with the police. Under the former coalition government the Australian Federal Police saw an increase in its staffing numbers from 2,000 to 6,000. But over the past three Labor budgets, including the one delivered last night, the Gillard government has axed a whopping $309 million from Australian Federal Police funding, at a time when we have violence and gun crime plaguing our streets. In the 2012-13 budget, Labor froze the use of the $58.3 million taken directly from criminals under the proceeds of crime laws to prop up its precarious budget position.


Before the Labor Party came to office in 2007, they had actually promised to increase AFP ranks by 500 operational AFP officers over five years, starting in January 2008. This commitment has not boosted AFP numbers in real terms, as there have been at least 249 AFP redundancies since the Labor Party came to office. Now, because of the budget cuts that have been inflicted on the Australian Federal Police, we in the opposition get anecdotal reports about the effect this is having on the ability of the AFP to do their job. There is no doubt that the cuts to the AFP are particularly hampering their ability to fight crime. We have heard of ludicrous things such as crime scene investigators being forced to bring their own notepads and pens to crime scenes. We are aware that our officers who are serving overseas, doing very difficult work on behalf of our country, are in line to have their pay cut. This is a sorry state of affairs for an agency that was at its peak under the Howard government. It has been stripped back to bare bones since the Labor Party came to office. This is particularly galling in an environment where government spending has been so dramatically increased over the past five years.


The Australian Federal Police is not the agency that has been worst-affected by the Labor Party's savage cuts. Organised crime, which is a significant problem all over the country, is supposed to be tackled by the Commonwealth's most powerful law enforcement agency, the Australian Crime Commission. Tackling organised crime requires resources, expertise and cooperation; yet the ACC has been systematically attacked by the Labor Party. Last night's budget revealed that Labor has cut another $29 million from the ACC's budget, and 198 staff have been cut from the agency since Labor came to office. The ACC is not a large agency in terms of numbers; yet, astonishingly, since the Labor Party came to office they have cut 40 per cent of their personnel. That is 40 per cent of the personnel of our most powerful law enforcement agency, yet the Prime Minister and her minister have the gall to pretend that they are interested in the Commonwealth's law enforcement capabilities. Fighting organised crime cannot be achieved when our most powerful crime-fighting agency has been so significantly downsized, and clearly it has been sidetracked from the main game.


The Labor Party's apathy and, indeed, outright hostility to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies has also significantly affected the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Clearly the work of this agency goes hand in hand with the work of other law enforcement agencies. Customs have a very important role to play in stopping illegal goods, such as guns and drugs, from crossing through our ports and airports and arriving on our streets. At the moment it is very difficult for them to do that job properly. They are plagued by instances of corruption, and cuts to the ability of Customs to screen cargo—to the tune of $58 million since the Labor Party came to office—have given organised criminal syndicates a leg-up in their ability to bring contraband into Australia. It has taken the Labor Party a long time to admit that there are cases of corruption within Customs. This government simply does not subscribe to the tenet of a strong law enforcement regime and a strong border protection system. 


I was astonished last night when I was going through the budget papers to see that Customs has been dealt yet another blow—another $61.4 million cut to their overall budget and another 120 staff stripped from the agency at a time when they are already stretched beyond capacity due to previous budget cuts and also Labor's self-induced border protection crisis. Customs is not a particularly large agency. At its peak under the Howard government, it had about 5,800 people. Since the Labor Party came to office they have slashed 870 personnel from Customs, and those cuts are having a very savage impact on the ability of that agency to do what we expect it to do, which is to protect our borders. Customs is very much a victim of the Labor Party's fiscal mismanagement.


Given the fact that the Labor Party have such a dismal record on the Commonwealth's law enforcement capability, that is the background that we must take into consideration when we consider the measures that are contained within this bill. They are sensible measures, but, unfortunately, they come against the backdrop of the fact that the Labor Party has shown apathy and complete disregard for the ability of the Commonwealth to do its bit to fight crime in Australia.


I want to outline the key measures contained within this bill, which aims to strengthen security at our wharves and at our airports. The bill will amend the Customs Act 1901 to: include tests used to determine whether a person is 'fit and proper' to hold an ASIC or MSIC, the passes that control access to the secure environments at our airports and at our ports; impose new obligations on cargo terminal operators and cargo handlers, and provide powers to monitor and enforce compliance with those obligations; insert new offences relating to the misuse of customs information; enable the details of an infringement notice scheme to be set out in regulations; apply strict liability to several existing offences and increase penalties for a range of existing strict liability offences; and make a range of other minor changes to the Customs Act. The bill will also amend the AusCheck Act 2007 to allow a person's ASIC or MSIC, or their application for such a card, to be suspended if the person has been charged with a 'serious offence'. It will also enable the AusCheck scheme to make provision for background checks to determine whether an individual has been charged with a serious offence, or whether a charge for a serious offence has been resolved in relation to the individual.


The second aspect to the bill—and this is entirely unrelated, yet it has been added on—relates to an amendment to the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006. This amendment will make the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Deputy President and Chair of Committees of the Senate eligible for appointment to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. This has been drawn to my attention by the Deputy President of the Senate, who, despite the fact that they have been subsequently deemed ineligible because of an oversight at reading the provisions of the existing act, has for many years actually been doing very good work on this committee, until it came to the committee secretariat's attention that they were not eligible to sit on it. The rationale for that is not clear, and subsequently the government moved, sensibly in this case, to ensure that that anomaly is addressed, and I thank them for doing so. This will allow Senator Parry, who is the Deputy President of the Senate, to continue his work on this committee. He has done very exceptional work on the combined law enforcement committee of the parliament. In conjunction with his counterparts in the government, that committee does exceptionally good work. Indeed, some of the recommendations contained within this bill are a direct result of the deliberations of the law enforcement committee. So I thank the government for the speedy resolution to this matter, which is clearly just a rather strange anomaly.


This bill will implement a range of measures that are designed to better protect Australia's cargo supply chain from infiltration by organised crime and also increase the efficiency of the customs penalty regime. It is unfortunate that the process of implementing these measures has taken longer than it should have, particularly given that the parliamentary joint committee's report that I referred to earlier was released in June 2011. It has not quite been explained why it has taken the government so long to respond to what was an excellent report from that committee. The recommendations of Task Force Polaris—the minister has eluded many times to the good that they have done—were handed down over a year ago. Clearly, if the minister were to add more meat to the rhetoric of being serious about tackling organised crime, he would have sought to implement these recommendations sooner. He would have done a far better job of protecting the agencies that are under his control from the savagery of the budget cuts that the Labor Party has inflicted on them, including, astonishingly, further cuts that were revealed last night.


Despite the failure of the Labor Party to protect the agencies that this bill affects, the coalition does support the measures contained within the bill to strengthen powers of those agencies to regulate the aviation and maritime security environment in this country. So this bill enjoys the support of the opposition, although we do so while noting the fact that the Commonwealth law enforcement capabilities have been savagely attacked by the Labor Party. If they were serious about law and order issues, they would ensure that the Commonwealth law enforcement agencies were properly resourced—sadly, something that is not happening at the moment.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Cabinet Secretary) (18:09):  In July 2010 the government established Task Force Polaris—a joint law enforcement task force targeting organised crime on the waterfront and in the cargo supply chain in Sydney. This task force, as the shadow minister has just mentioned, has been very successful: it has now made 39 arrests, laid 190 charges and seized over 12 tonnes of illicit substances and precursor chemicals.


Last year I announced major reforms to crack down on organised crime in the cargo system. An important part of that is expanding the work of Task Force Polaris from Sydney to Melbourne and Brisbane. In the budget that was tabled last night, it includes something in the order of $5.6 million to expand the work of this task force to Melbourne and to Brisbane.


In Brisbane it will be called Task Force Jericho, and officers from the Australian Federal Police and Customs have begun setting it up and it will roll out in the middle of this year. In Melbourne the task force is called Trident and it has now been established with the Victorian police.


Since it was established in July of last year, Task Force Trident has already executed 71 search warrants and made 13 arrests, including the arrest of a suspect involved in the importation of over 300 kilos of liquid methamphetamine.


Task Force Trident also disrupted an intended importation of 200 kilos of methamphetamine and seized 25 kilos of methamphetamine, 130 tonnes of tobacco, a commercial quantity of cocaine and a number of other prohibited items. In the short time that it has been established, the value of this task force is already being demonstrated. I should add: this is replacing a task force that was shut down by the former government.


The rollout of these task forces is just one of the reforms this government has driven to make it harder for organised crime to infiltrate and exploit the cargo system. We have already implemented a number of non-legislative reforms to harden the cargo supply chain, including: changes to the integrated cargo system to limit access to specific cargo information, strengthening licence conditions on key participants in the trading system, and    increasing the number of targeted patrols of the waterfront.


This bill implements further important reforms. First, the bill places new obligations on cargo terminal operators and people who load and unload cargo, which are similar to those that the Customs Act imposes on holders of depot and warehouse licences. These obligations include mandatory reporting of unlawful activity as well as fit and proper person checks at the request of Customs and Border Protection. Second, it creates new offences for obtaining and using restricted information, including information from the integrated cargo system, to commit an offence and for unlawfully disclosing that restricted information. Third, it gives the Chief Executive Officer of Customs the power to impose new licence conditions at any time and make it an offence to breach certain licence conditions. This brings the Customs broker licensing scheme into line with other Customs licensing schemes. Fourth, the bill amends the AusCheck Act 2007 to enable an ASIC or MSIC to be suspended if the cardholder has been charged with a serious offence.


These amendments recognise the fact that the presence of high-risk individuals in the aviation and maritime environments can facilitate large-scale criminal activity and result in significant harm and losses to the Australian community and economy.


The current ASIC and MSIC regimes provide for the cancellation of an ASIC or MSIC where the holder is convicted of and sentenced to imprisonment for an aviation or maritime security related offence. The bill introduces the capacity for AusCheck to suspend the person's ASIC or MSIC or the processing of an application for an ASIC or MSIC if the person is charged with a serious offence. This measure has been developed based on the advice of the Australian Federal Police. The government will continue to consult with law enforcement agencies and stakeholders about the offences to be listed and will be prescribed by regulation.


Finally, the bill amends the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act, which establishes the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. The bill repeals provisions that prevent the deputy presiding officers from being appointed to that committee. It provides the parliament with greater discretion when appointing members to this important committee and makes membership eligibility consistent with parliamentary committees' similar functions.


I have made it clear that I am serious about making sure that our law enforcement agencies have got the powers and the tools that they need to target organised crime, whether that is on the border or on the street. When organised criminals penetrate the system, they can cause enormous damage. This bill, and other measures that the government is implementing—like the establishment of a National Border Targeting Centre—are designed to give our law enforcement agencies the powers they need to stop organised crime penetrating the system. It is an ongoing battle and more reform is required. As I have said in this place on a number of occasions, that also requires and demands national anti-gang laws and national unexplained wealth laws.


We need to give police more power to seize the assets of serious organised criminals. The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police has made that point recently. He said that our current laws in this area are not effective and national unexplained wealth laws are in the national interest. The Australian Crime Commission has estimated that 72 organised crime targets each generated $10 million or more in illicit profits over the past two years and six of these individuals had an estimated value of illicit profits of over $100 million each.


Both sides of politics have called for national laws in bipartisan recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement in this area, but it has been rejected on a number of occasions by the states and territories. That is why the Prime Minister placed this issue on the agenda at COAG in April. Unfortunately, at that meeting, the states and territories did not agree to reform. That is a disappointing decision; it is the wrong decision. We need these laws, and the longer we wait the more money criminals will make. If we are serious about tackling organised crime, then we need national anti-gang laws and we need national unexplained wealth laws. That is what this parliament has called for—what both sides of this parliament have called for—it is what the Police Federation of Australia has called for and it is what every police commissioner in the country is calling for. We need state governments to support this and give us these powers to create these new laws and I will continue to prosecute the case for them. In the meantime, I comment this bill to the House.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (17:56):  It is a great pleasure to speak on this bill. The bill contains two separate measures. The first part of the bill implements recommendations that have been made by Joint Task Force Polaris and the parliamentary joint committee on law enforcement's report following its inquiry into the adequacy of aviation and maritime security measures to combat serious and organised crime. The second part of the bill will remove a prohibition on the Deputy Speaker of the House and the Deputy Speaker of the Senate being members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity.


I will speak about those measures shortly, although relatively briefly. However, I first want to touch on an issue that this bill covers, and that is the very serious issue of organised criminal activity on our wharves and at our airports. The opposition believes that law and order should be a significant national priority. Unfortunately the government does not share this view and they have systematically attacked Australia's law enforcement capabilities since they came to government. We have seen latterly a road to Damascus style version, where the Prime Minister certainly believes that law and order should be a significant national priority. She has gone out into Western Sydney with her minister and announced some measures that they are taking to involve the Commonwealth more in this area. Unfortunately the record of the Labor Party since they came to office has been to systematically attack and degrade the Commonwealth's law enforcement capabilities in a way that I want to outline before I move onto the actual substantive part of the bill.


It is unfortunate that the budget cuts that have been inflicted on our law enforcement and border enforcement agencies are going to have the result of giving criminals a better chance of getting guns and drugs onto our streets. This has been compounded thanks to the reduction in funding and personnel to law enforcement bodies such as the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the Australian Federal Police. This government has savaged Customs in particular, the agency tasked with stopping illegal goods flowing through our borders. Astonishingly, after a record of five budgets that have attacked the Commonwealth's law enforcement capability in every single Commonwealth law enforcement agency, we saw again last night the Labor Party attacking our law enforcement capabilities. They again savaged the Australian Crime Commission, Customs and the Australian Federal Police. Last night's budget confirmed what we already knew: that this government is not pulling its weight in this area. In fact, they have gone out of their way to systematically degrade the Commonwealth's ability to help states in their joint law and order responsibilities.


I will firstly deal with the police. Under the former coalition government the Australian Federal Police saw an increase in its staffing numbers from 2,000 to 6,000. But over the past three Labor budgets, including the one delivered last night, the Gillard government has axed a whopping $309 million from Australian Federal Police funding, at a time when we have violence and gun crime plaguing our streets. In the 2012-13 budget, Labor froze the use of the $58.3 million taken directly from criminals under the proceeds of crime laws to prop up its precarious budget position.


Before the Labor Party came to office in 2007, they had actually promised to increase AFP ranks by 500 operational AFP officers over five years, starting in January 2008. This commitment has not boosted AFP numbers in real terms, as there have been at least 249 AFP redundancies since the Labor Party came to office. Now, because of the budget cuts that have been inflicted on the Australian Federal Police, we in the opposition get anecdotal reports about the effect this is having on the ability of the AFP to do their job. There is no doubt that the cuts to the AFP are particularly hampering their ability to fight crime. We have heard of ludicrous things such as crime scene investigators being forced to bring their own notepads and pens to crime scenes. We are aware that our officers who are serving overseas, doing very difficult work on behalf of our country, are in line to have their pay cut. This is a sorry state of affairs for an agency that was at its peak under the Howard government. It has been stripped back to bare bones since the Labor Party came to office. This is particularly galling in an environment where government spending has been so dramatically increased over the past five years.


The Australian Federal Police is not the agency that has been worst-affected by the Labor Party's savage cuts. Organised crime, which is a significant problem all over the country, is supposed to be tackled by the Commonwealth's most powerful law enforcement agency, the Australian Crime Commission. Tackling organised crime requires resources, expertise and cooperation; yet the ACC has been systematically attacked by the Labor Party. Last night's budget revealed that Labor has cut another $29 million from the ACC's budget, and 198 staff have been cut from the agency since Labor came to office. The ACC is not a large agency in terms of numbers; yet, astonishingly, since the Labor Party came to office they have cut 40 per cent of their personnel. That is 40 per cent of the personnel of our most powerful law enforcement agency, yet the Prime Minister and her minister have the gall to pretend that they are interested in the Commonwealth's law enforcement capabilities. Fighting organised crime cannot be achieved when our most powerful crime-fighting agency has been so significantly downsized, and clearly it has been sidetracked from the main game.


The Labor Party's apathy and, indeed, outright hostility to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies has also significantly affected the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Clearly the work of this agency goes hand in hand with the work of other law enforcement agencies. Customs have a very important role to play in stopping illegal goods, such as guns and drugs, from crossing through our ports and airports and arriving on our streets. At the moment it is very difficult for them to do that job properly. They are plagued by instances of corruption, and cuts to the ability of Customs to screen cargo—to the tune of $58 million since the Labor Party came to office—have given organised criminal syndicates a leg-up in their ability to bring contraband into Australia. It has taken the Labor Party a long time to admit that there are cases of corruption within Customs. This government simply does not subscribe to the tenet of a strong law enforcement regime and a strong border protection system. 


I was astonished last night when I was going through the budget papers to see that Customs has been dealt yet another blow—another $61.4 million cut to their overall budget and another 120 staff stripped from the agency at a time when they are already stretched beyond capacity due to previous budget cuts and also Labor's self-induced border protection crisis. Customs is not a particularly large agency. At its peak under the Howard government, it had about 5,800 people. Since the Labor Party came to office they have slashed 870 personnel from Customs, and those cuts are having a very savage impact on the ability of that agency to do what we expect it to do, which is to protect our borders. Customs is very much a victim of the Labor Party's fiscal mismanagement.


Given the fact that the Labor Party have such a dismal record on the Commonwealth's law enforcement capability, that is the background that we must take into consideration when we consider the measures that are contained within this bill. They are sensible measures, but, unfortunately, they come against the backdrop of the fact that the Labor Party has shown apathy and complete disregard for the ability of the Commonwealth to do its bit to fight crime in Australia.


I want to outline the key measures contained within this bill, which aims to strengthen security at our wharves and at our airports. The bill will amend the Customs Act 1901 to: include tests used to determine whether a person is 'fit and proper' to hold an ASIC or MSIC, the passes that control access to the secure environments at our airports and at our ports; impose new obligations on cargo terminal operators and cargo handlers, and provide powers to monitor and enforce compliance with those obligations; insert new offences relating to the misuse of customs information; enable the details of an infringement notice scheme to be set out in regulations; apply strict liability to several existing offences and increase penalties for a range of existing strict liability offences; and make a range of other minor changes to the Customs Act. The bill will also amend the AusCheck Act 2007 to allow a person's ASIC or MSIC, or their application for such a card, to be suspended if the person has been charged with a 'serious offence'. It will also enable the AusCheck scheme to make provision for background checks to determine whether an individual has been charged with a serious offence, or whether a charge for a serious offence has been resolved in relation to the individual.


The second aspect to the bill—and this is entirely unrelated, yet it has been added on—relates to an amendment to the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006. This amendment will make the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Deputy President and Chair of Committees of the Senate eligible for appointment to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. This has been drawn to my attention by the Deputy President of the Senate, who, despite the fact that they have been subsequently deemed ineligible because of an oversight at reading the provisions of the existing act, has for many years actually been doing very good work on this committee, until it came to the committee secretariat's attention that they were not eligible to sit on it. The rationale for that is not clear, and subsequently the government moved, sensibly in this case, to ensure that that anomaly is addressed, and I thank them for doing so. This will allow Senator Parry, who is the Deputy President of the Senate, to continue his work on this committee. He has done very exceptional work on the combined law enforcement committee of the parliament. In conjunction with his counterparts in the government, that committee does exceptionally good work. Indeed, some of the recommendations contained within this bill are a direct result of the deliberations of the law enforcement committee. So I thank the government for the speedy resolution to this matter, which is clearly just a rather strange anomaly.


This bill will implement a range of measures that are designed to better protect Australia's cargo supply chain from infiltration by organised crime and also increase the efficiency of the customs penalty regime. It is unfortunate that the process of implementing these measures has taken longer than it should have, particularly given that the parliamentary joint committee's report that I referred to earlier was released in June 2011. It has not quite been explained why it has taken the government so long to respond to what was an excellent report from that committee. The recommendations of Task Force Polaris—the minister has eluded many times to the good that they have done—were handed down over a year ago. Clearly, if the minister were to add more meat to the rhetoric of being serious about tackling organised crime, he would have sought to implement these recommendations sooner. He would have done a far better job of protecting the agencies that are under his control from the savagery of the budget cuts that the Labor Party has inflicted on them, including, astonishingly, further cuts that were revealed last night.


Despite the failure of the Labor Party to protect the agencies that this bill affects, the coalition does support the measures contained within the bill to strengthen powers of those agencies to regulate the aviation and maritime security environment in this country. So this bill enjoys the support of the opposition, although we do so while noting the fact that the Commonwealth law enforcement capabilities have been savagely attacked by the Labor Party. If they were serious about law and order issues, they would ensure that the Commonwealth law enforcement agencies were properly resourced—sadly, something that is not happening at the moment.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Cabinet Secretary) (18:09):  In July 2010 the government established Task Force Polaris—a joint law enforcement task force targeting organised crime on the waterfront and in the cargo supply chain in Sydney. This task force, as the shadow minister has just mentioned, has been very successful: it has now made 39 arrests, laid 190 charges and seized over 12 tonnes of illicit substances and precursor chemicals.


Last year I announced major reforms to crack down on organised crime in the cargo system. An important part of that is expanding the work of Task Force Polaris from Sydney to Melbourne and Brisbane. In the budget that was tabled last night, it includes something in the order of $5.6 million to expand the work of this task force to Melbourne and to Brisbane.


In Brisbane it will be called Task Force Jericho, and officers from the Australian Federal Police and Customs have begun setting it up and it will roll out in the middle of this year. In Melbourne the task force is called Trident and it has now been established with the Victorian police.


Since it was established in July of last year, Task Force Trident has already executed 71 search warrants and made 13 arrests, including the arrest of a suspect involved in the importation of over 300 kilos of liquid methamphetamine.


Task Force Trident also disrupted an intended importation of 200 kilos of methamphetamine and seized 25 kilos of methamphetamine, 130 tonnes of tobacco, a commercial quantity of cocaine and a number of other prohibited items. In the short time that it has been established, the value of this task force is already being demonstrated. I should add: this is replacing a task force that was shut down by the former government.


The rollout of these task forces is just one of the reforms this government has driven to make it harder for organised crime to infiltrate and exploit the cargo system. We have already implemented a number of non-legislative reforms to harden the cargo supply chain, including: changes to the integrated cargo system to limit access to specific cargo information, strengthening licence conditions on key participants in the trading system, and    increasing the number of targeted patrols of the waterfront.


This bill implements further important reforms. First, the bill places new obligations on cargo terminal operators and people who load and unload cargo, which are similar to those that the Customs Act imposes on holders of depot and warehouse licences. These obligations include mandatory reporting of unlawful activity as well as fit and proper person checks at the request of Customs and Border Protection. Second, it creates new offences for obtaining and using restricted information, including information from the integrated cargo system, to commit an offence and for unlawfully disclosing that restricted information. Third, it gives the Chief Executive Officer of Customs the power to impose new licence conditions at any time and make it an offence to breach certain licence conditions. This brings the Customs broker licensing scheme into line with other Customs licensing schemes. Fourth, the bill amends the AusCheck Act 2007 to enable an ASIC or MSIC to be suspended if the cardholder has been charged with a serious offence.


These amendments recognise the fact that the presence of high-risk individuals in the aviation and maritime environments can facilitate large-scale criminal activity and result in significant harm and losses to the Australian community and economy.


The current ASIC and MSIC regimes provide for the cancellation of an ASIC or MSIC where the holder is convicted of and sentenced to imprisonment for an aviation or maritime security related offence. The bill introduces the capacity for AusCheck to suspend the person's ASIC or MSIC or the processing of an application for an ASIC or MSIC if the person is charged with a serious offence. This measure has been developed based on the advice of the Australian Federal Police. The government will continue to consult with law enforcement agencies and stakeholders about the offences to be listed and will be prescribed by regulation.


Finally, the bill amends the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act, which establishes the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. The bill repeals provisions that prevent the deputy presiding officers from being appointed to that committee. It provides the parliament with greater discretion when appointing members to this important committee and makes membership eligibility consistent with parliamentary committees' similar functions.


I have made it clear that I am serious about making sure that our law enforcement agencies have got the powers and the tools that they need to target organised crime, whether that is on the border or on the street. When organised criminals penetrate the system, they can cause enormous damage. This bill, and other measures that the government is implementing—like the establishment of a National Border Targeting Centre—are designed to give our law enforcement agencies the powers they need to stop organised crime penetrating the system. It is an ongoing battle and more reform is required. As I have said in this place on a number of occasions, that also requires and demands national anti-gang laws and national unexplained wealth laws.


We need to give police more power to seize the assets of serious organised criminals. The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police has made that point recently. He said that our current laws in this area are not effective and national unexplained wealth laws are in the national interest. The Australian Crime Commission has estimated that 72 organised crime targets each generated $10 million or more in illicit profits over the past two years and six of these individuals had an estimated value of illicit profits of over $100 million each.


Both sides of politics have called for national laws in bipartisan recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement in this area, but it has been rejected on a number of occasions by the states and territories. That is why the Prime Minister placed this issue on the agenda at COAG in April. Unfortunately, at that meeting, the states and territories did not agree to reform. That is a disappointing decision; it is the wrong decision. We need these laws, and the longer we wait the more money criminals will make. If we are serious about tackling organised crime, then we need national anti-gang laws and we need national unexplained wealth laws. That is what this parliament has called for—what both sides of this parliament have called for—it is what the Police Federation of Australia has called for and it is what every police commissioner in the country is calling for. We need state governments to support this and give us these powers to create these new laws and I will continue to prosecute the case for them. In the meantime, I comment this bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (18:19):  This parliament has a shared commitment to a better deal for Australians with a disability. In the words of the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, 'the NDIS is an idea whose time has come'. All in this chamber know that the system of support for Australians with a disability is broken. The level of support a person with a disability receives can depend on a number of factors: what state they live in, whether the disability is congenital or was acquired and, if acquired, whether it was in the workplace, a motor vehicle accident or some other context. Workers compensation and motor vehicle accident insurance provide coverage in some states, but if you are born with a disability or acquire a disability later in life it can be a different story: waiting lists and queues. The result is that many people with a disability are left without the assistance that they need. So we need a new system of support based on need rather than rationing, with the entitlement for support going to the individual. The individual needs to be at the centre and in charge, able to pick up the supports, aids, equipment and service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the Productivity Commission's landmark report into long-term care and support for people with a disability. This is the vision of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


It is important to note that this is also a shared vision of every government in Australia and every opposition in this country. The federal coalition, for its part, has enthusiastically supported each milestone on the road to the NDIS that has reflected the work of the Productivity Commission. We support the six launch sites. We welcome the agreements between the Commonwealth and the states and the territories for full jurisdiction-wide rollout. We support the NDIS Act passed in March. And Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, has demonstrated his personal commitment to Australians with disability by raising over $1.2 million through the 2012 and 2013 Pollie Pedal charity bike rides for Carers Australia. Each year, along the 1,000-kilometre routes, Mr Abbott has met with people with disability, carers and disability organisations—and I recall meetings on this year's Pollie Pedal in Mount Gambier and other places along the route, particularly with young carers, older carers and those caring for kin and other Australians. The next Pollie Pedal will also be in partnership with and raise funds once again for Carers Australia. This is not just a professional commitment on the part of the Leader of the Opposition, it is also personal.


All comments, questions and suggestions by the opposition in relation to the NDIS have been offered in a constructive spirit in an endeavour to help ensure that the NDIS is the best that it can be. The coalition has always stood ready to work with the government and see the NDIS delivered as soon as possible. The coalition believes that the full implementation of an NDIS would be nothing short of a new deal for people with disabilities and their carers. We have to get this right.


Because the NDIS is a once-in-a-generation reform that will unfold over the life of several parliaments, it should be the property of the parliament as a whole on behalf of the Australian people rather than any political party. To get this right will require a very high level of consultation and attention to detail, not just today, not just in the next few weeks or months, not just in the launch sites, but from now until full implementation. The coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. A parliamentary oversight committee would lock in all parties and provide a non-partisan environment where issues of design and eligibility could be worked through cooperatively. We believe that the government should accept this offer for a parliamentary oversight committee.


I reiterate that the coalition has supported the establishment of the National Disability Insurance Scheme every step of the way. We want the NDIS to be a success and we want it to belong to all Australians. It is too important to become a partisan football. We want to ensure that the NDIS is a reality as soon as possible and on a secure footing. The best guarantee for the NDIS in the long term is good economic management, good budget management and a government that prioritises and lives within its means. Economic policy and social policy are not alternatives. They are not in competition. You need a good economic policy to afford a good social policy.


The Productivity Commission, for its part, recommended that the NDIS be funded from consolidated revenue—core government business funded from core government revenue. Our view has long been that the problem under this government was not that Australians did not pay enough tax; rather, this government has not been a good steward of the ample taxes paid. We long predicted that the government's wrong priorities, waste and excessive spending would compromise their ability to fund the NDIS from consolidated revenue, as recommended by the Productivity Commission. Until a few weeks ago the Prime Minister was also of the view the NDIS should be funded from consolidated revenue. She categorically ruled out a levy or the need for one as recently as December. Instead, the Prime Minister found everything she could possibly find to spend money on and made no provision for the NDIS, hence the government's levy proposition in this bill.


Our view is straightforward. We did not propose a levy. There should not be the need for a levy. The government is only proposing a levy because they have blown the bank and failed to prioritise. We do not like tax increases but we do not think that Australians with disability should miss out on a better deal due to poor decisions by a bad government. That would not pass the fair-go test. Although this legislation will pass with our support, we view the Medicare levy increase as only a temporary measure until the budget has been repaired and is in strong surplus. 


Let me put our decision on the NDIS Medicare levy increase into a broader context. We know that the Productivity Commission did not recommend funding the NDIS through a new tax on Australians. We understand that many families in this country are doing it tough and that tax increases are an impost on the household budget. That is why we took our time and soberly considered the government's proposition rather than respond immediately. We know that Labor's mismanagement of the economy and the state of Labor's budget do not currently allow for the NDIS to be funded from consolidated revenue without further borrowings on top of already quite significant borrowings by this government. Australians with a disability and their carers want the confidence that the NDIS means a permanent change in the way that our country supports people with a disability. People with a disability should not have to wait any longer than is necessary for the support they need. So for these reasons, the coalition is prepared to support the government's proposed increase to the Medicare levy.


But it is important to recognise that the Medicare levy increase does not cover the full cost of the NDIS. The levy does not cover the difference between what governments currently spend on disability and the full cost of this new scheme. When you take into account the 25 per cent of levy proceeds that the Commonwealth will give to the states and territories for 10 years, the levy covers perhaps 40 per cent of the Commonwealth's required contribution to a NDIS over the longer term. So before this legislation passes both houses of this parliament, the government should outline how the remaining 60 per cent of funding will be provisioned.


Despite promising to do so on budget night, the government has failed to outline where the balance of the funds will come from beyond the NDIS launch period. On page 4 of the budget related paper DisabilityCare Australia there is a graph headed 'Meeting the costs of DisabilityCare Australia'. It covers the period 2012-13 to 2022-23. It purports to show full funding of the NDIS. It includes a category called 'Other long-term savings—selected long-term savings from 2013-14 Budget and 2012-13 MYEFO'. These are unnamed and unquantified savings that may well have been counted several times over for other purposes. What the graph does, however, prove is that beyond the launch phase the Medicare levy increase only covers 40 per cent of the Commonwealth's share of NDIS costs. The government has still to present its full funding plan for this scheme.


The NDIS is a venture of huge proportions. According to the Australian Government Actuary, the NDIS will, in full rollout, have a gross cost of $22 billion per annum and require, in complete form, an additional contribution from government of more than $10.5 billion beyond 2018-19. When such a call is being made on taxpayers, they are entitled to know exactly what the NDIS will achieve and who it will support. Before this legislation passes both houses, the government needs to be clear about all aspects of NDIS eligibility. Equally, the 400,000-plus people the Productivity Commission envisaged being supported by the NDIS are entitled to know what the gateway to the scheme is.


The gateway to the NDIS comprises a number of elements: the eligibility criteria in the NDIS Act; the NDIS regulations, known as the NDIS rules, only some of which have been released and only in draft form; the NDIS national assessment tools, which have not been publicly released. Only one of the gateway elements is fully and publicly available. Now this is against the backdrop of the Productivity Commission's blueprint having been in the hands of the government for two years, against the backdrop of a $22 billion scheme, against the backdrop of a new tax base which is being created in the form of the Medicare levy increase to part-fund the scheme and against the backdrop of the NDIS launch sites going live in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania in just six weeks time.


When the opposition indicated it would consider the increase to the Medicare levy, we said that first the government needed to introduce legislation to establish a fund in which levy proceeds would be held. The government has acceded to this request. Secondly, we said the government needed to legislate the Future Fund as guardians of this fund. Again, the government has acceded to this request. Thirdly, we said the government needed to release the final NDIS rules and the NDIS national assessment tools. This the government has refused to do. I repeat: we are talking about $22 billion of Australian taxpayers' money, a new tax base, launch sites going live in six weeks and the parliament and the nation not as yet—not of this evening—having before them the full details that will determine NDIS participation.


When the absence of the NDIS rules and the absence of the NDIS national assessment tools are raised with the government, they state that the eligibility criteria are in the NDIS Act. It is true that there is contained in the act a broad—indeed, a very broad—outline of the criteria to be an NDIS participant. And it is true that there are some draft rules which slightly expand on the criteria. But these are still extremely broad outlines of eligibility. It has been said by some that the opposition's desire to see the NDIS rules and the NDIS national assessment tools released is getting down into the weeds. But if you are an Australian with a significant disability, the rules and the assessment tools are not some theoretical mechanisms; they are elements that will combine to underpin your opportunities and quality of life.


The Prime Minister herself has said that people who want to know about eligibility should look at the NDIS Act. I cannot believe that the Prime Minister seriously expects Australians with disability to get  a copy of the act, grab a set of the draft and incomplete rules and then try and hunt down a copy of the as yet to be released assessment tools and then try and work out if they are in or out and what supports they may be entitled to. The final NDIS rules should be released. The NDIS national assessment tools should also be released. Wherever I go—and I know the feedback from my colleagues in this place is this—there is universal support for the NDIS, but there is also a real hunger for further information about eligibility and the sorts of therapies and supports that will be funded through the scheme. It is not premature for potential scheme participants or their families to be seeking this information.


Let me give just a few examples. For autism, early intervention is currently supported by the Commonwealth through the Helping Children with Autism program. The Productivity Commission envisaged, and the NDIS Act has provision for, early intervention services. It is assumed that the NDIS will supplant the Helping Children with Autism program. Parents of young children would like to know what this means for their children in terms of the level of NDIS early intervention supports but also the circumstances under which their children would qualify. If they do not, are there any other supports available? Surely these are very reasonable requests for information by people with children who have autism.


Let me take the example of supported accommodation. This is a concern for ageing parent carers who want to resolve accommodation for their adult children with intellectual impairment. Who will qualify? If qualified, and assuming there will be an adequate recurrent package, what will be the arrangement for capital to address the accommodation backlog? What will be the model? Again, these are eminently sensible and reasonable requests for information. Or take equipment. If you need a wheelchair, what level of cost will be covered? If your wheelchair costs, for example, $14,000, will you be covered for the full cost or only part? And, if so, what proportion? Once again these are entirely eminently sensible and reasonable requests for information which is currently not being provided. Or take hearing aids. These can range in cost from a few thousand dollars to in excess of $10,000. What will the NDIS deem to be reasonable and necessary? Again, this is a reasonable request for information. Or take support for blind and vision impaired people. Will the full cost of a guide dog be covered? How often? Will home modifications be covered? What will be considered reasonable and necessary? What will be the mechanisms to deliver supports to people with vision impairment over 65? Once again, these are very reasonable and understandable questions from people who find themselves in this situation seeking information—and the government should provide it soon.


At this point in time, developing a complete picture of how the NDIS will unfold is limited by insufficient information, examples of which I have just provided to the House. Neither the Senate committee that inquired into the NDIS Act nor the parliament tonight have had the benefit of the full NDIS rules or the national assessment tools in undertaking their due diligence. In the absence of these elements it is difficult to determine if the vision of the Productivity Commission is being fully given effect to. The risk, as always, with this government is their capacity to competently implement the scheme.


In conclusion, we will not frustrate this legislation; we will ensure its passage. However, we will not cease posing the questions being asked of us by Australians in general and our constituents with disability in particular. We will do so in order to ensure that the NDIS delivers on the vision of the Productivity Commission for a new deal for Australians with disability.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (18:37):  I would like to thank those members who have contributed to debate on these bills. These bills represent an historic step in the transformation of disability services in Australia. DisabilityCare Australia is the most fundamental social reform since the introduction of Medicare. These bills will lock in funding for DisabilityCare Australia, providing certainty and security for the 410,000 Australians with disability, their carers and their families. 


The Medicare Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill will increase the Medicare levy. From 1 July 2014 the Medicare levy will increase half a percentage point from 1½ per cent to two per cent. Every dollar raised from the increase in the Medicare levy will go directly to fund DisabilityCare Australia. This will provide a strong and stable funding stream. To assist the states and territories to fund their contribution to DisabilityCare Australia, the government will allocate them around $9.7 billion of the additional Medicare levy revenue over a 10-year period.


The DisabilityCare Australia Fund Bill establishes the DisabilityCare Australia Fund, which will hold and invest the revenue from the increase in Medicare levy. The fund will only be drawn down to make reimbursements to the Commonwealth and to the states and territories for expenditure directly related to DisabilityCare Australia. The bill also guarantees the share of the fund that will be made available to the states and territories. The DisabilityCare Australia Fund will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians, who have experience in successfully managing other government owned investment funds. The DisabilityCare Australia Fund Bill also contains amendments that deal with interim matters to enable DisabilityCare Australia to commence operations from 1 July 2013. 


The remainder of the bills being considered as part of this package contain consequential amendments that will increase the rates of other taxes that are linked to the Medicare levy. These changes will build a better life for Australians with significant and permanent disability. I commend the bills to the House.

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (18:19):  This parliament has a shared commitment to a better deal for Australians with a disability. In the words of the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, 'the NDIS is an idea whose time has come'. All in this chamber know that the system of support for Australians with a disability is broken. The level of support a person with a disability receives can depend on a number of factors: what state they live in, whether the disability is congenital or was acquired and, if acquired, whether it was in the workplace, a motor vehicle accident or some other context. Workers compensation and motor vehicle accident insurance provide coverage in some states, but if you are born with a disability or acquire a disability later in life it can be a different story: waiting lists and queues. The result is that many people with a disability are left without the assistance that they need. So we need a new system of support based on need rather than rationing, with the entitlement for support going to the individual. The individual needs to be at the centre and in charge, able to pick up the supports, aids, equipment and service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the Productivity Commission's landmark report into long-term care and support for people with a disability. This is the vision of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


It is important to note that this is also a shared vision of every government in Australia and every opposition in this country. The federal coalition, for its part, has enthusiastically supported each milestone on the road to the NDIS that has reflected the work of the Productivity Commission. We support the six launch sites. We welcome the agreements between the Commonwealth and the states and the territories for full jurisdiction-wide rollout. We support the NDIS Act passed in March. And Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, has demonstrated his personal commitment to Australians with disability by raising over $1.2 million through the 2012 and 2013 Pollie Pedal charity bike rides for Carers Australia. Each year, along the 1,000-kilometre routes, Mr Abbott has met with people with disability, carers and disability organisations—and I recall meetings on this year's Pollie Pedal in Mount Gambier and other places along the route, particularly with young carers, older carers and those caring for kin and other Australians. The next Pollie Pedal will also be in partnership with and raise funds once again for Carers Australia. This is not just a professional commitment on the part of the Leader of the Opposition, it is also personal.


All comments, questions and suggestions by the opposition in relation to the NDIS have been offered in a constructive spirit in an endeavour to help ensure that the NDIS is the best that it can be. The coalition has always stood ready to work with the government and see the NDIS delivered as soon as possible. The coalition believes that the full implementation of an NDIS would be nothing short of a new deal for people with disabilities and their carers. We have to get this right.


Because the NDIS is a once-in-a-generation reform that will unfold over the life of several parliaments, it should be the property of the parliament as a whole on behalf of the Australian people rather than any political party. To get this right will require a very high level of consultation and attention to detail, not just today, not just in the next few weeks or months, not just in the launch sites, but from now until full implementation. The coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. A parliamentary oversight committee would lock in all parties and provide a non-partisan environment where issues of design and eligibility could be worked through cooperatively. We believe that the government should accept this offer for a parliamentary oversight committee.


I reiterate that the coalition has supported the establishment of the National Disability Insurance Scheme every step of the way. We want the NDIS to be a success and we want it to belong to all Australians. It is too important to become a partisan football. We want to ensure that the NDIS is a reality as soon as possible and on a secure footing. The best guarantee for the NDIS in the long term is good economic management, good budget management and a government that prioritises and lives within its means. Economic policy and social policy are not alternatives. They are not in competition. You need a good economic policy to afford a good social policy.


The Productivity Commission, for its part, recommended that the NDIS be funded from consolidated revenue—core government business funded from core government revenue. Our view has long been that the problem under this government was not that Australians did not pay enough tax; rather, this government has not been a good steward of the ample taxes paid. We long predicted that the government's wrong priorities, waste and excessive spending would compromise their ability to fund the NDIS from consolidated revenue, as recommended by the Productivity Commission. Until a few weeks ago the Prime Minister was also of the view the NDIS should be funded from consolidated revenue. She categorically ruled out a levy or the need for one as recently as December. Instead, the Prime Minister found everything she could possibly find to spend money on and made no provision for the NDIS, hence the government's levy proposition in this bill.


Our view is straightforward. We did not propose a levy. There should not be the need for a levy. The government is only proposing a levy because they have blown the bank and failed to prioritise. We do not like tax increases but we do not think that Australians with disability should miss out on a better deal due to poor decisions by a bad government. That would not pass the fair-go test. Although this legislation will pass with our support, we view the Medicare levy increase as only a temporary measure until the budget has been repaired and is in strong surplus. 


Let me put our decision on the NDIS Medicare levy increase into a broader context. We know that the Productivity Commission did not recommend funding the NDIS through a new tax on Australians. We understand that many families in this country are doing it tough and that tax increases are an impost on the household budget. That is why we took our time and soberly considered the government's proposition rather than respond immediately. We know that Labor's mismanagement of the economy and the state of Labor's budget do not currently allow for the NDIS to be funded from consolidated revenue without further borrowings on top of already quite significant borrowings by this government. Australians with a disability and their carers want the confidence that the NDIS means a permanent change in the way that our country supports people with a disability. People with a disability should not have to wait any longer than is necessary for the support they need. So for these reasons, the coalition is prepared to support the government's proposed increase to the Medicare levy.


But it is important to recognise that the Medicare levy increase does not cover the full cost of the NDIS. The levy does not cover the difference between what governments currently spend on disability and the full cost of this new scheme. When you take into account the 25 per cent of levy proceeds that the Commonwealth will give to the states and territories for 10 years, the levy covers perhaps 40 per cent of the Commonwealth's required contribution to a NDIS over the longer term. So before this legislation passes both houses of this parliament, the government should outline how the remaining 60 per cent of funding will be provisioned.


Despite promising to do so on budget night, the government has failed to outline where the balance of the funds will come from beyond the NDIS launch period. On page 4 of the budget related paper DisabilityCare Australia there is a graph headed 'Meeting the costs of DisabilityCare Australia'. It covers the period 2012-13 to 2022-23. It purports to show full funding of the NDIS. It includes a category called 'Other long-term savings—selected long-term savings from 2013-14 Budget and 2012-13 MYEFO'. These are unnamed and unquantified savings that may well have been counted several times over for other purposes. What the graph does, however, prove is that beyond the launch phase the Medicare levy increase only covers 40 per cent of the Commonwealth's share of NDIS costs. The government has still to present its full funding plan for this scheme.


The NDIS is a venture of huge proportions. According to the Australian Government Actuary, the NDIS will, in full rollout, have a gross cost of $22 billion per annum and require, in complete form, an additional contribution from government of more than $10.5 billion beyond 2018-19. When such a call is being made on taxpayers, they are entitled to know exactly what the NDIS will achieve and who it will support. Before this legislation passes both houses, the government needs to be clear about all aspects of NDIS eligibility. Equally, the 400,000-plus people the Productivity Commission envisaged being supported by the NDIS are entitled to know what the gateway to the scheme is.


The gateway to the NDIS comprises a number of elements: the eligibility criteria in the NDIS Act; the NDIS regulations, known as the NDIS rules, only some of which have been released and only in draft form; the NDIS national assessment tools, which have not been publicly released. Only one of the gateway elements is fully and publicly available. Now this is against the backdrop of the Productivity Commission's blueprint having been in the hands of the government for two years, against the backdrop of a $22 billion scheme, against the backdrop of a new tax base which is being created in the form of the Medicare levy increase to part-fund the scheme and against the backdrop of the NDIS launch sites going live in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania in just six weeks time.


When the opposition indicated it would consider the increase to the Medicare levy, we said that first the government needed to introduce legislation to establish a fund in which levy proceeds would be held. The government has acceded to this request. Secondly, we said the government needed to legislate the Future Fund as guardians of this fund. Again, the government has acceded to this request. Thirdly, we said the government needed to release the final NDIS rules and the NDIS national assessment tools. This the government has refused to do. I repeat: we are talking about $22 billion of Australian taxpayers' money, a new tax base, launch sites going live in six weeks and the parliament and the nation not as yet—not of this evening—having before them the full details that will determine NDIS participation.


When the absence of the NDIS rules and the absence of the NDIS national assessment tools are raised with the government, they state that the eligibility criteria are in the NDIS Act. It is true that there is contained in the act a broad—indeed, a very broad—outline of the criteria to be an NDIS participant. And it is true that there are some draft rules which slightly expand on the criteria. But these are still extremely broad outlines of eligibility. It has been said by some that the opposition's desire to see the NDIS rules and the NDIS national assessment tools released is getting down into the weeds. But if you are an Australian with a significant disability, the rules and the assessment tools are not some theoretical mechanisms; they are elements that will combine to underpin your opportunities and quality of life.


The Prime Minister herself has said that people who want to know about eligibility should look at the NDIS Act. I cannot believe that the Prime Minister seriously expects Australians with disability to get  a copy of the act, grab a set of the draft and incomplete rules and then try and hunt down a copy of the as yet to be released assessment tools and then try and work out if they are in or out and what supports they may be entitled to. The final NDIS rules should be released. The NDIS national assessment tools should also be released. Wherever I go—and I know the feedback from my colleagues in this place is this—there is universal support for the NDIS, but there is also a real hunger for further information about eligibility and the sorts of therapies and supports that will be funded through the scheme. It is not premature for potential scheme participants or their families to be seeking this information.


Let me give just a few examples. For autism, early intervention is currently supported by the Commonwealth through the Helping Children with Autism program. The Productivity Commission envisaged, and the NDIS Act has provision for, early intervention services. It is assumed that the NDIS will supplant the Helping Children with Autism program. Parents of young children would like to know what this means for their children in terms of the level of NDIS early intervention supports but also the circumstances under which their children would qualify. If they do not, are there any other supports available? Surely these are very reasonable requests for information by people with children who have autism.


Let me take the example of supported accommodation. This is a concern for ageing parent carers who want to resolve accommodation for their adult children with intellectual impairment. Who will qualify? If qualified, and assuming there will be an adequate recurrent package, what will be the arrangement for capital to address the accommodation backlog? What will be the model? Again, these are eminently sensible and reasonable requests for information. Or take equipment. If you need a wheelchair, what level of cost will be covered? If your wheelchair costs, for example, $14,000, will you be covered for the full cost or only part? And, if so, what proportion? Once again these are entirely eminently sensible and reasonable requests for information which is currently not being provided. Or take hearing aids. These can range in cost from a few thousand dollars to in excess of $10,000. What will the NDIS deem to be reasonable and necessary? Again, this is a reasonable request for information. Or take support for blind and vision impaired people. Will the full cost of a guide dog be covered? How often? Will home modifications be covered? What will be considered reasonable and necessary? What will be the mechanisms to deliver supports to people with vision impairment over 65? Once again, these are very reasonable and understandable questions from people who find themselves in this situation seeking information—and the government should provide it soon.


At this point in time, developing a complete picture of how the NDIS will unfold is limited by insufficient information, examples of which I have just provided to the House. Neither the Senate committee that inquired into the NDIS Act nor the parliament tonight have had the benefit of the full NDIS rules or the national assessment tools in undertaking their due diligence. In the absence of these elements it is difficult to determine if the vision of the Productivity Commission is being fully given effect to. The risk, as always, with this government is their capacity to competently implement the scheme.


In conclusion, we will not frustrate this legislation; we will ensure its passage. However, we will not cease posing the questions being asked of us by Australians in general and our constituents with disability in particular. We will do so in order to ensure that the NDIS delivers on the vision of the Productivity Commission for a new deal for Australians with disability.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (18:37):  I would like to thank those members who have contributed to debate on these bills. These bills represent an historic step in the transformation of disability services in Australia. DisabilityCare Australia is the most fundamental social reform since the introduction of Medicare. These bills will lock in funding for DisabilityCare Australia, providing certainty and security for the 410,000 Australians with disability, their carers and their families. 


The Medicare Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill will increase the Medicare levy. From 1 July 2014 the Medicare levy will increase half a percentage point from 1½ per cent to two per cent. Every dollar raised from the increase in the Medicare levy will go directly to fund DisabilityCare Australia. This will provide a strong and stable funding stream. To assist the states and territories to fund their contribution to DisabilityCare Australia, the government will allocate them around $9.7 billion of the additional Medicare levy revenue over a 10-year period.


The DisabilityCare Australia Fund Bill establishes the DisabilityCare Australia Fund, which will hold and invest the revenue from the increase in Medicare levy. The fund will only be drawn down to make reimbursements to the Commonwealth and to the states and territories for expenditure directly related to DisabilityCare Australia. The bill also guarantees the share of the fund that will be made available to the states and territories. The DisabilityCare Australia Fund will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians, who have experience in successfully managing other government owned investment funds. The DisabilityCare Australia Fund Bill also contains amendments that deal with interim matters to enable DisabilityCare Australia to commence operations from 1 July 2013. 


The remainder of the bills being considered as part of this package contain consequential amendments that will increase the rates of other taxes that are linked to the Medicare levy. These changes will build a better life for Australians with significant and permanent disability. I commend the bills to the House.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (19:00):  Mr Deputy Speaker, you and many of my colleagues here have been to that great Southern Hemisphere capital which is not Santiago or Buenos Aires: it is Frankston! You would know that that capital of the south-east of greater Melbourne is a fantastic community, blessed by a lot of really terrific attributes: the coastal location, a vibrant commercial hub—




Mr Hawke:
  The federal member!




Mr BILLSON:
  Well, yes. Thank you for interjecting about the qualities of the federal member. It has always been a bit close, though, so maybe not everyone holds that view!


You would be as surprised as I am, Mr Deputy Speaker, in all of the talk and the hoopla around Labor's long-promised but little-delivered NBN, that the great commercial centre of Frankston does not even feature in the rollout maps. Let alone the lack of progress and the tempo at which the rollout is progressing, and the highly ambitious roll-out schedule that is published: the great city of Frankston, the commercial hub—the capital of the south-east of greater Melbourne—does not even rate on the rollout plan.


Under the best likely scenario, given current rates of progress under Labor's NBN, the capital city of Frankston might get some action in about 2022, if they are lucky. 2022 if they are lucky, for what is recognised as the regional activity centre—both the current state government and the previous Labor state government saw it as a crucial part of the economic future of the metropolis of Melbourne. But in Labor 's world of NBN Co. and all of the problems it has had actually hitting any of its rollout targets, there is one way to avoid disappointment in Frankston—and that is not to include it in the program at all. They cannot be late because they are not even on the schedule! Even at the current rate of progress—2021, 2022 or 2023—then maybe the economic hub that is Frankston city might be factored into Labor's NBN plan.


It goes into the industrial state to the north of Frankston around Belvedere Park and Carrum Downs, where a lot of economic activity has been seen. In the great community of Mornington—one that I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker, in your terrific role as Minister for Veterans' Affairs have visited as we looked at that fantastic Memorial Park in Mornington—there is so much economic activity in the main street: retail sales activity, restaurants and professional service providers, and even in the industrial area out to Mornington East. Guess what? They are not even on the rollout plan either!


You hear the Labor government and its members talking about what a wonder the NBN will be. Well, the NBN is on the never-never in Dunkley. Under Labor, the NBN is on the never-never in Dunkley. You can imagine my excitement when with the release of the coalition's plan by our leader, Tony Abbott, and our very capable communications and broadband shadow minister, Malcolm Turnbull, we could say to those communities that under the coalition faster broadband, rolled out more swiftly and more affordably, will be coming to Dunkley. We were delighted to brief Frankston City Council mayor and senior executives and the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council mayor and senior executives about the prospects of higher speed, more affordable broadband coming to their communities under a coalition government if we can earn the support to be elected, compared to the never-never scenario that they face under Labor.


We thought that with updating its rollout plans in recent weeks the government may have been stung into action by the coalition's exceptionally good policy: recognising the new universal support for the rollout strategy that gets something done to deliver high-speed more affordable broadband to communities like the greater Frankston and Mornington communities. I thought when there was much announcement and hoopla again about the updated rollout plan that the Gillard government might have been stung into action. But just to rub salt into the injury, guess what? Still not included. Labor is saying a million more households. But no: no work to be commenced until the 2020s in Mornington, Frankston South, the Frankston Central Activities District, the Pines and Seaford for any time in the foreseeable future.


Contrast that with the commitment of the coalition. Not only will the work be undertaken; it will be completed. In those communities we would roll out faster broadband across the Dunkley electorate within the first three years under an Abbott government if we are able to earn that opportunity. That is a real, rock-solid commitment that my community welcomes. Not only will it be available—what an enormous step forward!—not only will it be very fast and not only will it identify those commercial areas as a priority; for most households it will be $300 a year cheaper. With cost-of-living pressures, broadband costs should be coming down not going up. Get on the coalition plan; NBN Co.'s plan under Labor is a dud for the Dunkley community.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (09:30):  I rise to speak about the government's failure to bring justice to the more than 450 doctors, nurses and anaesthetists who served as members of the SEATO civilian surgical medical teams that operated in Vietnam between 1964 and 1972. These volunteers all suffered the hardships of war while tending to the wounded and should not be denied repatriation benefits similar to those provided to ADF personnel serving in Vietnam during the same period. Because it is alleged these volunteers were not technically under the control of the ADF but under the control of the Department of External Affairs, they have been denied justice for more than four decades. This is despite the fact that these civilians were awarded the Active Service Medal for working in a warlike situation. Justice Mohr, in his report in 2000, found that these nurses:


…were integrated with the ADF and performed like functions.


The Weekend Australian has recently revealed a previously hidden document, which indicated a chain of command between the ADF and the hospital of Bien Hoa, where hundreds of Australian civilian medical staff were located at the time. The result of this bureaucratic blockade is that the physical pain these civilian volunteers have suffered, including lymphomas, thyroid disease, autoimmune disease disorders, multiple sclerosis and post-traumatic stress disorder at higher rates than in the general community, has been compounded by the emotional anguish of being ignored by the government.


Dot Angell says that she is angry, very angry; Ted Kremer says that he feels betrayed; and Maureen Spicer says that she is outraged. I have met some of these brave people, including former senior nurse Caroline Coventry, who went with the first Alfred Hospital team to Vietnam in 1966 and is also a Kooyong constituent. I have taken up their case by writing to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Warren Snowdon, but to no avail.


Today, Mr Deputy Speaker, I give voice to their case in the parliament and join with such distinguished Australian military figures as General Cosgrove, who supports their case and calls for an act of grace by the government. As a former Vietnam veteran, General Cosgrove has said:


Very plainly, the men and women of the Vietnam surgical teams, there at the behest of the Australian government, were no more 'free agents' than was I.


It is never too late to right a wrong. I hope that an Australian government, whatever its political affiliation, can bring justice for these Australian patriots, who selflessly risked their lives to help others. In doing so, we will be not only properly dealing with our past but strengthening our future.

"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr IAN MACFARLANE
 (Groom) (10:00):  I shall not keep the House long on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill 2013, bearing in mind that we do, of course, agree with the government in terms of the changes it is making. Offshore petroleum safety is paramount. The changes that are being introduced under this amendment are changes which not only do we support but come from the 2010 Montara commission of inquiry report together with other policy and technical amendments. This is part of the process of ensuring that the Australian and global communities are confident in the operation of offshore petroleum assets, particularly in the oil and gas industry.


Offshore petroleum is a very important part of Australia's economy, though you would not know it from the budget last night, and I will come back to that later. The reality is that our gas exports at the moment come virtually entirely from offshore petroleum in Western Australia, with some also from offshore petroleum in the waters north of Darwin. As a Queenslander, I have to say the industry is expanding onshore in Queensland, but it is also expanding offshore in Western Australia. We see the introduction of the latest technology in the world, the technology of floating LNG, where the plant is actually placed on what could be called a ship, though it is bigger than an aircraft carrier. In fact, one of the executives of the gas industry says it is a pretty handy par 5—it is about 490 metres long. That is a hell of a big ship. On top of that, you put the LNG plant and that plant then produces LNG and exports it to the world. 


It is imperative that as Australia moves into the next phase of offshore petroleum production—liquids, condensate and oil, and also gas for the LNG plants to supply the Asian markets in particular—we have the sort of legislation that ensures that those operations are done safely and in an environmentally sustainable way. We all know that there have been some unfortunate, and in fact disastrous incidents in recent times. Montara was the incident in Australia that caught the public's attention. Far bigger tragedies have occurred: the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico on 20 April 2010 and the death of two drill workers in the Otway Basin off the Victorian coast in 2012. They are salient reminders to the oil industry that it needs make sure that its operations are not near-perfect but actually perfect. 


The bill will amend the act to implement a number of findings in the legislative review conducted into Montara and will aim to strengthen the implementation of polluter pays principles in the offshore petroleum regularity regime. I hope we do not get to that. I hope the industry operates in a way that is safe but also prevents the escape of any molecules into the environment. The amendments in this bill will: introduce alternative enforcement mechanisms enabling inspectors appointed by NOPSEMA to issue environmental improvement notices; introduce a statutory duty on petroleum titleholders in the event of the escape of petroleum; provide an ability for the regulator to take up the necessary actions to recover costs from the titleholder; and, finally, improve the effectiveness of insurance requirements in the act to ensure that titleholders are in a financial position to comply with the new statutory polluter pays duty and other extraordinary regulatory costs that they may incur.


As I said, the coalition supports these amendments and is of the view that the offshore oil and gas industry can operate in a manner which allows it to grow without exposing either the workers or the environment to unnecessary risks. I know from my discussions with industry that this is an issue they are very engaged in and they are very keen to make sure that it works. We need to learn from the lessons of the past. We need to make sure that we have the right set of amendments and legislation to ensure correct and safe operation. But I think the onus is on the industry to go above and beyond the requirements of the legislation, to do everything they can to make sure the safety of their workers and the protection of the environment are paramount.


The thing that disturbs me and which continues to be exposed by this government is not the sorts of amendments they are making today, which we do support; it is what we saw in the budget last night, which continues to be a full frontal assault on the oil and gas industry and on the resources industry in general. The changes we saw in the budget last night may leave these amendments unrequired—that is, if this government were to be allowed to continue in its assault on the oil and gas industry, exploration and development of oil and gas offshore and onshore would basically grind to a halt. We saw last night some of the most short-sighted policy I have seen handed down by a government in my mere 14½ years in this place, perhaps even in my political lifetime going back probably three decades—that is, to make it more difficult, more expensive for multinational companies, which in the end are responsible for most of the oil and gas development in Australia, to invest here. When the oil and gas industry in Australia today is responsible for 30c of every private-sector dollar invested in Australia, it is beyond me why a government would be turning on this industry simply to desperately try to get dollars in to balance its wasteful spending.


The industry is currently investing around $200 billion over five years, which is around $1,200 per second. On top of the $200 billion it is investing, it will pay billions of dollars a year in royalties and taxes to the government and create more than 100,000 new jobs. On top of all that—if that was not enough—the industry is considering investing many tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars in future projects. So when we see a change in the thin capital rules that means it is now more expensive for companies to invest in those projects, we realise that this government really does not get it. On top of that, the government changed the exploration rules. The increases in costs associated with trading or buying exploration permits will be a further deterrent to investment in Australia. Everyone, surely, wants to see investment in Australia. Everyone, surely, wants to see the amendments we are discussing today being there for an industry that is thriving, prospering and investing in Australia, as well as growing jobs, growing exports, putting extra revenue into the coffers. The changes that were introduced last night by the government to both thin capital and exploration allowances was, as I said, the most short-sighted thing I have seen for a long time.


The coalition will continue to work with this government to ensure that offshore safety and protection of the environment is maintained. I had a very fruitful and useful working relationship with the previous minister, Minister Ferguson. I thank him and congratulate him for what he did for the resources industry in Australia. His replacement, the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism, Minister Gray, is someone I have known for a long time through the corporate sector prior to him coming into politics. I have the absolute confidence in him that I had in his predecessor. I wish the minister well. I look forward to working with him over the months ahead.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:10):  I rise to speak on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. I commend the member for Groom for the first two-fifths of his speech and the last one-fifth of his speech. There were two-fifths there during which I drifted off, but I commend him for his contribution and for the bipartisan support that the opposition has given this legislation.


Obviously, as an island nation we have always taken a particular interest in our immediate surrounds. We have a troubled and a proud history as a federal government in being a little bit adventurous. I will particularly mention my predecessor as the member for Moreton, the Hon. James Killen, who did so much back in his time in the 1970s in terms of looking at federal responsibilities. He had a barney or two with the states working out those federal responsibilities. We can also look at the PRRT and some of the debates that went on in this place about that. Obviously, it is now well established that the PRRT is a good tax. We have a sustainable industry there that is also giving a responsible return to Australia. If you look at the Hansard debates at the time that that legislation was introduced by the Hawke government, you could swear that it was going to be the end of that industry. But we have obviously seen a significant offshore petroleum industry since, and it continues to have a healthy outlook—despite what the member for Groom said about the tax avoidance manoeuvres undertaken by some large multinational companies that work in this area.


I particularly commend the Labor government in both the 42nd and 43rd parliaments for the work we have done in declaring parts of our surrounding waters marine parks. As a Queenslander, I am very proud of the Great Barrier Reef, as all Australians are. We have declared some of the other marine park areas in recognition of the important contribution that our oceans make, as a source of food but also in terms of their impact on global climate change and maintaining temperatures. If you go north-west of Australia, you are getting into an area called the Amazon of the oceans. We are only just exploring some of the scientific and health benefits associated with the marine flora and fauna. I would like to commend the work of the famous Australian writer Tim Winton, who has done much to focus Australia's view on the south-western part of Australia. And on cue a Western Australian walks in! I commend Minister Gray for the work that he has done in recognising that important interplay between industry and the environment.


Sadly, over recent years we have seen a number of tragic accidents due to serious risk within the offshore petroleum industry. I first encountered this industry when I was on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industry and Resources under the member for Lyons, Dick Adams. We did a review of the draft Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Bill. We were looking at productive fields changing to be more useful in a carbon constrained world. This is offshore and sadly it is dangerous. There have been incidents. We have all read about the Montara incident in the papers. I also recall the two deaths in the Otway Basin. These can be dangerous environments and it is important to get the health and safety legislation and support well established and controlled. Those two incidents indicate that there is a need to develop strong, effective regulations of our offshore petroleum regime to ensure the health and safety of our workers as well as protecting the Australian marine environment.


The compliance measures contained in the amended bill will include a range of alternative enforcement mechanisms, such as infringement notices and adverse publicity orders, and continuing penalties. It is a stepped-up scheme of common sense and it allows for a bigger stick to be hauled out slowly. The agreed recommendations from the whole-of-government polluter-pays report include: an express polluter-pays obligation and an associated third-party cost-recovery mechanism; clarifying the insurance requirements to ensure that maintenance of sufficient financial insurance is compulsory without a direction being given and to clarify the compliance role of the regulator; enabling NOPSEMA inspectors to issue environmental prohibition and improvement notices to require petroleum titleholders to take action on removing significant threats to the environment; and requiring the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority to publish occupational health and safety and environment improvement notices and prohibition notices on its website—the naming and shaming side of things.


The upstream oil and gas sector is a significant industry for Australia, generating around $35.6 billion in the 2008-09 financial year. It employs over 10,000 people. Australia is in danger of marine damage and risk to worker safety within the oil and gas industry, but unless new oil discoveries are made in Australia there is legitimate concern about the long-term fall in production as ageing oilfields decline. As a Queenslander, I know that there are significant developments onshore, but offshore we look forward to new exploration and development leading to new production. The petroleum industry has been acutely aware of the environmental issues for many decades. Geologists, geophysicists and production engineers have been taught to protect and conserve the natural phenomena which surround them every time they venture into the field to initiate and build a project. As a consequence, through their work the petroleum industry has been taking steps to minimise its disturbance to flora and fauna both onshore and offshore for a number of years prior to the media hysteria about the Montara incident.


With this in mind, the government has maintained a regulatory body to ensure this protection is upheld and in some cases improved. That is why we introduced the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority to police the petroleum industry's safety and environmental standards. The regulatory body was set up as a direct response to the 2009 oil and gas spill into the Timor Sea. As a result of the inquiry it was recommended that a single independent regulator look after safety, well integrity and environmental management of the Australian offshore petroleum industry. It effectively consolidates the current state, territory and national regulation for health and safety, structural integrity, environmental plans and day-to-day operations associated with petroleum activity in Commonwealth waters. As I mentioned, it will be supported by the opposition.


The bill under debate today has been introduced as a necessary action to further maintain the safety of offshore petroleum workers and to enforce those further environmental standards on the industry, so that all Australians can be assured about the sustainability of our environment which is a big asset for our tourism industry as well as the enjoyment of the nearly 90 per cent of Australians who live within 100 kilometres of the ocean. Our marine environment is worth protecting by strengthening the application of polluters-pay standards. By forcing industry to stop, contain, control and clean up spills that occur we are giving our fragile environment a chance to survive and grow for future generations.


Environmental protection and the conservation of biodiversity are exceptionally important for Australians, and the international community is watching us to make sure we get it right. Every Australian wants to see our economy grow and prosper. As the Labor Party we are all about jobs, but we need to get the balance right and ensure we do not do so at the expense of our environment. Stringent environmental controls must be in place across the petroleum industry. Greenhouse gas storage is significant in reducing environmental impacts, but there are also a number of measures that must be monitored to ensure maximum protection is upheld, including drilling fluids. Drilling muds must be ecologically tested to ensure there are no toxic effects on the surrounding environment. Disposal of the chemical and heavy metal content of waste material should strictly adhere to government regulations, particularly in offshore locations. Land clearing, including clearance of vegetation for tracks and drilling sites, should be further controlled to ensure any disturbance is kept to a minimum. Oil spill control is hopefully not something that the minister will ever have to worry about, but obviously this would be detrimental to our environment. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill is focused on implementing improved industry standards for clean-up and reduced environmental impact.


The bill is also a reflection of our commitment to our Clean Energy Future. Obviously the Australian Labor Party is moving Australia to a low-emissions economy while upholding our commitment to protecting jobs and growth. Despite the doom and gloom and the relentless jeremiad coming for those opposite, the reality is that since 1 July and the introduction of the carbon price, the emissions in the national electricity market have fallen by about 10 million tonnes and renewable energy generated in the NEM has increased by almost 30 per cent over the same period. This is while the economy has continued to grow close to trend and we have created around 160,000 new jobs. I particularly commend the government for the Carbon Farming Initiative by allowing additional land-based abatement projects to generate credits. Despite those opposite, we have got a multi-pronged attack, which is what a price does. Obviously their mechanism will be a complete disaster. Heaven forbid if they do get a chance to implement it. I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (10:21):  It gives me great pleasure to support the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. Let me proceed in three brief steps. The principles which we uphold in relation to offshore oil and gas are very clear. The first is about the economy and energy security. We unashamedly seek to support energy security for Australia and the capacity to be an oil and gas producer and, potentially—certainly in the case of gas—exporter. These are good things for Australia and for the world. It is about human development. It is about the access to heating and cooling and all of the benefits which come with modern society. Encouraging and supporting a viable flourishing offshore oil and gas industry, with a particular focus on gas, is good for Australia, is good for human development and is one of the drivers of bringing not just tens but hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in India, Indonesia and China. That is a profound historic contribution.


The second of the principles is in relation to environmental safety, security and sustainability. Whilst we want to see genuine energy security and all the human benefits that flow from it, we do not want to make the trade-off where our environment is lost. That means we need strong, clear standards. This bill fairly and squarely addresses those standards as a consequence of the Montara incident and the Montara commission. We, for example, are categorically, clearly and implacably opposed to mining and offshore petroleum and gas exploration in the Barrier Reef. In my judgement it will not change in my lifetime or, beyond that, in generations. I think that that is something which will be an Australian standard for the entire foreseeable future across the full political spectrum. So our duties are clear on that side.


The third of the principles is to make sure that we try to minimise our emissions footprint. To the extent that gas replaces other forms of energy generation around the world, that is a way of doing this, but we also need to make sure that we have adequate measures. Where this broad bill addresses greenhouse gas storage—the act itself—is one way of reducing our overall national footprint.


Let me then move from the principles to the bill. The bill is a response to the Montara incident. I disagree with the member for Moreton, who made the point that it was a wild public overreaction. It was a very serious incident with very serious environmental consequences. I think it was well responded to by the authorities in general, but let us not understate the environmental incident nor overstate it. It was a serious incident. Having said that, we support the amendments which are proposed as a consequence of the commission—in particular, the alternative enforcement mechanisms, infringement notices, daily penalties for continuing offences; it is a tough regime. But our Australian companies have been, for the most part, outstanding. This was a case of negligence, and it is appropriate that there are consequences when there is significant damage to the environment. Let me restate that principle. We support the inspection regime. We support the statutory duties on petroleum titleholders. We support the regulator having the ability to take the necessary action and recover costs from the titleholder, and we support improving the effectiveness of insurance requirements.


Against that background, we also think that, in the future, there should be a one-stop shop for federal and state environmental approvals and assessments. In particular, I think we also ought to look—and here I move from policy to a personal view—at a single, horizontal, one-stop shop within the federal environment so that there is only one point of negotiation between a firm and the federal government rather than multiple agencies. I think a single coordinating agency for approvals, assessments and other activities would be far preferable to a multiple agency regime. That is a personal view as to how we can take the one-stop-shop concept in terms of federal-state relations to a true, national, one-stop-shop assessment. That would make the difference on projects, I think, such as Olympic Dam and Browse, where they had to run the clock for five or six years to get approvals and, in the meantime, the economic circumstances changed, the cost profile went up and the projects were lost.


That brings me, lastly, to the contrast between this bill and what we saw last night in the budget. The contrast is this. This bill is an example of good cooperation, and I thank the minister and his predecessor; they have both been very good partners in working across the chamber. By contrast, the entire carbon tax process has been a debacle. We saw a write-down of $5 billion of revenues because they had phantom revenue projections last night. However, there are still phantom revenue projections. The 2015-16 price of $12.10 in the budget and the 2016-17 forward carbon price of $18 in the budget are more than double and triple what the market is saying the price will be. In other words, there is still phantom revenue built into the budget, and that means a $2 billion black hole in 2015-16. The surplus is gone—evaporated; toes up; it no longer exists. And, in 2016-17—using, again, the forward price of the market, as opposed to the government's inflated phantom revenue projections—there is a $4 billion black hole. What we have there is the same thing as last year: phantom revenue, predicted, spent, but ultimately unlikely to eventuate. It is exactly what we said last year. Nothing has changed. Compare these two examples of phantom revenue with the way this bill was done on a cooperative basis with industry and across the chamber. There should be more examples such as the offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage amendment bill and fewer examples of phantom revenue for political purposes which is spent in advance and which ultimately evaporates.

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (10:28):  I rise to sum up this debate on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. In so doing, I want to pay tribute to my predecessor, the member for Batman, for the work that he did in dealing with the immediacy of Montara and then the outstanding public administration work that has given rise to this piece of legislation. It is impossible to make that statement without giving due credit and acknowledgement to the opposition and, in particular, the shadow minister, the member for Groom, for his tremendous insight and support of good industry practice, leading to good environmental regulation and a safer and better offshore working environment for Australian workers and for this extremely important growing industry.


This bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to strengthen the offshore petroleum regulatory regime, continuing the Australian government's work to implement the lessons learned following the uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons from the Montara wellhead platform in August 2009. Recent incidents such as the tragic accident on the Stena Clyde rig in the Otway basin located in the Bass Strait which resulted in the deaths of two employees, one a 32-year-old man from the Northern Territory and the second a 60-year-old, during drilling operations in August of last year further emphasise the need for a strong, effective regulatory framework to promote and encourage the safe best practice that we have in our industry and the continuous improvements in the operations of the offshore petroleum industry.


The amendments in this bill help to achieve this goal by introducing a range of alternative compliance and enforcement tools to strengthen the ability of the regulator and the courts to enforce critical safety and environmental management requirements, including adverse publicity orders, injunctions, infringement notices and continuing offences to help protect the Australian offshore workforce and the marine environment. The bill also inserts a new polluter pays provision in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to both impose an express statutory duty on titleholders to respond to an escape of petroleum as well as provide a legislative guarantee that all costs of responding to an escape of petroleum, including clean up, remediation of the environment and environmental monitoring, will be met in full by the polluter should they fail to fulfil their statutory duty.


A number of additional policy and technical amendments in this bill will also strengthen the operation of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006, including enabling NOPSEMA inspectors to issue environmental prohibition notices and environmental improvement notices to require titleholders to remove significant threats to the environment and to require NOPSEMA to publish environmental and occupational health and safety prohibition and improvement notices issued by inspectors so that lessons from offshore inspections can be shared across the offshore petroleum industry in support of continuous operational improvements and improved occupational health and safety and environmental outcomes. I commend this bill to the House.

"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr IAN MACFARLANE
 (Groom) (10:00):  I shall not keep the House long on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill 2013, bearing in mind that we do, of course, agree with the government in terms of the changes it is making. Offshore petroleum safety is paramount. The changes that are being introduced under this amendment are changes which not only do we support but come from the 2010 Montara commission of inquiry report together with other policy and technical amendments. This is part of the process of ensuring that the Australian and global communities are confident in the operation of offshore petroleum assets, particularly in the oil and gas industry.


Offshore petroleum is a very important part of Australia's economy, though you would not know it from the budget last night, and I will come back to that later. The reality is that our gas exports at the moment come virtually entirely from offshore petroleum in Western Australia, with some also from offshore petroleum in the waters north of Darwin. As a Queenslander, I have to say the industry is expanding onshore in Queensland, but it is also expanding offshore in Western Australia. We see the introduction of the latest technology in the world, the technology of floating LNG, where the plant is actually placed on what could be called a ship, though it is bigger than an aircraft carrier. In fact, one of the executives of the gas industry says it is a pretty handy par 5—it is about 490 metres long. That is a hell of a big ship. On top of that, you put the LNG plant and that plant then produces LNG and exports it to the world. 


It is imperative that as Australia moves into the next phase of offshore petroleum production—liquids, condensate and oil, and also gas for the LNG plants to supply the Asian markets in particular—we have the sort of legislation that ensures that those operations are done safely and in an environmentally sustainable way. We all know that there have been some unfortunate, and in fact disastrous incidents in recent times. Montara was the incident in Australia that caught the public's attention. Far bigger tragedies have occurred: the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico on 20 April 2010 and the death of two drill workers in the Otway Basin off the Victorian coast in 2012. They are salient reminders to the oil industry that it needs make sure that its operations are not near-perfect but actually perfect. 


The bill will amend the act to implement a number of findings in the legislative review conducted into Montara and will aim to strengthen the implementation of polluter pays principles in the offshore petroleum regularity regime. I hope we do not get to that. I hope the industry operates in a way that is safe but also prevents the escape of any molecules into the environment. The amendments in this bill will: introduce alternative enforcement mechanisms enabling inspectors appointed by NOPSEMA to issue environmental improvement notices; introduce a statutory duty on petroleum titleholders in the event of the escape of petroleum; provide an ability for the regulator to take up the necessary actions to recover costs from the titleholder; and, finally, improve the effectiveness of insurance requirements in the act to ensure that titleholders are in a financial position to comply with the new statutory polluter pays duty and other extraordinary regulatory costs that they may incur.


As I said, the coalition supports these amendments and is of the view that the offshore oil and gas industry can operate in a manner which allows it to grow without exposing either the workers or the environment to unnecessary risks. I know from my discussions with industry that this is an issue they are very engaged in and they are very keen to make sure that it works. We need to learn from the lessons of the past. We need to make sure that we have the right set of amendments and legislation to ensure correct and safe operation. But I think the onus is on the industry to go above and beyond the requirements of the legislation, to do everything they can to make sure the safety of their workers and the protection of the environment are paramount.


The thing that disturbs me and which continues to be exposed by this government is not the sorts of amendments they are making today, which we do support; it is what we saw in the budget last night, which continues to be a full frontal assault on the oil and gas industry and on the resources industry in general. The changes we saw in the budget last night may leave these amendments unrequired—that is, if this government were to be allowed to continue in its assault on the oil and gas industry, exploration and development of oil and gas offshore and onshore would basically grind to a halt. We saw last night some of the most short-sighted policy I have seen handed down by a government in my mere 14½ years in this place, perhaps even in my political lifetime going back probably three decades—that is, to make it more difficult, more expensive for multinational companies, which in the end are responsible for most of the oil and gas development in Australia, to invest here. When the oil and gas industry in Australia today is responsible for 30c of every private-sector dollar invested in Australia, it is beyond me why a government would be turning on this industry simply to desperately try to get dollars in to balance its wasteful spending.


The industry is currently investing around $200 billion over five years, which is around $1,200 per second. On top of the $200 billion it is investing, it will pay billions of dollars a year in royalties and taxes to the government and create more than 100,000 new jobs. On top of all that—if that was not enough—the industry is considering investing many tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars in future projects. So when we see a change in the thin capital rules that means it is now more expensive for companies to invest in those projects, we realise that this government really does not get it. On top of that, the government changed the exploration rules. The increases in costs associated with trading or buying exploration permits will be a further deterrent to investment in Australia. Everyone, surely, wants to see investment in Australia. Everyone, surely, wants to see the amendments we are discussing today being there for an industry that is thriving, prospering and investing in Australia, as well as growing jobs, growing exports, putting extra revenue into the coffers. The changes that were introduced last night by the government to both thin capital and exploration allowances was, as I said, the most short-sighted thing I have seen for a long time.


The coalition will continue to work with this government to ensure that offshore safety and protection of the environment is maintained. I had a very fruitful and useful working relationship with the previous minister, Minister Ferguson. I thank him and congratulate him for what he did for the resources industry in Australia. His replacement, the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism, Minister Gray, is someone I have known for a long time through the corporate sector prior to him coming into politics. I have the absolute confidence in him that I had in his predecessor. I wish the minister well. I look forward to working with him over the months ahead. The outcome of our cooperation will be to the betterment not only of the industry but also of the community of Australia and better for jobs in Australia.

That means we need strong, clear standards. This bill fairly and squarely addresses those standards as a consequence of the Montara incident and the Montara commission. We, for example, are categorically, clearly and implacably opposed to mining and offshore petroleum and gas exploration in the Barrier Reef. In my judgement it will not change in my lifetime or, beyond that, in generations. I think that that is something which will be an Australian standard for the entire foreseeable future across the full political spectrum. So our duties are clear on that side.


The third of the principles is to make sure that we try to minimise our emissions footprint. To the extent that gas replaces other forms of energy generation around the world, that is a way of doing this, but we also need to make sure that we have adequate measures. Where this broad bill addresses greenhouse gas storage—the act itself—is one way of reducing our overall national footprint.


Let me then move from the principles to the bill. The bill is a response to the Montara incident. I disagree with the member for Moreton, who made the point that it was a wild public overreaction. It was a very serious incident with very serious environmental consequences. I think it was well responded to by the authorities in general, but let us not understate the environmental incident nor overstate it. It was a serious incident. Having said that, we support the amendments which are proposed as a consequence of the commission—in particular, the alternative enforcement mechanisms, infringement notices, daily penalties for continuing offences; it is a tough regime. But our Australian companies have been, for the most part, outstanding. This was a case of negligence, and it is appropriate that there are consequences when there is significant damage to the environment. Let me restate that principle. We support the inspection regime. We support the statutory duties on petroleum titleholders. We support the regulator having the ability to take the necessary action and recover costs from the titleholder, and we support improving the effectiveness of insurance requirements.


Against that background, we also think that, in the future, there should be a one-stop shop for federal and state environmental approvals and assessments. In particular, I think we also ought to look—and here I move from policy to a personal view—at a single, horizontal, one-stop shop within the federal environment so that there is only one point of negotiation between a firm and the federal government rather than multiple agencies. I think a single coordinating agency for approvals, assessments and other activities would be far preferable to a multiple agency regime. That is a personal view as to how we can take the one-stop-shop concept in terms of federal-state relations to a true, national, one-stop-shop assessment. That would make the difference on projects, I think, such as Olympic Dam and Browse, where they had to run the clock for five or six years to get approvals and, in the meantime, the economic circumstances changed, the cost profile went up and the projects were lost.


That brings me, lastly, to the contrast between this bill and what we saw last night in the budget. The contrast is this. This bill is an example of good cooperation, and I thank the minister and his predecessor; they have both been very good partners in working across the chamber. By contrast, the entire carbon tax process has been a debacle. We saw a write-down of $5 billion of revenues because they had phantom revenue projections last night. However, there are still phantom revenue projections. The 2015-16 price of $12.10 in the budget and the 2016-17 forward carbon price of $18 in the budget are more than double and triple what the market is saying the price will be. In other words, there is still phantom revenue built into the budget, and that means a $2 billion black hole in 2015-16. The surplus is gone—evaporated; toes up; it no longer exists. And, in 2016-17—using, again, the forward price of the market, as opposed to the government's inflated phantom revenue projections—there is a $4 billion black hole. What we have there is the same thing as last year: phantom revenue, predicted, spent, but ultimately unlikely to eventuate. It is exactly what we said last year. Nothing has changed. Compare these two examples of phantom revenue with the way this bill was done on a cooperative basis with industry and across the chamber. There should be more examples such as the offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage amendment bill and fewer examples of phantom revenue for political purposes which is spent in advance and which ultimately evaporates.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (10:28):  I rise to sum up this debate on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. In so doing, I want to pay tribute to my predecessor, the member for Batman, for the work that he did in dealing with the immediacy of Montara and then the outstanding public administration work that has given rise to this piece of legislation. It is impossible to make that statement without giving due credit and acknowledgement to the opposition and, in particular, the shadow minister, the member for Groom, for his tremendous insight and support of good industry practice, leading to good environmental regulation and a safer and better offshore working environment for Australian workers and for this extremely important growing industry.


This bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to strengthen the offshore petroleum regulatory regime, continuing the Australian government's work to implement the lessons learned following the uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons from the Montara wellhead platform in August 2009. Recent incidents such as the tragic accident on the Stena Clyde rig in the Otway basin located in the Bass Strait which resulted in the deaths of two employees, one a 32-year-old man from the Northern Territory and the second a 60-year-old, during drilling operations in August of last year further emphasise the need for a strong, effective regulatory framework to promote and encourage the safe best practice that we have in our industry and the continuous improvements in the operations of the offshore petroleum industry.


The amendments in this bill help to achieve this goal by introducing a range of alternative compliance and enforcement tools to strengthen the ability of the regulator and the courts to enforce critical safety and environmental management requirements, including adverse publicity orders, injunctions, infringement notices and continuing offences to help protect the Australian offshore workforce and the marine environment. The bill also inserts a new polluter pays provision in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to both impose an express statutory duty on titleholders to respond to an escape of petroleum as well as provide a legislative guarantee that all costs of responding to an escape of petroleum, including clean up, remediation of the environment and environmental monitoring, will be met in full by the polluter should they fail to fulfil their statutory duty.


A number of additional policy and technical amendments in this bill will also strengthen the operation of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006, including enabling NOPSEMA inspectors to issue environmental prohibition notices and environmental improvement notices to require titleholders to remove significant threats to the environment and to require NOPSEMA to publish environmental and occupational health and safety prohibition and improvement notices issued by inspectors so that lessons from offshore inspections can be shared across the offshore petroleum industry in support of continuous operational improvements and improved occupational health and safety and environmental outcomes. I commend this bill to the House.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Ms KING
 (Ballarat—Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (16:17):  I am very proud as the member for Ballarat and a member of this parliament, which has recognised and apologised on behalf of the Australian people for the shameful policies and practices of forced adoption. I have heard from a number of my constituents who have been affected by these practices. All were moved by the apology and particularly by the very heart-felt words of our Prime Minister.


For many, it provided a time to share their grief in the open without the stigma of the past and to begin a process of healing. Nothing will ever make up for the hurt, betrayal and loss caused by these practices. But, as a nation, this acknowledgment speaks to our common humanity and to our moral obligation. I do not think anything can be more powerful than the words of those mothers, particularly, who have been directly affected. So I would like to take the opportunity here to use most of my contribution to read to the chamber a letter handed to me by one of my constituents, Lyn Kinghorn, who details her own heartbreaking story, a story that is replicated many, many times across this country. I quote from Lyn's letter:


In 1963 I was single, 16 and pregnant. My parents bullied my child's father to stay away. My mother put pressure on me to have an abortion. They were willing to pay £400 for this. I refused and a place was found for me at Berry Street. I was happy to go to Berry Street and continually thought my boyfriend was coming with his Mum to rescue me, only to find out years later—he was threatened with jail if he came near me. 


My beautiful daughter was born on 24/12/1963. I took care of her for the week that I was in hospital. I had free access to spend all of my time with her. On 31/12/1963 a nurse was sent from Berry Street to the Women's Hospital to collect me. I begged and screamed for help not to be separated from my daughter. I was told to go home and be a good girl.


When I got back to Berry Street distraught and screaming – the Matron came out and said in a cruel voice ""I hope you have learnt your lesson."" I certainly did, no way would I ever get into such a situation again.


I married and two members of the family I married into had been single mothers in the decades before me. I believed I had been weak and something was wrong with me that I had been unable to be a Mum like they both had …


I am shocked and distressed to learn the role the medical profession took to separate me from my child.


Between the mid-1950s to mid-1970s the policy was that the medical profession, in its bid to heal infertility forcibly — removed babies from single Mums. What became of Doctor/patient care and relationship?? The medical profession used me and other Mums like me as a cure for strangers. Why was their need more important than mine?? I have been profoundly injured by this policy that is now known as Forced Adoption. I strongly expose this as ABDUCTION for adoption. My human rights were abused.


I was forced to sign consent 8 days after separation, as I was told I would never see her again and if I refused to sign she would be raised in an orphanage. By this time I had turned 17. I was unable to vote, get a loan or a drivers licence, but without an advocate present - able to sign consent to lose my child.


My first child after I married was stillborn — another daughter. I was heartbroken - but was able to move on from that without the continued trauma of loss the abduction has caused throughout my life.


I am so blessed to have had 4 more children and 4 step-children. My next daughter recently said ""Mum, this has consumed your life.""


I do wonder how this abduction has directed my life as a wife and mother. Many years spent involved with numerous groups trying to understand and uncover this truth. So hard to believe in Australia, this crime was committed against more than 200,000 Mums and babies. Yet in the previous decades — care and protection was the usual outcome.


I thank you for the opportunity to tell a small part of my experience.


I do not think any of us can imagine the incredible hurt that Mrs Kinghorn must feel but, because of her strength, resilience and determination, and the determination of the many mothers like her not to let this go, we can be here today to have this apology. We can also ensure that we understand what happened, say sorry for what happened, acknowledge all of the people affected and never again preside over policies and practices that will cause such unbearable hurt to families. Whether it is the mothers, the fathers, the children who were taken or their siblings, they all were and continue to be deeply affected by what happened to them.


Hopefully some in later years have, at the very least, had the opportunity to find out what happened and to meet some of their family members. Many simply will just never know. For all of that heartbreak, it is fitting that we offer, as this parliament, the most heartfelt apology. We are sorry.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (16:23):  Thank you to the minister for sharing that story. I think it is often the case that, when we are doing things in the parliament, it is the personal stories that people bring in here that can really frame these issues in our minds, and obviously that story is one of the ones where we can see just how tough these policies were on people and the enormous human toll that they took.


I will not use all of my time but I just want to take the opportunity to add my voice to the national apology for forced adoptions and removals. It is astonishing to find, when we look back, that it is actually not that long ago and how cruel these policies were for the people who were involved. For the parliament to come together, as we did in the last sitting period, and offer an apology on behalf of the people of Australia for what occurred is a very important thing that this parliament has done.


I will confess that, in the past when the parliament has come together to issue some of these apologies, I have sometimes been a bit, I suppose, cynical about the benefits of them.


But when you see the effect they have on people who have been affected by the policies, and the effect that the national apology can have, any of those thoughts are dispelled. I must admit I felt the same way about the national apology that was given by former Prime Minister Rudd on behalf of the country to Aboriginal people in Australia. To see the effect that had on the people and what it meant to them I think would dispel even the most cynical of thoughts about the importance of the national parliament taking these stands and saying on behalf of the nation that we are sorry for some of the things that have happened in our nation's past.


When we are talking about forced adoptions we are really talking about policies which, certainly to our eyes today, seem unimaginably cruel, and the institutionalised nature of the fact. We need to understand that the standards were so different back then. Even though it is not that long ago, the way people were treated was different. If you were a single mother in the 1950s and 1960s social stigma was attached to that. There was inability really to have any power over the situation. If you were a single mother it might be that your family would not want you to have contact with the father, perhaps the father just refused to take any responsibility and there was nothing at the time to ensure fathers would be forced to face up to the consequences of their actions. You could certainly impregnate somebody and then disown your responsibilities, and that happened to a lot of women, unfortunately, during those times. Then the stigma attached to them by society for being single mothers was crushing. A lot of families would not have anything to do with a daughter who found herself in this situation. They had so few options because it was not the case back then, as it is the case today, that you could rely on the social security system for support, for instance. If you were a single mother and you found yourself in these circumstances, your options for how you would support yourself and support your family would be incredibly limited. Obviously, for mothers facing these circumstances it was incredibly difficult.


I join with the parliament and say that I think this is the right motion on behalf of the country. I think it is good that the parliament has come together to apologise for forced adoptions and I add my voice to the parliament's motion. I think it is a very worthy thing for the parliament to have done.

"Collins, Julie, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (16:27):  What a privilege it was to be in the Great Hall on 21 March when the Prime Minister issued the national apology for people affected by past forced adoptions. To be in that room and to have the privilege of the people nearby to share their experiences with you was incredibly moving. They were so resilient, but you could see that the pain and the sadness affected every single one of them, and that was just people who were able to be there on that day. No doubt the experience of the past adoption practices affected them very deeply. 


It was a very long journey indeed for many of these people to make it to Parliament House to hear that apology, which acknowledged the past wrongs and the dreadful hurts which were caused. That we are here today acknowledging this terrible hurt is testament to the courage, persistence and determination of many but particularly the mothers who fought for so long to have their voices heard. Saying sorry is such a vital first step towards recognising the trauma we caused and beginning the journey of healing. 


However, it equates to just hollow words unless there is also swift and tangible action to accompany it. That is why immediately following the apology the Prime Minister announced that the government would fund measures of $11.5 million over four years. We know that there were approximately 150,000 forced adoptions in Australia. The constant message during the consultations on the forced adoption apology was that unless the apology was backed up with specific practical measures it would be just words. Almost all of the people consulted wanted counselling by appropriately trained staff, with an emphasis on mental health services. They wanted a cost-free, one-stop shop for searches for birth certificates, deaths and marriages and to ensure hospital records were preserved and available to be searched without cost. Another frequent request was for a lasting commemoration.


The government, of course, responded. Our response was: $5 million for improved access to specialist support services, $5 million for training and guidelines for mental health professionals and $1½ million for the National Archives to deliver the Forced Adoptions History Project. The Attorney-General's Department will progress resolution of the issues relating to integrated birth certificates and will investigate the harmonisation of and access to judicial birth, death and marriage registers. The package of measures also includes an immediate investment of funds for the Access to Allied Psychological Services program, where, through their GPs, people who were affected by past forced adoptions will have priority access to a mental health professional.


The package also includes funding to develop guidelines and training for health professionals to increase awareness of forced adoption issues. Awareness of this shameful chapter in Australia's history among the broader population is also paramount. For this reason we will be funding the National Archives of Australia for a public education and awareness exhibition and a website which will allow people affected by past forced adoptions to give voice to their experience.


But we know that people who have lived through the trauma of past forced adoptions need much more than this. They need services to support them to gain access to the information which tells their experience—the information from hospitals, maternity homes and other places where records are held. We also know that people affected by past forced adoptions need peer and professional support to help them with their journey of understanding and healing. We need to design services that strengthen, complement and enhance what is already available to ensure we can meet their needs and expectations. This means making sure that people who have experienced past forced adoptions have a voice in the development of these services. I will soon be announcing a process to ensure we have representation from these people—including mothers, fathers and adult adopted persons—so that their experiences can positively contribute to an improved system.


If we are going to make a lasting impact on people's lives by helping in the process of healing from the terrible injustices which have occurred, we must take the time to get this right. We need to find out what currently exists; where there are strengths, weaknesses and gaps in services; and how a system of support can best meet the needs of people affected by forced adoptions. Through these measures, the government is committed to ensuring that the voices of those affected are heard and continue to be heard, and that those people are supported throughout the difficult process of healing. We are sorry.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (16:32):  I start by congratulating the previous speaker for her speech. This is obviously a subject which is very difficult for people, and she gave an excellent speech. On that note, I also congratulate the member for Swan for his speech in the chamber on this issue. For those people who did not have the privilege of hearing the member for Swan in the chamber when we last sat, which was, I think, seven weeks ago, it was one of the best speeches that has been given in this term of the parliament. I commend that speech to anyone with an interest in this issue. As someone who lived through the reality of this issue, the way that he clearly, concisely and emotionally dealt with the issue was an absolute credit and testament to him. In that regard also I think credit is due to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, who also spoke extremely well on this issue.


Both sides of the parliament came together to recognise this issue and to work in a bipartisan way to make sure that there was a national apology for forced adoptions and removal policies and practices. By making that apology, we were able as a parliament to recognise the errors that occurred. It is absolutely vital for those who have suffered to have the reassurance that the national parliament has recognised that what went on was wrong and that it has been prepared to do the right thing, admit that and make this apology.


The government has also put revenue towards trying to help deal with the situation, and I commend the government for doing that. Obviously that was supported by the coalition, rightly, and hopefully those policies which have been put in place as a result of this national apology can help those people who are still dealing with this issue and in many cases have had to deal with it for most of their lives.


I would like to go back to the member for Swan's speech because, having not lived through this, I think it is difficult to understand what the consequences would be. He talked about being reunited with his brother and the emotion of that and also what his brother and he had had to live through until they were reunited and until, slowly, other members of the family were also reunited. I think it is extremely telling. As someone who grew up as one of six children, I cannot imagine what it would have been like to discover members of your family when you were at the age of 45 or 51, as was the case with the member for Swan.


I commend all members of the House for the national apology, and I commend all those who have made statements on it. I think there have been some very moving speeches from our two leaders and, most importantly, from someone who has lived through this and to whom this meant so much. It is an honour for me to stand here to support this apology and to commend those who have also done so.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (16:37):  I am pleased to speak to the motion moved by the Attorney-General in the House of Representatives on Thursday, 21 March, to formally apologise for past practices and policies that forced the separation of mothers from their babies. These policies and practices are a shameful part of our past and resulted in such sadness, pain and suffering for so many mothers, fathers and children as well as brothers, sisters and extended family. I am pleased that the government and the parliament in a bipartisan way is taking responsibility and formally apologising for these practices. I hope that this apology will be a step in the healing process for many Australians who have had their children forcibly removed from them and for the children who grew up not knowing their parents.


When listening to the experiences of mothers who had their children forcibly removed, it struck me that they not only experienced and continue to experience the grief and trauma of losing one's child and not only were denied the fundamental rights and responsibilities to love and care for their child but they were also treated so badly—being shamed and shunned by our society. One of these mothers is Roslyn Sponheimer. In 1963 Roslyn fell pregnant at the age of 17 and was immediately made to feel shameful. Her parents and GP mapped out her future, which she had no say in. She was to resign from her work and lie to her friends and family, saying that she was leaving to work in the country. Instead, she was to enter the Kate Cock's Home for Unmarried Mothers in Brighton, Adelaide, under a false name. She was to live there until the baby was born and then return home, leaving her baby behind. When Roslyn reflects back to her time at the home she says that there was no concept of informed consent and it was just accepted that after giving birth mothers were to leave their babies behind. No alternatives were ever discussed. In Roslyn's words:


So there we were. A bunch of society outcasts, brainwashed into submission and suffering feelings of such low esteem and low self worth that I can say it has impacted on every decision I have made in life since.


After a long and difficult birth, Roslyn was able to see her son for five minutes. She recounted that she could still remember every detail of his face as he looked up at her.


After the birth Roslyn was sedated and confined to bed for five days as a result of toxaemia. On the seventh day, when she was able to get up and move around, Roslyn recounts:


… the Deaconess called me into the waiting room. She said, 'I have a form for you to sign.' She then asked me if there was any request I had of the adopting parents. All I could think to say was, 'Don't make him learn the piano if he doesn't want to.'  She then asked me if I wanted to name the baby. I said I didn't want to remember a name, thinking it would somehow be easier if she named him instead. She said she would name him after her own husband. She then handed the form to me to sign.


After two weeks in hospital, Roslyn was given tablets to dry up her milk and told to go home. Roslyn's family never mentioned the birth of her son, and for a long time Roslyn went along with that silence. She said that it was only when she had her daughter and son later on that she understood what had been stolen from her. Roslyn said:


To survive mentally, I had to put it to the back of my mind. Due to the laws of our land, I couldn't search for my son until he turned eighteen and so I just had to grieve in private. Even my husband didn't seem to have any understanding of what I was going through.


Roslyn attempted to search for her son when he turned 18, but to no avail, as there was not any support to do so. Despite a desperate search she found only dead ends. To add insult to injury, a social worker from the Department of Community Welfare at the time called Roslyn to inform her that there had been a complaint from the Methodist mission which had been responsible for the adoption, and that she had to stop looking for her son.


After 22 years, Roslyn was able to locate her son via a government department and was reunited with him in 1986. Since the reunion, however, Roslyn has attended various counselling sessions but has been unable to completely come to terms with the loss of her baby. Even though her son is now 49, is married and has his own children, it has taken most of the 27 years since her reunion with her son for her to feel that she could be herself around him. Looking back on what happened to her, Roslyn feels that she was denied the opportunity to express normal feelings of anger, hurt and emotional pain and that she has been left with an aching void which will never be filled. 


Unfortunately, Roslyn's story is one of so many mothers around the country who had their babies forcibly removed. Approximately 150,000 to 250,000 babies of unwed and mostly teenage mothers were forcibly removed from the 1950s to the mid-1970s in Australia. These mothers and fathers were betrayed by a system that gave them no choice and subjected them to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice. These actions deeply damaged not only the mothers, fathers and families but also the children. 


The motion before the House also apologises to the children who were adopted or removed who were led to believe that their mothers had rejected them and who were denied the opportunity to grow up with their family and community. These children grew up not knowing how much they were loved, and many still report a constant struggle with their identity, uncertainty and loss and feel a persistent tension between loyalty to one family and a yearning for another. One of these people is Annette from Aldinga in my electorate, who was taken from her unmarried mother in 1954. Born out of wedlock, Annette was a child of the forced adoption policy. Annette finds solace in the fact that her mother hung on to her and refused to sign the forms to release her from her custody for six weeks. Annette says that what happened next has impacted her entire life. After being separated from her mother, Annette was adopted in 1954 by a family that needed more hands on their farm, and she spent her time after school not relaxing or socialising with her peers but performing manual labour for her adoptive family. At the age of five, Annette was given a book titled The Chosen Baby, but Annette did not feel lucky for being chosen, as she said she had to deal with the grief of believing that she was not wanted by her biological mother and of having an unhappy childhood with her adoptive family.


As Annette grew older she attempted to conduct research into where she had come from, to heal the pain she had from not belonging. But as if to rub salt into the wounds, Annette was incredibly upset that she was made to pay for any information that you could find in the state records. Everything that happened to Annette as a child still affects her today. But she worries also for her own children, who, because of the lack of a family—they have no uncles, aunties, grandparents or cousins—will not appreciate the role the extended family plays. Because of the forced adoption policies that removed  Annette from her mother, her children have been denied the opportunity to have a family network. They lack the support that an extended family provides.


These are just two stories from my electorate, but I know there are many more right around a country. We can never make up for the trauma, pain, loss, disconnection and separation that has been caused by the forced adoption processes, policies and procedures. We have heard from the Prime Minister that the government, and indeed the parliament, is committed to doing what we can to help those affected by forced adoption practices, to help families reconnect and to help adoptees find their families. The government will provide funding towards support services and recognition of the people affected by forced adoption policies and practices. This includes the Allied Psychological Services Program, which will give families high priority in accessing important mental health services, and funding for the National Archives of Australia to undertake a history and recognition process for those affected by forced adoption policies.


The government is also establishing a Past Forced Adoption Practices Implementation Working Group, whose members will represent the mothers and fathers of the children of past forced adoptions. This group will perform a key advisory role to the government on the implementation of services and projects. It will also provide a platform for national consultation and communication between the government, advocacy groups, peak bodies, non-government organisations and service providers in the time leading up to implementation.


We all expect the right to determine our own direction in life, and part of that is enabling us to nurture, care for and love our children. But during this dark period our society has deliberately denied many this opportunity. While we can never fully make up for what has happened to these families in the past, we will make sure that these practices are never repeated. To Roslyn, Annette and all those who have been affected by these practices, we say sorry.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (16:47):  I thank the member for Kingston for her moving speech. I know how passionate she is about these issues, and we could see the emotion in her face as she related to us so very well that harrowing story about Roslyn, which we would all concur is a rather tragic tale. I also commend the member for Swan for his 21 March speech to the House of Representatives on this subject. I think you could have heard a pin drop while he was speaking, and that is a rarity in the House of Representatives. The words he expressed and the emotion he showed that day were a lesson for all of us about how important this is, how wrong the practice was and how far we have moved as a society.


Adoption emerged in Australian legislation in the early 20th century. In the early stages it was generally an open process and often involved the adoption of older children, as opposed to infants. After World War II, society changed its perception of adoption, and the idea of the adoption of infants became more acceptable. Adoption was seen as the solution to the societal stigmas of infertility and illegitimacy, and also spared these children from spending their childhood in institutions.


In the 1950s, adoption legislation was amended throughout Australia to remove the openness of earlier legislation and ensure adoptions occurred through a closed process. It was thought at the time that this would help the adoptive parents to ensure that they were seen as, and felt like, the natural parents of their babies. This was referred to as the 'clean break theory', which was developed by Sigmund and Anna Freud. It was seen as the best outcome for both the birth mother and the baby. Furthermore, those who supported this theory believed it was important in ensuring that the bonding between the adoptive mother and the child was not interrupted. Whilst many women willingly placed their babies up for adoption with religious organisations, adoption agencies and through other measures, the sad and shocking reality is that a number of women were forced to place their babies up for adoption usually because they were unmarried. Young women and their families, and indeed society, felt they were not fit to take care of their children.


The Senate Standing Committees on Community Affairs released a report in 2012, entitled 'Commonwealth contribution to former forced adoption policies and practices' after an extensive inquiry into former forced adoptions in Australia's history. The report states it was incontrovertible that forced adoption was common, but it was not possible to estimate the number of forced adoptions that had taken place as statistics from the era do not indicate why a child was placed for adoption, nor whether the parent or parents had willingly consented. Previous parliamentary inquiries into past adoption practices have been undertaken by the New South Wales and Tasmanian parliaments. Both parliaments found such practices had caused a considerable amount of pain and suffering, especially for parents who had been pressured to place their child up for adoption. The New South Wales report went as far as to say there had been a number of practices which were unethical and even unlawful.


Forced adoption occurred in Australia for more than 50 years, from 1930 until 1982; however, most of these adoptions took place from the 1950s to the 1970s. Society at that time held different views than those of today. White, married couples with a secure income were seen as the ideal family unit and regarded as the most capable of providing the necessary care for children. On the other hand, having a child out of wedlock and the lack of financial support for single mothers meant there was a widespread view that adopting the babies of these unmarried women was in the best interests of the child.


There are numerous reports of women who were forced to pass their baby up for adoption gaining access to their hospital records later in life to find their file had been automatically stamped 'BFA'—baby for adoption—due to their being an unmarried woman, before they had even given birth or signed any adoption papers. Lina Eve was one woman who discovered her files have been stamped. She said:


My medical records have “BFA” stamped on them...even though I had said from the start I wanted to keep my baby. So its clear to me they had the adoption of my child as their intention all along.


Most mothers were unmarried at the time they gave birth and were sent to maternity homes for all or some of their pregnancy, a decision usually made by their parents. Many did not have pleasant experiences in these homes, having their possessions removed and being prevented from having any outside contact with supporters they had. They were made to work without pay and were subjected to pressures to put their babies up for adoption. Ann Allpike made a submission to the Senate committee stating:


The emphasis was always on adoption being what was ‘best for the child’—‘if you love your baby then you will give it up for adoption’. … I was not treated as an expectant mother but rather encouraged to think of my baby as not being mine but belonging to some perfect deserving married couple.


The experience of giving birth was also not pleasant for many women who were considered to be putting their babies up for adoption even if they had not already given consent. Women recall being medicated, strapped to the bed and ignored or abused by medical staff. Jan Kashin stated to the Senate committee:


Certainly by 1963 the practice of hiding the baby from the mother giving birth was well established. The sheet went up on cue. The drugging was mandatory for unmarried women, as was … the shackling to the labour ward bed.


Babies from unmarried mothers were quickly whisked away, with most never touching and many never seeing their baby. It was remarkably traumatic for a woman who had been shunned by society and quite likely by her family to not be allowed to have contact with the child she had been carrying for nine months—the reason she had been shunned in the first place. Medical staff at the time, and indeed midwives and nurses who submitted evidence to the Senate committee, believed it was kinder to remove the baby from the start than to allow the mother and baby to bond before the baby was removed from the mother at a later date, which would have caused further and, in some people's opinion, 'unnecessary' distress.


Following the birth of their child, these women were left to get on with their lives as if nothing had happened. Many returned home and were treated as if they had been on vacation, but described having a strained relationship with their parents often for the rest of their parents' lives. Others started over somewhere new, holding what they felt was a shameful secret inside. No matter what, all these women got on with their lives still longing for the baby they knew had been wrongfully taken from them.


The effects of forced adoption are immeasurable. This practice affected not only the mothers and babies but also the fathers of these children and the families which these people have gone on to have later in life. While some women shared their past with husbands, partners and children, others have held onto this secret for a lifetime. Indeed, some women stated to the committee that their submission was the first time they had spoken about their past since the incident had occurred.


For some women the pain of their past was too much to live with and, sadly, they have taken their own lives. How tragic is that! For some, searching for their lost children has consumed their lives. For others, the trauma of what they went through has caused strain on relationships and family dynamics. Some women have lived normal lives but held this pain inside for a long, long time. No two women have dealt with their grief in exactly the same way. In the same way, no two people deal with grief in exactly the same way. No matter what, though, all these women have had to deal with a horrific experience to which they should never have been subjected.


The Senate committee reported that they received a number of submissions regarding how adopted people felt about their adoption. An overwhelming majority described unhappy childhoods—being placed in abusive families and struggling with their self-identity and a need to know who they were. Whilst they were in the minority, submissions were received by the committee from people who held no bitterness towards either their birth mothers or their adoptive families. 


I also read a comment from Kristene Wood, a child who was placed into forced adoption, on the Facebook page of my parliamentary colleague the member for Dawson, George Christensen. Ms Wood wrote:


I am a child of forced adoption, and I wouldn't have had it any other way. I was lucky. I have biological brothers and sisters who were not so lucky. And in saying this, I do not take away from them the love that they have for their/our mother but as a result of circumstances they grew up as products of the system, in orphanages, foster homes and the abuse that entailed ... I thank you for the beautiful parents I received, for their love and support throughout my life. Although they are now both dead, I wish that I could have them back every day. I was lucky I was able to thank my biological mum before she too passed away ...


Ms Wood was lucky to be able to meet her biological mother and pass on her eternal gratitude. And I am sure there are many children from this era who would also want to let their mothers know that they have had a good life and are grateful for the life they have lived. This does not excuse the fact that these children were taken away from their mothers, but I hope knowing their child still received a happy and loving upbringing can bring their mothers some comfort.


On 21 March this year, the Prime Minister apologised for the 'policies and practices that forced the separation of mothers from their babies, which created a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering'. This apology was issued following one of the recommendations of the Senate committee's report. And, whilst it cannot change the past and it will not take away the anguish and trauma of these events, hopefully this formal recognition can assist in the healing process for all those affected by forced adoptions.


Barbara Maison said in her submission:


We need to be respected in this country's history as mothers who had their babies taken forcibly from them for no other reason than to satisfy the ideals of others. We need to be respected in this country's history as mothers who were unjustly abused, betrayed and punished by all governments, hospital staff, welfare workers, religious hierarchies and society because of their inhumane, obscene prejudice towards us.


To Ms Maison I say: we do respect you and all the other mothers who went through similar experiences to yours. This apology will help ensure your part in Australia's history is acknowledged and recorded as you would like it to be. May it help to ensure nothing of this nature occurs again.


As the Leader of the Opposition stated:


Whenever adoptions take place, they have to be chosen and they have to be for the right reasons.


People have a right to make choices and they deserve our love and respect whatever choices they make.


Whilst there can be no excuse for forced adoptions in the past, before I finish I would like to note that not all adoptions were carried out under such circumstances. I was contacted by a constituent from a small town in my electorate, who requested I do not use her name so as to ensure her family's privacy is protected. She wished for me to make this point clear. This constituent and her husband adopted children during the 1970s—two children who have grown up knowing about, as she put it, their natural backgrounds. When they approached the adoption agency it was made clear to them that the agency would be looking for parents deemed to be most suitable for the children and not the other way around. They were extensively interviewed, and filled out countless forms, which required answering a number of very personal questions—rightly so, as this ensured children were only going to be placed in loving, caring homes. My constituents were overcome with joy when they found out that they had been successful in gaining approval to be adoptive parents to two children they love and cherish. I am sure these constituents are not alone in wishing to be acknowledged as parents who gave their children a loving home. Not all adoptions which occurred during a certain period of the Australia's history were carried out through unethical measures.

Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (17:00):  I was certainly privileged to attend the national apology for forced adoptions in the Great Hall on 21 March in the company of many of those who had undergone a forced adoption experience. It was certainly a very humbling and touching event. I am glad that we, as a parliament, had come together in a truly bipartisan way to support this apology. We saw the same happen with the apology to the stolen generation. I think it is very important that we do reconcile some of these less compassionate periods of our history. At times there was a different thinking. I believe that many of those involved in these particular events genuinely in their own way believed that they were doing the best for both the child and the parent. Clearly, with the benefit of hindsight, we know that this was absolutely not the case, as we have seen in this particular initiative.


As we have seen, as a result of the policy of the day there were literally hundreds of thousands of Australians adopted. In many of these situations the mothers had no meaningful choice and, even worse, were absolutely and totally denied any choice at all in what occurred with their child. We as a society have been left with that legacy—hundreds of thousands of mothers who never knew their children and those same children were left not knowing who their mothers or fathers were. As opposition leader, Tony Abbott, said in his address, this is a tragedy for them. It is also a tragedy for our nation and we must atone for it.


I hope for those affected by the forced adoptions, whether they are the mothers, the fathers or other family members, that the apology has helped to provide some level of healing and some level of closure. I do accept, however, that these issues and impacts surrounding forced adoption are complex and for some will never be resolved. For mothers having their babies that they have loved and nurtured, carried for nine months and given birth to, taken from them without even a look or a touch would be truly heartbreaking. Surely a cry from the child at this point must echo with them for the rest of their lives. The children, who were often taken so young that they did not know any different, still had to come to terms with the knowledge later in life that they were adopted. Even the most loving stable childhood—and I have to congratulate those adoptive parents who provided this—could not prevent feelings of disconnection for many of those children.


This is an issue that is very close to my heart. I would like to highlight two special people that have their own stories to tell. Rae Whitbourne is a grandmother from my region who featured recently in the Cairns Post, the local newspaper, on the day before of the national apology. Her story is not unusual amongst forced adoptions but that does not make it any less distressing. Rae fell pregnant at a young age after running a bit wild in country Victoria. She was taken to a Church of England home in Melbourne where there were a number of other girls in a similar condition. As their due date drew near, the girls were transferred to the Queen Victoria Hospital where Rae said that they were treated with near contempt by the staff. There was a stigma around them that they were 'bad' and that they had 'got into trouble'. Rae was just 14. After a dramatic delivery, she gave birth to a son, James. She wanted to hold him, but he was whisked away. 'I could hear him crying and I wanted to go to him, but I wasn't allowed,' she recalled. Rae was very vulnerable and certainly very confused and she did not know how to resist the next day when authorities came and forced her to sign adoption papers, saying it was 'best' for the boy.


More than two decades later, when her youngest child was 16, Rae eventually told her other children about their older brother. The long journey started in trying to track him down—writing to different organisations, but always coming up against a brick wall. Luckily, her son was also looking for his mother. They eventually reunited and now have a positive relationship. Rae was fortunate in that she had the opportunity to eventually meet her son. But for others, the failure to connect with their roots is frustrating and very heart-rending.


Peter Gries is a constituent of mine in Cairns. He was born in 1956 to a 16-year-old unmarried mother in a country town. While waiting for her due date, his mother was put into a home for unmarried mothers. In Peter's words: 'My adoptive parents were phoned a couple of days before my mother was due to give birth and were told ""The next one's yours."" My birth mother was not allowed any contact with me, whatsoever.' He is one who had a very happy childhood with his adoptive family. When, at the age of about five, he asked his parents where he had come from, they celebrated the fact that he was adopted. He said, 'With my adoptive parents I was made to feel very special. They said they had me because they really wanted me'. He recalled: 'I had a brother four years older, who was adopted in the same circumstances. But different people handle things differently. I felt I was very special but my brother had very strong feelings of abandonment.' In later years, Peter did feel a void when it came to his family history. When he went to his local doctor and was asked if he had a history of heart trouble or other genetic diseases he had to answer that he just did not know. 


He registered with Jigsaw, the post-adoption support organisation, but found it very limited in the amount of information he could access. Unfortunately, at the time, information-sharing was only possible if both sides had registered with the organisation. Peter's brother also had no luck in finding his mother. It has certainly had an effect on him and on his experiences as a parent. Peter told me that after receiving no information through Jigsaw or other agencies he had 'hit a brick wall'. He said, 'I tried to put it out of my head and forget about it—but then the apology brought it all back to the surface.' 


Recently he contacted my office. He asked: 'Now that the adoption apology has been made, what assistance will be given to those desperate to make contact but who have been met with closed doors? At 57 years of age there cannot be much time to connect with the birth mother I was taken from.' He was desperate for help. Peter would like to see more accessibility for people wanting to find out about their families. 'I wish there were a helpline that could guide me in the right direction—a mediation service or something like that,' he has reflected.


This is a very important point for us to recognise. Given that the apology may have brought these repressed feelings to the surface, I certainly urge this House to make sure that as a society we are providing an appropriate level of support for those affected. This includes not just emotional support but also help to reconnect these families that have been divided for so long.


I understand that this apology is just one step in a long journey to healing, understanding and getting those affected families back in touch with each other. Nevertheless, I have to say that I am very pleased to be able to stand here today offering my very, very strong support for this motion for those in our community who have been affected so adversely and profoundly by these forced adoption practices of the past. Let us learn from this dreadful experience and make sure this type of thing does not happen into our future.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2013-05-15,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (17:10):  It is with a heavy heart that I rise to join the previous speakers to speak on this motion in relation to the national apology on forced adoptions and, on behalf of the people of Gippsland, get our voice to the people affected by the forced adoption policies of the past. In doing so, I do not intend to quote the entire apology, but I think it is worthwhile to quote a couple of the extracts. I quote:


Today, this Parliament, on behalf of the Australian people, takes responsibility and apologises for the policies and practices that forced the separation of mothers from their babies, which created a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering.


We acknowledge the profound effects of these policies and practices on fathers.


And we recognise the hurt these actions caused to brothers and sisters, grandparents, partners and extended family members.


…   …   …


We say sorry to you, the mothers who were denied knowledge of your rights, which meant you could not provide informed consent. You were given false assurances. You were forced to endure the coercion and brutality of practices that were unethical, dishonest and in many cases illegal.


…   …   …


We offer this apology in the hope that it will assist your healing and in order to shine a light on a dark period of our nation’s history.


…   …   …


We resolve, as a nation, to do all in our power to make sure these practices are never repeated. In facing future challenges, we will remember the lessons of family separation. Our focus will be on protecting the fundamental rights of children and on the importance of the child’s right to know and be cared for by his or her parents.


As a personal message to the many people in my community who have contacted me in relation to this national apology I simply assure them: 'You did nothing wrong. You had the misfortune of living in a severely judgemental era of our nation's history and you did nothing wrong.'


The background to the national apology on forced adoptions is important. In February last year, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee released its report into those practices, and the report found that the policies and practices that resulted in forced adoptions and the removal of children were widespread throughout Australia, particularly during the mid-twentieth century. The Senate committee inquiry received submissions from hundreds of individuals who had suffered from the effects of forced adoptions and found that there were many different ways in which these forced adoptions occurred. The accounts provided in that report are shocking and graphic for anyone who has read them. They range from experiences of mothers being drugged and physically shackled to beds, to social workers failing to advise mothers of government payments that may have been available to support them to keep their child.


These forced adoption practices impacted a large number of Australians and caused significant ongoing effects for many people, particularly the mothers and also the fathers and the adoptees themselves. The report concluded that it is impossible to know the exact number of people who have been affected by these forced adoption practices but that it does number in the tens of thousands of Australians.


While I accept that an apology, no matter how well framed, how well meant, how well intentioned and how well supported by members of this place, cannot undo suffering that has been experienced by those who have been affected by forced adoptions, I hope that the apology will be accepted in the way that it has been offered by members in this place in the hope that it will provide a significant step in the healing process for the mothers, the fathers, the adoptees and their extended family members who were adversely affected by these practices.


It is a great example of this parliament at work when we have such bipartisan support for an issue of such importance, and I do commend the leaders of our two major parties, the member for Warringah and the member for Lalor, on their speeches in the Great Hall. It was a great occasion, befitting the Great Hall. I will quote the Leader of the Opposition, who said:


But hundreds of thousands of Australians have been adopted, often, because their mothers had no real choice or were denied any choice and that means that there are hundreds of thousands of mothers who hardly knew their children and hundreds of thousands of children who hardly knew their mothers.


He went on to say:


We were hard-hearted and we were judgmental and that’s why we should apologise.


We did inflict pain on those we loved and on those we had a responsibility for.


For some, we turned what should been the wonderful experience of new life into something filled with shame.


Instead of love, there was reproach;


Instead of support, rejection;


Instead of celebration, silence;


And instead of justice, there was wrongdoing.


And from the Prime Minister:


Today’s historic moment has only been made possible by the bravery of those who came forward to make submissions to the Senate Committee and also of those who couldn’t come forward but who nurtured hope silently in their hearts.


Because of your courage, Australia now knows the truth.


I will talk about the courage of one brave woman in my electorate, a woman by the name of Brenda Coughlan, who has been a fearless supporter and campaigner for people who have been affected by the policy of forced adoptions. Brenda has helped to lead the fight for this apology. Her baby was taken from her without her consent when at just 17 she fell pregnant and delivered her baby. Even though she was in a loving relationship with the child's father she was coerced into giving up her child for adoption. In her evidence provided at the Inquiry into the Handling of Child Abuse by Religious and Other Organisations held by the Victorian parliament's Family and Community Development Committee, Brenda said:


My body was forcibly examined without consent, not by 1, not by 2 but by up to 12 male medical students at a time — different hands, without consent, brutally and cruelly thrust inside my body one after the other, over and over again; at the same time, strangers’ hands cruelly pulling at my breasts, pushing at my stomach, with the excuse given that … it was just part of medical students’ training.


She went on to say:


I was eventually able to train my mind to visualise on an item in the cubicle so that the pain and the trespassing on my body by a group of males could be endured. I was barbarically and criminally tied down with shackles. I was torturously treated during labour. I was entrapped. I was defenceless. I was petrified and frightened.


I make no apology for the graphic nature of the evidence, because it needs to be told.


The hurt, anger and disillusionment with the medical profession resulting from that treatment obviously lingers with Brenda today. Brenda is not someone who has pursued this case for any material gains—she is not interested in compensation—but she wants to make sure that such atrocities never occur again. She said to me during a recent discussion in my office:


This is not about money, because my daughter was never for sale. Money can never compensate me for the pain and loss my daughter and I have endured.


It is a remarkable tribute to Brenda that in addition to working so hard campaigning for victims of forced adoptions she has found the energy within herself to open her heart to orphans in Asia and has actually organised ongoing practical support for those less-fortunate children.


I must say that Brenda has been through an emotional roller-coaster, and it is fair to say that she was disappointed with some aspects of the national apology. It was an intensely emotional time for all the people involved in this issue. She was disappointed because she was concerned it did not include a specific reference to the mistreatment that I have just highlighted in relation to the medical profession. I wrote to the Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus, on her behalf to raise her concerns in relation to the failure of the apology to identify that specific reference to the medical profession. I thank the Attorney-General for his most recent reply, which I will put on the record:


Although the national apology did not specifically mention the treatment of mothers in Victorian hospitals, it did acknowledge the manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice that many mothers experienced as a result of forced adoption policies and practices. It also acknowledged that many mothers were denied their rights, given false assurances and forced to endure coercion and the brutality of practices that were often unethical, dishonest and in many cases illegal. Not including references to specific situations ensured that the apology included the widest possible range of people affected by forced adoption practices.


The Attorney-General went on to point out that there has been a formal statement of apology from the Victorian government and that Melbourne's Royal Women's Hospital and Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital issued apologies on 23 January and 20 March this year for their involvement in forced adoption policies. I think it is important that it is on the record, because, for people like Brenda, the abuse and the violence that she endured will live with her for the rest of her life.


The national apology for forced adoptions is obviously not the end of the story for the people who were hurt by these policies. We cannot, by any stretch, pretend in this place that we can take away the pain or the suffering that they endured and that was inflicted on our fellow countrymen and countrywomen, but we can resolve to ensure that such atrocities are never repeated and to support those broken-hearted souls during the remainder of their lives. I do hope that through this apology, through the extraordinary support across both sides of politics, we can give some comfort to people like Brenda as they continue their life's journey. I commend the apology to the House.

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (17:21):  I am very pleased to join all the speakers on this very important motion. Like many contributors to this discussion, I joined Prime Minister Julia Gillard on 21 March this year when she apologised on behalf of the Australian people for the policies and practices that forced the separation of mothers from their babies. As we have heard so much, these policies and practices did create a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering for the mothers, the fathers, the daughters and the sons. As a government, we recognised and acknowledged the profound effects of these policies and practices, and offered the apology in good faith and with very deep humility. I saw firsthand how moved people were to hear the Prime Minister's deeply held and deeply felt words, recognising the wrongs that happened in the past and committing to ensuring they do not happen again in the future. 


To redress the shameful mistakes of the past, we are ensuring that all those affected get the help that they need, including access to specialist counselling services and support, the ability to find the truth in freely available records and assistance in reconnecting with lost family. Following the national apology, we tabled our response to the recommendations of the Senate inquiry and announced $11½ million in concrete measures and actions the government will be taking to assist those who have been affected. This includes $5 million so that mental health professionals can better assist in caring for those affected by forced adoption. It includes increased investment in the access to allied psychological services—a program in the Department of Health and Ageing—to make sure that people are connected to mental health professionals. To make sure that the survivors of forced adoptions can receive the support to cope with past pain and hurt, this increased availability to psychological services has already started and people can access this service through their general practitioner. 


To support those affected towards healing and recovery, the government have also invested $5 million to improve access to specialist services and supported records tracing. We will also work closely with state and territory governments to consider how best to invest the government's support to complement and enhance services. It is vital that current and future generations are made aware of this terrible chapter in Australia's history. To address this matter, we have provided $1½ million for the National Archives of Australia to develop an exhibition and a website to share and raise awareness of the experiences of those affected by forced adoption. That way this chapter in our nation's history will not be marginalised or forgotten again.


We plan to launch the website on the first anniversary of the apology in 2014 and the exhibition on the second anniversary in 2015. The involvement of the people who have been most affected—the mothers, fathers and the now adult children—is critical in informing our approach to these measures. We are establishing a Past Forced Adoptions Implementation Working Group to give advice to the government on rolling out these measures and also the other actions in response to the recommendations of the Senate inquiry. The government wants to develop these important support programs and so avenues will be made available for people to have a say about each of them.


Through the national apology we have acknowledged the shameful mistakes of the past and the importance of people speaking out about these past injustices. Through the strength and resolve of those affected, the time of neglect is over and we can now look forward to healing.

Dr STONE
 (Murray) (17:26):  On 21 March 2013 I sat down next to one of the victims of the forced adoption policies in the Great Hall of this parliament. We had a while to wait for the commencement of the ceremony and so we talked about his life, the sad life that he has had. He has had even more tragedies visited upon him since the initial trauma of his removal from his mother as a newborn. It seems that this incredibly courageous and stoical man, now in his fifties, was one of the many who, perhaps because of diminished responsibility or care, became one of the great many who were subject to medical experimentation, and so he now has serious ongoing health problems.


Michael explained that a series of invasive procedures and the administration of dangerous and, as it turned out, sometimes contaminated drugs left him sterile, stunted and with prostate disease. This he developed when he was still a teenager. He has also had cancer since he was 25. He has suffered, and continues to suffer, a great deal. This very special man, who has given me permission to use his name and pass on his story, has been advocating for proper compensation for himself and his fellow sufferers who were also used as medical guinea pigs in the 1960s and 1970s. More than 200 boys were subject to these treatments, usually prompted by them being short. It was then referred to as 'a failure to thrive'.


Michael O'Meara was born to his then unwed mother in 1961 at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne. His mother wed a few months later. Michael did find and meet his mother in 1989, but tragically she died of cancer shortly after. When his mother was in labour delivering Michael, she was administered LSD as a sedative. This further complicated the birth and affected the baby's kidneys. Michael was recruited into the growth hormone clinic at Prince Henry's Hospital in 1972 when he was just 10 years old. He was subjected to deep sleep therapy in April 1972. At this time he was administered the human growth hormone using products from cadavers. It has since been found that some of this material was contaminated, with a number of young recipients subsequently contracting and dying of the deadly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD.


On Monday, 16 June 2008 the Hon. Fran Bailey MP put a private member's motion into the House calling on the government to recognise the 'unapproved' recipients of hormone treatments, including the young men and boys like Michael, who received the human growth hormone treatments between the 1960s and the mid 1980s. The motion acknowledged that the report commissioned in 1993, known as the Allars inquiry, found that approved female patients receiving the same treatment, but for infertility, suffered similar negative effects and as a result of that report received compensation from the Commonwealth. Finally, Ms Bailey's motion called for the compensation of the male victims, both 'approved' and 'unofficial', who received the same hormone treatment but usually for growth stimulation purposes.


During the decades of this extraordinary period of medical experimentation on vulnerable young people, some were officially recognised and therefore were designated as 'approved' recipients of the drugs and procedures. Others, however, and that would seem hundreds, were not officially approved victims who received, however, the same treatment by medical practitioners. These unapproved recipients now have great difficulty obtaining their medical records or proper regard for their plight and their need for compensation. The disease CJD, one of the deadly consequences of experimentation with the human growth hormones, has a long incubation period which may extend for years. When it manifests itself, the dementia progresses rapidly until the patient dies a terrible death. It is one of the most terrible of human diseases. There is no easy test other than a brain biopsy that can confirm CJD.

Dr STONE (

Murray
) (
17:57
):  There is no easy test other than a brain biopsy that can confirm CJD, so these young boys—now men in their 40s and 50s—live with a time bomb, suffering this uncertainty at the same time that they suffer from the other health impacts of the treatments they received years before. In Michael's case he must spend many dollars each month buying medication that treats his conditions. Surely it is time that these injustices are recognised.


The 800-page report of the Allars inquiry made a very clear case for compensation for victims. I refer to the remarks of Dr Mal Washer MP, who participated in the 2008 debate on the Fran Bailey private member's motion. He highlighted how the Allars inquiry had identified


… failures in the production of product, including the collection of pituitary glands; failures in supervision of the product and programs by government agencies, including the health department, the National Biological Standards Laboratory and the Human Pituitary Advisory Committee, or HPAC; and failures of appropriate action undertaken by the department following suspension of the program in 1985. There were inadequacies in tracing the recipients, the information provided, the epidemiological studies, and blood and organ donation.


Successive governments have failed to take up the cause, although Fran Bailey's motion received bipartisan support at the time.


It is Michael's view that his status as an adopted child born of an unwed mother made him more vulnerable to this careless use of his young body.


As well as being treated with human growth hormone, an unknown number of pre-pubertal and adolescent boys who were short were treated with synthetic androgens or steroids to accelerate their growth after being primed with human growth hormones. This causes prostate disease for some and sterilised an unknown number of these boys. Many of these boys fell into the 'unapproved' category of patients, given that they were treated by medical practitioners who did not officially record all the details of the children they treated.


I was deeply moved by the story told to me by Michael O'Meara in the Great Hall on the day of the formal apology for survivors of governments' forced adoption policies in our country. I am in awe of Michael's dignity and patience as he strives to bring justice for himself and his fellow victims. No doubt Michael will continue to suffer as no human should because our nation failed in its duty of care in regard to his wellbeing. Sadly for Michael, he did not only suffer the ultimate tragedy of separation at birth from the woman who was his mother and who undoubtedly would have loved him. She was drugged and she could not ever know the struggles of her newborn just to draw his first breath. But her baby went on to suffer as a child and then as a man because governments failed to do the right thing by him. I call on the government to revisit the Allars inquiry and offer the same support and compensation as that which was offered and gratefully accepted by the women who were treated at the same time. Obviously Michael's story is just one of the many human tragedies that make up the thousands of stories that deal with the forced adoptions that took place in Australia over many decades in the 20th century. 


I think the official apology we gave was long overdue. It was magnificent in the way that it was addressed, I believe, in the appropriate ceremony and with very carefully chosen words from both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. I stand by that apology, as I think most Australians would. Let us hope that that episode in our history is never repeated in any form and that we never again treat some children as less valuable or their mothers as having less value simply because of their marital status. I very much commend this motion to the House.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (18:01):  I rise to speak on the national apology for forced adoptions. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition both spoke on 21 March this year in relation to forced adoptions and removal policies and practices, and the member for Swan gave us a very personal insight into these practices. Today I join our nation in apologising, and in so doing I would like to put on record the story of my friend Sue, who did not find out that she was adopted until much later in life after both her adoptive parents had passed away. As I speak today I will use the words 'birth mother' and 'mother' because those are the words that Sue uses.


Shortly after Sue's mother passed away her brother told her that she was adopted. Hearing those words irrevocably changed Sue's life and she began questioning who she really was. Everything that she had known about her biological identity or thought she had known was now changed. It was different and it was false. Sue embarked on the task of finding out who her birth mother and father were—a long and arduous process that took many years. Eventually she did meet her birth mother but her father had passed away, so she did not meet him. She has also met one of her brothers and a cousin. She still knows very little about the circumstances of her birth but she does know that her birth mother was an Ipswich teenager who was sent to a home for single pregnant women in Brisbane, where she gave birth to Sue. Sue's birth mother signed the papers for her adoption and they were not to meet again for about 40 years.


In the time I have known Sue the circumstances of her birth and adoption have weighed heavily on her mind and I am not sure that she will ever be totally at peace. In her words, she carries the shame of her adoptive parents in not talking to her and telling her that she was adopted. When I have asked her what she meant by that, she said that she never had the opportunity to ask her parents why they adopted her, whether they were not able to have children. But she does know that they hid her adoption from her and she does not fully understand why.


After finding out that she was adopted Sue spoke to an aunt, as it turned out that most of the family knew that she was adopted. The aunt said that Sue's mother just turned up one day with a baby. When the aunt asked whose baby it was, Sue's mother said, 'Mine.' When the aunt asked Sue's father when he would tell Sue that she was adopted, her father replied, 'Never, she'll never know.'


Sue talks about the adoption triangle of the birth parent, the adoptive parent and the adoptive child. She makes the point that it is not just the pain of the relinquishing parent that needs to be acknowledged; it is also the pain of the adoptive child and adoptive parent. Sue has pushed the issues of her adoption to the side. But, again, in her words, 'There is a little scar in her heart.' Her wish is that her adoptive parents were still alive so that she could hug them and tell them that she loved them. To Sue, and everyone else affected by forced adoption, I say: sorry.

"Markus, Louise, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (18:05):  I rise today to speak about a time in our nation's history that cannot be simply forgotten. Forced adoption policies and practices were widespread throughout Australia during the 1950s and on to the early 1970s. The practice of forced adoption affected many members of society. It was not restricted to a particular class, race, region or area. This was a time when many women were made to relinquish their children, a step that went against every instinct within them, breaking one of the most precious bonds that we have, that between parent and child. This was a time of deep distress and confusion for many young women. 


I stand here today saddened, particularly for those men and women whose lives were marked by this practice and the impact that it had not only on them but, particularly, on their children. For many, the grief has impacted their lives to this day. We know the role played by a mother and a father is invaluable, often setting the platform and foundation for a child's future. More important, it allows a child to understand where they come from, who their mother and father are. Many who have been impacted by forced adoption have questioned whether they were loved, whether they were wanted. 


A nation now understands the ripple effect of policies which did not put the needs of children first. The experience of every mother and child who endured this heartbreak was unique and very personal. We have heard some of those stories in this chamber today. All of us were touched and impacted to the depths of our being when we heard the stories, particularly throughout the Senate inquiry. We heard from mothers who were stigmatised and disempowered. Many mothers were shunned by the very people who should have been protecting and supporting them. I am sure the secrecy, the shame and the confusion was overwhelming for many at times. Of course we also heard the stories of children who, after years of struggling, asked the question, 'Why?' We heard about their questions of identity and their struggle to accept themselves and their past. 


In my own electorate of Macquarie there are quite a few brave people who have been touched by this issue. I would like to relate the story of one such man, a man by the name of Erik Spinney. Many of us know him. He is better known by his tribal name of Standing Bear. Erik was adopted as a baby through the forced adoption practices and he gave evidence at the Senate inquiry as well as writing several submissions. I have met Erik many times and have spent some time talking with him, not only in my office but over coffee. Last year I was touched by his own story. I was touched by his determination to reach out to others who have had the same experience. He spoke about the resulting emotional, physical and psychological effects for those who were part of forced adoption. Erik speaks weekly with people who have gone through the same experience. He mentioned to me that he has been in the position where he has had to talk down several people, mothers of adopted children and adoptees, from committing serious self-harm. While living in Canada for a few years Erik became ill but was unable to access his family medical history. This added complications to his treatment. These are just some of the ramifications for those men and women who were impacted by forced adoption. Erik's message to me was that we must ensure people do not fall through the cracks. We must ensure that every story counts. It is pleasing that one of the recommendations of the inquiry was that an exhibition be commissioned documenting the experiences of those affected by former forced-adoption practices and policies.


The Australian government is funding the National Archives of Australia, over three years, to deliver a forced-adoptions experience history project. We all know that the national apology to those involved in forced-adoption practices is only a beginning of the healing process. We need to be diligent to ensure that the proper support services are available to the thousands of men and women in our electorates across this nation who have been affected by former forced-adoption policies. They need to continue to be given a voice.


I echo the sentiments of the Leader of the Opposition in honouring those who have borne the hurt of the mistakes of this era. I wish to honour the parents who have always loved their children. I want to honour the parents—including the fathers— who have always loved their children and were so hurt by the decisions taken out of their own hands and made for them. It is important also to mention those adoptive parents who have tried to do the right thing by the children who were placed in their care. 


It is also important to honour and acknowledge all the children who have tried, in their own ways, to find their own place in a less-than-perfect world. That has, particularly at the instance of their birth, let them down. I congratulate and acknowledge their bravery and courage, and hope that their journey of healing does move closer towards wholeness.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (18:11):  I rise to add my comments to the national apology on forced adoptions. I commend both our Prime Minister and our opposition leader for their very wise and thoughtful words on that day. I will quote a few paragraphs from the Prime Minister's speech. She said:


We deplore the shameful practices that denied you, the mothers, your fundamental rights and responsibilities to love and care for your children.


… … … 


To you, the fathers, who were excluded from the lives of your children and deprived of the dignity of recognition on your children’s birth records, we say sorry. We acknowledge your loss and grief.


… … … 


To each of you who were adopted or removed, who were led to believe your mother had rejected you and who were denied the opportunity to grow up with your family and community of origin and to connect with your culture, we say sorry.


… … … 


We offer this apology in the hope that it will assist your healing and in order to shine a light on a dark period of our nation’s history.


… … …


To redress the shameful mistakes of the past, we are committed to ensuring that all those affected get the help they need, including access to specialist counselling services and support, the ability to find the truth in freely available records and assistance in reconnecting with lost family.


Finally, the Prime Minister said:


We resolve, as a nation, to do all in our power to make sure these practices are never repeated. In facing future challenges, we will remember the lessons of family separation.


Never to be repeated. But the root cause of those problems and past mistakes was an over-reaching state, well-meaning bureaucrats engaged in social engineering, who struck at the most primal and sacred bond there is—that between a mother and her child—and the bullying arrogance of meddling bureaucrats who believed that they knew best.


While we say the words 'This should never be repeated', I would like to use this opportunity to highlight two situations in our society where those mistakes of the past are being repeated. The first is in our child protection agency. Currently, we have over 39,000 children who are in the care of the state. In Australia today we have more children who have been removed from their parents than we have people in prisons. This has developed into a $3 billion industry.


Currently there is a child protection inquiry in Queensland, conducted by Commissioner Tim Carmody. I think some of his comments are very enlightening. Commissioner Carmody has accused some child protection officers of 'over-reacting', by taking children away from parents instead of giving families the help that they need. Commissioner Carmody said:


There are some children in very dysfunctional homes but the answer is not to just take them out. Removing a child at any age from a loved environment—even if it is inadequate or even risky—can give long term problems to that child. The impact on some children will be the same as the stolen generation.


Commissioner Carmody went on to criticise an 'over-reaction' in reporting cases of neglect and abuse and said that our child protection system should not be about 'social engineering' or supposedly 'giving them a better chance in life'. He said the 'system is over-responding to over-estimated risks' and said that children must be removed if there is a danger at the home, but he criticised removal on so-called 'emotional abuse'.


Commissioner Carmody noted that in Queensland today 70 per cent of children removed from their homes are removed due to so-called neglect or emotional harm. He said that the definition of 'emotional harm' was subjective and that there is not even consensus among child welfare professionals. Commissioner Carmody concluded:


If the answer is taking that child away from a loved parent, even if it's a violent home, and putting them with someone they don't know in someone else's home, how is that the right answer?


We seem to have lost the point of the emotional harm that is caused to a child who is removed from their family—from their mother or from their father. Child protection agencies seem not to consider the emotional harm that is done to a child who is taken from his or her parents.


I have had many cases of parents coming to my office and telling me stories of child protection officers chasing children like common criminals through the street, catching them and locking them up as though it was something from a Starsky and Hutch movie. I have heard stories about child protection officers telling children that their parents had abused them, alienating the child from their parents. We need to take a close look at this. Our children are most special and they must be protected. But if we today have more children being taken from their families than we have people in prisons I say that we have something drastically wrong and we need to look at it.


The second area is in our family courts. I know the family courts sometimes need the wisdom of Solomon to work out how to handle disputes between parents. But many cases have come to me in my office from both mothers and fathers, and I think that our family courts are failing badly and that we are making those same mistakes that our Prime Minister said should not be repeated. I would like to make a little comparison. There is a strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law where, if a female alleges that she is raped, when she goes before the courts she must produce four male eyewitnesses. Of course, when going to the courts and making the allegation of rape they are in fact making a statement that they have engaged in a sexual act. Unless that person is able to provide the four adult male witnesses, the case is reversed on them. They are shown to have made it up, to have fabricated it. And then, because they have made an admission of sexual intercourse, they face being charged with adultery if they are married or with fornication if they are not married, which in itself carries the punishment of death by stoning.


We nod our heads and say what a travesty of justice such a situation is. According to the National Commission on the Status of Women, an estimated 80 per cent of women currently in jail in Pakistan are there because they failed to prove rape charges and were consequently convicted of adultery. We say that is wrong but we have a similar situation occurring today in our family courts.


What is happening in our family courts is if a parent makes an allegation that their child has been the victim of abuse, and that can be either a mother or a father—it is not about mothers' rights or fathers' rights but about the rights of children—when they go before our family law courts the bar is so high it is impossible to prove. So we are seeing a similar situation to what we see under Islamic sharia law, where the burden of proof on the parent who the child has made the allegation against is reversed, and the courts find that the child has been coached to say those things. Without the evidence, the parent that has through good intentions been concerned about the child being abused and often sexually abused finds the courts are turning against them and they are having their child taken from them. This is not an isolated incident. I have many cases. I have spoken to Emeritus Professor Freda Briggs, who brought this to my attention.


We do have a serious problem with the way our laws are being interpreted in the family courts. It is something we need to have a close look at because we do not want to be here in this parliament in 10 or 20 years time making the same apology after seeing the hardship and suffering that has been inflicted upon many parents of children in our society. We do not want to be making that same apology again. We must learn from our mistakes in the past and ensure that we honour the Prime Minister's words—that we resolve as a nation to do all in our power to make sure these practices are never repeated—and make sure they come true.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (18:24):  Multiculturalism is one of Australia's greatest assets. It is something the western half of my Riverina electorate is built upon. It is important that we as a parliament acknowledge this as one of our nation's strengths. I commend the committee and I note the presence in the chamber of the member for Makin, who sat on the committee which produced this report, Inquiry into Migration and Multiculturalism in Australia. The committee was chaired by the member for Calwell. I commend the committee on its report into migration and multiculturalism in Australia. The report we are discussing tonight has 32 recommendations which seek to highlight what Australia is doing well and where we can improve.


These recommendations range from the antiracism framework and multiculturalism to religious diversity and the nation's social inclusion agenda. The coalition supports these recommendations and working with communities to ensure Australia remains a vibrant and inclusive multicultural society. Multiculturalism is vital and is something we must continue to support, but the cost of implementing programs is something that requires restraint from the government.


In my electorate the city of Griffith is a great example of a multicultural community. At Griffith High School, where I recently visited to award my Anzac writing competition certificates and a prize, there are many different ethnicities and nationalities. One hundred flags proudly fly at Griffith's annual Australia Day ceremony. An article in this morning's Area News highlights that immigration figures have more than doubled in Griffith over the past 12 months as migrants choose the lifestyle Griffith and surrounds offers. A citizenship ceremony in Griffith just last week highlighted that some 148 new migrants have moved to the city, an increase from 61 in the period of 2011-12.


As an irrigation community established prior to World War I, Griffith is now a proud city. The Murrumbidgee irrigation area is built on migration, multiculturalism and water. Today, Griffith and surrounds has a population of 27,000 and encompasses people from many nationalities and ethnicities, with Italian, Indian, Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern and Sudanese populations well represented. Most recently, the Filipino population is growing the most. With each of these communities comes a range of skilled and unskilled workers who make the Murrumbidgee irrigation area's economy prosper further. 


Mr Deputy Speaker Windsor, I know you visited Griffith. You were very welcomed there. You would have noticed the number of different nationalities. You would have also noticed the vibrancy that city has and the important part it plays in our economy and our nation. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be welcomed back anytime, because—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Riverina for his invitation.




Mr McCORMACK:
  You are welcome anytime. Members will know from my speeches that the farmers and communities in the MIA are producers in the nation's greatest food bowl. I have no hesitation in saying that. I say it proudly. I know we have many food bowls in this nation but none better than the Riverina, none better than that around Griffith. The food bowl we rely on every day is aided incredibly by migration and multiculturalism and this is why I support the report's recommendations.


Margaret King, who is the Griffith City Council's cultural services projects officer, told the Area News that such migration is 'critical to the economic development of Griffith'. 'Without it,' she said, 'our farmers would be in dire straits. Who would pick the oranges, for example?' And Mrs King is right. That is why the government's current stance on 457 visas is, I believe, misguided. For communities throughout the western half of my electorate, it is migration and multiculturalism—the very notions this report commends—that help farmers in the Riverina with picking and harvesting; 457 visas underpin Australia's regional economy. We heard in the chamber today a very passionate address about 457 visas and the need to always make sure that Australians get the jobs first. I agree. However, where Australians cannot or will not take up those jobs on offer, particularly in the busy fruit-picking and harvesting seasons, we need to rely on 457 visas to fill the gap. Certainly there are some jobs which require migrants on 457 visas to fill that gap in Australia.


The government needs to understand the needs of regional people and their communities, especially as far as 457 visas are concerned. Farmers, horticulturalists and local business owners are concerned what impact the government stance on 457 visas partnered with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan will have on the economies of Griffith and the MIA. I share their concerns, because 457 visas are vital to Griffith's economy as well as to towns such as Leeton, Coleambally, Hillston and Narrandera and all the other towns within the MIA. Any move to take them away will place the nation's food bowl in further jeopardy. The people of Griffith are strong and resilient, as you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker. Their city is vibrant and multicultural. They are what this report seeks to highlight: inclusive communities of many ethnicities and nationalities, living and working together harmoniously for the greater good. Multiculturalism is what makes Griffith, the MIA and this nation great. It is a community I am proud to represent and values which I commend here today. That is why my coalition colleagues and I support the report's recommendations.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (18:30):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the report of the inquiry into migration and multiculturalism in Australia. At a time when the movement of people around the world has never been greater, when religious differences are causing conflict in so many places, when global refugee numbers continue to rise, when population sustainability is a topic on the national agenda, the report's findings are timely.


For Australia, the intake of people from new countries has always been, and continues to be, a cause of anxiety. Not surprisingly, submissions to the committee very much reflected the cross-section of views that I believe today exist throughout Australian communities. It is important, however, that perceptions and opinions are based on facts and not misinformation. By most measures, Australia has managed its migration program and cultural diversity issues well. Resettlement of new migrants has not, however, been without problems. Nor should we assume that today's migration is the same as the post-war World War II migration when some three million people came to Australia between 1945 and 1975. Australia today is a much different place than it was in the years immediately after World War II, when the Australian population was only 7.5 million and Australia was embarking on a major growth phase. It was a different era.


Being part of the post-World War II migration, I can speak with personal experience about the post-World War II migration and how that migration has contributed to shaping Australia today. Whilst heavily influenced by its British heritage, Australian culture uniquely reflects the collective characteristics of the new settlers who have come to Australia since 1788 and their adoption to the physical and climatic conditions of the Australian landscape. 


It was during the post-World War II years that Australia changed most, both in population and in physical construction. These were the years that transformed Australia and this is the period I will focus my remarks on. In doing so, I acknowledge the Australians who were already living here and who had, through their own toil and hardships, opened the way for the people who followed. They were the pioneers whose place in our history will never be diminished.


It is often said that citizenship is a common bond which unites all Australians. For the people who came to Australia after World War II, it was much more than citizenship which united them. They had a common dream and a common interest in seeing Australia prosper. Not only had they mainly left war-torn Europe and were seeking a better life for their families but also their personal future was dependent on Australia's future. They shared a common desire to make Australia a better country. Regardless of where they originated, people saw each other as equals and the emerging national identity was equally owned by all of them. They came at the invitation of those already here and were grateful for the opportunity to do so. Their future was very much dependent on their right attitude and their commitment to Australia's national interest. They clearly understood that. They came with nothing, they asked for nothing and, having left the poverty and devastation of World War II, they were thankful for the opportunity to work and to live in peace.


For them, there was a light on the hill. They embraced their new homeland and the spirit enshrined in recommendation 1 of the committee's report, which reinforced Galbally's vision of multiculturalism as 'an inclusive policy which respects diversity and fosters engagement within Australian values, identity and citizenship within the framework of Australian laws'. I particularly emphasise the phrase 'within the framework of Australian laws'. That is a point that I will come back to later if time permits.


People chose to come to Australia and in doing so were appreciative of the rights and protections Australian law afforded them. They were people mainly from the European region with significant numbers coming from the UK, Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Poland, Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, Malta and the Netherlands. In Australia, their hard work, their skills and their resourcefulness were welcomed by the broad Australian community. They did any work that was available and quietly and respectfully made their contribution to Australia's productivity. When at times they were confronted by racism they turned the other cheek. Over time, the people who came to Australia earned the respect of the Australians who preceded them.


It was this wave of migration that made Australia a multicultural success story, that was first acknowledged by the Whitlam government with the abolition of the White Australia Policy in 1973 and, subsequently, the enactment of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975.


In truth, however, it is not laws which matter most. Laws may force a change in behaviour but they do not change the inner character or prejudices of a person. That comes from life experiences which, in turn, lead to a change in attitude and mindset. It is only then that prejudice, racism and discrimination are truly eliminated.


In embracing their new Australian identity, at no time did the new arrivals turn their backs on their heritage. The region I was raised in and which today I have the privilege of representing in this place is a shining example of a multicultural success story. People from most parts of the world now live within the region and new settlers have integrated into the community remarkably well whilst remaining proud of their heritage and their homeland. Over time, they established their respective cultural and sporting facilities. Today, many of those facilities have become important community resources for the broader community.


The Para Hills Community Club and the many sports facilities in the Para Hills Paddocks area are a credit to the British migrants of the 1960s. The Campania Club at Modbury, built in the 1970s and recently expanded and modernised, is an initiative of the large Italian community in the region. Similarly, the Croatian Sports Centre at Gepps Cross, the Dutch Club at Greenfields, and the Greek club, Florina, at Ingle Farm are all testaments to their respective cultural identities. In more recent years the Vietnamese people established their much-needed community facilities at Pooraka. The Maltese, Polish, Serbian, Hungarian, Macedonian and other communities with significant numbers in my region have established similar facilities in other places in Adelaide. I have no doubt that similar stories of cultural settlement can be found in most places in Australia.


One of the very visible benefits of Australian multiculturalism is that it has enabled Australians to experience international culture without having to travel overseas. By way of example, in recent weeks I have attended cultural celebrations of food, customs and entertainment at events organised by the Middle Eastern, Vietnamese, Italian, Greek, Indian and Dutch communities of Adelaide. In South Australia, hardly a week goes by without a cultural event being held somewhere in the state, and events such as the German Schutzenfest, the Italian Carnevale, the Greek Glendi festival, the Indian Mela festival and the Croatian food and wine festival are now major annual events on South Australia's community entertainment calendar.


Of course, one of the important economic benefits arising from Australian migration has been the trade and business links set up by new settlers to Australia with their homelands. Having personal links and a knowledge of both countries has proven invaluable for enterprising people from both sides of the trade.


Earlier in my comments I referred to recommendation 1 and the Australian law, and I will follow up my earlier comments with some comments about recommendation 6, which links into recommendation 1. Recommendation 6 states:


The Committee does not support legal pluralism and recommends that the Government promote the message that multiculturalism entails both a respect for cultural diversity and a commitment to the framework of Australian laws and values which underpin social cohesion.


This is an important recommendation because it goes to the heart of Australian values. The laws of Australia, or of any democratic country for that matter, reflect the values of the people and the standards which all people of that country are expected to adhere to. Not all laws are agreeable to all people, but they nevertheless express majority sentiment. Where they do not, public opinion will eventually cause a change to them. Our laws also seek to ensure that the virtues of justice, fairness and equality are the bedrock of Australian beliefs. Our cultural freedoms arise from those laws, but cultural freedom should not extend to the point where behaviour is clearly in breach of Australian law. The post World War II migrants who came to Australia respected and accepted that view, and that is what made Australia's migration program a multicultural success story.


In the moment I have left, I will take the opportunity to commend the members of the committee from all sides of parliament in this House who worked together and cooperatively in trying to bring to the House a committee report that truly reflects the issues that are relevant to this parliament and to the nation in respect to the multicultural nature of our society today, and I believe that the report and its 32 recommendations pick up on the matters that we ought to be aware of and perhaps as a parliament at some point need to address. I also thank the secretariat for the terrific work that they did in assisting the committee with its work. I also want to thank the chair of the committee, the member for Calwell, for her leadership in guiding us through what were sometimes touchy subjects and touchy areas of debate. But we got through it together and have presented what I believe is a bipartisan report that does justice to the work of the committee.

Mr Deputy Speaker Windsor, I know you visited Griffith. You were very welcomed there. You would have noticed the number of different nationalities. You would have also noticed the vibrancy that city has and the important part it plays in our economy and our nation. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be welcomed back anytime, because—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Riverina for his invitation.




Mr McCORMACK:
  You are welcome anytime. Members will know from my speeches that the farmers and communities in the MIA are producers in the nation's greatest food bowl. I have no hesitation in saying that. I say it proudly. I know we have many food bowls in this nation but none better than the Riverina, none better than that around Griffith. The food bowl we rely on every day is aided incredibly by migration and multiculturalism and this is why I support the report's recommendations.


Margaret King, who is the Griffith City Council's cultural services projects officer, told the Area News that such migration is 'critical to the economic development of Griffith'. 'Without it,' she said, 'our farmers would be in dire straits. Who would pick the oranges, for example?' And Mrs King is right. That is why the government's current stance on 457 visas is, I believe, misguided. For communities throughout the western half of my electorate, it is migration and multiculturalism—the very notions this report commends—that help farmers in the Riverina with picking and harvesting; 457 visas underpin Australia's regional economy. We heard in the chamber today a very passionate address about 457 visas and the need to always make sure that Australians get the jobs first. I agree. However, where Australians cannot or will not take up those jobs on offer, particularly in the busy fruit-picking and harvesting seasons, we need to rely on 457 visas to fill the gap. Certainly there are some jobs which require migrants on 457 visas to fill that gap in Australia.


The government needs to understand the needs of regional people and their communities, especially as far as 457 visas are concerned. Farmers, horticulturalists and local business owners are concerned what impact the government stance on 457 visas partnered with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan will have on the economies of Griffith and the MIA. I share their concerns, because 457 visas are vital to Griffith's economy as well as to towns such as Leeton, Coleambally, Hillston and Narrandera and all the other towns within the MIA. Any move to take them away will place the nation's food bowl in further jeopardy. The people of Griffith are strong and resilient, as you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker. Their city is vibrant and multicultural. They are what this report seeks to highlight: inclusive communities of many ethnicities and nationalities, living and working together harmoniously for the greater good. Multiculturalism is what makes Griffith, the MIA and this nation great. It is a community I am proud to represent and values which I commend here today. That is why my coalition colleagues and I support the report's recommendations.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-05-15,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (18:30):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the report of the inquiry into migration and multiculturalism in Australia. At a time when the movement of people around the world has never been greater, when religious differences are causing conflict in so many places, when global refugee numbers continue to rise, when population sustainability is a topic on the national agenda, the report's findings are timely.


For Australia, the intake of people from new countries has always been, and continues to be, a cause of anxiety. Not surprisingly, submissions to the committee very much reflected the cross-section of views that I believe today exist throughout Australian communities. It is important, however, that perceptions and opinions are based on facts and not misinformation. By most measures, Australia has managed its migration program and cultural diversity issues well. Resettlement of new migrants has not, however, been without problems. Nor should we assume that today's migration is the same as the post-war World War II migration when some three million people came to Australia between 1945 and 1975. Australia today is a much different place than it was in the years immediately after World War II, when the Australian population was only 7.5 million and Australia was embarking on a major growth phase. It was a different era.


Being part of the post-World War II migration, I can speak with personal experience about the post-World War II migration and how that migration has contributed to shaping Australia today. Whilst heavily influenced by its British heritage, Australian culture uniquely reflects the collective characteristics of the new settlers who have come to Australia since 1788 and their adoption to the physical and climatic conditions of the Australian landscape. 


It was during the post-World War II years that Australia changed most, both in population and in physical construction. These were the years that transformed Australia and this is the period I will focus my remarks on. In doing so, I acknowledge the Australians who were already living here and who had, through their own toil and hardships, opened the way for the people who followed. They were the pioneers whose place in our history will never be diminished.


It is often said that citizenship is a common bond which unites all Australians. For the people who came to Australia after World War II, it was much more than citizenship which united them. They had a common dream and a common interest in seeing Australia prosper. Not only had they mainly left war-torn Europe and were seeking a better life for their families but also their personal future was dependent on Australia's future. They shared a common desire to make Australia a better country. Regardless of where they originated, people saw each other as equals and the emerging national identity was equally owned by all of them. They came at the invitation of those already here and were grateful for the opportunity to do so. Their future was very much dependent on their right attitude and their commitment to Australia's national interest. They clearly understood that. They came with nothing, they asked for nothing and, having left the poverty and devastation of World War II, they were thankful for the opportunity to work and to live in peace.


For them, there was a light on the hill. They embraced their new homeland and the spirit enshrined in recommendation 1 of the committee's report, which reinforced Galbally's vision of multiculturalism as 'an inclusive policy which respects diversity and fosters engagement within Australian values, identity and citizenship within the framework of Australian laws'. I particularly emphasise the phrase 'within the framework of Australian laws'. That is a point that I will come back to later if time permits.


People chose to come to Australia and in doing so were appreciative of the rights and protections Australian law afforded them. They were people mainly from the European region with significant numbers coming from the UK, Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Poland, Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, Malta and the Netherlands. In Australia, their hard work, their skills and their resourcefulness were welcomed by the broad Australian community. They did any work that was available and quietly and respectfully made their contribution to Australia's productivity. When at times they were confronted by racism they turned the other cheek. Over time, the people who came to Australia earned the respect of the Australians who preceded them.


It was this wave of migration that made Australia a multicultural success story, that was first acknowledged by the Whitlam government with the abolition of the White Australia Policy in 1973 and, subsequently, the enactment of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975.


In truth, however, it is not laws which matter most. Laws may force a change in behaviour but they do not change the inner character or prejudices of a person. That comes from life experiences which, in turn, lead to a change in attitude and mindset. It is only then that prejudice, racism and discrimination are truly eliminated.


In embracing their new Australian identity, at no time did the new arrivals turn their backs on their heritage. The region I was raised in and which today I have the privilege of representing in this place is a shining example of a multicultural success story. People from most parts of the world now live within the region and new settlers have integrated into the community remarkably well whilst remaining proud of their heritage and their homeland. Over time, they established their respective cultural and sporting facilities. Today, many of those facilities have become important community resources for the broader community.


The Para Hills Community Club and the many sports facilities in the Para Hills Paddocks area are a credit to the British migrants of the 1960s. The Campania Club at Modbury, built in the 1970s and recently expanded and modernised, is an initiative of the large Italian community in the region. Similarly, the Croatian Sports Centre at Gepps Cross, the Dutch Club at Greenfields, and the Greek club, Florina, at Ingle Farm are all testaments to their respective cultural identities. In more recent years the Vietnamese people established their much-needed community facilities at Pooraka. The Maltese, Polish, Serbian, Hungarian, Macedonian and other communities with significant numbers in my region have established similar facilities in other places in Adelaide. I have no doubt that similar stories of cultural settlement can be found in most places in Australia.


One of the very visible benefits of Australian multiculturalism is that it has enabled Australians to experience international culture without having to travel overseas. By way of example, in recent weeks I have attended cultural celebrations of food, customs and entertainment at events organised by the Middle Eastern, Vietnamese, Italian, Greek, Indian and Dutch communities of Adelaide. In South Australia, hardly a week goes by without a cultural event being held somewhere in the state, and events such as the German Schutzenfest, the Italian Carnevale, the Greek Glendi festival, the Indian Mela festival and the Croatian food and wine festival are now major annual events on South Australia's community entertainment calendar.


Of course, one of the important economic benefits arising from Australian migration has been the trade and business links set up by new settlers to Australia with their homelands. Having personal links and a knowledge of both countries has proven invaluable for enterprising people from both sides of the trade.


Earlier in my comments I referred to recommendation 1 and the Australian law, and I will follow up my earlier comments with some comments about recommendation 6, which links into recommendation 1. Recommendation 6 states:


The Committee does not support legal pluralism and recommends that the Government promote the message that multiculturalism entails both a respect for cultural diversity and a commitment to the framework of Australian laws and values which underpin social cohesion.


This is an important recommendation because it goes to the heart of Australian values. The laws of Australia, or of any democratic country for that matter, reflect the values of the people and the standards which all people of that country are expected to adhere to. Not all laws are agreeable to all people, but they nevertheless express majority sentiment. Where they do not, public opinion will eventually cause a change to them. Our laws also seek to ensure that the virtues of justice, fairness and equality are the bedrock of Australian beliefs. Our cultural freedoms arise from those laws, but cultural freedom should not extend to the point where behaviour is clearly in breach of Australian law. The post World War II migrants who came to Australia respected and accepted that view, and that is what made Australia's migration program a multicultural success story.


In the moment I have left, I will take the opportunity to commend the members of the committee from all sides of parliament in this House who worked together and cooperatively in trying to bring to the House a committee report that truly reflects the issues that are relevant to this parliament and to the nation in respect to the multicultural nature of our society today, and I believe that the report and its 32 recommendations pick up on the matters that we ought to be aware of and perhaps as a parliament at some point need to address. I also thank the secretariat for the terrific work that they did in assisting the committee with its work. I also want to thank the chair of the committee, the member for Calwell, for her leadership in guiding us through what were sometimes touchy subjects and touchy areas of debate. But we got through it together and have presented what I believe is a bipartisan report that does justice to the work of the committee.


Debate adjourned.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (18:40):  I wanted to be associated with this condolence motion in relation to Ian Wilson, known as the Hon. Ian Bonython Cameron Wilson, AM. Ian was a friend. I last saw him on 5 March at his home in Burnside. Very tragically, he was dying of cancer. On 2 April, that took his life. Ian, interestingly, was first elected to this parliament in 1966. He held his seat for only three years. What I remember of him is the campaign he undertook in 1972 in the election that Gough Whitlam won and Bill McMahon lost to regain the seat of Sturt. That was a very memorable campaign. I joined the parliament in September of 1973. I went to the Old Parliament House and was assigned an office. The office was at the back of the building in what was ostensibly the new block, where you had the largest rooms. But they were shared with three others. Ian Wilson had the window, David Hamer had the middle of the room and I was left closest to the door.


What I know is that he was a great mentor, albeit having only been in the parliament for a relatively short time. He was an extraordinarily intelligent man. He had been a Rhodes scholar, a barrister and a solicitor. His achievements in the law were considerable. I remember his ministerial career, but I will not regale people about that. I also remember the extent to which he spoke—and if people take the time to go through the notes the Parliamentary Library has prepared they will find the press comments on this—about issues that he took up personally. He was very much involved in the arguments in relation to income splitting in families. All of that has budgetary implications. But he was one who was out there running the arguments very positively when it was not necessarily the most popular thing to be doing. Given some of the matters we are discussing today, I will also mention that he was involved in debate about whistleblower protection, which I thought was another fascinating area of activity in which to be involved.


He was one of those who, when I make a judgment about my own political career, I know was on the same side. The most difficult time for me was in 1988 when I crossed the floor and voted for a motion moved by Bob Hawke affirming that Australia's immigration programs should be non-discriminatory. I am not going to go into the nuances of the debate. But Steele Hall, Peter Baume, and I were very strongly of the view that, regardless of what selection criteria you might use, country of origin, race or religion should never be a determining factor. On those matters, Ian Wilson and Michael MacKellar also saw fit to make known their concerns and they were not prepared to vote on that issue—they abstained from it.


When I look at that time when I served in the parliament, I served with a person that was a friend. I am glad I had the opportunity to be at his funeral. It was, in a sense, a celebration of his life. For me and my family there were other aspects of his life that brought us together, and they are recorded in the material that is before you. In 1999 he was the foundation chairman of the May Gibbs Literature Trust. With his wife, he worked as part of a team that saved and restored May Gibbs' home, Nutcote, in Neutral Bay. Where the Ruddocks became involved was that my wife Heather was invited to serve on the committee relating to the literature trust and involved in Nutcote and its continuing use. They were able to give awards to numerous young people for writing. The literature trust was about encouraging young people who wanted time and a secure location to be able to think about the issues that they were involved in and to be able to produce their works. This, I think, was a great credit to Ian and his family and was a great opportunity for him in his post-political career to contribute positively.


I have not mentioned all the matters raised by the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition. I do not want to repeat them. I just want it to be known that Ian Wilson was a friend, that he was a considerable contributor to this parliament and that he was a man of principle. To Mary, who was a great host to me on 5 March when I last saw him, to his sons Keith, Richard, James and Nigel and their families: you should be very proud—and I know you are—of what he was able to achieve. He was a great Australian.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-05-15,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (18:47):  I rise as well to convey my condolences on the passing of the Hon. Ian Wilson AM, and, perhaps more importantly, to pass on the condolences of Noel Hicks, the retired member for Riverina, who served with the Hon. Ian Wilson during his time in parliament in the House of Representatives. Mr Hicks, who lives in Griffith, wanted me to pass on his very best wishes to Mr Wilson's family and to record his reminisces of Mr Wilson.


I was very interested to hear the member for Berowra talk about the way that Mr Wilson commanded respect in debates and certainly got his point across. Mr Hicks's recollection of Mr Wilson was of a quiet, reserved man who got things done in a very good fashion, who got things done because he knew there was a piece of legislation that needed his expertise and who knew that his constituents needed something to be done—and he certainly was in there fighting for them, sometimes in a very unassuming fashion but in a very effective fashion, as Mr Hicks wanted the parliament to know in his condolences remarks. Mr Hicks remembered Mr Wilson as a gentleman, a thorough gentleman and a true gentleman, and somebody who was, as he said, really nice. That comes from a person who was also regarded by this parliament as a gentleman. Mr Hicks certainly is a gentleman, and I am sure the two of them had many a great discussion on policy, on legislation and on the way that the nation should go forward.


Mr Wilson retired from politics in 1993, having held the seat of Sturt from 1966 until 1969 and then losing the seat and regaining it again despite the overwhelming tide of the Whitlam election. He then held the seat until his retirement. He was the Minister for Home Affairs and the Environment. He was also the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in 1982, and he held that position until the coalition was defeated at the 1983 election. In 1993 Mr Wilson retired. 


Certainly, whilst he has passed from this life his efforts in this House and in this parliament are not forgotten. I commend the father of the parliament for his eloquent words, and I know that the fine words of my other two South Australian colleagues, who are due to speak in a moment on Mr Wilson, will also bring some comfort to the family of Mr Wilson. He did a great and honourable job, not just for his electorate and for this state but indeed for this nation.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (18:50):  I, also, would like to speak on this condolence motion for Ian Wilson. I would like to put some other perspectives, without focusing on his parliamentary career. I first met Ian Wilson when I was on a trip to Canberra as a school kid. It was a year 7 trip, and we visited Old Parliament House. Ian spent some time with us; it would have been a small part of his day, but I remember him keeping the attention of 11-year-old school boys. At the end of it he gave us loose-leaf Hansards, as well. We were a pretty rowdy group and we found this thing called 'parliament' fascinating. 


Some of his sons were at the high school that I attended and I remember, during the 1980 campaign, one of them—Richard—plastering 'Wilson for Sturt' stickers all over the prefects' year 12 room at St Peter's College. So I was certainly familiar with Ian Wilson.


The book Liberal Movement Story has an excellent chapter about the 1972 campaign. As the previous speaker said, Ian lost the seat of Sturt in 1969 to Norm Foster. In 1972, while there was a swing to the Labor Party and the Whitlam government came in, Ian retook that seat. The seat of Sturt was a different seat to the one it is now. I think it incorporated parts of Modbury, so it went into what is now the seat of Makin. So that was a tremendous political achievement, and it was through a lot of very hard work using all of the resources that the Liberal Party had to throw at it, the best of campaigning techniques and lots of visitors.


Other people have touched on Ian Wilson's parliamentary career, and I will leave that to others. My involvement with Ian Wilson and my getting to know him happened after he left parliament. I often saw him at various functions. The father of the House mentioned May Gibbs, and I remember seeing Ian Wilson at functions involving children's literature. He also had a long involvement and long interest in the area of aged care and retirement villages. 


Ian's faith was very important to him, and he had an involvement, I think, with St Matthew's Church at Kensington. I last spent a fair bit of time with him about 18 months ago, at a meeting of the Pioneers Association of South Australia. Ian had just come from a commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the sixth trip of John McDouall Stuart, who I think was also one of his forebears. That sixth trip was the successful trip, which crossed the Australian continent from south to north and back again. Ian was a good attender of functions in the electorate of Boothby—as was his mother, Lady Wilson. Most recently he had an involvement with us in taking up our consignment of wine. And we were very pleased to receive, in return, the Wilson wine, which was called Kerijani after the first two letters of the names of each of his four sons. I probably knew Nigel best when I was at school and I had a number of mutual friends with Nigel. But in more recent times, I have got to know Keith really quite well. His daughter and my son have been in the same class. His daughter and my daughter have been in the same softball team. So I have got to know Keith, the oldest son, and his wife, Sheree. 


I was very pleased to attend the funeral at St Peter's Cathedral. It was a tremendous celebration of Ian's life. Baden Teague and Jennifer Cashmore spoke at the funeral—both retired politicians who had been involved with Ian from the start. There were many people there, including Pam Oborn, someone who was involved in setting up the Young Liberals in South Australia with Ian. Each of his four sons spoke. I would like to, again, give my condolences to Mary, Keith, Sheree, India, Richard, James and Nigel. I will miss Ian Wilson. He was a true gentleman and his contribution should be recognised.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-05-15,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (18:56):  I am very pleased to join my colleagues the member for Boothby, the member for Berowra and the member for Riverina in speaking on the condolence motion to my predecessor, Ian Wilson. I knew Ian Wilson very well since I was a child. In fact, my mother and father were members of the branches in Sturt, the seat that I represent. I grew up knowing the Wilson family, the legacy of his father, Sir Keith, and his mother, Lady Wilson, and the contribution that the Wilson family, the Bonython family and the Bray family have made to South Australia since 1836. I have a very high regard for the Wilsons and all of their relations—anyone who has been associated with that amazing strain that have had such an indelible impact on my great state.


In fact, we are distantly related. John McDouall Stuart led an expedition across Australia and one of the members of that expedition was a man called Stephen King. Stephen King and the Wilson family were related. Stephen King is a forebear of mine as well. That is the nature of South Australia of course. The relationship is so distant that it barely bears repeating, but it did mean that we were both members of the John McDouall Stuart Society. Only relations of those on the expedition were able to be members of the John McDouall Stuart Society. 


I joined the Liberal Party when I was 17 and I joined the Burnside branch and I joined the Young Liberals—both in Sturt. I was president of the Young Liberals and president of the Burnside branch. I was treasurer of Ian's Sturt federal electorate council, or committee as it was called then. I was his campaign manager in 1990 and I was also the vice president of the Sturt federal electorate committee. I worked on every campaign in Sturt from 1987 onwards, which was the first opportunity that I had to run. I defeated Ian Wilson in preselection in 1992 and became the member for Sturt in 1993. 


Ian Wilson and I had a very close relationship because of the fact that I followed him in Sturt. We had a very chequered relationship. I think it is fair to say that I certainly was not the flavour of the month in the Wilson household for about 21 years, but I was pleased to attend his funeral and honour his commitment to public service. His commitment to public service was one that he inherited from his family and it was a very genuine one. He was a very good Liberal, in the small 'l' sense, and contributed to making sure that our party is a party that represents both the conservative and the liberal strains of political thought in this country.


He was also a courageous man in politics, and one of the things that was not mentioned in any of the eulogies given at the funeral was that he crossed the floor against the party—with the member for Berowra, in fact—to defend a non-discriminatory immigration policy in Australia, which did not make him popular with the powers that be in the party. But Ian Wilson was a man who put principle before preferment, in the great tradition of the small-L liberals in South Australia, who have had a real impact on our party for 60 years.


I am sorry that Ian Wilson's and my relationship never recovered from a bruising preselection—that is the nature of politics. I bear him and his family no animus. Can I say that his greatest achievements were his four sons and his marvellous marriage. His wife, Mary Scales, and his four sons, Keith, Richard, Nigel and James, gave marvellous speeches at the funeral. It spoke volumes for the kind of father, parent and husband that Ian had been that he has produced for remarkably great sons and South Australians, and I was pleased to be there to witness it. I thank the House for indulging me of this condolence motion on Ian Bonython Cameron Wilson.

It is a great privilege for me to have sat and listened to the contributions of the honourable members in this debate, particularly—at the risk of singling one out—that of the father of the House, the member for Berowra. It is never appropriate for anyone to say that they enjoyed a condolence debate, but it is certainly a great thing for me, as a relatively new parliamentarian, to sit and listen to the stories and histories of those who have come before us. As parliamentarians I think we are enriched by learning about the lives of the stories of those who preceded us, whatever the political party they have come from, or none.
