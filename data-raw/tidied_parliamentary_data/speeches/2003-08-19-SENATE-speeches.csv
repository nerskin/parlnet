"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—This is an important amendment to the government's Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. It would restrict land clearing in Australia— although not enough, I believe—to 1,000 hectares for any operator over any period of five years. That seems an extraordinary amount—after all, that is 1,000 football fields of native forests or woodlands scraped off the face of this continent. Australia is the only developed or rich country on the list of the worst 10 land clearers in the world. 
We know that there has been movement towards ending the land-clearing debacle in Queensland, which both Labor and the government have been totally irresponsible in preventing over the last decade or so. That land-clearing agreement does not come into force over the coming few years and, in the meantime, estimates are that up to 600,000 hectares are to be cleared in that state alone. Proportionately it gets worse when you go to Tasmania, in terms of volume as well as area. The most massive hardwood forests on the face of the planet in Tasmania, extensive rainforests, not least those in the Tarkine wilderness area of the north-west of the state, and woodlands—both dry forest and wet eucalypt forests—in the centre and east of the state are being cleared at the greatest rate in history. And, I might add, this is being done for the fewest jobs and for the poorest return to the public purse in history. That simple set of statements underlines the total failure of the regional forest agreement signed by Prime Minister Howard in 1997 to bring into play the much promised conservation of forest values in Tasmania.
I was explaining to the committee last night—and seeking advice and information from Senator Hill—about the failure of the regional forest agreement in Tasmania and about, in the absence of some change to put teeth into the regional forest agreement, the absolute need for a binding land clearance trigger which gives the federal government the power to intervene. What we got from that debate last night, from Senator Hill and from the government, was that this legislation looks after, will look after and is alleged to give greater strength to looking after Australia's top cultural and natural heritage, but not where logging in Tasmania is concerned. If there is one major factor that is going to be completely freed up to continue destroying national heritage it is the logging industry under the regional forest agreements, and that in particular means the Bacon government in Tasmania and Gunns Pty Ltd, the world's biggest woodchipper of hardwood forests.
I put it to the minister that the Meander Dam, which is currently before Environment Minister Kemp, should, under this legislation, be halted because it is endangering a prime habitat of the tiger quoll, a marsupial carnivore. The independent umpire in Tasmania determined that the dam should not proceed. What happened there? Lack of good faith was shown by the Howard government and Environment Minister Green in Tasmania, who hurried into the parliament to overturn the determination of the Land and Environment Court, so to speak, in Tasmania so that the dam building could proceed, the habitat could be flooded and the endangered species could be driven a little further towards extinction.
Minister Kemp has yet to make the decision to show that, if only on one occasion, this environment planning and conservation bill can have teeth. The problem with the legislation before us is that besides abolishing the Australian Heritage Commission and independent expertise, at least in listing places and things of supreme national heritage value, it gives the powers across to the minister to both list and delist places in Australia—in other words, to come under political suasion. Last night the minister said that, when listing national heritage places, they did have to take into account economic and social factors. Read for that big corporations, and indeed in some cases small corporations, wanting to grab the Australian people's heritage and develop it for their own ends.
We have heard precious little by way of a response to the request for information about Point Nepean. There was a request to Senator Hill to give an assurance that the heritage values there will be protected as the government moves to privatise an extraordinarily important part of the Australian national heritage, including historic buildings, in Victoria. But no plan has been put before this committee; there has been no covenanting— just a submission that the prospective developers in that case all feel that they can meet the objective of looking after heritage values. It is a matter of saying, `Leave it to private enterprise.' I, for one, have been around for far too long to do anything of the sort, and I think the minister should have presented the terms and conditions, if privatisation must occur, for any developer so that we can clearly see for ourselves that Point Nepean will be protected.
I could move on to talk about Recherche Bay in Tasmania but there will be a specific amendment in relation to that so I will wait until then. The amendment that we are considering deals with land clearing. This is a very important Greens amendment. It should be supported by the Labor Party as well as the Democrats. I do not believe that support will be forthcoming. I do not see a substitute or alternative arrangement. We should be seeing one; otherwise there will be no effective mechanism for the Commonwealth to intervene in the interests of the nation to prevent the destruction of prime native vegetation in Australia. What could be more prime than, for example, the Styx Valley in Tasmania, where the tallest hardwood forests on the face of the planet are being cleared at a prodigious rate, right up to the boundary of the current World Heritage area, under the Snowy Range, under the authority of Prime Minister Howard?
Let me refer to the Tarkine wilderness in north-west Tasmania. There is a pipeline track there, through the heart of that rainforest. It has been there since 1965, when the then Tasmanian Labor Premier, Eric Reece, gave the authority for that track to be cut through the heart of the wilderness in order to take iron ore from the Savage River mine to Port Latta on the north coast. It is there; but it has been sealed off and the magnificent rainforest on either side has been protected in the intervening nearly 40 years. Now, suddenly, under the Bacon government in Tasmania, there has been a public announcement by forests minister Paul Lennon. Recently, by the way, at a meeting in New Norfolk, where people were objecting to more log trucks being driven past their schools and through their town, he said that it was his job to defend the logging industry in every aspect, right across the board—no give, nowhere, no time.
But when it comes to the heart of the rainforests—the greatest temperate rainforest that our nation has, and which should be given priority for listing under this legislation—what will be the act that pre-empts that legislation? Mr Lennon has announced it, on behalf of the Prime Minister of Australia, the Rt Hon. John Howard, whose imprimatur is right on this, under the regional forest agreement—that is, the logging of 2,000 cubic metres of these statuesque, giant Antarctic beech, myrtle beech, for extraction by Britton Brothers and others in northern Tasmania so that they can make money out of them. There is no need for it because if you go across to Burnie, you will find a pile of rainforest woodchips there, including myrtle, on the wharf, ready to be sent to Japan to make paper. Under the mismanagement of Gunns Pty Ltd, massive quantities of rainforest are being logged for woodchipping at $10 a tonne royalty—or less than that. On the private land, of course, they cut down the forest, put the trees through the woodchip mill and get $100 freight on board per tonne for woodchip—sent to a ship standing offshore—for logging these forests which have been growing for centuries.
The Tarkine is of World Heritage significance and would be listed now as a World Heritage area if the previous Labor government or this Howard government had nominated it. It has extraordinary natural values. As I say, it is the largest temperate rainforest in Australia. It is bigger than the Daintree and the forests of the north which are tropical rainforests and which are World Heritage listed. It has extraordinarily important Indigenous values. It is named after the Tarkina people on the west coast and the Tommeginne people who were inland from that. This is the `forest of the dancing snakes'. It does not matter to this government; it does not matter under this legislation. The first priority will be to log in the heart of it so that some small-time operator can make a quick dollar. 
If I am wrong about this, let us hear it from the minister. But there is enormous fear about this on the north-west coast of Tasmania, at a time when what is creating jobs in Tasmania—and it is growing prodigiously; the ferries are packed—is tourism. People are coming to Tasmania to see its natural and built heritage, which we have more of, thank goodness, per square inch than most other places on the planet. People are not coming to see these forests horizontal on a log truck. They are coming to see them vertical in their god-given ambience, with their wildlife, with their streams flowing crisp and fresh, and with the cleanest air in the world, as has been monitored at Cape Grim, just west of the Tarkine. Of all the monitoring stations on the face of the planet, it has the cleanest air.
What is planned under the regional forest agreement with respect to the Tarkine? It is being eroded at record rates at the moment, under Forestry Tasmania, the Tasmanian government and Prime Minister Howard. It is planned to put in a forest furnace at Smithton, so that more of it will be burnt to provide electricity through Basslink to unsuspecting Melbourners who will be buying it as so-called `green power'.
I ask the minister: what is being done to review this decision on red myrtle? It was part of the regional forest agreement for determination in the five-year review, and there has to be a decision made which is agreed to by Minister Kemp. Is he going to make sure that there is not this dangerous environmental trespass on the pipeline track to get at that red myrtle or, as usual, are we going to hear nothing, or at best weasel words, about that?
That brings me to an important heritage matter. It is one of many, but I want to bring up the issue of logging at Kindred on the Leven River in northern Tasmania. There, we are assured, under the Forest Practices Code in Tasmania, rare and endangered species will be protected. Here was a concentration of Eucalyptus viminalis down to just a couple of per cent of its original range. Under the Forest Practices Code, which is Prime Minister Howard's guarantee to the Australian people that such values will be protected, the private landowner moved in and flattened the area. He did so without a timber-harvesting plan; without policing under the so-called Forest Practices Code, which is abused repeatedly; without an injunction from the Tasmanian Forest Practices Board, which is supposed to be the arbiter in Tasmania; and without a squeak out of the Hon. Paul Lennon, the minister for woodchipping and forests in Tasmania, or the Premier, the minister for national parks. 
There was illegal logging. That viminalis was sold somewhere illegally to an entity which took the illegally logged, rare and endangered Eucalyptus viminalis and sold it onto the market. (Extension of time granted) I ask the minister: does he know who sold that viminalis and, if not, will he find out? I also ask the minister: is it true that, even when a forest practices plan was insisted upon by the Forest Practices Board, the owner then illegally roaded this block, breaching the forest practices plan, in a configuration that was dangerous to the travelling public—a person had to go out with a stop-go sign for the trucks going in and out, carting this national heritage forest off to whatever market it went to? Is it also true that there was then an incursion into the river reserve of the Leven Canyon which allowed pirates to escape with tree ferns and other valuable components of that reserve? 
How extensive was the failure of this system under the Prime Minister's signature to protect the national heritage on the Leven River at Kindred? What has been the response under the legislation we have before us today to ensure that (a) the landowner was stopped immediately his illegal operation was brought to attention and (b) he was brought to book, or is this just another case of dozens and dozens of people flouting this Forest Practices Code and getting away with it—because in Tasmania you do not confront the industry; they determine what happens?
I would like to know that from the minister. The minister will get up and wanly, amongst other things, say, `Oh well, when we and the Democrats put through this legislation and guillotined it through this Senate in June 2000, you will notice that we excluded any further responsibility for the minister for forests under the regional forest agreement.' What I am saying is that that is totally against the spirit of this legislation. The Greens are trying to put federal responsibility for species and places of national heritage significance back in. That is what this bill is about. We have an amendment here to prevent land clearing—its worst excesses, at least—without the authority of the government. 
I am asking the minister: what is the alternative plan the government has in place to (a) prevent the massive land clearing, with its awesome contribution to global warming out of Australia and (b) in particular, prevent the destruction of some of the most delicate, important, valuable, beautiful and inspiring components of native vegetation, including rare and endangered species, in Australia? That seems to be happening at a greater rate than ever before in history under Prime Minister Howard's authority—if not signed authority, then withdrawn responsibility. What is going to be done about that? Doesn't the Prime Minister care? He knows about the matters I am talking about because there is a line of authority and he signed the document which gave the guarantee and, of course, he will want to know that his guarantee from 1997 is being carried out. 
I ask any member of this committee, any party at all: if the Greens' land-clearing trigger—which, as I said, I think is far too loose, but it is here—which gives the federal minister for the environment the power to intervene on excessive land clearing is not the right one, what is your solution? The worst thing we can do here is say, `Well, it's not exactly what we would like so we won't vote for it and we'll have nothing. We'll allow the situation to continue.' We are legislators for this great nation of ours; we are the custodians of this nation's natural and cultural heritage.
This bill, which I hold up here—500 pages about to become 700 pages—is `the book' of protecting the Australian people's heritage for future generations. I am saying it is a failure when it comes to forests and woodlands and rare and endangered species—not just the plants involved but the wildlife that live amongst them. I am asking everybody, including the Labor Party: if you do not support this amendment, where is yours? What are you going to do about the rapid deterioration of the nation's heritage? This bill does not have teeth. For goodness sake, give it teeth by supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-19,"—As Senator Brown has finished with the bill, I would like to begin with the bill and put this amendment into context in this debate. Hopefully we will get to the final vote on this very important package of heritage bills today. I think this is the fourth or fifth time we have resumed this discussion in this chamber. Hopefully we will see this through today and it will give us a far better means of protecting our national heritage than the current system. 
Indeed it has been a long time coming. The process began under the previous Labor government. I think these bills have had a six-year gestation period. Senator Hill may be able to help me a bit with the time line. There have been some three years of active negotiation and discussion. In the last six to 12 months they have been quite frenetic and fraught with a few difficulties but we are virtually there. What gives me great heart is the number of organisations that are supportive of this legislation: the Heritage Commission, the Australian Council of National Trusts, the Humane Society, WWF and the list goes on. There are about 20 of them all hoping that we will see this legislation through today. 
I will look specifically at the issues Senator Brown has raised. Yes, in Tasmania there is a major problem. We are effectively sitting and watching our heritage being trashed. Our old forests are being reduced to those various coloured piles of woodchips that I have seen on the waterfront at Burnie. At the same time we are seeing more and more people on the bushwalking tracks. I have done a fair bit of bushwalking down in Tasmania and the last time I was there they were at the point—and Senator Brown may be able to help me with this—of deciding whether or not Cradle Mountain track should be accessible by permit only over Christmas because so many people are using that track.
—No, but they are moving to that.
—You cannot say to them, `Well, go and do the south-west track.' To start with, that is not very well developed and is really for very qualified, experienced, very fit people. The last time I was down there I went on the walk that takes you up to the Walls of Jerusalem and that was packed with people going both ways for the entire day that I was going up. A few days later when I was coming back there were fewer people because it had been effectively snowing in the middle of summer. The tracks are packed, and what is Tasmania doing? It is clear-felling areas that could be the next walking area, the next tourist destination. One of my daughters has already walked much of that area in the Tarkine, on virtually no tracks at all. It is a beautiful place that the Tasmanian government could put real resources into for its tourism potential. But we are not seeing that, and I agree with Senator Brown that this legislation is not dealing with that. But neither, unfortunately, are Senator Brown's amendments. 
I believe we need to sit down with those stakeholders—those people who are interested. And the same thing applies when we are talking about land clearing. My home state has good land-clearing legislation but people are still finding ways around it and we need to have a far better monitoring and enforcement process. But speaking from a state that has dealt with it, I do not believe we need to come in and wave a big stick over people's heads, with no compensation and no discussion. I believe that that would initially lead to an even greater rate of clearing than we are seeing now, and the way this amendment is written, with its reference to 1,000 hectares, would lead to that. 
In some places where we have endangered species one hectare is too much to be cleared. I draw the chamber's attention to a letter I had today from Alastair Graham of the Tasmanian Conservation Trust. They are looking again at this issue and they are actively in debate and discussion with government, as I am, on these issues. But there needs to be a complete ban on land clearing, a complete ban on logging of rainforest and a complete ban on industrial logging of old-growth forests rather than a blanket ban applied in this way. We certainly need to deal with this issue. Once you look at who the cessation of land clearing is going to affect you can see that it would only affect a handful of families. 
People are resistant to change. They are particularly resistant to change if they do not have any view of where their future lies and what is going to happen to them. People are concerned about bureaucracy. As some farmers have said to me, bureaucrats are deciding for them where they can put fences and how many cattle they can run. This is a process that we certainly cannot let drag on, and I am very pleased that we are finally very close to an agreement in Queensland. Senator Brown, I certainly acknowledge your best intentions but unfortunately this amendment is not the way to go. Hopefully the Tasmanian government will come to its senses because this is where a lot of the problem lies and, with a review of the RFAs, hopefully we can get some sense into the heads of the members of the Tasmanian government.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-19,"—I will respond briefly. There are a lot of points that could be made but the first is that the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is regarded as of the best of its type in the world. Whereas you can always argue as to whether it could have or should have gone further, it does give the Commonwealth, for the first time, a significant role in the protection of assets of national importance. I think it has made a significant contribution to the sorts of goals that Senator Brown has been outlining. Senator Brown was opposed to it from the start. Senator Brown has never seen the legislative process as particularly useful in conservation. Regrettably he has not used the influence that he has in this place to achieve better conservation outcomes through the legislative process. It is true that it did not cover forests that were subject to regional forest agreements. The reason it did not was that it was a process that was already in place across Australia to provide not only better conservation outcomes in relation to forests but sustainable economic returns.
It was a policy that was agreed to by the two major parties in this country. In fact, it was commenced by the Labor Party but taken up by us. Its goal was, on the one hand, to achieve a comprehensive, representative and adequate conservation reserve system and, on the other hand, to allow for what was not within that reserve forestry that was conducted on both an economic and ecologically sustainable basis. A great deal of research from many of the best scientists within the field in Australia was undertaken over a considerable period of time to ensure that wise judgments were made as to where the boundaries were drawn, that proper assessments of the sorts of values that Senator Brown has been talking about—endangered species and the like—were properly taken into account in drawing those maps and that nothing is locked in forever, because mistakes can be made. There were review periods. Senator Brown made reference to the review of the Tasmanian RFA that is due to take place, and I am seeking advice on the status of that review at the moment. When he asks me about the issue of the red myrtle or of a particular endangered eucalyptus I will get that information. The advisers that I have here today do not have it at hand. That is why forestry that was subject to these ecological assessments was not included within the EPBC Act.
As I have said on many occasions, conservation in this country is really a partnership between the various tiers of government, with the states under our Constitution having primary responsibility for natural resource management. When the structure of the new Commonwealth legislation was being negotiated with the states, there was debate about whether extensive land clearing should have been included as a trigger as a matter of national environmental significance. It was decided, in the end, not to include it. Some of the reasons were covered by Senator Lees in her contribution. Some states had already enacted effective legislation, such as South Australia, which passed its legislation on this matter some 25 years ago. It was very difficult to determine a formula. The formula being proposed by Senator Brown is simply an arbitrary formula.
For those and other reasons it was decided that their share of the burden, emphasis and responsibility should remain on the states. We have been seeking to implement that commitment on a cooperative basis ever since. Reference has been made today to the slow but, it now seems, positive progress that has been made in Queensland. Queensland is likely to agree to, legislate and enforce new restraints that will be financially supported by the Commonwealth as well as the states. So the Commonwealth will be a party to achieving a better land-clearing outcome in Queensland. It is in the effective implementation of that sort of partnership that we believe the issue of land clearing might be best progressed.
This debate has been something of an aside, I have to say, to the purpose of the heritage bills that are before the chamber, but I accept that the issues are important. Whereas the formula that has been adopted across this chamber—with Labor on the RFAs and then with the Democrats on the EPBC Act—certainly moves us in the right direction, I do recognise that it will never satisfy Senator Brown and we will have to have these asides from time to time. Seeking, on the part of the Commonwealth, to unilaterally breach the agreement that was made with the states in the planning of the EPBC Act will not, in my submission, achieve the outcomes that we are seeking anywhere near as effectively as the sort of cooperative arrangement that we are in the process of implementing in Queensland. On that basis, the government will not support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-19,"—I want to indicate that the Democrats will support this amendment. I do not think it is ideal. As I said yesterday, there would be some difficulties in terms of administration and enforcement of such a law. However, we are all getting rather frustrated with what the minister describes as attempts to develop a cooperative arrangement with the states. From my perspective there is not a great deal of cooperative rhetoric or language that is being heard between the Commonwealth and state governments, and I do not think this is helping the situation. The government did commit to moving forward on land clearing, but effectively we have heard not a lot since that time. It is little wonder that senators in this place, such as Senator Brown and us, use this opportunity to put forward what may be not entirely 100 per cent ideal legislation. But it is the only tool we have in order to push governments along. I suggest that the ALP think seriously about supporting this.
Let the government take it away if it is not supportive of this model. Then come back to this chamber and suggest something which is. That way at least we can see this making some progress. I think we are all accustomed to making change over time in this place. Certainly I would argue that that is what this legislation does for heritage. It is not the ideal answer, but it is a start. On that basis, we are supporting it and its thrust. Nonetheless, I think we should apply the same approach to matters such as land clearing. We will go on shortly, Senator Lundy, to your amendments to do with greenhouse. It is much the same problem. In other words, an amendment which we might develop in this place is an attempt, as much as anything, to get it right. It probably needs a great deal more thought and effort to make sure that it is right. Nonetheless, it is a good start and that is, I think, what we should be aiming for.
As I understand it, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust talked about clear-felling of old-growth forests, and I think it is the case that Tasmania Together proposed to phase out clear-fell old-growth forest logging by 2010 and stop clear-felling of higher conservation forests by January 2003. I think if we were able to work with the states to agree on that phasing out—perhaps an even more reasonable proposal than that, I would suggest— this would at least give us some confidence that we were moving in the right direction. I want to indicate that that is what the Democrats propose to do.
I really think that the minister will have to get accustomed to the idea of these kinds of amendments being put forward until there is something more concrete that the chamber can feel assured about in terms of land clearing, because it is a huge issue for this country. It is a greenhouse issue as much as a biodiversity and conservation issue. It is also a heritage issue because, as Senator Brown often says in this place, some of these very old trees, in particular, and ecological systems are a really significant part of our heritage.
I would also comment—as it seems I have done thousands of times in this place—that the minister says that there is already a protection system in place: our RFA system looks after forests, it is sustainable and all of that. But even state governments come to the understanding that the RFA system does not work in Victoria. The Bracks government, and I congratulate them for this again, has decided that logging in the Wombat State Forest is not sustainable, partly because they are running out of water in Geelong—a bit like in Adelaide, Senator Hill, but of course that is not quite the same problem. For that reason they are phasing out logging.
I think this is a recognition that the RFA process never was about a sustainable yield of timber and probably never will be. In most cases there should be sensible reviews to determine whether the RFA process is based on a fallacy, and that is that you can keep on doing this clear-fell logging forever and ever. I will leave my comments at that, but it is important to say, I think, that we cannot just say, `We won't deal with land clearing or forestry issues anymore because they're already dealt with by the RFA process.' Time and time again, the evidence demonstrates that to be not the case.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—The minister said that this is the best bill in the world. It is very easy to say that, but it is also very easy to prove that that is absolutely wrong. When it comes to the logging of the nation's heritage forests, you only have to look at New Zealand and Thailand, which have stopped it. Here we have a licence for it to continue at a greater rate than ever before in history. This bill is a manifest failure. It is one of the worst bills in the world when it comes to protection of the forest heritage and the wildlife heritage of this nation. The Greens are trying to put into the bill a tooth to help protect that forest heritage where the delinquency of the authorities in Tasmania is allowing even the soft rules of the regional forest agreements to be broken. The government is going to oppose it, and the question is: will the Labor Party oppose it?
Senator Lees said that hopefully we will see the Tasmanian government come to its senses. I would be with Senator Lees on that hope if I did not live with all those log trucks ripping through Hobart, Launceston, Devonport and all the other towns of Tasmania that are en route to woodchip mills. Do you know how many? There are 500 trucks a day going out of our old-growth forests into the woodchip mills to export, amongst other things, some of the most statuesque, important and rare forests of the world to the rubbish dumps of the Northern Hemisphere, via paper mills, at the lowest return in history—as I said earlier—to the Tasmanian people in terms of royalties. `Best bill in the world,' my foot!
The minister said, `Senator Brown has never seen the legislative process as worth while.' That is quite wrong. I am here as a legislator. I have legislation before the minister to give him the power to intervene on land clearing and he says, `No, wrong way around.' I am the legislator. It is the government here who are saying, `We don't want to legislate.' They do not see this parliament as being the place for legislation on this matter. Sure, the woodchip industry has prodigious influence. It gives donations to the big political parties. It has business lunches and dinners with relevant ministers in Tasmania. It rules over the 80 per cent public sentiment against this destruction of our forests. That is why we do require legislation in this place. We do not have legislation in this place because the government do not see the legislative process as worth while. They see their cosy arrangement with the job-shedding woodchip corporations as what is worth while to them in a political sense. It is the forests and the wildlife that suffer as we go.
The minister said that endangered species are protected properly by the maps. Let me tell you what goes on within areas of the maps drawn up under the regional forest agreement—just a pencil sketch. The rare and endangered tiger quoll I spoke about earlier is being extensively poisoned by 1080 under Mr Howard's signature and the regional forest agreement. The beautiful little bettong—now almost extinct on the mainland but still numerous in Tasmania— with its white-tipped tail is being poisoned under the Forest Practices Code as 1080 is spread out across these forest areas once they have been logged and fire burnt, because they do not want these animals coming in and grazing on the precious seedlings which give them their money from the next crop of woodchips. We are talking about total destruction of ecosystems. This poisoning is different to that on the mainland. This is not poisoning of feral animals; this is poisoning purely, 100 per cent, to kill native wildlife, including endangered species, under this legislation which the minister says is the best in the world.
Then there is the giant wedge-tailed eagle, bigger in Tasmania than its mainland cousins, which nests in these forests. They have simply been cut out from underneath it. We do not know the impact of 1080. Some say it does not affect it. That is codswallop. The fact is that the wedge-tailed eagle is down to 200 breeding pairs and one of the biggest threats to it—it is also threatened by farmers poisoning carcasses—is the loss of habitat which is being cut from under it by Gunns Pty Ltd and the minister for forests in Tasmania, Paul Lennon, under the authority of Prime Minister Howard through his signature on the regional forest agreement.
When you get to the streamside reserves you find extensive breaches of the Forest Practices Code where the logging industry, including Forestry Tasmania itself, has gone in through streamsides which are supposed to be protected and which, amongst other things, are prime nesting sites in Tasmania for the pure white goshawk, which is also down to 200 breeding pairs. You see it going through the forest like a white flash; it is one of the most magnificent things to see in action. It is being driven just a bit closer to extinction every time a nesting site is lost through an illegal operation under the Forest Practices Code—under the authority of the Prime Minister—because there is no proper comeback against the people who do things like that, including Forestry Tasmania under the authority of the Rt Hon. Paul Lennon, Deputy Premier of Tasmania, and the Premier.
This legislation says: `We won't touch forests like that in Tasmania. We will not protect those species. We will endorse their getting closer to extinction at the greatest rate in Australian history of forest destruction. While we are at it, we will cut across the job-creating tourism industry and give the benefit to Gunns Pty Ltd'—the CEO of which, Mr John Gay, having sacked dozens of people in recent years, cashed in his options on 31 July this year and made $7 million in one day, in one transaction, out of these forests we are trying to protect. Gunns has made a 35 per cent return on its capital so far. Forestry Tasmania has made a negative return. It makes the books look as though it is earning one per cent. These are the Tasmanian people's forests but Gunns is making the money and—besides that which goes into the pockets of Mr Gay and other members of the board like the former Premier of Tasmania, Robin Gray—it bounces across Bass Strait, through the Stock Exchange and into the pockets of shareholders including the Commonwealth Bank and Perpetual Trustees, doing nothing for Tasmania. That is the economic side of this destruction of rare and endangered species, grand forests and Tasmania's future fortune under the failure of this legislation.
I propose a tooth which says, `Any owner who is going to log more than 1,000 hectares over five years will be guilty of a misdemeanour which will lead to 50,000 penalty units for a body corporate or 5,000 penalty units for an individual.' Guess what? The government says no. It says, `Oh no, it's the environment.' Criminal behaviour towards the environment shall not be created when it comes to forests because that might just entrap some of the high-flyers who are robbing the public of their environmental heritage as well as their right to a decent return if they were to log these forests. Ditto when it comes to the red myrtle in the Tarkine, which is being targeted in the coming summer by a get-rich-quick group of operators who are quite happy to see much bigger amounts of myrtle from elsewhere going to whatever downstream processing designs they have for it. They are quite happy to see it go to the woodchip mills and be sent as scrap to the paper mills of Japan, Korea and China under the authority of Prime Minister Howard and the regional forest agreement.
This is scandalous. The Tasmanian situation is an absolute environmental, economic and employment scandal. That is why the Greens are calling in the state and federal parliaments for a judicial inquiry into it. But, far short of that, surely we could legislate to make things right in the interests of this nation. Surely the time to do that is when you have before this parliament a bill amending the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. This is the bill whereby we get the teeth to do the right thing by the people of Tasmania and of this nation. I have moved an amendment on behalf of the Australian Greens which says, `Let's have a very blunt tooth, at least, to stop this massive rate of land clearing not just in Tasmania but also elsewhere in Australia where it occurs,' and the government has said, `No, it is better that we have nothing.' Read into that prodigious influence on this government by big-money concerns at the expense of the people and the heritage of Australia.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-19,"—Senator Brown knows full well that Labor do not have an intention to support any of these amendments apart, of course, from our own. We do so on the basis that the main problem with this bill comes back to the issue covered in Labor's amendments right at the start: this bill is removing the independence of the Heritage Commission. It effectively makes all of the decisions that are going to be dealt with under this new bill political decisions—decisions made in the Minister for the Environment and Heritage's office. For this reason, Labor believe this bill cannot be supported.
Like the Greens and other parties, we have taken the opportunity to move an amendment—it is coming up shortly—to highlight issues of concern which this bill presented an opportunity to say something about. Our amendment relates to a greenhouse trigger. At the same time, we are well familiar with the opportunity that bills such as this present to argue the cause on each of these issues. What we are hearing here from Senator Brown is his well and often stated case. It is not a case that Labor agree with, and we have a series of complex views on these matters that we have argued out in this chamber before. As I said, that is the approach Labor are taking to the package of bills. We are not going to support them. We know the Greens are not going to support them. We hope the Democrats are not going to support them now that they have effectively had to do a mea culpa because their deal with the government has fallen through, with the government now relying on Senator Lees and other crossbenchers to see these bills go through.
I do not believe there is a justification for this bill passing this place. I do not believe that the merits exist within what is left already for it to pass. I note with interest that we are now almost going through an exercise with the Democrats trying to outgreen the Greens, the Greens trying to maintain their credentials, if you like, and Meg Lees coming up from the rear trying to argue the case in some absurd fashion that there is some ongoing concern in the context of a bill that she is going to support. It is beyond belief that we find ourselves here debating these points when the most critical principle of heritage protection in consideration here is its independence—the ability to have areas or items listed without it being a political decision. We have been in the chamber now for a long time debating these bills on the basis that somehow we can make them better through a whole series of amendments. The Democrats got as many of theirs up as they possibly could, with Senator Lees coming in with a group of amendments that backed in the rest of what effectively constitutes the deal with the coalition.
It is not going to be a good outcome either way, and if everyone was genuine and genuinely committed to heritage protection in Australia they would realise that once that fundamental independence is gone from the Heritage Commission these bills are unsupportable in the first place. I take Senator Lees to task over her comments about all of those groups she keeps referring to and saying support the bill. The Australian Conservation Foundation does not support the bill. We know now, via comments made by Commissioner Rodney Dillon, that ATSIC has grave concerns about the future of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage protection as well. Their fear, and indeed Labor's concern, is that those issues will not be proceeded with in due haste on behalf of the coalition.
There is a whole range of issues tangled up here, which makes the best outcome not proceeding with this legislation in its current form. I believe the coalition government have an obligation to actually go back and do what they should have done at the start, which was come forward with a model that did protect the independence of the Australian Heritage Commission and made the appropriate updating of the act, which is, I guess, the main thrust of their argument as to why it should pass. Losing the independence of the Heritage Commission is a trade-off which is far too great for Labor to contemplate supporting. It is like the crossbench—in particular, Senator Lees, who has done the deal—saying, `We know this proposition needs to be updated and we are actually quite happy for you to completely destroy the principles that gave it life in the first place,' which are by having independent decision making and an independent decision-making structure around it. It is unbelievable that the compromise has been so great. It has obviously been a significant focus of the coalition to ensure that compromise, and the amendments we have seen which have tried to fiddle around the edges by increasing accountability are all designed to try and offset that fundamental trade-off that we think is unacceptable. We will continue with our opposition and I look forward to having an opportunity, hopefully very shortly, to move Labor's amendment in relation to a greenhouse trigger so that we too can take the opportunity that this bill presents to have a say on the issues that are important to our hearts.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-19,"—I realise I should resist the temptation, because we have been debating this for many days—indeed, this has now been six years in the making—but I cannot just let that go through to the keeper. This will be a great outcome for heritage in this country. Indeed, it is because people are committed to preserving our national heritage that we have this bill before us today. From all the groups that I have mentioned through to people in the departments and those at a ministerial level, we have people committed to getting this legislation through. Senator Lundy mentioned the ACF. The ACF has become an absolute dinosaur. The ACF refuses to do anything that involves a coalition government. The ACF is sitting out there waiting for the next time the Labor Party is in government. Obviously that is going to happen at some time in the future—it is inevitable in Australian politics. Senator Hill thinks it is a little amusing but, Senator Hill, at some stage you are going to have to pass the baton across to this side. They will move over to your side and you will come over here and on we will go. That is the day the ACF is waiting for before it will support anything a government does. Who knows what the Labor Party are going to do? As Senator Brown has already said, they are at the heart of the problem of the destruction of our national forests.
However, putting that aside, yes, a letter did come yesterday from ATSIC, from Commissioner Dillon, and we have spoken to Commissioner Dillon since then. Unfortunately, he was deliberately misled and some very inaccurate information was passed on to him. He does not now support the comments that he made as a result of being substantially misled. So let us just get on with it—let us get this legislation through. I will not read the long list of 20-odd organisations, starting with the National Trust, that are supporting what we are doing. Of course there is still some tidying up to be done. This needs monitoring and we need to work on constant improvements. But it is an enormous step forward from where we were. 
The ALP will be moving an amendment in a moment that they hope will sink the bill. They are trying yet another strategy because obviously, if their greenhouse amendment gets up, the government will not be very pleased. I will argue the case or not for that amendment later, and by the look of it that will be after question time. I think the ALP's behaviour and attitude to this whole issue have been very disappointing.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-19,"—If it is the case, as you say, that Commissioner Dillon has retracted his written statement and it has been refuted, we have not seen a retraction. It is very easy to stand up in this place and say, `Don't worry about that letter.' The fact is we are in possession of the letter and we have not been advised of any such retraction. It is probably worth while at this point outlining the actual concerns expressed. They include, in the final paragraphs:
In conclusion, I would like to reiterate what I said in my last letter: that Indigenous heritage may not always be protected where this protection stands in the way of short-term economic gain. For ATSIC to support this bill it would need to be satisfied that:
·	the government will commit in Parliament to immediately invigorate the negotiations with the ATSIHP Bill;
·	ensure that the RNE becomes a part of the matters of national environmental significance under the EPBC Act;
·	the Bill includes the provision of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage inspectors with appropriate powers to ensure adequate protection of Indigenous heritage;
·	some technical amendments are considered to the objects of the wildlife protection clauses that came into force in January 2002 to recognise the inherent Indigenous rights and ownership in wildlife similar to the clause that was supported unanimously in the Senate; and
·	the emergency listing provisions are strengthened along with other matters that ATSIC has already raised.
I look forward to getting some clarification about the status of this letter because there is nothing on the deck to suggest that it is not still current in terms of that advice.
I can only go back to my original point. It has been quite an exercise hearing the crossbenchers—the Greens, the Democrats and Senator Lees—vying for the strongest green credential. You cannot take away the ultimate point about this legislation, which is: what you are doing is selling out. You are letting the government potentially politicise the listing of Australian heritage and heritage protection. I cannot see how this exercise can be justified. It is just another example of the lengths the coalition will go to, and the ability of the crossbenchers to be manipulated into a situation of supporting something for gains that do not have to come with a trade-off. In this case particularly Senator Lees held out and asked for and insisted on from this government that they cover all bases. That is what this parliament is all about. So I am concerned to hear continually their justification and how great this bill is going to be. 
Labor have already put on the record, and we acknowledge, that there have been improvements and there are some improvements in this bill. They are way overdue. It does not cancel out our fundamental point: that the loss of independence of the Heritage Commission is an unforgivable sell-out. It is an unforgivable trade-off and one that we will not accept. Nothing changes that perspective. I know that Senator Brown has already said that he is not supporting the bill either and it remains to be seen whether this deal will ultimately lead to a sell-out deal being done with Senator Lees. 
The Democrats would have loved their set of amendments to have got up. It was fascinating to sit back and watch the bickering about whose amendment was better and whose amendment was worse, and the tinkering around the edges, and the government just sitting back and saying, `We will have one of theirs and one of theirs,' and making up the weakest mix of whatever they were trying to do. That is the exercise that we observed yesterday in this place. That is what it has been reduced to. That fundamental trade-off has been done and it is unforgivable. As I have said many times, Labor will not be supporting this fundamentally flawed bill.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—Firstly, I do not agree with Senator Lees that the Australian Conservation Foundation is a dinosaur organisation. I think that it is very unfair. It is a wonderful organisation. It has a huge membership and it is growing. I am going to see its new energy efficient premises in Melbourne in the coming week or two. I think it is an absolute example of environmental practice being put in place by an organisation which is the umbrella organisation of Australian environmental groups and one that has huge public support.
—There are not many people under the umbrella.
—Senator Lees, I think there are not enough people under the umbrella—I would agree with that. It is just a pity that the government was not under the umbrella of good environmental sense as well. When groups like the Australian Conservation Foundation get attacked like that, it is best to let them speak for themselves. They have given us an issues paper from last Monday under the headline `Australia's Heritage protection up for grab'. I seek leave for it to be incorporated into Hansard.
Leave granted.

ISSUES PAPER

ATTENTION: Political and Environment Reporters
Australia's Heritage protection up for grab
The Senate will decide the future of Australia's heritage this week. ACF has consistently asked for improvements to draft legislation if it is to be better than the existing Australian Heritage Commission (AHC) Act 1974.
While the AHC Act and particularly its administration definitely needs improvement, there are key weaknesses in the proposed heritage bills and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999 into which heritage laws are being shoved. Amendments tabled in the Senate do improve the legislation, but do not raise the standard of heritage protection to what we should expect.
The existing Heritage law has been used to protect Jervis Bay, Shoalwater Bay and Shelburne Bay. There should be no retreat on this law or on the independence of the Australian Heritage Commission which administers it.
ACF has consistently highlighted critical shortfalls in the government's heritage legislation and called on all parties to seek amendments which include:
·	definition of actions which trigger the legislation must include government authorisations as under existing heritage laws. Proposed changes will use the same definition as the EPBC Act 1999, which has generated poor environmental assessment outcomes. Only one development application has been knocked back in almost three years and of nearly 900 development applications, only six have required public environment reports or environment impact statements (see below);
·	protection for the place and its values not just values: The values only approach, which the Government unsuccessfully tried to foist on the World Heritage Convention, allows for piecemeal protection of sites of significance. The existing AHC Act focuses on the place and does not mention values;
·	listing of sites on heritage registers: the decision about whether a place is going to be put on the National or Commonwealth Heritage list should be based on a place's heritage significance alone. The Government wants to politicise this decision and be able to reject a listing because of social or economic considerations. If the lists are to have value they should be based on heritage significance. This is the situation for listing of endangered species under the EPBC Act where only environmental issues can be considered—social and economic concerns are considered in relation to individual proposals. Accepting socio-economic considerations at the listing stage allows for the politicisation of those considerations and is a backward step on the EPBC Act;
·	All Commonwealth heritage sites to be put on Heritage List: The Commonwealth has hundreds of site on the existing Register of the National Estate and these should all be placed in the legislation creating the new Commonwealth Heritage List.
·	An independent Australian Heritage Commission: The statutory independence of the existing Australian Heritage Commission is proposed to be replaced with an Australian Heritage Council, relegating it to a primarily advisory role.
Problems with the EPBC Act
There are a number of problems with the EPBC Act including its failure to directly address greenhouse pollution and landclearing, its mechanisms for delegating approval powers to the states and broad Ministerial discretion.
The latter is particularly relevant because of the relatively small number of full public assessments being undertaken by the Commonwealth. Unless a more rigorous approach is taken this is likely to continue.
By May 2003, of the 237 development proposals deemed to require environmental assessment, only 6 had gone through some kind of public assessment (5 assessments by Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), 1 Public Environment Report (PER), and 0 Public inquiries), compared to the figure of up to 10 per year under the former EPIP Act.
The uncertainty generated by the broad Ministerial discretion and other weaknesses in the referral, assessment and approval processes of the EPBC Act must be overhauled if the Act is to be effective legislation protecting Australia's biodiversity and its natural and cultural heritage.

—I thank you and, in doing so, point out the end of that document from the Australian Conservation Foundation about this piece of legislation. As is Senator Lundy, they are very worried about the independence of the Australian Heritage Commission being lost and in fact the whole commission being abolished. The paper states:
There are a number of problems with the EPBC Act including its failure to directly address greenhouse pollution and landclearing, its mechanisms for delegating approval powers to the states—
away from the Commonwealth and giving broad discretion to the minister in Canberra rather than to the independent Australian Heritage Commission. This discretion of the minister is—
... particularly relevant because of the relatively small number of full public assessments being undertaken by the Commonwealth—
on environmental matters. The paper states:
Unless a more rigorous approach is taken this is likely to continue.
By May this year—that is, after three years of operation of the legislation—
... of the 237 development proposals—
that are threatening environments of national significance, as the ACF put it—
... deemed to require environmental assessment, only 6 had gone through some kind of public assessment ... compared to the figure of up to 10 per year under the former EPIP Act.
You can see from that that this legislation is not performing. I will go back to the final paragraph of the ACF letter:
The uncertainty generated by the broad Ministerial discretion and other weaknesses in the referral, assessment and approval processes of the EPBC Act must be overhauled if the Act is to be effective legislation protecting Australia's biodiversity and its natural and cultural heritage.
The fact is that the legislation is there. It has replaced the previous legislation; we have had that fight and we the Greens lost it and the Democrats won it in the year 2000. Effectively, what we are seeing today are some very limited improvements to try to make the legislation what it was touted to be—that is, the defence of Australia's environmental interest.
What the Greens are saying here is, `Let's empower the minister to act against the excesses of land clearing in Australia, one of the great scourges of the environment.' Maybe because the state governments are Labor—I do not know—the Labor Party is not going to support it and nor is the government. There you see the problem. It is politically influenced against the public sentiment in this country and against this opportunity to do the right thing by the environment.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Brown's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-19,"—I move opposition amendment (2) on sheet 3039:
(2)	Schedule 1, page 11 (after line 7), after item 4, insert:
4A After Subdivision F of Division 1 of Part 3
Insert:
Subdivision FA—Protection of the environment from greenhouse actions
24B Requirement for approval of greenhouse actions
	(1)	A person must not knowingly, intentionally or recklessly take a greenhouse action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the environment.
Civil penalty:
	(a)	for an individual—5,000 penalty units;
	(b)	for a body corporate—50,000 penalty units.
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply to an action if:
	(a)	an approval of the taking of the action by the person is in operation under Part 9 for the purposes of this section; or
	(b)	Part 4 lets the person take the action without an approval under Part 9 for the purposes of this section; or
	(c)	there is in force a decision of the Minister under Division 2 of Part 7 that:
	(i)	the action is not a controlled action; or
	(ii)	the action is a controlled action but this section is not a controlling provision for the action.
24C What is a greenhouse action?
		In this Act, a greenhouse action means any of the following:
	(a)	establishing an industrial plant which emits, or is likely to emit, more than 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalent per year; or
	(b)	any other action, series of actions, or policies which will lead, or are likely to lead, to the emission of more than 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalent per year.
In moving this amendment, I take the opportunity these bills represent to express Labor's view about climate change and to reflect on the coalition government and how its approach to climate change is inconsistent, backward and fundamentally bad for Australia. Domestic action has largely failed and emission projections have recently been revised upwards, as it has become increasingly clear that current programs to reduce emissions are failing. The need to achieve emission reductions is not reflected in the priorities of other government policies, including industry, energy, treasury, and research and development. The coalition government has consistently failed to spend money allocated to climate change in the budget each year. It has delayed spending at the same time as emissions are increasing.
Labor believes that much more needs to be done to tackle climate change. Not a day goes by when the effects of climate change are not being seen and felt. Labor believes that with vision and leadership Australians do not have to choose between decent environmental outcomes and a strong and growing economy. It is possible to have both. In pursuit of this type of sustainable economic growth, Labor is taking this opportunity to move amendments to include a greenhouse trigger in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. This will enable major new projects to be assessed for their greenhouse impact as part of any environmental assessment process, and will ensure that new developments represent best practice and that Australia's national interest is taken into account. This amendment is an expression of Labor's greenhouse policy released in August last year.
Labor's approach to climate change is good for the environment, good for jobs, good for investment and good for industry. Indeed, the passage of these bills gives the government the opportunity to finally deliver on the Prime Minister's 1999 promise of applying a Commonwealth greenhouse trigger under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in relation to new projects that would be major emitters of greenhouse gases. But we have heard already the expression in the chamber by Senator Lees that to include such a trigger in this bill would sink the bills, so it is pretty obvious that Senator Hill has failed to convince his colleagues of the need for a greenhouse trigger and that his successor, the current Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, has not even bothered trying. But promise they did and, four years later, we are still waiting.
Again, in stark contrast, Labor first moved an amendment for inclusion of a greenhouse trigger to the EPBC Act when it was first debated in 1999. To ensure sustainable economic growth, Labor has once again introduced these amendments now. The absence of a trigger exacerbates the damage being done by this government's illogical position in saying that they will meet the Kyoto protocol but steadfastly refusing to ratify it. It is also another example of a fundamental failure of national leadership on reducing Australia's escalating greenhouse emissions. I urge those in the chamber to support these amendments. It is worth noting that the Greens moved similar amendments and we believe not only that our amendments are stronger but also that this is an appropriate opportunity to see whether or not the coalition are capable of taking up the challenge of this crucial issue.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-19,"—I am amazed because I can remember that when I was trying to negotiate a greenhouse trigger to the EPBC Act, Mr Beattie, the Labor Premier of Queensland was totally opposed to it. It is interesting to see that it is now federal Labor policy. We know that we have federal Labor taking one position and Mr Beattie taking another, but my experience, to fill Senator Lundy in on the full story, was that all of the states were totally opposed to it. I now suspect that all Labor premiers are totally opposed to it. This was the stumbling block.
We agreed to a greenhouse trigger in principle and the legislation provides a consultation process with the states. That was commenced, various consultancies were let and advice was given as to what might be the best model in all the circumstances. Discussion papers were put out and so forth but we were not able to reach a conclusion and the consultation process, from the perspective of the government, continues. If Senator Lundy is now indicating that Labor has switched and that the state Labor premiers are now likely to support a greenhouse trigger, that is very useful information for the government to take on board. It may be that one day we can get to an outcome of a greenhouse trigger representing a matter of national environmental significance within the EPBC Act. I thank Senator Lundy for that piece of information. Whilst we are not prepared to sign on in this way, because the act sets out the process for the introduction of new greenhouse triggers, I think her revelation of the new ALP federal policy may be helpful in the future.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—The Greens will be supporting this amendment. It is largely the Greens' amendment brought forward by the Labor Party, but let me concede to Senator Lundy that I think it has a refinement or two that makes it even better. Let me reiterate what we are talking about here. We are talking about an impending global emergency which is going to affect the lives of every citizen on this planet and every Australian for decades to come. The later the action is taken, the greater the action that will be required. Over the last century the earth—this planet, the only living place we have—heated up by one degree Centigrade, or 0.6 degrees to be exact. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change forecast global heating ranging from one to six degrees in this coming century. In the wake of the heating disasters that we just saw in Europe and Asia, where 5,000 people died in France and preliminary figures are going into the thousands in India because of the heatwave, some scientists are now saying that we have to look at seven to 10 degrees heating by the end of this century, making large areas currently inhabited by millions of people totally uninhabitable because of global warming. Who would deny that that is going to involve the extinction of large slabs of our fellow creatures on this planet? That is what 1,200 of the world's top scientists, including 100 Nobel laureates warned us of a decade ago.
Which peoples are the greatest malefactors when it comes to this? Australians, like the Americans, are the worst per capita polluters of the environment and the worst causers of global warming on the face of the planet. Here is an opportunity for the Howard government to do something about it and it is going to vote against it—even when it just pertains, as this bill does, to the environment of Australia. We have 11,000 people in Tuvalu who are going to be missing their country by the end of this century if the worst predictions come true. They have appealed to allow Australia to take them lock, stock and barrel. The Howard government, whose policies are contributing manifestly to this emergent global warming crisis, says, `We won't take them; we will leave it to New Zealand,' where people per capita on average produce half the global warming gasses that are produced in Australia under the Howard government.
The Howard government is going to oppose this greenhouse trigger because of the coal and aluminium industries—not the people of Australia but the big money, vested interests who have open access to Prime Minister Howard's door against the interests of the average Australian citizen. This is culpable; this is irresponsible. This is the government putting its head in the sand as the sand heats up and saying that it is somebody else's problem, particularly the next generation's, or that there will be a technofix. They are dreaming that somebody else should fix up the problem that this government, and like governments around the world under the pressure of these big industries, is creating. It is time that Mr Howard, the cabinet and this government took stock.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I have noticed that, as the broadcast lights come on, Senator Brown has become far more animated and hysterical. 
 (Senator Cook)—Would you state your point of order, Senator Campbell.
—Is there a standing order against overacting?
— There is no point of order.
—That is the sort of reaction to this serious matter that you would expect from the government opposite. It is reprehensible and it is time that they came to grips with this problem, acted maturely and supported the amendment before the Senate.
Progress reported.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-08-19,"— My question is to the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone. Can the minister confirm that wealthy families who borrow money to play the stock market can use these activities to reduce their income to access family tax benefit part A? Does the minister agree with her department's view that trying to crack down on share investment activities that enable rich families to get the family tax benefit cannot occur due to `the complexities of assessment and verification by Centrelink' and because it is not cost effective? Given that this minister has shown she is prepared to strip the tax returns of 650,000 average Australian families each year, no matter that the debts have come about through no fault of those families, when will she show the same alacrity to close this loophole for the rich?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-08-19,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question arising from the partial answer by the minister. Is the minister aware that since 1996 the total value of this stock market margin lending has risen from $2 billion to $10.5 billion and that 130,000 individuals now have margin loans of more than $90,000? Why does this minister continue to hit hardworking low- and middle-income families with large end-of-year debts but reward the growing number of high-income families who play the stock market?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2003-08-19,"—I thank the senator for the question. I will deal first with this allegation of stripping families of their tax returns when the overpayment they might have incurred may have been through no fault of their own. That may be true. There may be families who have quite openly told Centrelink what their income estimate would be during the year and they might have changed it appropriately. There might be families who at the end of the year have a windfall of one type or another—it might be the opportunity for extra overtime, which is appreciated, or it might be a capital gains tax, for example, the selling of a beach house. The capital gain would come in in that year and dramatically push someone over. Of course, they would then incur an overpayment because adjusted taxable income for social security purposes is not the same as taxable income for income tax purposes. 
The key point is of course that family tax benefit is paid on the basis of two things: your income and the number of children that you have, and there are differing rates for the age of the children because it has been ascertained that children cost different amounts at different ages. We can say this: families in the same circumstances should get the same amount of money. If a family overestimates their income because they think they are going to have a pay rise or they think they are going to get overtime and they therefore do not get as much family tax benefit from us, at the end of the year we do what has not been done in the past: we top them up and give them their entitlement so that a family in the same circumstances as another family will get the same amount of money. Equally, a family who has assessed their income in another way and who may have fallen short in their estimate and may therefore have been overpaid will be required to pay that money back. It will be treated, in effect, as a down payment on the next year's entitlement. Up to a certain amount of money, families pay back at $20 and at another amount of money at $40. I do not regard it as stripping them of tax returns.
The family tax benefit is integrated and related to the tax system. Just as in the tax system sometimes lucky people get a cheque saying, `Here you are; you have had too much tax taken away during the year and you get some tax back,' and other people get a notice saying that they have to pay more, with the family tax benefit system some families who have been paid more will be told at the end of the year, `Hold on, you have an overpayment; we have to fix this up,' and hundreds of thousands of families will be told, `Hold on, we did not give you enough,' and we will top them up in a way that no government has previously done.
As to the first part of the question, which related to share trading, the advice I have at this point—and I want to qualify this because I think it needs further checking—is that the definition we use of `adjusted taxable income'—namely, income for social security purposes in relation to family allowances—is the same as Labor used when they means tested their family allowance.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2003-08-19,"—Firstly, in relation to the supplementary question, no-one is hitting hardworking low-income families. Hardworking low-income families—how did they fare in the recession we had to have? Is it the low-income families whose real incomes went down? Yes, it is. Is it low-income families who have got the biggest tax gains—huge tax gains—from us? Yes, it is. Is it low-income families who now get a lot more in family tax benefits? Yes, it is. And do low-income families expect to get more than someone in the same situation? Let me help you here, Senator: no, they do not. Did Labor take into account the averaging of shares? I do not think they did.
Senator, I have already said—you perhaps were not focusing on this issue because you were reading out a question from someone else—I have asked my department to look at this with the tax department and see if there is any loophole that can be reasonably closed, if there is in fact one. Lastly, do not assume that the only people who trade in shares are the rich. You are a bit outdated.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-08-19,"—My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. Will the minister inform the Senate of the government's approach to taxation compliance to provide revenue for essential services in health and higher education? Equally importantly, is the minister aware of any alternative policy approaches?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Compliance</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-08-19,"—I thank Senator Santoro for that very incisive question. The Australian Taxation Office recently released its compliance program for 2003-04. The program outlines the risks to Australia's revenue and the steps the tax office is taking to address them. While the vast majority of Australian people do do the right thing, there are some specific areas identified for increased compliance focus.
The tax office will increase its use of data matching to identify those who try to operate outside the tax system. Last year, the tax office collected an additional $3 billion for the community as a result of audit work, and 67 people went to jail for avoiding their tax obligations. Over the three years to 30 June 2003 the tax office estimates that an extra $2.6 billion in revenue has been collected as a result of tax reform's impact on the cash economy. The tax office's compliance program is part of an effort to ensure a fair, efficient and effective tax administration system for all Australians, because this government believes that protecting Australia's revenue base, low taxation and getting the economic fundamentals right underpin growth and wealth that can provide vital services such as health and education.
And what is Labor's plan for health and education? Labor wants to increase taxes. It wants to increase the Medicare levy. The evidence that the Labor Party will rip into the taxpayer to meet additional spending is overwhelming. The ACTU's Mr Greg Combet last night on Lateline claimed that Australians want higher taxes. Tony Jones said:
I raise it because this is in your facts sheet about tax and I'm just trying to get to the point here of what you mean by saying Australia is a low taxing country relative to other OECD countries. It seems to be suggesting we could have higher taxes here.
Mr Combet said:
Well, we're stating the facts.
What we have here are too many contradictions. Labor argues that taxes are too high but the ACTU, which happens to control 50 per cent of the votes at ALP conferences, states in its tax fact sheet that OECD data indicates that Australia is a low-taxed country. Labor wants to spend more but still claims it will have a budget surplus at the end of the day. Both of these propositions cannot be right.
Senator Conroy was the first in a long line of Labor spokesmen who spilt the beans on Labor's plans to slug the taxpayer when he fessed up to a group of schoolkids a couple of years ago. After Mr Latham had been shadow Treasurer for about eight hours he could not control himself—he hopped into negative gearing and he wants to wind back capital gains tax. Mr Combet, again on Lateline, has also raised the question of company tax. Mr Jones said:
You clearly would like to have higher company tax. What is the ACTU proposing exactly?
Mr Combet said:
We'll be looking at that over the course of the next few days.
So, while the Howard government has cut taxes by $10.7 billion over four years, all six of Labor's states and two Labor territories have increased taxes. When it comes to the Labor Party in control of the financial levers, it is not only taxi drivers who will be under attack; it will be each and every Australian taxpayer.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Compliance</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2003-08-19,"—I have further information in relation to questions asked of me at question time. Senator Faulkner asked me a question about a table that went to my office and whether the table had been changed. I indicated to him in question time that my advice was that headings and things like that had been changed to make it more comprehensible. That has been confirmed. I have spoken directly to the officer who handled the question and she confirmed that she did not touch the table at all. She also confirmed her recollection that the table did deal with $60,000 and over—in other words, it did not stop at $60,000, it just bunched all the incomes above $60,000 into one group.
The second part of the question that Senator Faulkner asked me related to the process by which the committee was told that the information should be withdrawn. I am advised that sometime on Thursday afternoon my office was rung by the department and alerted to a problem that material had been passed directly to the committee, that is, it did not go through my office, and that they thought that the information looked incorrect—and when you see the table you can see why you would think that something could not be right there. They were not certain of it and needed to verify it. My office— I think, properly—told them that they should immediately contact the committee, say that they lacked confidence in the data and that they were not sure that it was correct and therefore that the document should be withdrawn until we could verify it.
I do recall on one other occasion being criticised here for taking some time to get back to a committee because I took the view that I had to get the right information before I went back to the committee. I was criticised for not having immediately gone to the committee to tell them that what they had was incorrect. It seems that you cannot win one way and you cannot win the other. But on balance I think that on the previous occasion it would have been better to have gone straight to the committee and said, `This is wrong and you will have to wait until I get the answer.'

That the Senate take note of the explanation.
It is more than three months—it is almost four months—since I asked the questions on 5 May. I would argue that there are a lot of people who really need answers to those questions. They are timely and urgent. As the minister will recall, all Pan Pharmaceuticals products were recalled with a class 1 classification. That means that they were deemed to be potentially life threatening. The TGA has said that the majority of the recalled items did not fall into class 1 classification— in other words, they were not life threatening. In fact it is probably disputable whether Travacalm, the one product which was said to have triggered the recall, was even that. However, the vast majority of those recalled items fell under what is known as `medicine potencies outside standard limits' and a routine recall would have been necessary. But there is not even any evidence that the majority of those items were outside standard limits. No testing was done to indicate that.
My question was: what prompted the government to set up an expert committee to review complementary health care? This would appear to have been a failure in quality control in manufacture, not a failure of the complementary health care system or complementary health products. This government chose this opportunity to set up a council which would look into those products that many would say did not need looking into.
A member of that committee, Professor Alastair MacLennon, is reported to have said that the government should not support the complementary health care industry. Why then was Professor MacLennon not ruled out as a biased member? Instead, the government put him on this committee. These are serious questions, and the minister has had them since May and has not bothered to answer. I asked who on the committee has expertise in regulatory controls to meet appropriate standards of quality, safety and efficacy, and I asked for details to be provided. Again, there was no indication of that. I asked who on the expert committee has expertise in the interaction between complementary and prescribed medicines and the communication of this information to health care practitioners, and I asked for details to be provided. They are pretty obvious questions and they point to a lack of proper process in this whole recall matter.
It was said that 15 August was the date that this committee was to report to the government. My question does not include whether that report has been received and what the minister proposes to do with it. Presumably she has had it for some days, but I would like to ask the minister to include that question here as well: what has this committee discovered and when are we all going to hear about it? I asked whether the committee called for public submissions but I understand this did not happen. Again, three months ago it was a reasonable question; now it is probably passe. But how will this committee collect its evidence? I ask: why was this a level 1 recall? Clearly it was not and should not have been. Why is it that other options were not taken up? Why was it that Pan Pharmaceuticals' products other than Travacalm were recalled at all? There may have been poor practices at the manufacturing base but this is no reason to recall all of those products and, I must say, to thrust so many small businesses into a dire situation. Many of them found that people came back to return the products and they had to hand over money for refunds, but there was no question of compensation for them. The whole thing really is a serious mess.
Why didn't the TGA examine some of these products before doing that recall? As I said, they were not a classification 1 recall, not posing a danger to anybody and, by recalling them, they simply inconvenienced consumers and small business people. I think it would have been more sensible for the TGA to have informed the Complementary Healthcare Council so that the industry could work together with the TGA to test all those products in question. It is my understanding that Wal-Mart in America was selling and still is selling Pan's recalled products, and that they tested them and found them to be of good quality. I looked up the Internet and there was certainly a warning in the UK that this has happened in Australia but, to my knowledge, no other country has seen fit to recall every product that had a Pan Pharmaceuticals component to it. So I asked whether the government could confirm that in Europe Pan's products were still being sold, likewise in New Zealand. I think this is information that we in this place are entitled to know, as are those people who use these products and the small businesses that use them too.
According to the Complementary Healthcare Council, sales of medicines are down 20 to 40 per cent and export sales are down $200 million. My question still is: does the government intend to compensate small retail businesses for that economic loss and the general decline in consumer confidence? What response has the government made to the request from the Complementary Healthcare Council for funds to invest in marketing for the industry and for positive statements to be made by the government about complementary medicines? We are not talking about a small sector; it is well known that vast numbers of people use these products and by all accounts they use them safely. It is a bit like the ethanol debate: once you start to suggest that there is a serious problem then people wonder about whether they ought to be taking these products—wonder unreasonably, I would suggest.
We wanted to know what progress there had been to the government's request to major distributors that claims by small business for refunds to consumers for recalled products be expedited. We would like to know whether the government is monitoring the financial impact of this recall on small business. If it is not doing that, why is it not doing that and what does it propose to do? I would say to the minister and to all ministers in this place that the Senate is getting a little fed up with the way questions put on notice are treated with disdain. I know there are a lot of questions in this set of questions but it is the case that this is a topical issue. It affects thousands of people. I know that all senators in this place will be receiving messages in the hundreds from people in the complementary health care system. If they are not then they are not looking at their emails. If you think that there is no interest in this question then that would be a mistake. What we do want is to have answers to questions provided in good time. I certainly do not think that almost four months is in good time, and I urge the government to get the answers to these questions to the Senate as quickly as possible.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Question No. 1602 </title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-08-19,"—Let me set the record straight. I got up and apologised.

My office have contacted me and said that she did ask a question about allied health on 5 May which has been answered. The question she is referring to was asked on 7 July.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-08-19,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked today.
Just one week after the debacle of the carer allowance reviews, today we have again seen why the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone, is not a suitable person to have charge of this most delicate portfolio. On the one hand, we have a minister who is happy to justify stripping the carer allowance from 30,000 families with disabled kids and, on the other hand, evidence has emerged that indicates hundreds, if not thousands, of high-wealth families have accessed family tax benefit payments. The double standard is quite stark and obvious for all to see. Right under the minister's nose families earning hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of dollars per year have pocketed payments which are worth up to $4,300 per child; yet low-income and middle-income families caring for kids with severe asthma, ADD, diabetes or cerebral palsy are being stripped of a modest $87 per fortnight benefit. Moreover, these are not completely new issues.
The income test for FTB is an original fault, of which the minister has had full and adequate knowledge for a long time—yet she has done nothing. Today she professes innocence and is suddenly talking to her department and trying to receive some advice about the problem. Now that the figures are out there, the minister is running for cover and blaming everyone but herself. The minister has failed to adequately address the loopholes that Labor has been identifying. Firstly, when a claim for family tax benefit is lodged, no verification is made of current family income. Payments are made on the basis of customer estimates alone. Secondly, margin lending losses from playing the share market may be used by families to artificially reduce assessable income. Thirdly, and finally, the government relies on the self-reporting of foreign income with no verification measures in place.
I will take the points one by one. The first is verification of income. The fact is that high-wealth individuals may access family tax benefit A payments because, at the time of claim, no verification of family income occurs and payments commence on the basis of a customer estimate alone. Indeed, the current family tax benefit rules mean that families may obtain these payments for up to two years before they must provide details of their actual income. While they may have to eventually repay the benefit, it does allow high-wealth individuals and families to pocket payments for up to two years interest free. It is this same flawed estimation system that punishes honest families. Even if they advise Centrelink of changes in their income, they may still have their tax returns stripped to recoup the money.
The second point is margin lending losses. Unlike the negative gearing of property, families who negatively gear shares may reduce their assessable income for family tax benefit. This is an illogical and clear loophole. It is also a practice that has exploded in recent years. The net value of margin lending loans has exploded from $2 billion in 1996 to more than $10.5 billion today. There are 130,000 individuals who have margin loans in Australia and, even if just one uses the mechanism to claim more of the family tax benefit than they would otherwise have received, it is one too many. This loophole should be closed forthwith.
The final point is foreign income. The other loophole pointed out by Labor is that, while foreign income impacts on family tax benefit payments, no verification is made by Centrelink. Essentially it is an honour system. Foreign income is, of course, a major problem for taxation as well. Currently only foreign cash transactions of more than $5,000 are tracked by financial institutions and AUSTRAC, and only a small proportion of these may be investigated by the ATO. As a bare minimum, Centrelink ought to seek bank statements and obtain data from financial institutions to obtain concrete information on those who derive a foreign income.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2003-08-19,"—One salient piece of information should be put into this debate to take note of answers by the Minister for Family and Community Services in question time. That fact is that there are around two million Australian families—with something like 3½ million children—who are, at the present time, benefiting from the introduction of the family tax benefit by this government. That is a huge number of people who depend upon the capacity of the government to deliver benefits to them through this mechanism, and I think it ill behoves us to begrudge them receiving that kind of benefit. The vast majority of Australian families with dependent children benefit from the government's family tax benefit. Expenditure on family assistance under this program has increased by about $2 billion, and I will come back to why that is in a moment.
With so many people benefiting from these arrangements and so much money involved in this program, it is inconceivable that, from time to time, anomalies in that arrangement will not arise. Anomalies were identified during the process of the estimates committee hearings earlier this year. They were identified and acknowledged not just by members of the estimates committee who might have been sitting opposite but also by the minister herself. Much has been made of the so-called discovery that some very wealthy people—15 millionaires, supposedly—are receiving the family tax benefit. That information was discovered by virtue of a table being produced at the Senate estimates committee. On production of that table, some doubts were raised about its accuracy. At the upper end of the income spectrum, the numbers supposedly receiving benefits were quite small. But still it did appear to show that 15 people on incomes greater than $1 million were receiving the family tax benefit.
To her credit, Minister Vanstone took that information and ordered an investigation into how that could be. Minister Vanstone has not come to this place and argued, as those opposite would like to pretend, that it is fine for millionaires to receive the family tax benefit. On the contrary, she has made it clear she does not believe that is an appropriate outcome, and she has said instead that there should be an analysis of how the system throws up such results, if indeed there are millionaires receiving the family tax benefit. Careful analysis of each of the cases in that particular matter has had to be undertaken, and that analysis is not yet complete. Of course, there are privacy issues in that as well.
In any system this large, there could well be perfectly innocent explanations as to why this kind of result might be thrown up. There could be the incorrect transfer of data from one set of figures to another. There could be some cases where benefits have been saved from earlier recipients and preserved in some way that goes against the current guidelines. It could also be that some people are claiming those benefits who are not entitled to them, and perhaps in some way the system has not properly identified them. Whatever the explanation, it behoves us all to let that analysis which Minister Vanstone has initiated be completed and then we can come back and decide whether or not—
—Will you guarantee you will bring the review back?
—It is not up to me to do that, Senator. It behoves us all to look at that analysis and decide whether or not the system needs to be fundamentally changed. I remind senators that there are two million Australian families receiving benefits under this scheme. If you think you can administer a scheme that large without anomalies on occasion being thrown up, good luck to you. I think it is as credible as any other promise the Labor Party is making at the present time, if that is what you say. This government deserves credit for seeing a problem in the way in which the system is being delivered and moving quickly to identify solutions to that problem.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2003-08-19,"—What we have seen in question time today is an attack on the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone, and the government—an attack on the government's and the minister's administration of this important big budget item and sensitive portfolio of social welfare. It is an attempt of course—not unusual for an opposition, particularly this one—to paint the government and the minister as uncaring, and thereby gain political advantage. It is an opportunist attack on the minister who properly defended her position all week—and last week. It is an old tactic.
I can tell the opposition this: as we enter an election year—if it has not dawned on you—this government is happy to stand on its record with regard to social welfare. In fact it has been one of our finest and proudest reforms. We have had two ministers carry that welfare: the first minister, who is not in the chamber any more, Jocelyn Newman, and now this minister, Senator Vanstone. It requires a pretty cool head, a pretty tough exterior and a soft interior. Knowing Amanda Vanstone, I can tell you that she has all those qualities to deliver the government's reform. Since 1996 it has been one of the finest reforms that this government has introduced. It has not been easy. We have had to balance targeting the needy against the users of the system. The public demanded such change, almost from day one when we came into government. Excuse me, Mr Deputy President, you can tell I have a cold.
—Would you like a glass of water, Senator?
—No, that is all right, Mr Deputy President. Thank you for your care; it is more than is being shown from those opposite. My point is that almost from the time we came into government, from day one, the public demanded—
—What about an Irish whiskey?
—Senator Ian Campbell, stop interjecting on your own speaker. 
—Senator Campbell was kindly offering me a shot of whiskey, which I might have.
—That would be quite out of order in this chamber. I offered you water. You may proceed.
—My point is that the public pressure for change in the social welfare system was brought on the government almost from day one. The government was seeking a new transparency in the system, and a new accountability in the system. Our first step was to introduce and enhance the mutual obligation policy. What epitomises that program is the most successful and publicly accepted—and those on welfare accepted it—Work for the Dole system. Secondly, the government introduced a tougher and more accountable audit system of existing payments so that those that deserved payment got payment—and, I should add, increased payment—and those that were using the system were found out. This must sound terrible.
—It does, I can assure you, Senator McGauran.
—I will battle on, nevertheless. Those cheats were found out. To this end it went straight to the budget bottom line, which was turned back into the welfare system itself, a saving to the tune of $1.4 billion a year. That is an enormous saving that can be turned back in, as I said, to the welfare system.
The opposition raised the matter of family tax benefits today as part of their attack on the government. As my colleague said, there are over two million Australian families benefiting from this system and where loopholes have occurred this minister has acted. In her press release about the family tax benefits she said that some millionaires might be receiving payment and that concerns her, and she has sought an inquiry into the matter. To bring your concerns into the chamber before presenting them to the minister privately, as every electorate officer does when it comes to social welfare payments and always gets the proper response—

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2003-08-19,"—I take up the comments from poor Senator McGauran who can now have his glass of water and his lozenge. We have a serious issue here in the minister's response to the questions both last week about the carer allowance and today about the whole issue of the number of people who have extraordinary levels of income and who are receiving the family tax benefit. There are some issues that still need to be raised in the debate.
This afternoon in answer to a question from Senator Faulkner the minister talked about the fact that she had checked with her chief of staff and her staff had actually made changes to the answer. She said that she does not interfere. She said that she likes to let the public servants do their job. Unfortunately, the outcome of that decision is that we have a minister who does not know what is going on in her department. Given the sensitivity of the department and the issues that are raised in this debate, that is a real area of concern for us. 
The minister's responses to the questions and the excuses she offered us today in her answer are of concern to us all as well. First of all, yesterday she suggested that Labor was somehow responsible for these wealthy families keeping their benefits. She knows that is simply not true. While it is true that some families were receiving child disability allowances in 1993 and they retained the family payment when the benefits were overhauled, the coalition decided to preserve their benefit again in 1998 when the carer allowance was introduced.
So the last review, which occurred in 1998, and which gave five years grace for the reviews, was a decision of the coalition. The minister also claimed that Labor's opposition to the current carer allowance review was somehow preventing wealthy families from being removed from receiving the benefits. That is a pretty desperate kind of claim because we all know, and the minister certainly ought to know, that the carer allowance is not means tested. Perhaps the minister is considering introducing an income test for the carer allowance. If she is, she certainly should say so. But there are many, many unfortunate families currently being thrown off the benefit and losing it because of the tighter medical assessment, not their income. 
I will give an example of the hardship caused as a result of the stinginess of this whole approach. Let me tell the Senate about a delightful young woman that I know. Alice is 13 and has Down syndrome. Her father is 52 and he earns about $26,000 a year. Her mum is a stay-at-home mum, not by choice but by necessity. Alice's mother has not been able to contribute to the family's income. Alice's parents have spent a fortune on sensory equipment to help Alice's development. They receive just $78.80 a fortnight in carer allowance and the maximum family tax benefits allowable. 
Last year Alice's father was directed to do overtime owing to a new contract given to the construction company he works for. As a result of that overtime Alice's family received a debt advice from Centrelink for overpayment of family tax benefit parts A and B, irrespective of the fact that they reported changes to their income throughout the year. This system is a system where one in three families—that is about 600,000 to 700,000 families every year—accumulate an average debt of around $850 through no fault of their own. The Ombudsman says this system is flawed. He has pointed out that families cannot avoid these debts and that we have to do something to change the system.
In terms of Alice's family, to add insult to injury, Centrelink sent them a carer allowance review form after the minister decided that some children with disabilities do get better and conditions become more manageable. Of course, we know that Down syndrome does not go away. In cases like Alice's, sometimes children are able to achieve incredible results and show improvements, but improvements for a Down syndrome child or young adult do not mean the same as they do for an able-bodied child. Improvements might include actually being able to get a bus independently. Improvement could mean maybe being able to cook toast or pour cereal for themselves for breakfast. But what it does not mean is that those daily chores can be done unsupervised. (Time expired)

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2003-08-19,"—Last week we had the debacle of the carer allowance reviews, and here today we have been given a further insight into why the Minister for Family and Community Services is not suitable to have responsibility for this very critical portfolio. I guess really we should be asking ourselves, `Why did the Prime Minister appoint this minister to this particular portfolio?' because it was about eight years ago that the Prime Minister, John Howard, told us about his fairer Australia. We have seen nothing fair from this minister. And then we heard about his commitment to look after Australia's battlers. The last two weeks has shown us that the understanding of what an Australian battler is is not known either to the Prime Minister or to Minister Vanstone.
The double standards of the government have been exposed by what we have seen in the past couple of weeks. At the same time as families earning hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars have been pocketing up to $4,300 per child, we have at the other end of the scale the low- and the middle-income families caring for children with severe asthma, diabetes, attention deficit disorder and cerebral palsy being stripped of a modest $87 per fortnight in benefits. Clearly the minister has lost control of the day-to-day running of her portfolio. I think it is open to question as to whether she has any feeling for those in the community who are less well off and less able to cope with the difficulties thrown up by life from time to time. Even worse, the minister is blaming everyone but herself for the mess that we are confronted with. It seems to be a part of the government's philosophy that ministers blame someone else if they make a mess. The minister has clearly failed to adequately address the loopholes, and it has been left to the Labor Party to raise them.
When a claim for family tax benefit is lodged, there is no verification of current family income payments made at all—it is the applicant's estimate alone that is taken into account. This leaves those big salary earners at liberty to show their absolute greed, and they feel no embarrassment about it whatsoever. We could say, `We should deal with those people,' and no doubt the minister will deal with those people now that it has been exposed. But it has shown us another side of some of those—you cannot mark all of them down—who are wealthy within the community. Many of those who are wealthy in our community are out there to get anything they can and to lean on everyone barring their own capacity to earn. Yet those who are least able to provide—those who are less well off and those with children who need acute care—would not think to, and do not have the capacity to, look for rorts of the system or to look for loopholes that have been left open.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-19,"—Pursuant to standing order 67, I ask that the question for the postponement of business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 for today, Tuesday, 19 August 2003, be put to the Senate for determination without amendment or debate. I seek leave to give a brief explanation.
Leave granted.
—I do this on the basis that we had a similar occurrence in the chamber yesterday where the Australian Greens were seeking to postpone this same notification. At the time, Senator Faulkner rose and convinced the Australian Greens to withdraw that postponement notification to allow this issue to come on for debate. I ask the Greens to do the same today: to withdraw the postponement notification to allow this issue to be debated in the chamber today. I do so on the basis that this issue is a very important one to the people of the ACT and also that it has come to my attention that, in the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act, it seems to be quite an anomaly that there is no time limit for which this disallowance motion can actually stay on the Notice Paper. What appears to be a developing tactic on behalf of the Australian Greens is to notify postponement in perpetuity.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Postponement</title>,Notices,9,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—by leave—It may help Senator Lundy and the chamber to point out that this disallowance motion is coming up for debate very shortly, and I intend to move the motion.
—You have notified the postponement of it today. That is what the Clerk read out. The Clerk postponed it on your advice.
—We should be able to reach agreement. There has obviously been an error.
—Senator Brown, are you seeking to withdraw that postponement notification on the basis that it will be dealt with in the proceedings this afternoon?
—Yes, my apologies to the Clerk, through you, Deputy President. That notification was given yesterday and obviously I have failed to withdraw it, but I now do so.
—No, there was another one given today, Senator Brown. It came in today, according to the Clerk. So you are now seeking leave to withdraw that postponement notification?
—That is correct.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—I move:
That Amendment 41 of the National Capital Plan (Gungahlin Drive Extension), made under the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988, be disallowed.
I would like to explain to Senator Lundy that I would have preferred to have delayed this motion but it is the Labor Party's support for the government position to have it brought on and dispensed with today that leaves me no option but to bring the motion forward. That then brings us to the debate on the substantial matter, except for one thing: the major reason for delaying this vote of the Senate would have been to allow the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, which is inquiring into this matter, to have deliberated. It has not done so, and I always believe that a debate is better when you have the information which gives the best determination. I think this should have been delayed longer so that we could get the evidence from all the citizens involved, all the authorities involved and the government instrumentalities involved— both at territory and national level—before this determination to proceed with the eastern alternative goes ahead.
I am not going to canvas in detail the arguments for the alternatives, except to say that there is a very strong local community group, headed up by the Save the Ridge residents, who are opposed to the decision that has been made because they believe—and they have a very cogent argument—that this alternative is going to have by far the most detrimental impact on the environment. That does not mean just the local environment; it means the natural heritage of this important part of the ACT's constitutional make-up. They believe that there are better alternatives. One can argue very well—as a number of residents and organisations in the ACT do—that there is not a need for this debate to be taking place. They argue that there are better alternatives, including the one thing the ACT lacks greatly and needs very importantly: a better public transport system. Canberra, by design, is a beautiful, pleasant place to live in but it is the most spread out capital city in the nation. It has a bus service but it does not have a rail service. Residents have been pushing for a light rail service and for alternatives which would lessen the impact of road transport on the wonderful amenity that Canberra has. This Gungahlin expressway is simply going to increase the impact. It is going to be a further incentive for the motor car and motor truck to dominate Canberra at a time when—and we were debating this earlier—we should be sensibly going to clean, quick, efficient public transport.
You cannot divorce the two. The more you press for expressways and the more you put up to $100 million into this particular roadwork, the less money there is available for public transport. It has become too much embedded in the mind of both Labor and Liberal governments that public transport is an add-on. It is not; it is a real alternative. Until the mindset changes so that you understand that the future of world society depends on efficient, clean public transport— particularly public transport not based on fossil fuels—then we are adding to the problem every time we link one part of a city with another part by a new expressway, as is happening in almost all capital and major cities in Australia.
That said, the argument against the route that has been chosen by the National Capital Authority is a very strong one. The Save the Ridge group have made their submission to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories inquiry into the National Capital Authority. They have a list of reasons for their concerns, particularly their concern with the planning route that has been decided by the NCA for the Gungahlin Drive extension. Their concerns come under the headings:
1. Lack of accountability and transparency of NCA.
	...	...	...
2. Conflict of Interest.
	...	...	...
3. Lack of rigor by consultants and subsequent erroneous (bordering on fraudulent) claims by NCA re conclusions reached on environmental impacts.
That particular section goes on to talk about the impact of this road on the really important natural values of the ridge, which is open forest dominated by scribbly gum and red stringy-bark. It has got important plant and animal communities, it is in the city and it is going to be very badly affected by this expressway. The submission goes on to list further concerns under the headings:
4. The terms of reference set by the NCA were skewed.
	...	...	...
5. The NCA ignored its legislative obligation to maintain the integrity of the inner hills and ridges.
	...	...	...
6. The NCA report is based on concerns which do not exist, and if they did exist they are outside the charter of the NCA.
	...	...	...
7. Bias in NCA assessment due to favourable re-design of the Eastern route.
The eastern route endorsed by the NCA was designed by Young Engineers during the NCA study.
The submission goes on:
8. Lack of rigor by NCA in accepting without criticism the poor quality and limited scope of work undertaken by the engaged consultants. 
	...	...	...
9. Further lack of rigor by NCA in accepting without criticism the poor quality and limited scope of work undertaken by the expert peer reviewer.
	...	...	...
10. Bias in conclusions
	...	...	...
11. Lack of consistency by the NCA in relation to its views and involvement with GDE.
	...	...	...
12. Enormous financial burden of NCA actions on the ACT Community.
The final paragraph states:
If NCA has the ultimate mandate for making decisions such as this on freeways such as GDE (as claimed by Federal Minister Wilson Tuckey), why does it fall to the ACT Government to do all the planning and design work and pay the enormous costs associated with this road (an anticipated final cost close to $100 million)?
Finally, in saying why we have to be very careful in simply stamping a vote on to a discussion which is not yet complete within the community, I will quote comments from Dr Geoffrey Wasteneys, who is the coordinator of the O'Connor Ridge Parkcare Group. Part of his letter, which has gone to the opposition, says this:
As an ANU scientist I am also the chief investigator on a $1.2 million ARC funded linkage project that uses the natural resources on Black Mountain reserve and Bruce ridges. We are exploiting the unique properties of some orchid species in this area in a project on embryo development. This project, potentially worth billions of dollars to agriculture, has attracted interest from a consortium of three multinational seed companies. The GDE—
that is, this expressway, the Gungahlin Drive extension—
threatens our research project and undoubtedly many others. I have recently been offered a Canada research chair and am now considering moving my team and our research project to the University of British Columbia. It is now my opinion that the NCA and the ACT government provide no support or incentive for research projects in the ACT. The Gungahlin Drive extension is a fine example of short-sighted planning that will not only destroy a unique asset but with it destroy opportunities for research that could be of huge benefit to the prestige and economy of the ACT and Australia. I urge you to consider this request very seriously.
That request should be met in the way the doctor asks. I brought forward this disallowance motion because there is strong feeling in the community about it. The Senate is the backstop here. We do have responsibility in this fashion for what is happening in the ACT. There are community groups and large numbers of residents and academics who are opposed to the ACT's decision in this matter, and it is quite proper that that opposition should find expression in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CAPITAL PLAN (GUNGAHLIN DRIVE EXTENSION)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-19,"—It is also with some regret that I find myself in this position in the Senate. Had due process been followed and the policy of the ACT, now Labor, government on their preferred route, the western route, been adopted and accepted then we would not in fact be here. If that had happened, we would not have to be debating this disallowance motion of the amendment that would allow the eastern route to be constructed. There is some important history of this debate that I think needs at least a little airing this afternoon. First and foremost is that the eastern route is not the ACT government's preferred option. In fact, the western route was, which in large part would have satisfied the concerns of the Save the Ridge group and other citizens concerned about the eastern route. Obviously it would have provided the solution to a growing traffic problem in the new area of Gungahlin.
However, the Labor government in the ACT, in their wisdom, have determined that a road to solve the Gungahlin problem is their first and foremost policy. For Labor it is not a question of the western route or no road. This is where the concerns of Save the Ridge diverge from the ACT government. The Labor government was put in a position where it had no choice if it were to build a road. It was forced to accept the route determined, effectively, by the National Capital Authority. I can say that because the chain of events that emerged following the election of the ACT government very clearly demonstrated how the National Capital Authority asserted its powers under the ACT (Planning and Land Management) Act to directly influence what could or could not be done. Without going into the detail now, because I do not think it is necessary to the germane issues we are debating here today, the NCA concluded that in their view only the eastern route was allowable.
In my view, this was a very politically fraught debate. I certainly have alleged on more than one occasion that I felt the National Capital Authority's actions were highly political with the involvement of Minister Tuckey. I think that is highly regrettable. It actually does not change anything because, whatever the circumstances, if the ACT government were going to build a road to serve the needs of Gungahlin residents they would have to build it on the eastern route. They made that decision in those circumstances in December 2002.
Under the provisions of the act, that amendment to the National Capital Plan is subject to a disallowance and it is that disallowance moved by the Greens in March this year that we are debating. One of the interesting things about this debate and why we are now debating the disallowance in these circumstances is that, unlike any other act that I could find or have been made aware of, that particular act governing the National Capital Plan does not have a time limit on the number of days that a disallowance can stay on the Notice Paper. Usually legislation requires and specifies 15 days, and this debate would have been brought on in that manner. But for some reason this act does not have that provision, hence the concern I expressed when I rose earlier to prevent further postponement of this debate that we are in fact in a situation whereby it could be postponed in perpetuity, never allowing the Senate to actually debate the disallowance, regardless of the various views. That is of concern and certainly why Labor feels very strongly that this issue has to be decided. For the record, it has actually been on the Notice Paper for some 28 sitting days, but that amounts to some four months of deliberation. 
This disallowance motion does not prevent works beginning on the road. With respect to the deliberation, once gazettal has occurred work can actually start, but it is not particularly desirable. I for one would certainly argue that, if a disallowance is on the Notice Paper, it is reasonable that that be respected, particularly if it is known that the prospects are that it is going to be successful. However, that is not the case in this regard and now we find ourselves needing to bring on the debate, and I acknowledge the Greens withdrew what seemed to be some confusion about a further postponement to allow this matter to be debated.
I now turn to some comments made by Senator Brown about the role of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. That committee is currently inquiring into the role of the National Capital Authority, but those terms of reference do not specifically go to whether or not the Gungahlin Drive extension should proceed on either the western or the eastern route. That inquiry is able to reflect upon those issues and is continuing to do so. But the terms of reference do not play a formal role one way or the other in determining matters relating to this disallowance. 
I guess my view in following this area is that, ultimately, the ACT government is the appropriate body to determine the location of the route. In the lead-up to the ACT government election, the western or eastern route was the big issue. I said at the time that the ACT election should effectively serve as a referendum on the western or eastern route of the Gungahlin Drive extension, and I believe it did. The upshot was that Labor was not allowed to proceed with its policy of the preferred western route. It was prevented from doing so because of the views held by the National Capital Authority and, I believe, the federal Liberal Party. As a result, Labor put the need for the road—and the only option left to it by the National Capital Authority, that of the eastern route—at the forefront, making it policy to allow that road to proceed. I do not believe that it had any choice in doing that. It was a situation whereby Labor was forced to concede to the powers of the federal act governing the ACT land and planning issues as a result of our status as the nation's capital.
It is my hope that in the future, when we have had time to reflect on this and other circumstances, we can find a way to better establish the roles of the different territory and national capital planning authorities and how they can work together to achieve the best outcomes for the ACT. I do regret that the ACT government has been reflected upon by Save the Ridge and others as somehow not representing their interests, because there is not a government that has fought harder for its own policy than the current ACT Labor government. I will also say that I respect and think it appropriate that the ACT Labor government believes that a road is necessary over the proposition put by the Australian Greens that no road is the best option.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CAPITAL PLAN (GUNGAHLIN DRIVE EXTENSION)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2003-08-19,"—I also rise to oppose the disallowance motion which Senator Brown originally moved in this place, as pointed out by Senator Lundy, in March of this year and then over a series of postponements dealt with today. The motion to disallow amendment 41 to the National Capital Plan would have the effect, if it were to be passed, of preventing the route of the Gungahlin Drive extension being determined to the east of the Australian Institute of Sport, although it is obvious from what Senator Brown has had to say that his intention is that the road be prevented from being built at all. He would prefer that there was not a road on any alignment down, or close to, the O'Connor ridge—and I will comment on that aspect of his position in a moment.
The route for this road has been a matter of debate in the territory for a very long time. The idea of a road travelling between Belconnen and north Canberra was first foreshadowed in planning documents issued by the NCDC in the mid-1960s. The proposal firmed up in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the road was described as the John Dedman Parkway. More recently its name has been changed to the Gungahlin Drive extension, acknowledging that there is a road called Gungahlin Drive travelling through part of Gungahlin and the new road will be an extension of that.
The first question I would like to pose in this debate today is very simple: why are we debating this matter? Why should we be debating this matter? The National Capital Authority is responsible by statute for determining the location of national and arterial roads in the ACT. That is clear from its legislation. It does not build the roads, generally speaking, but it does determine their location. The Gungahlin Drive extension is not a national road; it is, however, an arterial road. It is designed to service the needs of Gungahlin residents, most particularly, undertaking domestic journeys between Gungahlin and areas in the south of the ACT like south Canberra, Woden, Weston Creek, Tuggeranong and perhaps, as a very long diversion, the city centre of Canberra.
What is the national interest in determining the route of an arterial road within the ACT? It is true that the Commonwealth has had its interest sparked by the proximity of the road to the Australian Institute of Sport and has quite appropriately felt the desire to protect the integrity and the interests of the Australian Institute of Sport in the deliberations about the route for the road. But in a sense that is a coincidence. This debate would still be proceeding even if the AIS were not located in that corridor, because the NCA retains a responsibility to decide what the route should be, given that it is an arterial road. With great respect, it seems to me that, as the ACT is self-governing, the location of arterial roads within the territory servicing the domestic needs of ACT residents ought to be determined by ACT residents themselves through their elected parliament and not by the national parliament.
That is a personal view and a digression. I return to the matter which is before the house. As has been indicated by Senator Brown and Senator Lundy, there are two essential issues in this debate. The first is whether the road is needed at all—that is, whether we need to reserve a route for an extension of Gungahlin Drive into the central part of the city. The second, if we do need to reserve a route, is whether the route should travel to the east or to the west of the Australian Institute of Sport. Let me address the first question: whether a road is needed. I think that the case for this road along this corridor is simply irresistible. It is extremely difficult to argue on the basis of any comparable city plan anywhere else in Australia that a road of this kind could be dispensed with.
As I have said, this road is designed to serve the needs of the residents of Gungahlin. At present Gungahlin has between 30,000 and 40,000 residents but it is planned to ultimately have 110,000 residents. When it is complete, if it has been completed in accordance with the present territory plan, it will be the largest of the territory's townships—larger than Belconnen is at present, with something like 90,000 residents. Yet it is the only township that has been planned until now without a choice of arterial escape routes to allow egress by residents. With the current level of vehicle use in the ACT—or, indeed, anywhere else in Australia—it is simply inconceivable that a road would not be necessary to service such a large number of people. For example, the planning for Belconnen—with, as I mentioned, 90,000 people—includes four arterial exits. In Tuggeranong, which is a bit smaller—with about 80,000 residents—there are, again, four major arterial exits.
At present in Gungahlin there is only one—Northbourne Avenue, the main entrance into Canberra city and the road used by people coming by car from Sydney or Melbourne. It is very significant route which is at present seriously congested for periods during the morning and the afternoon. That generates a very large amount of so-called rat running whereby residents are forced to use suburban streets in Belconnen and particularly in north Canberra to avoid those congested roads in finding their way into more southern parts of the territory. Even with the creation of the Gungahlin Drive extension and a further arterial road to the east of Mount Ainslie, the so-called Majura Drive through the Majura Valley, Gungahlin residents will have less accessibility than residents in Tuggeranong and Belconnen. There will be fewer lanes available to them to drive anywhere out of Gungahlin. That is unfortunate.
Senator Brown said that one of the reasons why roads need to be provided at a high level in the ACT is that Canberra lacks a good public transport system. Senator Brown said that Canberra needs a better public transport system. With great respect, I think that is nonsense. The ACT has an excellent public transport system. I challenge Senator Brown to travel on one of the ACTION buses and see what a good public transport system it is. It is clean, it is efficient, the timetables are very well kept to and the routes are in good locations. Frankly, I think it would be very hard to compare ACTION with any other public transport system in any part of the country and not find this city's public transport option excellent.
The problem with the public transport system is that it is not well used. People do not take advantage of the public transport system. In part, that may be because the option to use cars has historically been available in the ACT, and most residents in the ACT do in fact choose to use cars. But the argument that we can avoid the need for the Gungahlin Drive extension by merely closing off access routes to and from Gungahlin, forcing people to use public transport because there are no other options available, is a very poor way of producing the outcome that Senator Brown would argue for—that is, presumably, that we have a much higher take-up of public transport and do not need roads like the Gungahlin Drive extension.
Indeed, some comment was made on this when the earlier work that was done in the ACT addressed the question of the alternatives of public transport. The ACT government previously commissioned the preliminary assessment evaluation for the John Dedman Parkway proposal, as it was then called, in 1997. That followed the earlier preliminary assessment under the territory's planning legislation by Maunsell Pty Ltd. They commented in that evaluation on a document produced by the Conservation Council of the South-East Region and Canberra entitled Canberra at the crossroads: a way out of the transport mess. I quote from the evaluation: 
The report suggests that if much higher levels of public transport patronage are achieved then the John Dedman alignment will not be needed. It suggests targets of 30% of work trips, 65% of city centre work trips and 50% of trips to ANU.
The PA assessed traffic demand at three levels of public transport patronage, the current 10%, 20% (twice current levels) and 30% (three times current levels). The 30% overall patronage level equates to over 50% transit share for civic work trips (close to the suggested target of 65%). Even under this scenario traffic modelling in the PA demonstrated that a John Dedman Parkway would still be needed.
The crossroads report suggests that traffic demand can be further ameliorated by reducing the population of Gungahlin from 110,000 to 85,000.
Gooromon Ponds is a proposed base for a township for the ACT which in fact lies outside the present borders of the ACT beside the road between Canberra and Yass. It is being considered at this stage because alternative options in the ACT are very limited. The evaluation goes on to say:
It is likely that Gooromon will be a substantial development area in the future especially as Jerrabomberra is increasingly constrained by grassland and endangered species issues. Population not accommodated in Gungahlin may well go to Gooromon. Gooromon traffic will access the city via the Barton, Northbourne and John Dedman corridors. The John Dedman alignment should be retained to meet this need if and when it arises.
Of course, the need most certainly has arisen, at least as far as planning for it is concerned at this stage.
It is very hard to argue that in some way the residents of Gungahlin in the ACT should be discriminated against vis-a-vis other residents who enjoy much better road access to their residences. Equally, a much more carefully researched and compelling case needs to be made than the one which is presently available to us, which is that somehow if a magically much greater level of public transport usage can be engineered the road will not be required. I suspect that even if public transport levels of the order found in Sydney or Melbourne were engineered for Canberra we would still not be able to do without a second major arterial route out of a township of the size that Gungahlin will ultimately be—that is, in the order of 110,000 people. If you look at similar population centres elsewhere you will see that very well demonstrated.
Senator Lundy, in particular, raised the question of the issue of the eastern route versus the western route. I do not want to go into that in great detail because that is perhaps a debate for another day. Clearly, Senator Brown wants to achieve a situation where there is no route specified. He may or may not prefer the western route over the eastern route, but the fact is that once you have got over the argument—as I think you must— that there is not a need for the road, then the question of east versus west is an interesting argument.
Very briefly, the case for the eastern route as opposed to the western route is based on three main grounds. The first is that the western route takes the road much closer to housing, particularly in Kaleen. We have generally tended to avoid major arterial roads passing close to housing in the territory. It would be a pity if that principle were not to be applied in the case of this road. The second is that to put the road on the western route would make it pass through developed parts of the ACT, particularly through the suburb of Bruce. It would be a road effectively bisecting the suburb and facilities of Bruce. It would have the effect, for example, of separating the sports precinct in Bruce from the industrial estate there. It would have the effect of putting the road very close to the student residences at the Institute of Sport—and having a major motorway just a few feet from their bedroom windows is hardly the kind of encouragement one would want to give to our young aspiring sportsmen and sportswomen.
The most compelling argument is that the western route would be significantly more expensive for the ACT consumer. That route would cost at least $10 million more and, on some estimates, $30 million or more than the cost of the eastern alignment. It might be very generous of members of this place to decide magnanimously that they prefer the western route over the eastern route but, of course, it is the residents and the taxpayers of the ACT who have to foot the cost of the alternative route. I do not think it is appropriate for us to make that decision. The fact is that, on a number of grounds, the eastern route is a much better route.
As to the impact on the environment, I concede that the arguments between east and west are rather closer, but it is wrong to suggest that the western route is free of environmental problems. It is not. It is also wrong to suggest that the eastern route is extremely damaging to the environment. I have personally walked the area concerned to examine it. It is, in some parts, seriously degraded. In fact, part of the route was a tip for ACT residents in past years. It does not travel along the route of the ridge itself—that is, the highest part between north Canberra and Belconnen. In fact, it travels very close to the developed areas where the Bruce Stadium and the Institute of Sport are currently located, minimising the impact on the environment.
Particularly for reasons of cost, I think it is very likely, notwithstanding what Senator Lundy has told the Senate today, that the ACT government was quite relieved to be told that it could not have the western route because of the very considerable costs and problems associated with that route. It can at least now look the Save the Ridge group in the eye and say, `We did our best,' but still pocket the saving between the eastern and western routes.
Senator Lundy indicated also that she regretted the role that the NCA has played in interfering with the ACT government's decision. Given what I have said about what I think should be the role of the NCA in such matters, I have a smidgin of sympathy for that point of view—just a smidgin—but I also point out that Senator Lundy did propose at the time the previous government was in place and was talking about the eastern alignment that perhaps disallowance of that eastern alignment might have to be contemplated by presumably Senator Lundy and her colleagues in the Senate. If it is wrong of the NCA to overturn the decision of an elected ACT government, presumably it is also wrong of the Senate to do so.
I close by saying that I think, irrespective of whether the Senate should be having this debate, it is very important to make a decision which allows a route to be settled upon and to proceed. I invite senators who have any doubt about the subject to travel to Gungahlin early one morning, climb in a car at about quarter past eight or half past eight and attempt to travel to Parliament House and see how long it takes them. They should compare that kind of travel with similar routes elsewhere in the territory and see how very difficult the position is for residents of Gungahlin. I urge the Senate to oppose this motion of disallowance.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CAPITAL PLAN (GUNGAHLIN DRIVE EXTENSION)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-08-19,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to lend our support to the disallowance motion today. I begin by saying that I agree with much of Senator Humphries's articulation of the issues. I may not agree with all the conclusions or the answers that the senator put forward, but I think all of us involved in this debate today have raised—or, indeed, will raise—concerns, whether a smidgin or a lot, about the role of the NCA. The issue of the role of the federal government in arguably a self-governing territory is perhaps an important debate but, as the previous speaker has said, perhaps one for another day, although it is of course quite pertinent to the debate before us.
Senator Lundy commented that the previous election in the ACT was in a way a referendum on the issue, and I agree with her on that. I put on record again the position of the Australian Democrats. When we went to the last ACT election, we had a very clear policy on this issue. It was a clear policy of opposing the eastern alignment of the GDE, and the Democrats intend to stick to that commitment, whether it is through our federal representatives or, indeed, through our member of the ACT Legislative Assembly, Roslyn Dundas. We believe that the eastern alignment of the Gungahlin Drive extension should be removed from the National Capital Plan altogether. As colleagues may know, my ACT colleague Roslyn Dundas has been involved in many debates on this issue in the assembly and has articulated her opposition to the eastern route in the media and in the community. So that comes as no surprise. On behalf of the Democrats, she has met with the AIS on occasions to identify its concerns, with the goal of course of resolving some of the issues. An inspection of the western route was also conducted to inspect the social and environmental impacts of the road. That is obviously an issue that has been raised.
As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I have also put on record the opposition of the Australian Democrats to the approval of this process; hence, our final opportunity today through this disallowance motion to put on record our concerns and our opposition. We have actively participated in the protection of O'Connor Ridge in discussions to assist the campaign to stop the eastern route of the road going through. One of the main concerns we have of course is the environmental devastation that we believe, and others believe, would be caused by the eastern alignment of the GDE. We believe that this would be the worst possible environmental outcome that could be produced. The previous speaker made clear that perhaps there are environmental considerations with the western and the eastern routes and, yes, we concede that, but we believe that the eastern alignment is the least preferable.
We have been concerned by the ACT government's dogged determination to push the Gungahlin Drive extension through the east despite overwhelming evidence that there are environmental and other impacts and also against strong public opposition. Despite the fact that the inquiry by the Standing Committee for Urban Services had of approximately 1,000 submissions only 2.5 per cent that favoured the government's position that the road went to the east of the AIS rather than to the west, the government has maintained its stance regardless of that community concern. Besides major public opposition to the eastern option, there is also evidence that the western route can be better, more economical and, arguably, more efficient than the eastern route, which could require the running of an inferior highway up and down slopes through the most ecologically significant part of the Canberra Nature Park.
We know—and I am sure that the last thing the Senate probably needs is additional history, but I will attempt to be brief because I think colleagues have already outlined some of the history—that the current plans have been on the table for around 40 years since town planners recognised that an effective road link to Gungahlin was needed to deal with the population expansion in the national capital. A transport corridor for the Gungahlin Drive extension was originally identified before the Australian Sports Commission and the AIS were built at the Bruce precinct. In 1991 the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory ratified the need for this road link. In 1997 several routes were examined as part of the John Dedman Parkway preliminary assessment. From this process, two proposed alignments emerged as the only viable options: the first, the eastern option, which would run on the O'Connor Ridge side of the Australian Institute of Sport side of Bruce; and, the second, the western route, which would run through the western side of the AIS. Over the years consultancies commissioned by the NCDC have favoured routes to the west of the AIS. There are the two previous studies, to which you have already heard references—Maunsell back in 1975 and 1977—recommending and confirming the western option.
The issue of the Gungahlin Drive extension has, since its inception, been a political issue. I do not think anyone in this chamber debates that fact. It has particularly been a political football for the two major parties. With a growing population in Gungahlin, what I would call poor transport and infrastructure planning and the increased pressure on the Gungahlin roads, the ACT government was forced to make a decision. Hence, we found ourselves in the position before the last election where both major parties were forced to make a decision as to their preferred options. The parties took two clear and distinct proposals to the electorate at that time. The ACT Liberals promised to build the road along the eastern alignment, cutting through the nature reserve, while the ALP committed itself to the western route. Recognising that both major parties were committed to a road and that a road would be built one way or the other—and the Democrats do recognise that fact—the ACT Democrats took the position that a western route was preferable to the eastern alignment. We took a very clear stance opposing the eastern route. This is not a new-found position.
The ramifications of the Labor and Liberal decisions, it could be argued, were quite electorally significant. The issue of saving the O'Connor and Bruce Ridges, Canberra's inner city nature park, became a very strong community issue—and it still is. I mentioned that overwhelming community opposition to the proposed eastern alignment before. I think that the Save the Ridge campaign is a cry with which many Canberrans and others of us are familiar. I think that is an important part of this debate, because it does involve the issue of an election promise being broken. 
Following the Labor Party's success in the 2001 ACT election, Labor did progress planning and design work to ensure that the GDE would be built to the west of the AIS. The construction of the GDE to the west of the AIS required an amendment to the National Capital Plan—the jurisdiction of the National Capital Authority. Late in 2002 the NCA indicated that they would not support a road built along the western route. Apparently their basis for this was a concern that a road along the western route would impact adversely on the Australian Institute of Sport. This argument, we believe, has been brought into question by the Fitch report, among others, commissioned by the ACT government. This one was released earlier this year. The report, which has been discussed through the joint standing committee, particularly at last week's hearing, states that an eastern alignment would have a greater environmental impact than a western alignment—again, a concern for the Democrats. It states that an eastern route would cut through the bushland through which AIS athletes regularly jog and cycle as part of their training and that a western alignment, with all the additional noise abatement and impact reduction that have been proposed by the Stanhope government, would surely have impacted less than an eastern route.
Our concern is this: with the Labor Party having promised the voters of the ACT a particular route and that, if elected, it would protect the valuable inner city bushland, what was the response of the Labor government when the NCA made its position clear? Again, this relates back to the powers of the NCA—an unelected, arguably unrepresentative government agency—to tell a democratically elected government the path that it should pursue. The debate as to whether or not the Labor government put up a sufficient fight is one which has no doubt raged within the assembly and the community. It is not one which I will explore today, because all of us have touched on the broader issue: the powers of a self-governing elected assembly and government as opposed to the government agency that is the NCA.
Today we are presented with an opportunity to stand up against a decision that was made by the NCA and acknowledged and accepted without the fight that we would have liked to have seen by the Stanhope government. We have got an opportunity today to stand up for the interests of those Canberra residents who were promised an alternative route, a chance to knock back the NCA's decision on this particular issue and maybe send the draft amendment back to the National Capital Plan for a closer look. As I mentioned earlier, the standing committee is currently conducting an inquiry into the NCA and is in the process of hearing evidence about a range of these issues. I look forward to the outcome of that inquiry.
Again, the Democrats reiterate our concern for what is a broken promise to the people of Canberra. Our concerns relate to the powers of the NCA and the backflip by a Labor territory government. We hope Senator Brown will have the numbers and the disallowance motion before us today will be passed. Our concern is that if this process goes ahead, valuable bushland will be destroyed. This bushland provides a rare and valuable inner urban recreational amenity as well as a habitat to wildlife. It is enjoyed, and has been enjoyed, by generations living in the inner north of Canberra.
The Democrats also reiterate our call for something that is long overdue: a long-term integrated transport strategy. I will not pick up Senator Humphries's point in detail here—the notion that there is a good public transport system that is not necessarily well used. I think that is an interesting debating point. I would urge Senator Humphries to read some of the submissions that are coming into the joint standing committee, particularly in relation to the issue of public transport. I do not think any state or territory in Australia has public transport right yet, from a range of perspectives, so there is always room for improvement. A long-term integrated transport strategy is appropriate.
We believe—and my colleague Ros Dundas in the ACT Legislative Assembly certainly also argues this—that the people of Canberra have not had sufficient transport planning and they have had an ineffective allocation of funds in that area. We must deliver a scheme that will focus on the transport needs of the ACT for the next few decades, not just for the next few years. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the disallowance of the approval of amendment 41 of the National Capital Plan, the Gungahlin Drive extension, as part of our long-running concern about and opposition to the route that will be going ahead if this disallowance motion is not supported.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CAPITAL PLAN (GUNGAHLIN DRIVE EXTENSION)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—I congratulate Senator Stott Despoja for that very good summation of why this disallowance motion should proceed. I will be very brief because most of the issues have been canvassed. However, I want to refer a little to Senator Humphries's submission, because I thought it was quite extraordinary. The first thing is that Senator Humphries says it is not appropriate for us to make this decision. Here is the democrat at work—if Senator Stott Despoja will forgive me—versus the market fundamentalist. What we have in Senator Humphries's submission is that the due democratic processes of ACT governance do not count and that the backstop that the Senate provides in a debate like this, with its elected representatives—one on either side from the ACT, to boot, both of whom have contributed—ought not to count. That leaves the NCA. I might ask: who elected them?
If you go a little bit further back, it leaves the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Wilson Tuckey, pulling the strings. So much for democracy when it gets to a true market fundamentalist. It really has to be taken out of the people's hands and determined by people behind closed doors, with their ears shut to public submission but with a very big clout at the end of the day. I would have thought Senator Humphries, as a Liberal, would have more respect for democratic processes than that. What it boils down to is him supporting Wilson Tuckey against the democratic options that the people of the ACT have had. If you go back to the election then you go back to the western alternative for the Gungahlin Drive extension.
The second thing is that Senator Humphries got down to the real grit of the environmental argument with his comment that east versus west is an interesting argument. No, it is not. There is a compelling argument for the western alternative, and that is what is driving many of the people who are fighting to save the ridge. It is not interesting; it is compelling. No wonder Senator Humphries did not get into a rebuttal of it— because there is none. He simply goes right across the top of the environmental values and, true to a market fundamentalist, gives them zero weighting—nothing at all. We come back to this argument that we are moving large numbers of people, and then always the rational, fastest way to do that is what comes out because there is a dollar sign attached to it at the end of the day—$10 million on this occasion, Senator Humphries says. So dollars count and environmental values and long-held legal planning principles—guidelines to the NCA—go out the window when it is convenient. Bring in other alternatives and make it expedient, and ultimately the decision here is not made by the people of the ACT but by Wilson Tuckey and the NCA, behind closed doors.
Senator Humphries says, `I will verbal Senator Brown while I am at it and say that he doesn't want this at all, that he stands for public transport and that the expressway is not an alternative.' In case he is tempted, as I think he may be, to go and spread that about, let me make it clear that the Greens have been arguing for the western alternative. Added to that has been a very good argument—and Senator Stott Despoja just outlined it very well—that public transport should be considered and brought into this debate. Had that been done long ago—had a start on it been made in 1910 or 1920—we would not be having this debate. We would have a city with a public transport system second to none in the world instead of a city with a future linked to expressways only, in a world where that is a prescription for greater environmental and traffic difficulties. Senator Humphries strayed to it a little when he said we do not want roads and cars near houses. But we are talking about cities. If you do not want roads and cars near houses, what is your alternative? It is public transport: clean, efficient, quick, cheap public transport.
But, as always with market fundamentalists, there comes into it a cost factor. They do not even look at it because they presume it is going to be more expensive, and they discount social and environmental costs. Those costs equal zero in that line of argument— even for a great city like Canberra, whose ambience and amenity are salubrious and beyond the dreams of every other capital city in the world. Those other values equal zero in the argument put forward by Senator Humphries. I reject that.
I believe it is our right to be debating this matter here. The Greens are not the least bit on the back foot about bringing up this matter. After all, there is a motion that the Senate can choose to or choose not to deal with. The Greens have said: `Let us deal with it. Let us have the arguments put out and let us, seeing a determination is being made on the eastern alternative, for goodness sake have another look at that. Ameliorate it if you can. Take Senator Humphries out of the room when you do so because, if that amelioration is going to cost a few dollars, he will be opposed to it.' There are other values there that might advantage all concerned. Let them be considered. If nothing else comes out of this debate, at least let those be considered.
Finally, there has been and there will continue to be a strong public debate about this issue and trenchant opposition to the NCA-Wilson Tuckey-Senator Humphries alternative because it is the wrong one. The people of the ACT need to be recognised. They are citizens. This is their city. They deserve better than to have their submissions ignored behind closed doors. They deserve better than to have their vote in their territory government ignored. They are not going to get recognition from Senator Humphries, they are going to get it from Wilson Tuckey and they are not going to get it from the NCA, but they are recognised in this place today. I think they are recognised very strongly by Senator Stott Despoja, by Senator Lundy and by me. That is the function of this place. You never know what will happen in these campaigns, and I personally hope that people will keep up their strength and yet see better sense and greater wisdom brought into this debate so the decision foisted upon them is altered.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2003-08-19,"—On behalf of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee, I present the report of the committee on the provisions of the Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2003, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—I move Australian Greens amendment (1) on sheet 3050:
(1)	Schedule 1, item 31, page 33 (after line 4), after subsection 324L(5), insert:
	(5A)	To avoid doubt, if the Minister by instrument removes all or part of a place, or a National Heritage value of a place in accordance with this section, the instrument is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
This amendment is identical to one proposed by the opposition. It is an important amendment, and I hope committee members will take particular notice of it. It is to ensure that in the future any components of Australian heritage that are so important that they have been listed by a minister under the new system are not delisted without the authority of parliament. In other words, delisting has to be by regulation. The reasons for that are very obvious: pressure can be brought on any minister of the day to delist part of Australia's heritage, whether cultural or natural, by big-moneyed interests—when what Senator Hill calls `social and economic values' come into play. The amendment simply gives parliament that authority. It is a very important backstop to the protection of national heritage.
I think Senator Hill, being a democrat by nature, will support this. I am pleased to be able to draw it to his attention, because it was just one of those things that he overlooked. It is an extremely good amendment. I know that Senator Lees will want to support it as well, because it is such an important backstop for protecting Australia's heritage down the line. Mark my words: there will come a time when a minister of the national government of Australia will be under backroom pressure to delist part of the Australian heritage, to take off one of its values, to remove some acres of it or to give over some buildings, some foreshore or some forests, because a developer wants to get at them in some way or other. If the arguments are good for that, put them to the parliament and have the parliament make that decision. It should be done by regulation. There should be the option for both houses of parliament to look at it, to give their stamp of approval before a heritage area, place or value is delisted.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-19,"—I was about to leap to my feet to move Labor amendment (1) on sheet 3051 but, given that it is identical—and given that Senator Brown leapt to his feet and moved his amendment on the issue of the disallowance—I indicate that Labor will support Australian Greens amendment (1) on sheet 3050. We do so on the basis that this bill will allow the minister to remove places from the National Heritage List in two circumstances. The first is where the place no longer has heritage values, and the second is where it is necessary to do so in the interests of Australia's defence or security. Where the minister wishes to remove places because of a loss of heritage value, she or he must do so using the vehicle of a disallowable instrument.
Labor believe that removing a place is a significant step. To make sure that there is absolutely no doubt about the role of parliament in the decision making process, Labor's amendment—we are debating the Greens amendment but ours is identical—requires that a disallowable instrument be used. I have to say that this is again an attempt by Labor to make this government accountable. Our primary complaint with these heritage bills is that effectively the opportunity to maintain the independence of the Heritage Commission has gone. Labor, as I have said before, are not in a position to support these bills but have supported this particular amendment because we proposed to move one that expressed the same thing and it presented an opportunity to improve specific accountability to the parliament.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-19,"—I have to say that I do not understand Senator Brown's amendment and therefore I rise to seek some clarification. The government bill has the effect that if a site is to be removed—if the minister decides to remove it as a result of loss of value—it is a disallowable instrument; it can be disallowed. The only instance that I can see where it cannot be disallowed is if it is being removed on national security grounds. That seems to me to be a reasonable outcome. If the government has taken a national security decision then I do not think it is appropriate that it be disallowable; if it is a values issue then there is an argument that it should be. The government has accepted that, and that is the way the bill has been drafted. If that is clear, as I think it is, I cannot see the point of Senator Brown's amendment, unless he is trying to achieve some other outcome that is not apparent to me. It is interesting that both Senator Brown and Senator Lundy can clearly see something here that I cannot see. One of the two might explain it to me.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—It is a removal of doubts clause. There is some doubt, in the way the government has written the legislation, that in all cases there will be an opportunity for parliament to disallow the removal of a place of national heritage value from the Heritage List. Already the minister has said, `Except where national security is at stake'. Could the minister give us an example of where that would be the case? In any event, when he gives the example, I ask committee members to think about this: why should the parliament not be involved in an important matter like that? We are talking about a very short-listed national heritage register which lists the most important components of the nation's heritage. This is a doubts removal clause. It simply says the parliament should be there to validate the delisting of an entity from that list, whatever the circumstances.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-19,"—If we are debating whether or not a disallowance on national security grounds should attract a disallowance then that clarifies the issue. There is clearly an issue between the government and Senator Brown; I do not know about the opposition. If that is the issue between the government and Senator Brown then we stand by our position that, if it is removed on national security grounds, it is inappropriate that it be disallowed because of the executive responsibility of the government on national security issues. What would be such a circumstance? I have to concede that it takes a bit of imagination to conjure up a circumstance in which a matter of national heritage significance would be withdrawn on national security grounds. Perhaps the national item could be a defence site and the weight of circumstances in which Australia finds itself could mean that a certain defence activity should take place on that site that has a higher precedent in terms of Australia's national interests than the heritage value. I think that is highly unlikely to occur, so we are probably spending time here arguing about nothing. I certainly believe that there is an argument to include the provision in the bill—and the government has done that. If the provision is included—that is, that there is a capacity to remove on national security grounds—it is inappropriate that that be subject to parliamentary disallowance.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—I reiterate that in all circumstances, and particularly because the minister has not been able to give an example of what he means by national security being at stake, the parliament should be the authority, not the minister of the day, whoever that might be. If specific security grounds could be conjured up—and I cannot think of any—which would require the delisting of a piece of the national heritage, and presumably its destruction or damage as a result of that, the parliament should be involved. We are dealing with the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, schedule 1, section 324L, entitled `Removal of places or national heritage values from the National Heritage List'. Subclause (5) says:
If the instrument—
that is, the delisting notice—
deals only with removal for loss of value, the instrument:
(a) is a disallowable instrument—
that is, parliament can say no to the minister, and—
(b) takes effect—
within 15 days, effectively—
or to be taken to have been disallowed, under that section as it applies in relation to the instrument because of section 46A of that Act.
Then the minister must publish it. The amendment says:
(5A) To avoid doubt, if the Minister by instrument removes all or part of a place, or a National Heritage value of a place—for the concept of place is being introduced here, as well as the value—in accordance with this section, the instrument is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
It is simply saying that, whether it is a place or a value that is listed on the National Heritage List, a move to deregister it by a minister of the day will be allowed only after the authority of parliament has been added to the minister's wishes.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-19,"—I am sorry, Mr Temporary Chairman: I do not think that there is any ambiguity. If we were to agree with Senator Brown's amendment, that in fact would introduce an ambiguity. The questions would then be asked: why has an additional, unnecessary clause been added and how does the disallowance provision of Senator Brown's amendment relate to the disallowance provision that the government has already put in the bill? Apart from the defence issue, on the values issue I do not think that we have a disagreement with Senator Brown in principle. It is just a question of the best way to legislate, and we believe that our bill as it stands effectively achieves our objectives. Therefore, we would not support Senator Brown's amendment. I beg the indulgence of the chamber: I have to be out of the chamber for a short while and I plan to leave the bill in the very capable hands of Senator Campbell, who has strong credentials in the environment and heritage area.
—I am parliamentary secretary to an excellent minister.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-19,"—I think Senator Hill's reasoning that to support this particular amendment would be to increase ambiguity is somewhat farcical. The amendment states that its purpose is to avoid any misunderstanding. The intent of it is, of course, to clarify. So I do not accept that for a second. I thought that I would take this opportunity to again reflect on the overall nature of this bill. I will do so by quoting from an article authored by Tom Uren that was referred to earlier in this debate. It appeared in the Canberra Times on 13 August this year. Tom Uren's words certainly sum up much of Labor's concern—which, I hope, I have conveyed adequately to the chamber in the course of this debate. I will not, obviously, go through the entire article, but I think that its central passages are extremely pertinent. Tom Uren writes:
Gough Whitlam's Government set up the Justice Hope Committee in 1973 to inquire into the National Estate. The Hope Report, tabled in April, 1974, said in essence: “The Australian Government has inherited a National Estate which was downgraded, disregarded and neglected. A permanent statutory body should be set up to manage the National Estate.”
The Hope inquiry recommended that the new authority be granted independence from governments. The Whitlam Government created the AHC as a statutory authority, with both houses honouring Hope's recommendation. David Yencken was appointed the first chairman of AHC in 1975.
The now Emeritus Professor David Yencken gave evidence in 2001 before the Senate Environment Committee on the proposed Australian Heritage Council Bill 2000. He spoke on a joint submission by seven former commissioners, including five former chairs of the commission.
Professor Yencken said that the proposed bill contained some positive elements but noted obvious deficiencies. He said that the maintenance and continued development of the National Estate would be jeopardised by the change. Responsibility for listing should rest with the council as it now does with the commission and the council should retain all the powers of the existing commission.
Professor Yencken said that the 25 years of experience gained by the commission should not be lightly cast aside. The AHC Act requires an annual report from the commission, which also has the power to make reports at any time on any subject of its choosing. The minister has to table those reports.
I have advocated to senators that Parliament can strengthen the commission's powers but that ministerial control would suffocate it.
Tom Uren goes on to reflect upon the support that he understood he had for his campaign; in particular, the ALP and Greens support is acknowledged. But Tom Uren was under the impression that:
Two independent senators intimated they would vote to support the commission as an independent authority.
The results in this place have indicated that that is not happening. Tom Uren also goes on to reflect upon the role of the Democrats and urges the Democrats to support his campaign. We now know, as well, that that certainly was not forthcoming in the early part of the debate. It remains to be seen how the Democrats will treat the final form and shape that this bill takes.
Finally, in reflecting on Tom Uren I would like to acknowledge his role in seeking to protect Australian heritage through his campaign and his continued advocacy of the need for an independent commission to look after the interests of Australian heritage. Indeed, I acknowledge the fact that that campaign should continue in the context of this bill and following its passage through this place. I thought that it was a timely opportunity to read that excerpt from Tom Uren's piece in the Canberra Times. I think that it serves as a timely reminder that the amendment we are now debating is another effort to remove ambiguity on the accountability aspect that having a disallowable instrument for all removals of heritage items from the list brings into this place.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—Let me put the argument again, in regard to what Senator Hill said, to express clearly why this amendment is necessary. We are dealing with the clause in the bill which describes how a minister may remove places or national heritage values from the National Heritage List—and there are five clauses. All of them mention, in one way or another, the removal of places or values from the National Heritage List by the minister. But when you get to the clause which says that the parliament can disallow the minister's decision, it is only about values, not about places. So a piece can be taken out of a place provided it does not, in the opinion of the minister, affect the values. Why the sudden restriction to values in the disallowable instrument? My amendment ensures that there is consistency right through and that, when it gets to what the minister can disallow, which is places and values, the parliament can override the minister on places and values, not just values. That is the minister's wording. Let us be consistent about it. This amendment, which is shared by the Greens and the Labor Party, says, `Let us make sure, so there can be no doubt about it, that the minister cannot remove either a national heritage place or a national heritage value from the list without the authority of parliament.'",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-19,"—The government's problems with this have been enunciated by Senator Hill, but I want to reiterate because I heard Senator Lundy, when she began her last intervention, intimate that she was attracted by the argument in Senator Brown's amendment about creating more clarity. The reality, however, is that it would create internal inconsistencies in the legislation and, more importantly, it would ensure that subclause (1)(b), which allows the minister to remove all or part of a place from the list, applies to only two items. There are only two reasons why the minister can remove things from the list without them being disallowable instruments: firstly, if they seek to have those values and, secondly, if it is in the interests of Australia's defence. Those are the only exceptions; all the rest have to be disallowable. As I understand it and as I am advised, Senator Brown's motion would have the effect of ensuring that these two would also have to be disallowable. That is quite clear. It is undesirable from the government's point of view, and we believe the legislation is better in the form in which it is presented.
I am also advised, in relation to the last part of Senator Brown's contribution, that there is a difference between the way people perceive national heritage places and values, and that the government has adopted the World Heritage model—that is, it is values to which you obviously give protection. Of course, those values are attached to a place, and it is obviously very hard to take one away from the other—they are intrinsically linked, no doubt. I do understand that the ACF have a different view of that but, on my reading of this legislation, it clearly talks about places on the list. It clearly means that in relation to the places and the values in subclauses (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) they are all disallowable, with the exception of the two which I referred to in subclause (1), which are not disallowable for reasons the government claims are sound.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—First, the government has just said that this measure is based on the World Heritage model which looks at values. That is not right. There has just been a move by the Australian government, backed up by the British and American governments, to try to have a values only system of listing and assessing World Heritage properties. It was voted down in the world forum in Paris. The Australian government failed to get it through there, and now it is trying to introduce it in this legislation. The Australian public know the value of heritage places and know the historical, Indigenous, cultural, natural and environmental values in places, but they want those places protected because they hold those values. Here we have a bill in which the minister has written in subclause (3):
The Minister may remove all or part of a place ...
However, when it comes to what parliament can do, they can only object to the removal of a value because it has been lost or something. My amendment says, `No, you don't. If the minister can remove a place from the National Heritage List, then the parliament ought to be able to overrule the minister on that.'

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-19,"—I question the need for any sort of exemption in the national interest, be it for defence or for any other reason, from the disallowable instrument status of the rest of the power to revoke. As I understand it, we already have an exemption power under section 158, which is that a site is not to be listed because it is not in the national interest. I would have thought that if there was a defence-sensitive site, then it would not be listed in the first place. It is hard to see why we need to have that exemption from a disallowance.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-19,"—The obvious answer is that we are talking about something that is already on the list. It would not be on the list if the national interest exemption had applied in the first place. But this is something that could be on the list. I heard Senator Hill say before he left that this will obviously be a very rare occurrence. He could not even think of an example, though he tried to come up with one. It may well be a piece of coastal land in the north-west of Western Australia, for example, that has some wonderful values—is a wonderful place and has those values attached to it—but which may be required for defence purposes. For that reason, it may need to be delisted. That is something that is in the future. We are applying it to something that is listed now that a future government may want to delist.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—Neither Senator Hill nor Senator Campbell can give us an example.
—I just gave you one.
—You gave us a non-specific example. Let me be specific. If a future government does want to resume Bennelong Point because there is some defence reason for doing that, or it does want to resume a central part of Melbourne city or any other capital city in this place, or a coastal reserve, or a marine reserve, the parliament should be involved in that. That is what my amendment says.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-08-19,"—by leave—I move Greens amendments (1) and (2) to (6) on sheet 2868 together.

38F Section 524A
Omit “not”.
Amendment (1) aims to capture funding decisions within the definition of an action. Of course, a definition of an action is critical to triggering the application of the proposed heritage legislation. The government's proposed definition of an action significantly weakens the heritage protection laws by substituting the strong definition of an action outlined in the Australian Heritage Act with the weak definition contained in the EPBC Act. 
Under the Heritage Act, the taking of an action includes the making of a decision or recommendation—including direct financial assistance to a state or territory—the approval of a program, the issue of a licence or the granting of permission. It also includes a recommendation in relation to direct financial assistance granted or proposed to be granted to a state or territory. The EPBC Act's definition of an action, the weaker, excludes these decisions. The effect of using the narrower definition is to exempt all government decision making and funding activity from the operation of the legislation. This amendment is about maintaining the status quo of the definition of an action in relation to heritage, but it also addresses the flaw in the EPBC Act by applying the definition in the Australian Heritage Act and thereby ensuing a higher standard of protection of Australia's natural and cultural heritage than the government has proposed with this bill. That is amendment (1) in this set of amendments.
Amendments (2) to (6) also deal with the definition of an action. They are directed at widening the scope of the action to include a recommendation. So the first amendment is about including funding decisions and these ones are about including the recommendation. The Heritage Act says:
... if the adoption of a recommendation would adversely affect a place, the making of a recommendation shall be deemed to affect the place adversely.
The bill before us weakens the protection for our national heritage by omitting a recommendation from the definition and, therefore, the scope of the activities that trigger the act. Reducing the type of actions to be covered in this bill will result in many Commonwealth actions that affect heritage places being exempted from proper consideration, assessment and decision. The narrow definition of the action that the government proposes in this bill is the same as the one in the EPBC Act, as I said before. The Greens believe that this is one of the major flaws in the legislation that was, as we have heard before, guillotined through the parliament with the support of the Australian Democrats. 
The definition fails to capture policy plans and programs. Only significantly advanced development proposals are captured. By the time they trigger the act, they have significant political and financial momentum and it becomes difficult to properly scrutinise or stop them. This is borne out by the statistics of the operation of the EPBC Act where, of the near 900 referrals to the Commonwealth so far, only one proposal has been stopped. That was the matter of Booth, a case involving a Queensland orchid farmer who wanted to install electrified barriers against flying foxes, and the proposal was stopped because it was already illegal under state law. 
The Greens believe that the critical component of the EPBC Act needs to be fixed, and this amendment does that by extending the definition in the act to ensure that it includes recommendations and funding decisions in accordance with the provisions of the Australian Heritage Commission Act. This will ensure that the full sweep of government decisions is captured. In talking further about the weak definition of an action that we find in the EPBC Act, I think it is quite astounding not to include government decisions and funding decisions in the definition of an action to trigger such action. In the EPBC Act, some other things are not included in the definition of an action, such as a decision by a Commonwealth agency to grant a governmental authorisation under a whole range of different acts, including the Customs Act, the Export Control Act, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act, the Fisheries Management Act, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act, the Quarantine Act and the Trade Practices Act. 
I turn to how these acts in the past and the predecessor to the EPBC Act were able to be used to protect national heritage in Australia. Of course the Export Control Act is an act that I have been familiar with as part of the environment movement in the way in which it regulates the export of uranium from Australia. It is a clear act that has implications in protecting heritage areas of Australia. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act was used in the 1980s to quash a proposal for sandmining at Shelburne Bay in Far North Queensland. The Shelburne Bay region has outstanding conservation and cultural heritage values and is known for its magnificent pure white sand dunes, the Barrier Reef coastline, the heathlands and the forests. The traditional white sands of Shelburne Bay have been described by the traditional owners of the land as `an image of the great white manta ray' landing in that area. Proposals in the 1980s by a Japanese company to mine Shelburne Bay were opposed by the Hawke government. In 1987 the government used the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act to quash such a proposal for sandmining at Shelburne Bay. Under the current EPBC Act, these acts are excluded, and it would not be possible for the Commonwealth government to stop a sandmining proposal at Shelburne Bay under this definition of an action. 
The series of Greens amendments that I have moved seeks to redress this situation and return us to a situation much closer to the legislation that we had in the predecessor to the EPBC Act of being able to use all these pieces of legislation, including government funding decisions and recommendations in the definition of an action. I urge the committee to support these amendments.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech

No doubt the minister will indicate that there would be constitutional problems for the states as well, because many of those decisions would be matters for the states. As I have said, while this is attractive, particularly the funding option, if some decisions could be nipped in the bud earlier on in the decision-making process that would be desirable.

"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-19,"—I stress again that I simply cannot agree with the view of the Greens that we are weakening protection of heritage by continuing to work on this legislation. We will, in fact, considerably strengthen the protection of Australian heritage both here and overseas if this legislation is passed. In response to Senator Brown's incorporating a letter earlier today from the ACF criticising the legislation, I seek leave to incorporate the response to that letter from the Heritage Commission. It is a three-page document. There are also two other pages: one from the National Trust supporting the legislation and one from the Humane Society International and the Tasmanian Conservation Trust supporting the legislation.
Leave granted. 
The documents read as follows—
New Deal Will Boost Australia's Heritage Protection
Two bills currently before parliament will provide stronger protection for Australia's heritage icons and historic places, if a deal between the Howard government and Senator Meg Lees enables their passage through parliament.
Australia's leading environment organisations have welcomed news of the deal and say the new bills will finally bring national heritage protection under the protective umbrella of the Commonwealth's EPBC Act.
“These bills are a major advance over existing Commonwealth heritage laws”, said Alistair Graham, Tasmanian Conservation Trust.
“Before these bills, Commonwealth legal protection was very limited, applying only to heritage sites on Commonwealth land and Commonwealth activities. This meant that many of the 14,000 properties listed on the Register of the National Estate received no Commonwealth legal protection.”
The new bills will provide clear and accessible procedures for people to notify the Minister if the values of listed heritage properties are under threat. 
“We are looking forward to seeing an independent and reinvigorated Australian Heritage Council as a result of this new legislation”, said Michael Kennedy, Director, Humane Society International. 
The Groups also welcomed the Howard government's additional $13.3 million dollars in the recent Budget for its new Distinctively Australian heritage initiative on the condition that this package of heritage legislation is passed. They also noted the earlier work done by a wider range of groups and the Democrats over the last two years or so in preparing elements of the package agreed between Prime Minister Howard and Senator Lees.

19th May 2003
Dear Senator
During its recent 17/18 May Board meeting the Australian Council of National Trusts (ACNT) discussed the matter of the heritage bills which are currently before the. Senate.
The ACNT, along with a large number of other interested parties, has made its support for the amended bills publicly known for sometime. In the ACNT's view the proposed legislation will. significantly enhance the Commonwealth government's role in the protection of Australia's heritage. For the first time the Commonwealth government will be required to assume responsibility for the protection and good management of all places entered onto the National list. Furthermore individual Commonwealth agencies will be required for the first time to identity and conserve their places of heritage value. The Government has also made it apparent, with its Distinctively Australian budget announcement that financial support will be provided.
The legislative package has been nearly 4 years in the making, involving considerable consultation with interested parties. It has reached the point where it has the support of all state and territory heritage agencies and peak heritage advocacy bodies including the National Cultural Heritage Forum (NCHF)
The protection of the nation's cultural heritage has been an area of ,environmental policy that bas been badly neglected in recent times. These bills before the Senate provide an opportunity to rectify this. Nat only will the Commonwealth have greater responsibilities but because the bills are linked to the existing Environmental Protection, Biodiversity and Conservation Act the Commonwealth's protective powers are extend to the heritage domain.
On behalf of the Australian Council of National Trusts (ACNT) I urge you to lend your support to the passage of these Bills. 
Yours Sincerely
Alan Graham
Executive Officer, ACNT

Senator
The Australian Conservation Foundation sent a position to you on the Heritage Bills. I am supporting the aspirations of a large number of stakeholders including the Commission since 1996.
Mr Don Henry
Executive Director
Australian Conservation Foundation
60 Leicester Street
CARLTON Vic 3053
Dear Mr Henry
Thank you for your letter of 24 June 2003 concerning my press release of 18 June. In response to the points you have made:
1.	The ACF stands alone in opposition in the spectrum of stakeholders who have engaged in the consultation with the Heritage Bills in recent year. At the meeting of the National Cultural Heritage Forum the following stakeholder groups indicated their strong support for passage of the Bills: Australia ICOMOS Australia Council of National Trusts, Institution of Engineers Heritage Committee, Federation of Australian Historical Societies, Australian Academy of the Humanities, National Heritage Chairs and Officials (representing the state, territory and NZ heritage councils), Royal Australian Institute of Architects, Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology, Australian Institute of Archaeology, Property Council of Australia Museums Australia. Mr Wayne Smith of the ACF was not counted as a supporter. I note the inclusion of the Wilderness Society in your letter. Mr Marr attended the National Heritage Convention in 1998 but has not participated in consultation since that date. The Society has been regularly invited to participate in consultations through the development of the Bills The offer was not taken up,
2.	I do not understand your claim about the weakening of the existing AHC Act provisions. I expect you are referring to the removal of the grants trigger. In practice this has, in recent years, largely a waste of time and money. By far the majority of the AHC Act section 30 advice matters has been the Director of the Heritage Commission providing formal written advice to the FA Director responsible for heritage grants. They are the same person. I remain surprised you see substantial criminal penalties as a weakening. You would be aware that in the recent case relating to the protection of outstanding Commonwealth heritage on Norfolk Island listing of the area on the RNE proved useless. Section 26 of the EPBC Act was used to provide effective protection,
3.	Your point about needing to place these sites on the Commonwealth Heritage List is simply wrong. These places are protected now through the existing operation of sections 26 and 28 of the EPBC Act whether they are listed or not. That is why the Bills do not include penalty provisions for Commonwealth places. They are already in place. The Bills provide further clarity, tighter definitions and a management framework for protection that is already there. Having said that, all Commonwealth places on the RNE with heritage values will be transferred to the Commonwealth list. Work is continuing on checking the values for relevant places and significantly upgrading the Statements of Significance. In the last 18 months the AHC has almost exclusively confined its RNE listing action to Commonwealth sites in anticipation for the operation of this provision.
Your link any alleged World Heritage strategy on the part of the Commonwealth Government is a mystery to me, The Bills focus on `values' vs `places' is based on aiming to achieve the best conservation and practicable management outcome.
With reference to my comment `existing arrangements are maintained'. This is reference to the fact that, under the new system, the Register of the National Estate is to be maintained by the Australian Heritage Council together with the power of the Council to add to the Register. If there is a departure from these arrangements then it is in the area of a significant expansion of the Council's function vis a vis the Commission.
The proposal to accommodate social and economic considerations for heritage places is widely seen as sound governance. Comparisons with other EPBC triggers are irrelevant. It is impossible to contemplate that an non-answerable body of heritage experts could make decisions that could impose significant impacts, severe penalty provisions and oversight of the Federal Court on citizens for the potentially large sweep of areas and tenures potentially covered by heritage listing without the opportunity for those citizens to put their case, Almost all those engaged in the consultation process now accept these decisions are rightly to be taken by elected representatives answerable to Parliament. The Bills however readily recognise that the final decisions must me made in an open, proper and transparent way with ready, broad standing, legal redress to transgressions.
I notice again that something is being made out of any delay on placing Commonwealth RNE on the Commonwealth list. Let me restate the position that delay does not matter. These places are already protected by sections 26 and 28 of the EPBC Act. Any `delay' will be the result of checking that each of the c800 places actually exist and their statements of significance reflect the heritage values set by the legislation. This work is well underway. There is no other agenda at work here. Why would a conservation body want to take an action that misses an ideal opportunity to have sound upgraded statements of significance which, for the first time, become the statutory basis for protection when the alternative is outdated and in many cases, one-line statements of significance?
Your comments about a partisan position are not understood. The current Bills have their origins in a reform process established in 1996 by Australian Heritage Commission Commissioners appointed by the previous Government. `The second major tier of the Bills is the protection of Commonwealth heritage. The provisions are a direct implementation of an inquiry conducted on the matter by the previous Government. The basis for the national heritage listing policy is an intergovernmental agreement signed in 1997 by all state and territory governments as well as the Commonwealth and the Local Government Association, Successive AHC Commissioners have remained strongly committed to the measures now detailed in the Bills.
At the recent meeting of Australasian Heritage Chairs and Officials in Wellington NZ there was considerable enthusiasm to see the Bills passed. All of these jurisdictions are Labor Governments. The suggestion of a partisan position is therefore incorrect. There are a number of national heritage strategy programs in train that will implement a coordinated approach to heritage protection. There is already coordinated work addressing early themes for listing, maximising the value of heritage for tourism in regional Australia and a coordinated approach between the protection of national, Commonwealth and state/territory heritage places and areas.
Even the matter of overseas listing is the subject of enthusiastic engagement. Australia and New Zealand are working collaboratively to achieve early inscription of the Anzac area on our respective national registers. This is been done in close cooperation with Turkey as part of a possible collaborative effort to see the Gallipoli Peace Park put forward for World Heritage nomination backed by the national inscriptions of Australia and New Zealand.
I hope my points of clarification have been of assistance.
Yours sincerely
Tom Harley Chairman

—I thank the chamber. I would like to answer another criticism of Senator Brown's on an ongoing issue that we have been debating since we began debate on these bills I do not know how many days ago: values. Senator Brown has some difficulty with the concept of our protecting values. I look at just a couple of World Heritage listings and at the system of protection of values. To start with Kakadu National Park, it was `inscribed on the World Heritage List in three stages over 11 years'. It goes on to say, `It is one of the few sites included on the List for both outstanding cultural and natural universal values.' I will not read any further, but it talks about the various natural and cultural values that Kakadu has under the World Heritage listing. 
Looking at the World Heritage listing for Heard and McDonald Islands, the values table there sets out a variety of values. One relates to the outstanding examples representing major stages in the earth's history. Another value relates to the outstanding examples representing significant ongoing ecological and biological processes. These are all values for which places are listed. I just want to reiterate that this bill is strengthening the protection because it will be recognising not just an individual building or an individual particular place—maybe a bridge—but the values of that particular area.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-19,"—I understand Senator Lees's argument and find it very wanting. Of course places are inscribed on the World Heritage List because of the values that they contain which are of universal significance: natural values, cultural values and those dynamic values of evolution of species and cultures to which Senator Lees referred. If you look at the nomination for the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage place, Senator Lees, you will find that it is nominated for all four of those natural values. It is one of only a handful of the hundreds of World Heritage nominations in which that conjunction is held.
But there is a growing move by the Australian and American authorities to say, `Let's just list the values.' It is a very clever move, because what it says is, `Then we can get at the rest of these places with developments. Then we can have the historic building kept intact while we exploit the perimeter around it for car parks. Then we can have the wild river kept intact, but we can log the forests on the hillsides to the east and west. Then we can list a rare and endangered species habitat, but we can allow some incursion in the vicinity which is not going to materially affect it'—mining or tourist ventures for some developer who has got at some government. You are opening the door to serial erosion of a place and, with it, the threatening of the values that are within it.
Everybody understands where a place is and where the boundaries are on a map. As soon as you go to values, you get into opinions. It is a moving feast and, even though those values have been listed, under this legislation it becomes the prerogative of the minister—getting some advice from a council, but it does not have any strength—to determine what those values are. Not so with lines on maps: you know where the boundaries are. But when it gets to values a minister can look a camera and a nation straight in the face and say, `I'm going to protect that value and I'm going to protect that rare plant there, but I am going to allow this tourist development right next to it.' Of course, if a bushfire gets away, people trample on that plant or rootrot gets in as a result of the road going into that development, he did not know about that at the time and some other government has moved in in the meantime. It becomes a moving feast of erodability of the place that has been put on the Heritage List.
That is why that last amendment was important. The minister has in his legislation mentioned place as much as he mentioned value, but when it comes to the parliamentary powers to do something about deregistration only the values would be able to be deregistered. The minister would be able to come in here and say, `I am protecting that value—while I take a big lump out of that place.' It is a very dangerous drift. Australia, Senator Hill, the Hon. David Kemp, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, and the Hon. John Howard, the Prime Minister, are pushing not just in this country but in world fora to try to pull the rug out from under this protection of place. They say, `Leave it to us; trust us with values.' Of course, behind them is a whole suite of developers wanting to get at heritage. It is very important that that be stood against. 
It was a very important victory in Paris earlier this year when the Australian government's move to undermine World Heritage through this `Let's have values and not place' was lost—but now we have it being advocated here. Senator Lees, I just disagree with you. I think you should protect both the place and the heritage values for which it is listed. It is very important to understand, if it is going to be a continuing debate, that the public will side very much with the places being protected. You know where they are, you know where the lines are and you know what the boundaries are. If you just leave it to values, then anything can get clobbered, ultimately, by a minister asserting that they are going to protect the value while they erode the place.

I think the amendment is extraordinarily important to this piece of legislation, and it will be lost if we allow a recommittal. But the will of the Senate must out. However, it is a very high duty of ours—and I have been caught out in different circumstances—to make sure that the reasons for a recommittal like this are justified. I reiterate: the importance of this motion is that it empowers the Senate to have a say in the future heritage and delisting by a minister of national heritage. It is a very important amendment and it warranted keen attention and presence here. I will agree to Senator Howard's—Senator Harris's—request for a recommittal.
—It was a Freudian slip!

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-08-19,"—I understand that the nature of government amendment (1) is to limit the capacity for emergency listing of sites that are overseas and therefore out of Australian jurisdiction or jointly managed by Australia in relation to their heritage values. I recognise that for ongoing listing of sites that are overseas a cooperative management regime would be put in place between the Australian government and whichever government. But I imagine an emergency listing where it is an interim measure could be used to stop a heritage place being destroyed whilst an agreement was reached between the two governments about ongoing management of the site. So I recognise that in an ongoing sense there needs to be joint management, but I am wondering why that needs to be the case in an emergency listing, given that it is an interim measure. Would it allow time for such a joint management proposal to be negotiated between the two governments in question?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-19,"—As I understand it, what it does is make it clear that the provisions will only apply to persons with a jurisdictional connection with Australia, as outlined in subsection 5(3) of the EPBC legislation. Arguably, that may not be necessary. You can have a debate as to whether in fact it is necessary, because arguably it cannot have an effect unless there is a jurisdictional connection. To be on the safe side we are putting it up as a second amendment, but I do not think it deals particularly with the issue that Senator Nettle was raising.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-19,"—I indicate that the Democrats will not be supporting these amendments. We see them as a significant weakening of the legislation. I would be interested in hearing the minister's arguments, but it seems to us that there is no justification for the amendments. After all, this legislation applies to Australian citizens and their actions—so, if an Australian corporation decided to bulldoze something on the Kokoda Trail or one of the other sites that are being considered for listing, there would be no opportunity to put in place the emergency listing quickly enough. It seems to us that it is a necessary and sensible thing to advise foreign countries of our actions, but we are talking about Australian citizens or Australian corporations. If we cannot through this legislation determine, or at least stop, any behaviour or action being taken by Australian citizens overseas then I think it is a poor showing. I think the emergency listing process is a good one. It prevents sites being damaged by actions that would otherwise take place if such a provision did not exist. It is too late once the damage has been done. We think it should be sufficient to notify the foreign country of our intention to act and explain why. I cannot imagine a country saying, `No, we need to go through 15,000 processes before you can tell your own citizens that they are not to damage a heritage site.'
It also seems to us that a number of these amendments, such as amendment (6), are putting into legislation matters which are simply departmental correspondence. It should not be necessary to put into law the necessity to notify foreign departments. That ought to be something that happens in any case. I do not know whether the minister wants to give us a more thorough explanation of the need for this or some examples where it might be necessary, but it is very difficult to see any good reason for this. It did not come up in the inquiry process and I wonder, as I said, why it is necessary.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-19,"—I was not party to the negotiation, but it seems to me that being able to list extraterritorially is quite a radical step in itself. It is a good step. Under this legislation, we will be able to list assets that have very important heritage values to Australia albeit they are located overseas. There has already been public discussion in relation to the Gallipoli Peninsula. It would be not only radical but highly provocative if we were to give ourselves the power to make emergency listings. In our relationships with other states, I think they would regard that as highly provocative and, in a piece of legislation where we are trying to build public confidence in the protection of Australian heritage, taking unnecessarily provocative steps may well prove to be counterproductive.
The philosophy behind this legislation is a little different to that of the past. Under the existing legislation we have ended up with 20,000 listings or nominations because parties went out and sought nominations against threats or perceived threats and we ended up with a totally unworkable system. We prefer to approach this in perhaps a little more conservative way but a way that can give confidence that we will build assets that we are capable of protecting. We will put in proper processes for their conservation and protection. I guess that means the philosophical basis is a little different to what Senator Allison is looking for, but that is the philosophical basis on which we drafted the bill.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-19,"—But the minister would acknowledge that this legislation applies only to Australian citizens and Australian corporations. Let us take the example of Gallipoli that he provided. If there were the need for an emergency listing, it is hard to see that Australia would just sit back and not act quickly in the event that whatever values we determined worthy of heritage listing at Gallipoli were damaged by an Australian citizen who might be taking such action as to do that.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-08-19,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise to speak to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission telecommunications reports 2001-02—report 1, Telecommunications competitive safeguards; report 2, Changes in prices paid for telecommunications services in Australia; and report 3, Telstra's compliance with price control arrangements—subsections 151CL(5) and 151CM(3) of the Trade Practices Act 1974. These reports are a timely reminder, in the context of the government's proposal to fully privatise Telstra, as they raise critical issues about Telstra's readiness for full privatisation. The reports conclude that competition has not developed as extensively as expected because of issues to do with the industry's structure, Telstra's network ownership and the integrated nature of its operations. The reports state:
Competition has clearly not developed as extensively as was expected following the opening of the telecommunications markets in 1997.
While there are signs that competition is increasing in long-distance and mobile services, the ACCC believes that it is still not being effectively competitive. In particular, the ACCC argues:
... that the markets for local call and fixed-to-mobile services are a long way from being effectively competitive.
Surely this has to be of some concern to the government and to consumers generally? The ACCC found that in 2001-02 telecommunications prices decreased more slowly than in any year since 1996. Small business for the first time experienced an increase in price, while large business customers got twice the price reductions of those ordered to residential customers. The ACCC's report to the minister in June this year, entitled Emerging market structures in the communications sector, stated:
... the ongoing lack of effective competition in many telecommunications markets means consumers continue to pay higher prices and receive lower quality services across the entire communications sector than they otherwise would.
Today's ACCC reports raise serious concerns about the way in which Telstra measures price movements, raising serious questions about whether Telstra is complying fully with the price cap determinations. Under the price control arrangements affecting Telstra, the ACCC has to ascertain whether Telstra has complied with those price control arrangements. It should be noted that this compliance is a condition of Telstra's carrier licence. On page 165, it states:
... without independent confirmation the auditor is unable to satisfy itself about the accuracy of the price movements and Telstra's compliance with the price movement cap for the first and second basket of services ...
On page 157 it further states:
Telstra has breached its price control obligations ...
and that:
This breach is central to the possibility of a more substantive breach of the 2002 determination in the 2002-03 price cap year, should there be no carry over from 2001-02.
Part of the problem is that Telstra is not complying with the ACCC methodology. According to the ACCC there is a disparity of views between the ACCC and Telstra in relation to the measurement of price movements. Clearly, Telstra needs to be pulled into line. The ACCC report shows that the government has a lot of regulatory issues to sort out before it can convince Telstra's customers—the Australian public—that the pricing and regulatory system is fixed, full privatisation can proceed and an out-of-control corporate gorilla can be created.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2003-08-19,"—I wish to take the opportunity tonight to say something about the ethanol industry, which of course has had considerable publicity in the last couple of weeks. I want to make the point that our coalition government is in the business of working in partnership with communities and shows a particular interest in the development of an activity and business that will encourage growth in regional areas—and that is the ethanol industry. One of the ways in which the government has sought to do this is by backing a home-grown industry which, if expanded, has the potential to create employment growth, increased productivity in rural areas and a renewable biofuel which will be of great value to all Australians.
I am greatly surprised that the ethanol industry has not gained bipartisan support. You might expect opportunism from the Greens, but you would hope that it would not come from the alternative government. Labor has shown a complete lack of understanding of regional affairs and a complete lack of regard for the ethanol industry. Instead, it has concentrated its efforts on scoring cheap political points by trying, firstly, to embarrass the Prime Minister—who is in favour of an expanded Australian ethanol industry and increasing development in rural and regional areas—and, secondly, to attack the main player at present, which is the Manildra Group. The Manildra Group is based at Manildra in the central west of New South Wales and is a very large employer. At this time it purchases around one million tonnes of grain each year, so it is a very important player in the grain market.
There are a number of benefits in producing and using ethanol petrol in Australia. Firstly, from a production point of view, ethanol is a renewable energy source that is produced from sources such as sugarcane, wheat and barley—crops that Australia produces very well. These crops are the lifeblood of Australian agriculture, and an expanded ethanol industry would provide an additional alternative market for grain and crop producers. I might say a little bit more about this in a minute, but the US experience shows the advantages of having one extra choice for producers of those grains. Market opportunities are improved substantially if ethanol production is in place.
There are plans for two major ethanol plants in my home region, which is northern New South Wales, at Gunnedah and Quirindi. These two projects combined would provide a massive injection of good into our local regional economy. At Gunnedah the proposed $55 million plant, if it goes ahead, would provide 150 jobs during construction and around 34 permanent positions. It is estimated that the production of 120 megalitres of ethanol at Gunnedah would lead to spending in the north-west of about $1 billion during the initial five years of operation. At Quirindi, Symgrain, a branch of the Research Foundation Institute, has a proposal to develop an ethanol plant based on new processing designs utilising higher contents of starched wheats. Initially, the plant would see production of 60 megalitres of ethanol per annum, with an eventual increase to 100 megalitres. One hundred and forty jobs would be created during the construction phase, with an additional 300 jobs envisaged once the plant is operational. It has been estimated that the plant will provide a $30 million regional injection, mostly in new farm incomes. Even if both these plants were established in the same region, neither would intrude on each other, as both would use different processing and import methods and, possibly, different grains.
The second reason an expansion of the ethanol industry in Australia should be encouraged is that such biofuels offer greenhouse, air quality and regional benefits while reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels. The use of these renewable fuel alternatives will reduce our dependence on both domestic and overseas oil resources. The advantages are very obvious. The use of ethanol blends can reduce emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and other ozone pollution problems. Ethanol is low in reactivity and high in oxygen content. It is for this reason that the ethanol industry in certain states of America was first encouraged by state governments, and they of course have mandated a 10 per cent ethanol petrol blend.
This has certainly had an impact in Minnesota. It is quite extraordinary. Minnesota is a small state that is very much dependent on agriculture. In the 12 years or so since assistance was provided to the ethanol industry in that state, ethanol production has gone from 11 million gallons to 300 million gallons, according to the figures for 1990-2002. Ethanol consumption in fuel has gone from 30 million gallons to 240 million gallons. Ethanol production provides nearly 3,000 jobs in the state of Minnesota and has an economic input to local communities of around $A900 million, which certainly would not include the amount of money involved in the purchase of the grains used in ethanol production.
The coalition government has put in place a comprehensive strategy to support the production and the use of biofuels in Australia. The National Party are strong supporters of the ethanol industry and its further development, and our leader, John Anderson, has shown that he will certainly go in to bat as hard as he can for the industry. In May 2002, the coalition government announced a $5 million two-year study to address market barriers to the increased use of ethanol in fuel. In the same month, BP commenced a trial selling E10 fuel from six Brisbane service stations. In April 2003, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, David Kemp, announced that the coalition government would move to set a 10 per cent maximum limit on ethanol content in petrol and that the labelling of ethanol blends at the pump was mandatory. This was an attempt to build confidence in the community, which had become necessary because of the misguided and inaccurate comments of some of the oil producers and other misguided groups in the community with a particular agenda that they wished to push. It is very disappointing that it was necessary to do that.
On 25 July 2003, the coalition government announced its decision to allocate $37 million to fund one-off capital subsidies for projects that provide new or expanded biofuels capacity. The subsidy will provide 16c per litre to new or expanded projects producing a minimum of five million litres of biofuel, with a maximum grant of $10 million per project. This is in addition to the existing production subsidy for biofuels, equivalent to 38c per litre which will be available to the industry until 30 June 2008. The ethanol industry will then be brought back into the tax net, which is a good thing. They should be provided with assistance to get their industry up and running, but eventually they must come back into the tax net and that is what is going to happen. Also in July 2003, the coalition government announced its decision to provide short-term assistance to all existing fuel ethanol producers to assist in the transition to the recently announced E10 standard to allow the current production subsidy to be paid in advance of the payment of excise.
The coalition government will also work actively with the ethanol industry to restore consumer confidence in using ethanol in fuel because it is in Australia's best interests. The ethanol industry is really a win-win situation. I cannot for the life of me understand why our political opponents are being so vexatious and difficult about it because it is very good for Australia. Labor have shown a distinct lack of interest in supporting the ethanol industry and therefore in supporting growth and development in rural and regional Australia. Labor have been responsible for scaremongering amongst the public that ethanol in petrol will damage cars, which has been found to be untrue when capped to the small percentage of 10 per cent. Labor have done what they can to damage the ethanol industry in their recent attacks upon the Prime Minister's credibility, which have been purely politically motivated and certainly not in the interests of growth in the community. This is a great industry. It should be encouraged. It is in Australia's best interests for it to succeed, and I am very pleased that the industry is looking to expand in my part of New South Wales because it will provide a lot of jobs, a lot of growth and extra markets for grain producers who need that assistance.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Fuel: Ethanol</title>,Adjournment,21,1,speech
