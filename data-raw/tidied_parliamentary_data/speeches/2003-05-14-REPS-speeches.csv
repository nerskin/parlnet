"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—As was said yesterday by Julia Gillard, the shadow minister for this portfolio area, this migration legislation is part of the government's agenda of belting double-dissolution triggers through this parliament. Mr Speaker, you will recall that I last debated this legislation in June last year.
—It doesn't have to be tricky. You can support us.
—Unlikely. I go back to a comment I made then in concluding my remarks. I referred to an article by Mungo MacCallum in the Sydney Morning Herald of the previous week. That article referred, initially at least, to the government's excisions of the Christmas and Cocos islands. I will quote it again because I think it encapsulates the nature of this legislation and what it is about. It states:
But of course it was more than that; it was a tactical retreat: an admission that we could not protect our territorial boundaries even against a few leaky fishing boats, let alone against any serious invader. The decision by Howard and his fellow diminishers Alexander Downer and Philip Ruddock to star in their own version of “Honey, I Shrunk the Borders” should have been seen not as a clever political ploy, but as a serious defensive weakness.
And now, with the move to cut out every island to the north and west of the continent because of a report that a single extra boat containing perhaps three dozen Vietnamese is on its way, the initial retreat has become an undisguised rout. In the best traditions of those other great war leaders Jubilation T. Cornpone and the Duke of Plaza Toro, our gallant triumvirate has simply relinquished the field.
That is not a bad encapsulation of this debate in terms of where the government's position is. As a result of contributions that have been made already, we know that the government's participation in this Pacific solution over a number of months has been obscenely expensive. In my view, it has been a cause for concern regarding our relationships with our neighbours. We have obligated our defence forces in the use of a frigate to patrol off Christmas Island at a cost, I understand, of around $1 million a day. We are deploying a very important naval asset to do potential boardings and thus far—and the minister has been expressing this view for some time—we have had no visitation. As a result, the minister claims that his border protection policy is a success. If it is a success, you have to ask why it is that we are deploying this particularly important defence asset in this manner; and why it is that in deploying defence assets we are actually using Army personnel as boarding parties for these vessels. These are Army personnel who, in the main, are from infantry battalions. In some cases, they are deployed out of the Northern Territory from 57 at Robertson Barracks to Christmas Island and then onto this vessel, where they sit and wait for we know not what. 
The bill proposes to excise from the Australian migration zone more than 3,000 islands that are part of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. Under the provisions of the bill, unauthorised arrivals who reach these excised islands will not be covered by the provisions of the Migration Act that deal with processing asylum claims. The bill intends to make unauthorised maritime journeys to Australia less attractive to those seeking asylum from persecution.
I am not sure that the claims of the government can be supported. We have here a situation where the government is proposing to excise islands that in many instances are simply a few kilometres from the mainland. The Tiwi islands Melville and Bathurst in my own electorate are home to over 2,000 Tiwi people. It takes just 20 minutes by light aircraft to get to these islands from Darwin. On a clear day they can be seen from the beaches of the northern suburbs. Yet under this legislation these communities will be excised. The same is true of other islands around the Northern Territory coast.
—The communities aren't excised; the islands are excised.
—Minister, the member for Lingiari has the call.
—I am happy to be corrected by the minister because all he does is confirm the stupidity of this arrangement. What I have put for the Tiwi islands and people goes for other islands and their communities around the coast of Arhem Land and into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Are we to believe, as the minister would have us believe, that people seeking to flee from oppression, torture and persecution, people who have sold all they have and who have risked their lives on barely seaworthy vessels, will stop at these islands within sight of the mainland and then simply give up?
I will not repeat my contribution of June last year, but I went through and summarised the landings on the Australian mainland from the central coast of New South Wales to the central coast of Western Australia. Very few of those landings at all had been made on the islands which the government now is seeking to excise. In his second reading speech to the bill to this parliament last year, the minister put forward this absurd suggestion:
The intelligence that we are gathering suggests that smugglers are now changing their tactics, not necessarily to target the mainland but to bypass the mainland on the way to New Zealand.
If this change in tactics is correct and these people are heading for New Zealand, it seems to me rather bizarre that we would be excising these islands which are particularly close to the Australian mainland. As I say, if you are looking for replenishment of supplies and you are floating around the north Australian coast within sight of the main-land, my guess is that that is where you would land. 
I hear no proposal from the government—in fact, if my memory serves me correctly, the minister has excluded this proposition—that they could potentially excise areas of the Australian mainland from the migration zone. After all, the bulk of the landings of these vessels have been on the mainland. It seems to me quite possible that the government might put forward in this parliament, at some point down the line, a ridiculous proposal to excise areas of the Arnhem Land coast, for example, or the Kimberley coast, the coast of North Queensland or the coastal areas within the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Submissions to the Senate inquiry which examined and rejected the need for this bill reveal how disingenuous the government's position has been. The Acting Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Ed Killesteyn, told the inquiry that this bill would encourage boats to try to reach the mainland—which supports my view. When he was asked how the bill would make it harder for people smugglers to escape detection, he said:
It is a simple matter of geography. If you remove the outlying islands from the capacity of smugglers to simply drop off their cargo, they are forced to look for other routes that will invariably bring them closer to Australia.
Those are the words of the minister's own departmental acting secretary. This bill, if enacted, will force people smugglers to bring asylum seekers closer to Australia. One can only assume that this is the advice which was given to the minister and the government. As we heard yesterday, and it bears repeating, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mick Keelty, went further by saying that it would be better to have people arrive on the mainland. He told the inquiry on 6 August last year:
This is a far preferable way for us to go, instead of having them left on a remote island.
When asked whether this legislation would result in increased arrivals of asylum seekers on the Australian mainland, he said:
Yes ... The whole object is to force people to come to Australia through the correct procedures but, if they are going to commit a crime in the way they are sending people to Australia, we can at least try to get them sent to where there is some infrastructure support for them. 
It is clear that this legislation will not do what the government says it will do; we only have to ask the government's own advisers for evidence of this. It will simply drive the smugglers into the mainland and strip back the government's responsibilities to protect excised communities. I am very concerned by how far the government will go to absolve itself of this responsibility. We gained some insight into that last year when, on the weekend of 14 December, the government secretly excised four islands off the coast of Western Australia, showing their utter contempt for this parliament in the process. The minister made the decision to excise the four islands—Bernier, Dorre, Faure and Dirk Hartog—without parliamentary consent, following reports of a boat in the area. As it happened, the boat was nothing more than a fishing vessel. 
What was truly outrageous about this particular act was that it happened just one week—one week only—after the Senate rejected the government's attempt to remove more than 3,000 islands from the migration zone. That is the regard in which this government and the minister hold this parliament. The absolute contempt shown by the minister in that instance is mirrored by the government's contempt for the advice they have received on the most appropriate way to deal with this problem. This action begs the question: if the government can be spooked by a fishing boat into divesting themselves of territory, what will happen when a smuggler's boat approaches the coast of Northern Australia? As I said, it is very clear that there is a potential when this threat emerges—if it ever does again—for the government to simply say, `We will need to excise parts of the mainland.'  
I want to go to some issues to do with the way in which the government has treated people on the excised islands. In particular I want to go to the question of Christmas Island, and then, if time permits, I want to go to an important matter to do with the Cocos Islands. I accompanied the minister to Christmas Island as he informed—not consulted—the island community about a proposal to build a reception facility on Christmas Island. The minister will say that he consulted, but there is one way to consult and it is a two-way process: `This is what we would like to do; what do you think?' That is not what happened. He said, `This is what we are doing; what do you think?' In any event, I have to say that the community of Christmas Island was supportive of the proposal. But there was very little, if any, consultation with the island community over the nature of that facility, and the government made very little effort to have informed discussions with the community members about it.
You will recall, Mr Speaker, that the original proposal was to develop a facility of 1,200 beds on Christmas Island. Some groundwork had been done on the site, which I visited on a number of occasions. The government had delayed the construction without explanation; indeed, in my view they misinformed the parliament through their agencies about why the delays were caused. They claimed that there were voids beneath the surface of the earth where they were doing the clearings. I spoke to the construction people and the engineers and, in fact, there were no such voids. It was merely an excuse because of the delay which had been caused by indecision by the government in terms of how they might proceed with the project. On 19 February this year, after having delayed the construction, the government terminated the contract. The Christmas Island residents were not told about this; they had to learn about it themselves. That same afternoon the government announced a proposal to retender for the construction of a scaled-down centre—reduced in size from a planned 1,200-bed facility to 800-bed facility. To this point, no tender has been let.
I note a government press release in the last day or so indicating their appointment of a project manager. The fact is that people on Christmas Island, at the invitation of the minister and the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, geared up because they were requested to gear up for the benefits that the construction of this facility would bring to the Christmas Island community. I know businessmen on Christmas Island who invested heavily—to the tune of millions of dollars. They brought equipment onto Christmas Island in preparation of their involvement in this project, as they were invited to do by the government. In February this year they learned that the contract had been terminated. They have incurred substantial losses as a direct result of the decision-making processes and the absolute failure of this government to live up to the commitments they made to the Christmas Island community—never mind the fact that there was little or no consultation. Now, of course, despite the heightened expectations that were built up as a result of the minister's visit last year about the potential of this construction, the local economy has dived. People are out of work and some are having great difficulties.
I will read from a letter to the editor in the March issue of the Shire of Christmas Island news,written by a local resident, Paul McCallum. The letter says: 
At the last auction of Christmas Island properties ... every single property was passed in despite some frantic early bidding. For the long-term, long suffering and somewhat ... cynical attendees at the auction, it was probably a predictable outcome, given the timing ... in the aftermath of Minister Tuckey's soul-destroying statement relating to the government's cancellation of the detention facility at North West Point.
This sums up the views of the people of Christmas Island. I want to quickly go to the issue of the Cocos Islands. The minister at the table, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, will recall the use of the quarantine facility on the Cocos Islands as an interim reception facility. Prior to the requirement by the minister and his department to use this particular facility, it had been arranged for it to be dealt with by DOTARS, the department responsible. The minister then said that his department required the use of this land. They no longer require the use of this land. 
In a meeting of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories in the parliament this week, on Monday 12 May, witnesses from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service told us, in a response to a question on whose books this asset was retained, that it was one of their assets but it had no book value; its value had been written off. This land—which covers a substantial area, 30 acres, and comprises paddocks, administration buildings, housing and laboratories—was initially scheduled to be sold by the government in 2000. I request of the minister and I ask him to convey this to his colleague minister that, because of the scarcity of land on the Cocos Islands, this land be divested from the Commonwealth and be transferred to the control of the Cocos Island Shire Council for their use, as an asset for them. This would show the government's good faith in this community, which in many respects it has exploited by bringing it along the road of expecting certain things to happen and then not doing them. It is very important that the government accept its responsibility to the Christmas and Cocos island communities, that it fulfil the promises it made to the people of Christmas Island and that it seek to transfer this facility at no cost to the Cocos Island community. This asset has no book value to the Quarantine and Inspection Service. It could be transferred at no cost to the Cocos Island Shire Council so that they can use it as an asset for themselves, to be developed for the purpose of the Cocos Island community. ",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—The Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] is simply a token effort by this government to make it look tough on the issue of border protection. But, frankly, it is nothing more than window-dressing—and window-dressing that causes unnecessary distress rather than comfort to those Australians who live on those parts of our great country, which the government would seek to have excised from it.
I represent an electorate which itself is part of an island, but also one which includes a number of what the minister would no doubt describe as offshore islands—assuming that he does not also regard Tasmania as falling within that category. Flinders and Cape Barren islands are two of this country's larger offshore islands. They are both inhabited by proud Australians, whom I am sure feel very much part of this country. I am sure that the citizens of the Coral Sea Islands Territory, the islands forming part of Queensland and north of latitude 12 degrees south, those forming part of Western Australia and north of latitude 23 degrees south and those forming part of the Northern Territory and north of latitude 16 degrees south, feel exactly the same way. To have their places of residence excised from the rest of Australia for government propaganda purposes is an insult to them. This is all about this government attempting to be seen as doing something about border protection, with a little political motivation on the side. 
In his second reading speech, Minister Ruddock described the disallowance of the regulations, which this bill seeks to replace, and the defeat of the bill itself when it was first presented as being an extraordinary outcome. His rationale was that the opposition was thereby undermining legislation that we had supported in 2001 to fight people-smuggling. We, on this side of the House, are absolutely serious about ensuring that people smugglers do not prosper or succeed in any way. But we would seek to do this by effective initiatives, which bite at the heart of those operations—not by trying to trick the Australian people that we are doing something by a shambolic excision of some parts of the country. This legislation will achieve nothing but heartache—heartache for those Australians who live in those parts of Australia sought to be lopped off by the government and heartache for the victims of the people smugglers, if they were to be landed at any of these places.
The only thing this legislation would do is to remove the right of any person landing on any of these islands to apply for a visa under the laws of this country. We would still have to face the issue of what to do with the arrivals, an issue with which, in the eyes of much of the rest of the world and many Australians, we have not dealt well.
In his speech the minister said:
We must have the capacity to manage our borders and ensure that our sovereignty is not put at risk by opportunistic people smugglers.
We on this side on the House do not dispute that for one minute, but where we differ from the government is on how we would do it. The action proposed by this bill, as I have said, is just lip-service and window-dressing. It will not make the slightest dint on those who would try to breach our sovereignty; it would create the smallest blip on the radar of the people smugglers. The only way in which we can achieve effective management and protection of our borders is through a comprehensive plan. As on so many other issues, the government is so intent on trying to dupe the people of Australia into believing that it is tough on this or acting on that that it drops the ball when actually doing things which will have some impact or effect. In his speech, the minister again continued with the spin. He said:
Expansion of the excised offshore places by this bill sends a very strong message to people smugglers that, while Australia has commitments elsewhere, we have not been distracted from protecting Australia's borders. We remain alert and prepared to move quickly to take measures to counter their operations.
This bill does absolutely none of that. If the people smugglers want to dump their hapless cargo on any one of those islands, they will still do so. Before we can get to them they will have already ripped off their clients and be long gone. The people on those boats would have no idea whether they were being landed at an excised island, an unexcised island or on the mainland of Australia. People smugglers are ruthless characters with no morals. They do not care where they land the people from their boats, so long as they get their money. The minister could not be further from the mark. The government is clearly distracted from doing anything effective about protecting our borders, just as it is from providing proper services to the Australian people on a daily basis. The government is far from alert. If this is the primary example of its measures to counter the operations of the people smugglers, it is alarming and it is a disgrace. 
Since the last election, only the people on this side of the House have put forward an effective and workable program, not only to counter the people smugglers but to comprehensively protect our borders. Excising any number of parts of this country on paper will do little in real terms to halt the people smugglers and protect our borders. What would make an impact would be a properly trained and equipped coastguard. This country has more than 37,000 kilometres of coastline but is without any effective form of maritime policing. It is no wonder that the people smugglers have found a nice little earner. Compounding the problem for this nation is the fact that Indonesia, with its myriad islands, has no such capacity either. We are open to the operations of the unscrupulous, whether it be by way of people-smuggling, illegal fishing, gun running or drug running. And this government's solution is a paper excision of our offshore islands to the north. They cannot be serious. Certainly we in Tassie are hoping that the minister does not have another rush of blood to the head and we find ourselves so excised.
Because we are living in an uncertain international security environment and because the threat of terrorism is real, we need a comprehensive strategy that will provide real protection for the Australian people. Our existing border protection system, as evidenced by the government's perceived need to do something about it—albeit something totally inadequate—is ineffective and inefficient. It leaves Australia's borders wide open to the worst of international crime. To effectively protect Australia's borders and cut the people smugglers off at the knees, we need better capability, specialist personnel, trained and informed volunteer efforts and the best use of national intelligence. 
On this side of the House, we believe that this can be best achieved by an Australian coastguard. We will not be able to tackle the people smugglers with a piece of legislation designed simply to scare them off—which, if it did have any effect, would probably only redirect them and their passengers to some part of the mainland. We would provide purpose-built ships, with effective capability for surveillance and interdiction duties. These would be more effective and less expensive to operate in protecting all of Australia, including our more remote Indian Ocean territories such as Christmas Island. We would ensure that they were staffed by trained personnel specialising in maritime policing. Royal Australian Navy and Australian Customs Service vessels and personnel would continue to play support and complementary roles, enhanced by the posting on board of specialised coastguard personnel. 
Far more effective than a paper excision would be the training and engagement of a nationwide team of coastguard volunteers—a major civilian effort which is crucial to the protection of our borders. We also need to develop a coastguard volunteer vessel program. Fishing vessel owners and other operators should be given incentives and opportunities to play a role in protecting our borders and their fellow Australians. At the same time, it would give us a chance to address other issues, such as maritime safety generally, pollution, and search and rescue. These would be serious attempts to do something about protecting our borders, whilst at the same time providing numerous other benefits and services to the Australian people.
But the government instead looks elsewhere: to legislation such as this—legislation that will do nothing to really address the problem. It is a cynical exercise, firstly, to try to dupe the Australian people into thinking it is doing something and, secondly, for purely political purposes. We on this side of the House remain absolutely serious about protecting our borders and we have put before the Australian people a viable and effective strategy to do exactly that. Our strategy is not a stab in the dark or a pie-in-the-sky approach. The existing structure of border protection, surveillance and enforcement is flawed. The basic organisational structure is weak and other aspects of government policy distort its effectiveness. Our approach is achievable and would make a difference. The specialist personnel and volunteers could be trained at the Australian Maritime College in Launceston and, as the minister will discover when he visits the Australian Maritime College soon, the college has significant capacity to properly prepare those who can effectively police and protect our borders. This would also significantly assist their survival attempts as they now struggle under some visa restrictions. The college already trains patrol boat personnel and can readily accept a brief to provide training in maritime policing, border protection and intelligence liaison. This training can be provided to both full-time and volunteer personnel. 
Self-reliance, independence and community security are qualities and values which the people of Australian hold dear. They are very much embodied in a program which would provide us with an effective coastguard. We need leadership on these issues. What we do not need is token, politically motivated legislation which does nothing to effectively address an issue which the Australian people have indicated is clearly of great importance to it—the protection and sovereignty of our borders. If this bill is passed, it will achieve nothing and will most likely simply open the way for the government to bring forward further legislation and regulations to excise more and more offshore islands—perhaps, as I have said, even the whole of Tasmania. It seems that this is all that this government can come up with to protect our borders. I urge this House and those in the other place to deal with this legislation with the disdain it deserves.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—At the commencement of this debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2], I am delighted to be speaking in the House when the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the shadow minister are both present. It shows a great respect for the parliament that both the government and opposition spokespersons on this issue have seen fit to be present. It is not always the case.
This debate comes not at the beginning of events when we can only peer into a glass with uncertainty as to the future but after a long period when we know too well the impact and effect of some of the policies that have been pursued by this government. Some of the things I am going to say will sound harsh. I certainly do not wish to impute any wrongful moral attributes to the minister at the table, but I do say very firmly that the way in which this government has handled the plight of those who have sought refuge in Australia does stand as a stain on our nation's character.
There are always events that are particularly prominent in political life to which people do tend to overreact. If ever there was a circumstance in which the long-term respect that Australians hold themselves in was damaged, I think it was the events that happened in the Tampa crisis, so well accounted for in David Marr's and Marian Wilkinson's book DarkVictory. What that leads to is a circumstance in which we realise that the political manipulation of Australian domestic opinion was far more important than the objective circumstances, the welfare interests of those who were at risk on the high seas, the danger that they faced—indeed, the danger that Australians faced in dealing with those situations—and the long-term self-respect that we as Australians ought to be able to have. 
That situation has been compounded by the manner in which detention centres have been run in Australia and by the harshness and apparent indifference of government spokespersons to the care and welfare of those who find themselves in detention—persons not accused of crimes but being assessed in relation to the claims they have made legitimately under international conventions for protection under agreements that Australia has voluntarily entered into and which Australia has not renounced.
Where do we start this debate from? We start it from a very troubled past and we start it in the knowledge that this government has been prepared to say or do virtually anything in order to persuade the Australian public that it faces an imminent threat of a dimension that requires draconian, harsh and unconscionable measures directed at those who come to seek protection under international conventions that we have entered into. We start the debate knowing that, as a consequence of that action, many of those persons have suffered from deep psychological impacts. 
In starting this out, the shadow minister very properly referred to the study conducted by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and the report of Zachary Steel, which pointed out that they could not find anywhere in the medical literature of the world a cohort of children as distressed as that group. However, there is also substantial literature that says that the rate of mental and psychiatric illness being attributed to those who actually have to serve as staff in detention and processing centres is higher than the norm. In other words, this is not only affecting the mental health of the children and adults who are being processed in this quite unacceptable way but also damaging the people who are being placed by this Australian government into the circumstances of dealing with people in such an inhumane way.
That is not surprising. If you put people into circumstances where you compel them to treat people as numbers, where you compel them to act in ways in which no other Australian would act towards another human being, then it is not surprising that some of those staff manifest difficulties with sleep and difficulties in terms of their own psychiatric wellbeing. I suspect it is an ongoing issue that this government will have to deal with in terms of occupational health and safety issues, and it is certainly an issue that I know those who represent those workers in the union movement are increasingly concerned about.
The excision of offshore territories is really, as the shadow minister said, simply a device to continue an ugly and unedifying debate that the government rode to office on at the last election. It is pointless to complain about the endpoint of an electoral contest which one loses, but it is important after you have let the dust settle to realise that in political contests domestically there are some tactics which are unacceptable, some consequences which are plainly wrong and immoral, and judgments have to be made irrespective of those electoral outcomes. We know that the Pacific solution is simply unsustainable: it is unsustainable in terms of its cost; it is unsustainable in terms of its morality; it is unsustainable as a matter of international law; and it is unsustainable in the end in the kind of damage it will do to the Pacific island nations that have been traduced into assisting in this area.
Let us take two examples. The two countries where people have been made subject to the so-called Pacific solution are Papua New Guinea and Nauru. What long-term consequences does this have for Australia's foreign policy? The truth is, we have essentially intruded into a domestic political situation for short-term Australian political gains for the government of the day but with complete indifference to the long-term interests of the domestic political arrangements in those countries. I instance, for example, that the offer of funding that was associated with the offer of the Australian government to the government of Papua New Guinea led to its initial rejection by the foreign minister of Papua New Guinea. Further pressure was applied by the Australian government. That foreign minister was dismissed. 
The current government of Papua New Guinea has enabled the detention facility on Manus to remain, but it is deeply unhappy about the presence of that facility and it has indicated that it does not wish to extend it beyond a period which could be negotiated diplomatically with the Australian government. Within the domestic political framework of Papua New Guinea we are ignoring the very real questions that ought to go to the long-term relationship between our two countries. Australian foreign policy has been grossly inept in its relationships with Papua New Guinea—as it has, broadly, with the countries of the South Pacific region. Those are countries for which we are the superpower. It is one of the areas where we really matter in international affairs.
Let us also look at the level to which our relationship with Nauru has been reduced. Instead of dealing with a government that is essentially corrupt, a government which has been plunged into crisis after crisis and which has been associated with money-laundering and a whole range of problems, and instead of putting in place long-term strategic support for reform and trying to engender a good long-term framework for relationships between the peoples of that small island state and the people of Australia, we now have a detention facility on the island, which is essentially run out of control and which the shadow minister has described as `self-managed'.
`Self-managed' is a very polite term for what may be happening. Let me be blunt about this. In practice, the decision of whether or not people can go to Nauru is being managed by Australia. Lawyers who would represent those on Nauru in relation to matters they wish to pursue are routinely being denied visas on the advice of the Australian government rather than by any independent decision of the government of Nauru. So, essentially, we have something of the nature of an Australian Guantanamo Bay, with people being held in detention without access to lawyers and with no opportunity for independent verification of their circumstances, and in a circumstance where the governing authority of Nauru is essentially self-destructing. I do not think `self-managed' is the proper description for it. Rather, it is a regime which is breaking down and which is unknowable because of the veil of secrecy around it.
These are all difficult circumstances. In Papua New Guinea, legal proceedings are being pursued at the moment under the constitution of that government seeking declarations that the detention of persons in the facility in Nauru is illegal under the laws of Papua New Guinea. What the outcome of that will be is, of course, a matter for future determination by the courts of that country. But let us consider the pressure that the Australian government put on them to establish that regime. It is a regime that, on its face, seems plainly contrary to the constitution of Papua New Guinea, which prohibits the detention of any person unless they have been charged with a crime or certain limited circumstances provided for in the constitution apply. We seem to be pressing our neighbouring countries into circumstances that are simply unacceptable. 
Those arrangements cannot continue. They will not continue, and the government knows they will not continue. The government still presses ahead with this legislation because it thinks that there is a residual sting in the tail of the debate that they commenced with the Tampa issue that they can still exploit. We on this side of the House do not fall for that and we reject it. It is futile to pretend that there is absolute unanimity on this side of the House about how much the regime should be changed in response to universal recognition on this side of the House that we need to make very great changes. All I would do in this speech is commend the minister—sorry, commend the shadow minister—
—Thank you.
—The minister takes his bows too early. I commend the shadow minister for a very substantial advance by way of policy, to which our party has committed in its caucus resolution. That policy would end the detention of children behind razor wire, lift the shroud of secrecy around detention centres, speed up the processing regime, and create an independent Inspector-General of Detention to monitor conditions and resolve complaints. I think it would certainly make a very substantial difference—one that would mean that Australians would no longer feel the shame of being placed in the position of trying to explain how an otherwise civilised society such as Australia could behave in a way that is so unaccountably uncivilised.
Of course, when you have a policy of this kind—which is, essentially, beyond explanation—you must dehumanise those you are treating in such a way. So we have a whole range of measures to maintain secrecy, keep people isolated from the media and prevent their names from being published in court proceedings—all the trivial dehumanising matters that enable us to treat these human beings as though they are mere ciphers. Again, we are very selective in this. The dehumanisation relates to people who arrive by boat seeking refuge in this country. Far greater numbers of people arriving in an unauthorised way in Australia and then pursuing claims for asylum actually arrive by air. We do not dehumanise those people, treat them in a way that compels their detention, lock them up behind razor wire or subject them to circumstances in which their children are rendered psychologically damaged. Instead, we focus on the other group of people and dehumanise them, demonise them, demonise those associated with their advocacy and give no credence to those who express concerns about them. We do all this while essentially turning a blind eye to the larger issue—including the larger security issue—that is represented by air arrivals.
The idea that a terrorist would choose to come to Australia on a leaky boat as a first order preference rather than arrive by air is so absurd as to hardly require more than the statement of it. Indeed, the government has produced no evidence at all to suggest that that is the case, yet the rhetoric flows from such a premise.
There are increasing numbers of allegations being made about continuing mistreatment in detention centres. I do not know the truth of these, but I receive emails routinely. Minister, I received a representation alleging that there are hooks in the cell wall, about two metres above the ground, where people are being handcuffed with arms extended above their heads. I do not know whether that is true, but the problem is that there is no independent internal examination of those matters.
We have allegations of staff of the facilities crushing tablets to aggravate detainees, despite medical advice not to do so. We have reports in the courts of breakdowns between the Australian Federal Police and the Australian DPP, whereby people charged with bashing detainees have not been pursued effectively. We have people routinely being deported from Australia in instances where they may either be victims of, or be knowledgeable of, sexual abuse. In some instances, they may have been prostitutes, brought willingly or unwillingly, and are removed before those matters can be pursued effectively by the police. We also have allegations of instances where staff who have been dismissed for mistreatment of detainees have been rehired. 
I have all of those allegations in front of me, but I do not want to mention names because it may be quite unfair. But the point I make is that when we have a regime of secrecy and, as Marian Wilkinson and David Marr establish in Dark Victory, a government that is prepared to lie in relation to these matters, to hide the facts and to not admit to circumstances which are manifestly true, it becomes very hard to accept on face value bare denials. 
When reports from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, which deal with very real allegations that were made, and recommendations made by an independent body charged with that responsibility are being dismissed by you, Minister, as not being properly established, it leads to us saying that, in order to ensure that the community does not believe that people are going to be subject to that kind of abuse, we need to have, as the shadow minister has suggested, an independent inspector-general. We know that children have been severely damaged, we know that there has been psychological damage and we know that there have been a lot of instances of self-harm. The idea that these are things that can be discounted and treated as if they were happening to inanimate objects or things is quite reprehensible. These are standing reprimands to our own self-worth.
Another problem that we have is that we do not have a release process properly established for those who cannot be returned. Minister, you know it is a problem, I know it is a problem and the shadow minister knows it is a problem. Putting your head in the sand and blaming the courts for not allowing the indefinite detention of persons who cannot be returned is a crude and morally wrong approach and it is quite unjustified.
Finally, I do believe that we need to go further than the position that Labor has articulated. It is no secret that I would wish the end of the excision of Christmas Island and a single processing regime. It is no secret that I would wish that temporary protection visas be limited to a period of one year. And it is no secret that I think that the language of mandatory detention is inappropriate. I think the substance of what the shadow minister is saying is to be commended, but I do not think there is any proper basis for continuing that language. But, those points aside, I commend the shadow minister, who I believe has done a very good job in improving our standing in the world.

"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I actually do believe in mandatory detention. It was a Labor government that brought it in in 1993, it was a Labor government that sought to protect Australia's borders, and it was a Labor government that ensured throughout the three years that mandatory detention was in place that Australia's borders were protected. It was also the case that the Labor government, over more than a decade and a half, was attacked on very key questions on how Australia's borders were being protected and on the immigration program by a Liberal opposition which absolutely distorted the fundamental realities about how that Labor government ran its immigration program. 
The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs knows full well that we did have a tough and uncompromising immigration policy whilst Labor was in government. The minister knows full well that there were variations of degree with which former Labor immigration ministers pressed their foot to the floor in terms of the way in which they described what was happening, but the minister also knows full well that Australia's borders were protected. 
When we had an influx of 3,000 people coming from the lower parts of southern China—the Fujian Province, I think—the Australian Labor Party in government acted quickly and sensibly and, with Nick Bolkus as minister, sealed up that problem by adopting a multilevel approach. It was not a unilateral approach; it was actually an approach involving the government of China, the provincial government and Australia—not only the cabinet but also the people in the immigration department whose task it was to sort it out.
One of the people who sorted it out was a former regional manager from the Bankstown office—which unfortunately, Minister, of course no longer exists because your government closed it. That office served the people of Bankstown well. As would be known, I have a high immigration impact electorate. The people of Bankstown are now forced to travel to Parramatta, to the city or to Rockdale—although Rockdale may have been knocked over as well—when that area is impacted on the greatest by immigration policies. But we also face the situation where people not only cannot get adequate local recourse but also cannot get a straight-up view of what the past history has been in relation to the way in which governments, both Labor and Liberal, have approached the problem of dealing with people coming in illegally.
We had an influx of 3,000 people. What we did was ensure that a person of the quality of Joe Rodigari moved on from being a regional manager at Bankstown to running enforcement in New South Wales. He dramatically increased the capture of people who were here illegally and shipped them overseas. Because of his expertise, he was moved on to lead the task force that was involved, particularly in Western Australia, in dealing with the influx from China. It was through a process of discussion and agreement making and by Australia being willing to put the money up to ship these people back that we sealed off the influx from southern China. People from southern China still find their way into Canada and the United States, but Australia effectively dealt at regional, provincial and national government levels in China to stop what could have been a major problem.
Under Labor, we had an influx of 3,000 people in 13 years. What do we have with this government?—11,500 in 2½ years. The major crisis that developed with people illegally coming to Australia was a crisis engendered against this conservative government. I am not sure whether I spoke on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] last time, so I have taken the opportunity to participate in the debate today. But I have spoken on other measures, including the transitional bill that was previously before the House. I may still be waiting for an answer to the question of whether or not that transitional bill was a vehicle for all of those people who were originally held up at Christmas Island and who took their sojourn in Nauru and other places to enter Australia and, in fact, stay. We know, despite the admonitions of the Prime Minister and the minister at the time, that a healthy number of those people landed in Australia, because they had refugee claims that were accepted. Those admonitions, as we know, were that not one single person would either enter Australia or stay here. But we know they have, and I think they have stayed in their hundreds. 
At the time this so-called Pacific solution was introduced—it is no solution and never was a solution; it has only been an addition to budget costs and an additional cost in terms of the manner in which Australia is seen in the world—I argued that it provides no stronger protection of our borders than we had in the past. It is only a political fix for the government. It is time the government pulled the whole infrastructure to pieces. I have no problem whatsoever with the excision of Ashmore Reef and Christmas Island, given their proximity to Indonesia and given the ham-fisted manner in which this government dealt with Indonesia over East Timor. There were evident pressures on the Indonesian government due to the collapse of their economy and finances and, when that government was at its weakest, this Prime Minister put his foot down on its neck over East Timor. The surge of people through Indonesia coming as illegals to Australia was a direct result of that. It was payback for the manner in which this government put pressure on Indonesia at its time of greatest weakness. The minister knows that, but the Prime Minister may not know that. He may not have had it enter his consciousness that there could be a direct correlation between relations between Australia and Indonesia and the difficulties that Australia faces from illegal immigrants.
The minister has argued time and time again that the actions the government took in placing people on Manus Island and Nauru, as part of the so-called Pacific solution, added absolutely enormous costs to this budget. All he needed to do was to excise Ashmore Reef and Christmas Island and put up a facility. A facility is finally being constructed at Christmas Island and we have had other facilities constructed. That excision only needed to be there. It did not need to be what we have in front of us today—3,000 islands, some of which are 40 kilometres from the mainland. Tasmania is not included, but who knows? Later on it might get a guernsey. I do not see why you would not put the whole mainland into it and just say: `It is one job lot. This country is an excision zone for immigration purposes.' Why not do the lot? Why not say that it is possible to get people here? We are an island continent. If you are going to deal with an island that is 40 kilometres off the coast, why not include the lot? Why not say that for immigration purposes it is going to be dealt with in another way?
In a fundamental way, the drive by our shadow minister is to have the United Nations approach to dealing with these issues accepted globally so that there is a multilateral approach to this which all nations that are impacted upon adversely and all nations that could be part of creating the problem need to sign up to. The UNHCR approach to this could be made global and universal. In effect, you would then be excising the whole of continental Australia. One of our key problems is a question of differential treatment between those people who come by boat versus those people who come by air, including differences in how they might be treated and, far more importantly, in how their refugee claims are assessed at law. The key question in relation to the original excisions was: how do you create a different layered approach so that those who might seek to gain an advantage over the commonality of people applying from overseas might not have that?
When the minister originally proposed the excision of Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef and we accepted that, that key question needed to be addressed because of things that were happening at the time. I accepted that; that is my personal view. But how the government then went about creating storage areas in New Guinea, on Manus Island and in Nauru was, I think, absolutely reprehensible. It is no solution whatsoever in Australian budgetary terms and it is no solution to this problem. The minister well knows that, but he is under the hammer of the demands of his Prime Minister and the demands of his colleagues who have pressed this on and on. 
What we are faced with here is another political bill—as we had a political khaki budget last night—to place this issue on the running lines in the run-up to the next election. There is no safety for this country or its people in the provisions of this bill that add all of those extra islands to the excision zone. There is no fundamental safety either in maintaining those outlying areas where people are kept. A number of people—including the member for Denison—have alluded, in relation to the rather cute terminology of Nauru now being `self-managed', to the fact that the people who are inmates there have taken over and are running the shop. I do not think we should be too surprised about that. If we look at last night's budget and the self-management that is demanded in health, in education and indeed across the board, we will see that it is part of the government's way of doing things. So it may not be so extraordinary that they expect people to take up not just cost burdens but managerial burdens as well.
The core from which this comes is a total government failure to deal with the people-smuggling problem and its initial genesis in relations between Australia and Indonesia. The fact is that the Indonesian government chose to turn a blind eye, at the very minimum, to people travelling through to Australia and, at the maximum, absolutely assisted people to move through to Christmas Island or Ashmore Reef, creating a flood of illegal arrivals into Australia who utilised other means, including aircraft, to get into Indonesia initially but then launched into the boat method.
There is the question of how you deal with the different types of people coming into Australia illegally and the original excision of Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef. Then there is the question of the attempted political message from this and from what the government attempted to do previously when they first put these regulations in place—and they were in place for, I think, a total of seven days from about 7 January to 17 January before they got knocked on the head by the Senate. This bill seeks to put them back in place. Does the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs really believe that this would have a major practical effect in stopping people-smuggling? That is for the minister to answer. I expect, though, that fundamentally neither he nor the people in his department do. The larger purpose of this bill is to signal that the government will attempt to pump out the message that they are against people-smuggling and will do a tougher job than Labor.
The reality is that throughout its period in government Labor was tough on immigration, tough on people-smuggling and tough on controlling our borders—despite the fact that we had a spineless opposition which not only within this parliament but also throughout the community used immigration issues as a whip to beat the government with to try to undermine the picture people had of it. The lackeys of this current government—those lackeys in the media, Alan Jones and the rest of the crew, who poured battery acid year after year on Labor supporters in Western Sydney and used the question of Australia's immigration program as a weapon to flail the government with—knew absolutely that what they were doing was entirely misrepresenting the situation. 
The people who worked in the immigration department did their job whilst Labor was in government. They did not seek to deny border security or border control for Australia. They did not seek to walk away from their responsibility, as members of one of the then government's departments, to try to make sure that Australia was secure. No-one rightly experienced in this area could say that the people in the immigration department throughout the 13 years in which Labor was in power sought to weaken Australia's control of its borders or turn a blind eye to those problems. What we did in government we now propose to do, and to do even more of, when we come back to government. The shadow minister for immigration has proposed a long-term solution to the questions posed by this government.
There is no long-term solution in self-management in Nauru. There is no long-term solution in keeping people holed up on Manus Island. There is no long-term solution in keeping a facade which was built around the fact that this government should have been condemned and thrown out of office because it had totally lost control of immigration matters and of Australia's borders. The government's overreaction in putting up its so-called Pacific solution was to cover its hide—to cover the fact that it had lost control of relations with Indonesia and that the flood of people brought in by people smugglers was direct retribution for the manner in which the Prime Minister had treated the Indonesians. If you ask Australia's intelligence agencies whether or not that has a fundamental basis in fact, I think you will get the answer that that is absolutely true. Relations between countries cannot just exist on a bilateral level. This government would like that to be the case—it would like trade matters to be dealt with only country to country. By and large it is averse to multilateral approaches. Even at the bilateral level we have suffered enormously in this area. But there are multilateral solutions—and the shadow minister for immigration has alluded to those—in getting a new regime whereby UNHCR rules prevail.
As the member for Blaxland since the middle of 1996, and since 2 January 1985 when I started working on immigration issues for the then Treasurer and afterwards the then Labor Prime Minister, I have adopted—necessarily, because my electorate is an immigration impact zone—the toughest approach to border control and immigration policy that one could reasonably expect given the tremendously important and deep reality of the impact of that policy on people in my electorate. The shadow minister for immigration knows this full well, because the character and nature of her electorate is very similar to that of mine. People who live in those electorates feel the impact of uncontrolled migration. They will feel the impact now of increased levels of migration—as, during the four years in which Paul Keating was Prime Minister, they would have felt the impact of the fact that Australia had the lowest levels of immigration since the program was inaugurated by Arthur Calwell after the Second World War.
There is only one government that had those low levels of 70,000, and that was the Australian Labor Party, under Prime Minister Paul Keating, in reaction to the fact that we were in recession. If the levels demanded by a number of people who advised him had been in place, then normal Australian people would not have been able to get access to jobs, there would have been more savage competition for those and the cost to the Australian budget would have been much greater. Sensible policy—policy that is based not just on the national interest of Australia as a whole but on the interest of people in the electorate of Blaxland and the interest of people in the electorate of Lalor and of other similar electorates around Australia—demands an Australian Labor Party opposition and an Australian Labor Party government that is tough when it comes to people-smuggling, that is tough when it comes to issues of border control and that is tough when it comes to protecting the interests of our electors and of the Australian people. 
It is this government that failed the test when it came to the question of controlling Australia's borders. This government was re-elected on the basis of a figment, a fig leaf created by this minister and the Prime Minister that this government was tough in these areas. There have not been people coming since these measures were put into place, and that is the government's rejoinder time and time again. But it caused the problem in the first place. Do a simple comparison: 3,000 people in 13 years versus 11,500 in 2½ years. Excuse me? There is a localised problem here which has been engendered by a failure of government policy at the fundamental regional level. We need to rebuild the relationship with Indonesia. We need to have a new set of policies where the UNHCR can operate on a more effective and more universal basis. I think we need to maintain the excision of Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef because of the question of proximity, but this grab bag of 3,000 islands is a political attempt in this bill, as it was in the regulations, to posture in order to cover up the fact that the government's record was so reprehensible. It just is not good enough, and I oppose it.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—in reply—I thank my colleagues for their contributions—of variable quality, I might say—to the debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. I also thank the member for Denison for observing that both the shadow minister and I remained here for the tour of this debate. The honourable member for Denison must have some other activities in which he is involved, as he has not been able to stay to hear the reply in relation to the matters he raised. I hope he might read these comments I am about to make.
This issue does not have to be a divisive issue. This is an issue which can be resolved quickly by the opposition saying, `We will support the measure.' Then all of the arguments about the government trying to divide the Australian community on this issue would fall to the ground. All you have to do is support the measure. Is there any reason for opposition to the measure? Is there some evil that will befall the Australian community because these islands are excised from the migration zone? I know a lot of people do not understand what is involved. They hear about excision and say, `This part of Australia is being lost to us in some way.' We know that that is not the case. It has not happened in relation to Christmas Island, it has not happened in relation to Cocos Island and it has not happened in relation to the Ashmore Reef. They are just as much part of Australia today as they ever were. If other islands were excised, they would remain just as much part of Australia as they ever were, subject to the exercise of our sovereignty where we say that for the purposes of the Migration Act certain people will not be able to lodge valid applications if they are in those excised areas. 
Before I move to the more detailed explanations, I will put it plainly why I want this measure. Some people have questioned whether or not I think this measure will be an additional tool in relation to dealing with potential unauthorised arrivals. The reason I want it is exactly the same reason that, under the regulatory power that we had, we excised temporarily certain islands when we became aware that there was a potential for a vessel to be able to reach Western Australia. The islands are off the coast of Western Australia and they were excised very deliberately because we thought that if a vessel landed in that area, instead of having them land in Western Australia and accessing the Australian determination system, we would be able to take people to those islands, land them there and then, under the provisions of the Migration Act, transfer them either to Christmas Island or to another offshore processing centre. The availability of those islands for that landing and to make that transfer was the very reason that we made that excision at that time. We then withdrew the regulations when they were not required. It is the very reason that we seek this measure. Why? Because we do not always know where vessels are likely to turn up.  
I know some people were getting rather excited in the last few weeks that our policy was unwinding with the prospect of some Vietnamese boat arrivals. These were Vietnamese that were saying they were intent on sailing to New Zealand, in vessels that clearly were not up to the task; they did not even get through Indonesia. But I tell you that if they had got to the Torres Strait it is very likely, heading to New Zealand because they think they might get a better outcome there, that they would have landed on one of our islands or landed on a reef and been forced to be landed on one of our islands. That is the reason that we see these excisions as being important. They add to our armoury. It is in that context that I felt you ought to know that this is not something that I view as useful for dividing the opposition. You have done a good enough job of that yourself in the debate today, let me say. This measure I believe adds to our capacity to be able to handle the question of unauthorised border arrivals.
Before I return to my formal text I will pick up the comments of the honourable member for Blaxland in relation to why we saw a sudden change in circumstances. The fact is that people look at the way in which laws operate. Ours are now a statute with regulations, on which people get advice. There are a lot of people offering advice; we have a whole industry of advisers who ensure that people are aware of the changes that occur from time to time, the nuances in the system, and how they can be used and exploited. The government has to be flexible enough to see those nuances and make changes.
We had some discussion today about other measures the opposition has opposed. It is becoming increasingly apparent that people are now misusing domestic violence provisions that were there for a very legitimate purpose—to help women who might be abused in a relationship. They were there genuinely to help them but they are now being used not only by women but, in 14 per cent of cases, by men. The provisions required simply a statutory declaration asserting that there was an abuse—requiring no evidence that could be tested but simply asserting it—as the basis upon which the order would be granted.
—Give us a proposal.
—We have a further proposal, having knocked out the first one which would simply have asked for Centrelink—
—The fact is that you indicated that this was not an issue about which you were concerned. I simply say, without raising it in any censorious way, that it has been the subject of a good deal of public comment. People are becoming aware of the abuse that we pointed out to you something like two years ago. The reason that we need to make changes, and the reason we made many of the changes that we did in relation to people-smuggling, is that people change their tactics. You had groups of people who, if they were able to make claims that they were from particular countries—whether they were or they were not—and use the legal system to remain here for long periods of time, could create a view that in coming to Australia they were getting far better outcomes than if they remained in other places. 
One of the points that the shadow minister has not well accepted in her own comments is that the attraction of Australia was not just our asylum determination system but also the access to benefits and the nature of support that is provided to people if they are in Australia rather than other parts. You can have this idea that you can put in place a level playing field for assessing claims. It would not alter the perception of Australia one iota in terms of the nature of the benefits that you get if you can make the step to Australia to have your claims addressed rather than having them processed in a camp like Kakuma in Africa or in the Middle East. There is a very wide range of issues.
Are our measures working? I think they are working very effectively at the moment. I took some figures from the report that the department collates in relation to asylum claims that were accepted, overturns by the Refugee Review Tribunal of departmental decisions and my interventions where a humanitarian decision was substituted. They total, up to 30 April, a little over 700. That is from all sources: people who have come as unauthorised border arrivals by air, unauthorised boat arrivals and tourists who put their hands up and say, `I am a refugee.' It would appear that if that goes on for a year we would be looking at something in the order of 1,000. I cannot recall when we have had those sorts of numbers. 
I looked at the figures for the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom have three times our population; I think it is about 60 million. They have 110,000 asylum claims that they are processing at the moment. Looking at the figures, something in the order of 37,000 claims would have to have been processed in Australia for us to experience the magnitude of the problem that they have in the United Kingdom. I think we are processing somewhere over 5,000 at the moment. That puts it into some perspective. They have a rate of asylum claims that is seven times that of Australia. That is a very significant difference, and it is little wonder that the arrangements put in place through the Pacific solution are something that the United Kingdom are seriously advancing that they should pursue in Britain right now.
We are not seen as some international pariah in relation to these issues; we are seen as a government that has taken a strong and effective stand in relation to border protection issues. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] is about ensuring that we are able to continue those arrangements. Have those arrangements been effective? In last night's budget we returned a little less than half a billion dollars to the budget over the term of the forward estimates as a result of the very significant reduction in unauthorised border arrivals. I noticed last year there were some comments about the enormity of expenditure in this area based on forward estimates. Let me just say it is coming off very quickly because of the measures that we have enacted.
This bill, by expanding the definition of `excised offshore place', sends a very strong deterrent message. The bill ensures that persons who travel unlawfully to Australia and gain entry to Australia at an excised offshore place will not gain access to our extensive visa application and review processes. Rather, their cases will receive consideration in line with the standard UNHCR processing procedures. The measures contained in the bill further strengthen the protection of our borders and make it significantly harder for smugglers to access the mainland without detection.  
The bill does not disadvantage Australians in any way, nor does it cause detriment to those people who, with lawful authority, seek to be in Australia under the Migration Act. These people will be able to move about just as freely in any of the excised offshore places as they would in any other part of Australia. These places remain an integral part of Australia. In addition, the traditional inhabitants of the Torres Strait islands will not be affected by the inclusion of the Torres Strait islands as an excised offshore place. 
My colleague Senator Scullion went to the Northern Territory recently and visited a number of Indigenous communities to consult with them about the effect of the bill and to make it clear that the proposed changes will only affect people who arrive unlawfully. All of the communities consulted expressed their strong support for the bill. Indeed, having previously indicated their support, they were concerned that it had been ignored.
—And in the Torres Strait.
—I am glad to hear that from the member for Leichhardt, who represents the Torres Strait in this parliament. This legislation is part of a comprehensive strategy. The strategy includes maintenance of cooperation arrangements with Indonesia. I have to say that they are continuing to improve, but essentially Indonesia has always been unwilling to have the very large numbers of people held in detention type centres at Galang that they had in the 1970s and 1980s. They are just not prepared to do it, and we need to understand that. We can work in other ways with them but on that there will be no change. To expect that any form of relationship with Indonesia would lead to a different view in relation to that I think is being somewhat naive in terms of the depth of their feeling that they were left with the problem for decades. They detained the Vietnamese asylum seekers until there was the comprehensive plan of action that led to the return of the bulk of them. They do not wish to be a party to that sort of arrangement again, and we have to be flexible enough to understand that. 
We have been getting cooperation from other countries within the region, and the recent Bali conference on people-smuggling demonstrated that. A very large number of ministers were present, with none of them demurring in relation to the importance of dealing with these issues. In terms of criticism of Australia, it certainly does not come from nation states and it does not come from creditable international organisations; it comes from time to time from certain NGOs and advocacy groups whose members are the same people who network with those in Australia who put those same points of view.
It has been 16 months since any boat was organised by people smugglers, and this is a very clear indication that the strategy has worked. People smugglers watch very closely what the government does. Creditable intelligence reports remain that smugglers are looking for ways and means to get their clients to Australia or other destinations in the Pacific. Therefore, the government must continue to be vigilant and to take any necessary action that it believes will enhance our border protection measures.
The government does not accept that the bill will force asylum seekers onto the mainland, as the opposition and minor parties suggest. Comments referred to in debate by the opposition as being made by the Australian Federal Police and the Acting Secretary of DIMIA before the Senate committee were taken clearly out of context. The answer given by me to the Senate estimates committee to a question asked by Senator Sherry, which used the same quote that the shadow minister used, sets out fully the context in which those comments were offered. I simply make the point that these officials were saying that the ability to effectively apprehend and successfully prosecute people smugglers will be enhanced by this bill and that failing to pass this bill will give people smugglers the green light to continue their trade to either Australia or other destinations. 
The success of our border protection strategies is being noted internationally, as I said before. The government's strategy is being used as a model for better managing the flow of asylum seekers and giving greater assistance and protection to refugees. The UK is developing a regional processing model incorporating transit processing centres in a regional protection area which draws upon the Pacific strategy. These international developments show that the measures contained in this bill are the way forward. They are measures that have placed Australia at the forefront of international developments in border management.
It is incomprehensible that now the opposition again seek to raise objections after having had ample opportunity to do so when legislation dealing with the Christmas and Cocos islands and Ashmore Reef was passed in 2001. Furthermore, it is irresponsible not to support this bill. Not supporting it shows a lack of regard to our border security and our international efforts to deter people-smuggling.
As I have a couple of moments left, let me say that I listened very closely to the debate yesterday. The member for Lalor argued that the Pacific solution had been a farce, with most of those being found to be refugees having been resettled in Australia. Let me say that the number of people found to be refugees was vastly down on the sort of processing that we would have expected if they had been processed onshore; less than 50 per cent obtained refugee status. That is a very significant reduction. In relation to those who were found to be refugees, 44 per cent have been resettled—primarily because they had closer links to Australia—and the balance have been resettled in five other Western countries.
—No; we made it very clear that we would take our fair share. The member for Lalor claimed that Labor's policies would be more effective than the government's, but you cannot escape the fact that the government policies have been effective and are working. She claims that the Pacific solution was an expensive detour, but it has been evidenced that it has helped contain numbers very significantly and there are now returns to the budget, as I outlined.
I conclude by saying to the member for the Northern Territory that this is a serious exercise of our sovereignty. In relation to Christmas Island, we are intent on proceeding with a cost-effective detention centre, and that is the reason that we have had to look closely at those questions. I am looking at Cocos Island and its future, but we are conscious that we need to have an ongoing capacity on Cocos Island to be able to deal with any arrivals. I note that the member for Bass totally misunderstood the concept of excision. I notice that the member for Denison seems to have abandoned any pretence of supporting Labor policy let alone the policies of this government. But let me say that we seek to maintain detention arrangements that were largely put in place by Labor and to ensure that they are effective and humane. To come into the House and peddle the sort of nonsense that you find on the web site of the Greens and to put it as though it is a serious issue that requires answers, such as taking people into a centre and hanging them up by their feet, I think does him little credit at all.

"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—For the information of honourable members, I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 and ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the memorandum. 
Leave granted.
—I thank the opposition for agreeing to leave being granted. As this House is aware, Australia has just experienced the largest recall of medicines in the country's history. Almost 1,600 complementary and other over-the-counter medicines have had to be removed from the market in Australia. This recall has also had international implications, with 28 countries known to be affected. This unprecedented recall was the result of a number of serious safety and quality breaches by the company Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd, with subsequent suspension of the company's manufacturing licence by the national regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration—or TGA, as we know it.
Safety and quality breaches included substitution of ingredients, manipulation of test results and substandard manufacturing processes. For example, there was evidence of a lack of testing of the raw materials that went into the medicines and also evidence of the use of raw materials that had failed testing. There was evidence of manipulation of the assay results for finished products to enable these products to comply with specifications. There was also evidence of the substitution of beef cartilage in the place of shark cartilage. There was also inadequate cleaning of tablet machines between the manufacture of different products, which may have included veterinary medicines.
These widespread and critical deficiencies in the company's manufacturing and quality control procedures necessitated strong regulatory action to protect the health and safety of the Australian public and of people around the world. The seriousness of the actions of this company, and the challenges these actions have presented for the regulator, other companies and consumers, have reinforced the need for strong and decisive action by the government. In just 12 working days since the suspension of the Pan Pharmaceuticals manufacturing licence, the government has put together a considered and balanced package of measures that will strengthen and refine Australia's world-class regulatory system for therapeutic goods.
The package of amendments that I am moving today will clarify and tighten the responsibilities placed on sponsors and manufacturers of therapeutic goods to ensure that the products they make or supply measure up to appropriate, internationally recognised quality and safety standards. The package will also provide the TGA with greater powers to take appropriate and timely action to remove substandard or suspect products from the marketplace. The amendments will, for example, ensure that every manufacturer involved in the manufacture of each batch of a therapeutic good will be identifiable and that this information will be able to be readily obtained by the TGA. The information that companies will be required to keep is information that they should already have about the products they supply; however, the amendments will ensure that this information is readily available, accurate and accessible. 
Another important change proposed by these amendments is the strengthening of the reporting requirement on sponsors and manufacturers about problems with their therapeutic goods. If sponsors receive any information about deficiencies with their product or any adverse effects from the use of their product, they will be required to notify the TGA as these are reported.  
The amendments in this bill will also extend the circumstances in which deficient goods may be recalled from the market and when their sponsors or manufacturers will be required to notify the public about the grounds for the recall. Currently, therapeutic goods can be recalled if there is a problem with the goods themselves. The amendments will allow goods to be recalled from the market if standards have not been met in the manufacture of the goods or if they have been manufactured by a company that does not have a current manufacturing licence.
These amendments are also designed to deter non-compliance with the regulatory requirements. They will, for example, provide additional grounds for the TGA to refuse access of product to the market, with additional grounds to withhold, suspend or cancel a manufacturing licence. One of the key changes will be that only a fit and proper person will be able to hold a manufacturing licence for the manufacture of therapeutic goods. It is also proposed that there will be new offences to provide additional incentives for manufacturers to comply with proper standards in the manufacture of therapeutic goods and for ensuring that such goods continue to meet acceptable standards of safety, quality and efficacy. There will, for example, be new offences for falsifying or destroying any document or record relating to the manufacture, testing or evaluation of therapeutic goods. Finally, the level of penalties for a range of offences will be increased by these amendments. It appears from recent events that the current level of penalties is an inadequate deterrent to suppliers of therapeutic goods who wish to place commercial interests over and above public health and safety. The new penalty rates reflect a more realistic incentive for companies tempted to take shortcuts and risk public health.
The changes to the regulatory system, reflected in these amendments, are about better protecting public health and safety in relation to all therapeutic goods. Although the events in this case involved a manufacturer of complementary and other over-the-counter medicines, the enhancements proposed are intended to benefit the whole regulatory system. Where changes have been specifically targeted at the listed products of the types affected by this recall, it has been to bring them in line with requirements applying to other types of therapeutic goods. The new adverse events reporting requirement for listed products is one such example.
It is recognised that these changes will have an impact on industry. They should assist in rebuilding consumer confidence in the quality and safety of these products and in restoring the national and international reputation of Australia's therapeutic goods industry. Responsible industry members will benefit from changes that deter poor behaviour by their competitors. Responsible companies will not be significantly affected by new record keeping and reporting requirements, as this represents information that these companies would already possess. Overall, this package of amendments represents a sensible response by this government to the Pan Pharmaceuticals incident. The government supports the actions of the TGA in identifying the deficiencies in the practices of this company and managing this extensive recall of medicines. It is because Australia has one of the world's leading regulators of medicines and that we do, in fact, regulate many of these products as medicines and not foods that the prompt and effective regulatory action could be taken. 
By supporting the government's amendments to this bill, the parliament will provide the TGA with an even better range of regulatory tools to protect public health and safety. The TGA will be able to more rapidly and readily identify manufacturers and sponsors who may not be acting responsibly. There will be stronger incentives for companies to comply with standards designed to ensure the safety, quality and effectiveness of therapeutic goods. And it will ensure future recalls—should that ever be necessary—will be able to be conducted faster and more specifically. I recommend these amendments to the House, and I will formally move them later in the debate. ",REPS,<title>PAPERS</title>,<title>Therapeutic Goods Legislation</title>,Documents,2,1
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—We are here today to debate the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 and a range of amendments. I intend to move an amendment at the conclusion of my contribution, with respect to a general statement about the way this issue has been handled. I signal to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing that the amendments she has just outlined have the support of the opposition, and we wish them speedy passage to the other place. However, it would be neglectful of me not to go through a range of issues which relate to what has occurred on this occasion—information that I believe the parliament needs to be aware of and that concerns the operation of our regulatory system, particularly regarding complementary medicines. All is not quite as rosy as one would think from the comments of the previous speaker. The amendments are basically a response to the Pan Pharmaceuticals crisis, which is currently working its way through the complementary and over-the-counter medicines system. It raises some very important issues. 
I would like to make a point about the general issue of regulation in this area under this government. We have seen real and endemic problems in the operation of the regulatory system with respect to Pan because this had been going on for quite some time, and it took quite some time for the regulator to establish that. It raises questions about the nature of our system, about the work on risk management and trust, and about the moves that have occurred in this area, as they have in so many other areas under this government, towards increased self-regulation and self-assessment. 
As members may well be aware, the Therapeutic Goods Act often has amending legislation required. In March 2001 in this place, we were debating the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000 [2001]. This bill brought forward a range of changes, particularly around the issue of listing of drugs in this area including processes of self-assessment and self-regulation with a greater emphasis on moving allegedly—and I stress `allegedly'—to post-market monitoring. I had a number of things to say in that debate on 8 March 2001, which I must say seem quite prophetic to some degree in terms of what we are dealing with now. The Hansard reads:
Essentially, this bill moves the consideration of safety, quality and manufacturing standards criteria from the pre-market phase to the post-market phase. As Labor has already stated in the Senate, the risks associated with this change are just not acceptable. While Labor believes that the majority of manufacturers and sponsors are responsible and will continue to ensure their products meet the required criteria, it only takes one unscrupulous company to potentially cause a major public health problem.
I repeat: it only takes one unscrupulous company to potentially cause a major public health problem. My speech continued: 
When balancing improved access with public health safety, Labor puts the health and safety of Australians first. The Howard government's claims that this weakening of the listing process will free up additional resources for increased post-market monitoring is, as I have already said, a joke. Let us look at the government's record on monitoring. Leaving the nursing home debacle aside, the TGA—and, more specifically, its Interim Office of the Gene Technology Regulator—has a dismal record, to say the least, and this too is a branch that is responsible for protecting the health and safety of the Australian public.
I went on to say:
These are the bodies and the politicians that expect the Australian public to believe that they will effectively monitor the safety of low risk medicines after they are on the market. Labor do not believe that this government will fulfil its responsibilities in this area, and that is one of the reasons why we will not support this bill. As if this government's atrocious monitoring record in the health and safety area is not enough to destroy public confidence ...
This bill is a reflection of the Howard government's model for governing. It deregulates to make things easier for industry. While the industry benefits of these changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 in terms of time and cost savings are obvious, any consumer benefits are less tangible. As I have already said, faster access to new products is not in itself a benefit when balanced against public health risk. Ask the Europeans at the moment whether they would forgo health and safety measures to gain improved access to any products. They are learning the hard way that deregulation and weakening of processes have some horrific downsides.
I concluded by saying:
For now, I would just like to restate Labor's condemnation of the Howard government for its systematic and continued attack on the processes and bodies that are responsible for protecting the health and safety of all Australians. Labor rejects the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000, as it rejects the now very public government agenda that underpins these changes to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Act 1989 ...
That is what I said in March 2001, and now look at what we are facing today. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing outlined, we are now dealing with a major public health issue. There has been a range of problems with the handling of this and we have clearly been heading down this track for some time under this government. 
The bill before us today is the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. When do you think this bill was introduced? It was introduced almost 12 months ago. It was introduced to the parliament on 27 June 2002 and it has languished ever since. The government, which decides the order of the consideration of legislation in this place, chose not to bother with this one. It did not see it as being important enough. It will be said by some that we are talking about some relatively minor changes with respect to this legislation. They will say: `It wasn't that much of a bother. They are matters in relation to advertising and other issues and there is not really much to worry about at all.' You could say that, but let us refer to the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech on the introduction of this bill. She said:
The definition of therapeutic goods currently excludes any goods that are covered by a prescribed food standard made under the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. This is the case even when the goods would otherwise, but for this exclusion, fall within the definition of `therapeutic goods' under the act.
Basically, this particular amendment is clarifying the issue of `therapeutic goods' versus `food' and giving the secretary the right to determine that something that appears to be a food—for example, some sort of sports supplement that could come in tablet form and could involve what we would normally consider to be a medicinal application—can be determined to be a medicine and therefore it can be regulated as it is supposed to be and it can be properly considered. The parliamentary secretary went on to say:  
The amendment to the definition of `therapeutic goods' will allow the use of a determination under section 7 of the act in the practical manner that the legislation and all stakeholders always intended.
Without the amendment, the confusion with the regulation around the food-medicine interface would escalate. This could, in the future, pose public health and safety risks to consumers resulting from individual complementary medicinal products being inappropriately regulated as foods.
That is, they would not be regulated to the standard required by medicines. These were the parliamentary secretary's own words at that time. We are only now, almost 12 months later, dealing with the issue of the confusion around regulation with respect to the complementary medicines area. When we talk about how this government has failed in its responsibilities to the Australian public, we can point to that issue of self-assessment, self-regulation and deregulation occurring over time. We can also talk about how the legislation we are dealing with now took almost 12 months to come before us. I know and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing knows that, if we were not now dealing with Pan Pharmaceuticals, this legislation would not be here today; it would still be languishing and we would still be waiting to deal with those matters.
When we go to the question of what occurred with Pan Pharmaceuticals, it is important to go through a chronology of the major events. New things are coming out almost every day with respect to this, so I am not suggesting for one minute that this is a full list of what occurred, but I think it does cover the range of major events over the period of the audit process. That is important if we are going to consider the question of whether action was taken in a timely manner in response to the concerns that had been raised. In mid-January, the adverse drug reaction reporting service established a number of incidents involving the use of Travacalm. This led the TGA to review those incidents, obtain some of the product, test it and, on 21 January, order the recall of Travacalm. This was then followed up with a TGA audit of Pan Pharmaceuticals with respect to those types of products, which are microdose applications, on 30 and 31 January. The TGA found a number of other critical breaches at that time and they altered the licence for Pan to prohibit them from manufacturing those microdose products at that stage.
Following on from that, it has been reported that there was an AFP raid on Pan on 13 February, with the seizure of a computer in order to get access to records. Another TGA audit into the wider application of the factory commenced on 24 and 25 February. That was truncated because of actions which related to Pan executives et cetera. It continued offsite but was then recommenced onsite between 7 and 14 April. As a result of that, the TGA convened an expert committee on 23 April to review the evidence that that audit showed regarding a range of problems at the factory. That expert committee then advised the TGA that they could and should move forward with suspension of Pan's licence and a full recall of products. They are basically the key events.
Criticism has been made of the TGA with respect to the conduct of that process. From my point of view, I have made it clear that I think that they were overly cautious in acting on this matter. I will relate the concern I have to a couple of points in terms of the timing that I have just mentioned. The audit established nine critical breaches that were all issues of major concern regarding the operation of Pan Pharmaceuticals. These were things like: the manipulation of raw data; the deliberate substitution of ingredients—for example, beef cartilage with shark; and deficient raw material product controls—you could not identify the source of some raw materials. There were also real concerns about the cleaning of equipment between lines. For example, if they were producing one product and then changed to another, they used the same equipment to produce that product. The machinery was not cleaned off properly, so there was the potential for ingredient mix. There was a range of unsatisfactory process controls, poor documentation, no compliance with documented procedures, issues around marketing authorisations, no testing of raw materials and no testing of final products. 
Allegations which relate to these very issues have since come out on the Sunday program. The transcript of the Sunday program says:
... the people were told actually sweep those powders and put it back into the harbour of the machine.
Later, Helen Dalley asked:
How often did this happen, this practice of sweeping powder off the floor and putting it back into the manufacturing machine?
The answer was:
This was a regular practice every day, and this was the culture of the company.
An employee of the company, Richardson Obedoza said:
We have to make 5 million tablets a day. But we can't make that many if we clean the machine properly.
There is no doubt that the range of concerns we are talking about are incredibly serious. The point I make is: there were nine critical breaches, so why did the TGA wait to act on a full recall until they had nine? Why not do it with seven? Why not do it with five? Why not do it with three? How serious does it have to be before they actually act? How serious before they call together the expert committee and say, `At this stage we have sufficient evidence to be able to put forward a case to say that these guys have to have their licence suspended and there has to be a recall'? I do not believe that they needed to wait until they had nine breaches. I believe that could have happened earlier.
We know that at least two critical breaches were found in the audit on the 30th and the 31st. Certainly the TGA thought there were serious concerns at that stage in respect of microdose applications because there was an alteration of the licence—a suspension of, as I mentioned earlier, the right of Pan to produce microdose application products. But I do not believe that the rest of the problems that were found were established only in April. I am sure a number were established earlier and that that would have given them scope to act at that time.
The argument that has been put publicly with respect to this is that it would have endangered the legal case. The minister for health has said that there needed to be a watertight case. Although the issues of legal action in these circumstances have to be very seriously considered and weighed accordingly, the bottom line for the regulator is that it is their job to protect public health and safety first and foremost. If they had established a real public health and safety concern earlier than the time when they eventually notified the expert committee, then they should have acted. If it had implications for the question of legal action down the track, that is a chance that the regulator have to take.
I have the feeling from a number of public comments from the minister and the parliamentary secretary on this occasion that there is almost a culture of fear within the TGA about having legal action taken against them. Part of that is understandable in the context of the history of Pan and members of Pan's management in terms of previous reports on activities around Pan's laboratories and other activities. But again I come to this clear point: if the final process found that the breaches were so serious that a recall was required—and I support that decision—and if an expert committee found that that was the case, I do not believe they had to wait until they had the audit completed and they had nine examples of critical breaches. They could have moved earlier. How much earlier is a matter of debate, but I certainly believe the fact that they could have acted earlier is quite clear. If that led to some form of increased likelihood of legal jeopardy, I am sorry: if there was a public health and safety risk then action had to be taken. I do not believe that the courts would have ruled in favour of an outfit like Pan, with the concerns which were raised about allowing its products to remain out there. I do not believe that. 
Another issue which I believe points to the problems with timing we have had here is the question of the earlier audit on 30 and 31 January. Essentially, that audit was into microdose applications. On that occasion, the TGA found sufficient problems with the operation of the microdose application component of the factory to actually alter the licence and stop Pan producing those products. Why then did they not order a recall of those particular products?
The fact of the matter was that, at that time, they had two critical breaches with respect to the processes being employed. That was sufficient to stop production. They had led them to move on Travacalm only a matter of days before, by ordering a recall. I believe that they should have acted at that time. I have been told that there were other issues around the fact that there were not the same sorts of safety issues with regard to the other products produced in that area, but I disagree with that. I think that action could have—and should have—been taken to recall at that time.
Then there is the issue of the overall conduct of the recall. I want to stress that this was an incredibly complex recall. There is no doubt about that. I think it has been said that it is potentially the biggest recall of these sorts of applications in the world. There is no doubt that it has produced a whole raft of issues. At this time, I also want to stress that I believe that the TGA is a professional organisation that is endeavouring to do the best it can. But I believe that it was overly cautious, and that had implications for public health and safety.
The recall process has been a disaster. As has been shown, it has been very much what I have called a `Demtel recall'— a case of, `But wait, there's more!' First, over 200 products that were Pan manufactured were withdrawn. Then we were told: `But wait, there's more! We just do not know how many more yet, but as soon as we get the notifications back from the companies we will let you know.' Then another few hundred were recalled, there was another `But wait, there's more!' and then another few hundred were recalled. Then a couple of hundred were taken off and a couple of hundred more were put on. The latest figure is somewhere in the region of 1,600 to 1,700, but I am not sure that that is the end of the story. It is a bit like Blue Hills.
Let us look at what occurred in that process and at action that could have been taken by the TGA that, I think, would have made this a lot simpler and avoided confusion for the public post the event. As part of the audit process, the TGA should have been able to contact all the companies they had listed as potential receivers of Pan products. There was no reason for them not to notify companies—they can do so under the act—as part of the audit process, merely to gather information on any products the companies had got from Pan and make it clear that it was part of the consideration they were undertaking as part of the audit. 
It has been put again by the minister that that would have tipped off Pan Pharmaceuticals that something was on. Despite the protestations of some members of the Pan board, there is no doubt that, after two audits—one on 30 and 31 January and then the commencement and ongoing operation of another from 24 and 25 February—an AFP raid in relation to computers and the withdrawal of Travacalm, anyone in the company who was aware of the sort of scrutiny that was going on would have realised that they had serious problems. You would not tip people like that off. That is ridiculous. There has been some reporting on share market transactions. Should that be proven, it will become pretty clear that people—at least, some of the key people who appear to be responsible for what has occurred—had a fair idea of what was going on. So I do not accept that argument.
Another argument that has been put is that this would potentially lead to problems with the share market—that it would lead to a run on the company because it would get out that this activity was happening. I disagree. It would get out that the TGA was conducting a detailed audit into Pan Pharmaceuticals. That should not be a surprise. Conducting an audit in that manner should not be a problem. If it is, it says something about the regularity and detail of auditing in this area. In my view, there is no doubt about that. I think those points are very important.
If that process had been undertaken, we could have had if not a complete then an almost complete list of products available at the start. All the confusion that has occurred since then would not have occurred—and there has been a lot of confusion. The Pharmacy Guild embarked on an advertising campaign last weekend in relation to the Pan Pharmaceuticals recall, entitled `Are you confused? Contact your pharmacist'. That private organisation has felt the need to get into the market and ensure that people are provided with information. It has been that confusing.
We have had the ridiculous situation where the health minister issued a press release—it was her one press release in this exercise—on, I think, Thursday of the first week to announce that no prescription medicines were included in the recall. Twenty-four hours later the TGA had to issue another press release saying that that was not the case. An antidepressant drug called Allegron, which was a prescription pharmaceutical, was affected. As I understand it, there were reasons for that from the TGA's point of view. Essentially, they had gone to great lengths to ensure that they had the correct information. The responsibility, as I understand it, relates much more to the company involved and to some of their internal procedures. But having the minister make such a statement when there was still some doubt—as was proven the next day—patently made this government look as though it had no idea what was going on.
Yesterday in the Senate the minister was asked a question about concerns that have been raised about refunds—how they were occurring and in what circumstances. What happened? Effectively, the minister said, `It's nothing to do with me. Ask somebody else.' She had no idea. She was more concerned with trying to push the Medicare reforms than taking some charge of the biggest public health and safety issue facing this country at the moment.
Then there was the issue of the advertising of the recall—who it was advertised to and in what circumstances. It is true that the TGA went further than they were required to in terms of organising the recall. They certainly played an important role in getting information out, and the argument can be put that they did more than they had to. But, having commenced that process, the TGA also had a responsibility to ensure that it was done properly. 
With respect to regional advertising, action was taken by the government only after it was raised by newspapers, the community and the Labor Party. Initially the advice from the parliamentary secretary's office was, `We're not going to advertise in those areas,' and then a change was made. When a further list was to be produced, it was announced that that list would be sent out only in metropolitan dailies. We again raised the fact that that was unfair to people in rural and regional Australia, and we believe that another alteration and some advertising occurred. But, essentially, we had a position where that recall was not under any control. There is also a question as to how long this has been going on. I assure you that there will be more discussion on this issue into the future with estimates—and possibly more than that.
Academics in the pharmacology department of the University of New South Wales produced a report in February 2002 on a series of products to deal with menopause. These products included the active ingredient isoflavone. That report was published in the Medical Journal of Australia in February 2002. The report pointed directly to a problem with a Pan product. Of the 10 products researched, eight were found to not meet the guidelines. The Pan product was the product that most did not meet the guidelines. I have spoken to the academics involved, including a professor of pharmacology. The TGA has never contacted him to speak about this issue and has made no inquiries about what was found in that study. That study came out two months prior to the last audit, which occurred in April 2002, in which Pan got a clean bill of health, and the recall occurred at the beginning of May. I think there are some questions that need to be answered. We are going to keep asking those questions and we are going to be expecting some answers.
As I said earlier, as they stand, the amendments are supported. We also agree in principle with the establishment of the expert committee, which was announced by the parliamentary secretary, but we would like to know a bit more detail. At this stage we have had a committee announced and a chair appointed, but we have no idea as to who is on that committee and we do not have any detail on the terms of reference.
I advise the parliamentary secretary that there was a committee established in this area—the Complementary Medicines Consultative Committee. I will have a lot more to say about that in the future. That committee was established last term by Senator Grant Tambling, who was the previous parliamentary secretary. Its brief related to a range of these issues. At its meetings, which occurred twice a year, it was considering issues relating to product safety, manufacturing processes, auditing processes and a whole range of issues that are particularly relevant to this exercise. What happened to that committee? I will tell you what happened to that committee. It has not met this term. It has been nearly two years since it met. And here we are today setting up an expert committee to look at some of these issues and to sort out this mess. I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its track record of weakening the regulation of complementary and over-the-counter medicines and notes that we are now dealing with the logical result of its negligence”.

"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—Firstly, I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Health and Ageing on confronting what has been a very difficult period in this industry and bringing the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 forward in a very timely manner. It has been a very difficult time, and no doubt the Therapeutic Goods Administration has had to burn the midnight oil to confront what has been a pretty disappointing effort all round in terms of the standards that have become obvious.
This bill will provide for better batch identification; additional reporting; additional grounds for the TGA to refuse to include goods on the register; an extension of the circumstances in which deficient therapeutic goods may be recalled; the insertion of new offences to provide additional incentives for manufacturers to comply with proper standards; and an increase in the level of penalties.
I compliment the opposition spokesman, the member for Bruce, for an excellent speech in terms of stating what is actually happening and offering some pretty strong and reasonable questions that need to be answered—as is the rightful role of an opposition. All I can usefully add is that those people who have used these products no doubt are seeking reassurance, and this legislation goes a long way to doing that. The industry has taken a major hit. I hope those people who have been so careless as to have this industry sullied are reflecting on what has occurred. No doubt we would all wish the many genuine producers in the marketplace—and many of us would have noted their efforts to try to get this industry back on an even keel—a steadying period and hope that they are able to get back to business in a reasonable way.
As I said, I compliment the parliamentary secretary, the minister and the TGA for their speedy response. This will be an ongoing watching brief for some time as we get this matter back under control. I wish the bill a speedy passage.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I rise to speak on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. My colleague the shadow minister, the member for Bruce, has more than adequately, as the honourable member for Grey was kind enough to comment, dealt with many of the issues which are before the parliament and, indeed, the community in relation to the Pan Pharmaceuticals debacle and the many products they have out in the community. The broad distribution of their products and the agency agreements which they had with many of the other producers of complementary medicine products extended the problems which occurred in relation to alternative health products much more widely into the community than would otherwise have been the case. They manufactured products on behalf of many other distributors in the alternative health care area, and so many more people than normal were affected by this crisis in the industry. We then had the spectacle of ongoing recalls. Day after day, the public were confronted in the newspapers and other media by further, ongoing recalls of products, which created something of a problem of confidence in the industry.
While this has been a very serious problem for consumers and the industry itself, our concern is primarily and almost exclusively the issue of safety for consumers. That has been the concern of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing and of the opposition, and I think all of us in the parliament take our first and primary responsibility to be the safeguarding of public health in these matters. The industry must look to its own manufacturing practices and its own responsibilities to ensure that it has the right practices and standards in place so that it does not breach the proper law of the land in respect of these issues and is able to deliver products to the public, who rightly look to the industry and to the parliament to ensure that the proper standards and laws are in place. This bill is a response to that, and the amendments that we see before us are a first response to the Pan Pharmaceuticals crisis and to the issues which are properly addressed as a response to it. 
In some ways, this situation will force the parliament to address something which has needed to be addressed for a very long time—that is, the general regulation of the alternative health care industry. This industry has grown in the last 10 to 20 years beyond all rational expectation and is now quite enormous. In Australia, the United States, Canada and Europe, the alternative health care industry has grown totally out of proportion to any rational consideration by the community to the health care return available from these products. If one were to look at the evidence available to support the alternative health care industry—that is, any reasonable scientific evidence, supported by mainstream medicine and science—then one would have to seriously question whether or not it is reasonable for the community to have responded financially in the way that it has in recent decades, with the faith that it apparently has in the alternative health care industry, and to have brought the size of the alternative health care industry to the magnitude that it now has. One would have to seriously question whether or not the current regulations and laws are adequate to provide sufficient protection and information to the community.
We currently, quite properly, regulate the pharmaceutical industry to the nth degree. We provide for a very rigorous standard of proof of efficacy of product and proof of outcomes in a scientific and medical sense. We provide for extremely rigorous controls on manufacturing, testing and clinical trials, and we ensure that there is no advertising of these products at point of sale or in the broadcast and print media and that they are properly prescribed by qualified individuals in a clinical setting. All of those things are done to tightly regulate and control the pharmaceutical industry, because, given their nature, these products must be handled in a controlled environment.
When we look to the alternative health care industry, the reality is totally different. It is true that the industry has products which, in some cases, can do very little harm. And, after all, what is the oldest admonition in the health care industry? `First do no harm.' But, after all, then we must seek to do some good, and if we are requiring people to part with substantial amounts of money—and we are talking about very substantial amounts of money in a collective sense—we must (a) first do no harm but then (b) in exchange for that substantial community faith and funding seek to do some good. If people are taking these products in exchange for those amounts of money, then they are in many cases avoiding traditional, scientifically based, clinically proven products and health care options, because people only have a limited amount of disposable income. Given the cost of pharmaceuticals, even though there is a PBS and even though there is a Medicare scheme—although one would wonder how long that might last; but I will put that question aside in the context of this debate—the funding available to the average family is, indeed, limited.
I know from my own district that chemist shops, pharmacy shops, are full of alternative health care products. The whole health care and medical industry must take some responsibility for this; the pharmacies, along with the TGA, the parliament and those who manufacture and distribute the alternative health care products, must take some responsibility for this issue. It is time that we faced up to it, and the Pan Pharmaceuticals crisis has provided the mechanism for that. Given the volume of these products in the community, this is a reality check for all of us. If we look at some of the evidence that has recently become available, we are finding now that there are very substantial bodies of evidence out there in relation to the efficacy of these products. There are a couple that I would like to particularly turn my attention to. 
In the alternative health care industry there are a couple of different types of products. The first is the homeopathy area; the second is herbs and related products, including Chinese traditional medicine; and the third is the relatively straightforward vitamin and mineral supplement area. Let us look first at the homeopathy area, which is a particular interest of mine. I have spoken on this in the parliament before and written to many of the agencies before—with very little response, partly because of the law and partly because people are reluctant to deal with these issues. I have singled out one product at random for special attention. I do not claim that these people are any worse than any others, but there is something special about this product and I do not think that they should go unscathed. It is time we had some specific examples out there, but other companies are equally bad and there is nothing particularly heinous about this example.
A company called vitaminsaustralia.com—`Your on-line health superstore'—currently offers Procare Homeopathic Medicine melatonin. Melatonin is not available for sale in Australia because no-one has gone to the trouble and expense of registering this compound, although it is freely available to customers in supermarkets in the United States, for example. This company advertise that Procare Homeopathic Medicine melatonin is `highly recommended' by them. They say that melatonin:
Helps relieve sleeplessness after long distance flights. Helps relieve stress, relieve nervous tension and mild anxiety. Helps relieve insomnia—
which, in case you did not know, they tell you is sleeplessness; and—
Helps provide stamina and endurance when taken in the morning.
According to the advert, it contains `3 milligrams of melatonin 6x per tablet'. The adult dosage is:
Sleeplessness after flights: Take 1 tablet 3 times daily from 2 days before the flight and during the flight and change at arrival to 3-5 tablets half an hour before the local bedtime.
As ANTI-STRESS active: Take 1 tablet 3 times during the day.
For relief of SLEEPLESSNESS at night: Take 2 to 5 tablets ... before bedtime or as directed by your healthcare professional.
This is a `low-allergy formula' which contains `no added cane sugar, salt, starch, gluten, yeast, wheat, cereals, colour, flavour or preservatives'. At the bottom of the advert it says, `Contains lactose.' The one interesting thing about this tablet is that it contains no melatonin either, because if it did the TGA would probably investigate these people, charge them with something relevant under the TGA Act and deal with them in the courts of Australia. So the one thing this product does not contain is melatonin, yet the advert says: 
Ingredients: Contains 3mg Melatonin 6x ...
For the uninitiated, 6x is a way of describing the almost infinite dilution of homeopathic products. These products are serially diluted again and again so that millionths upon millionths of infinite dilutions occur and in the end there are no molecules of the active substance left in the tablet. We have here a product which is sold for $22 in Australia—and this is consistent with the average pricing of these products—in which there is no melatonin left but which is sold as a `three milligram melatonin tablet 6x' so that no-one will understand the dilution and assume it contains three milligrams of melatonin. The way we sell things in Australia, 6x often refers to the magnitude of the product. In Queensland it might refer to a beer. 
—That's XXXX.
—Indeed it is, but that is the confusion to which I am referring. `Three milligram' usually refers to the concentration or the dosage, so `three milligram melatonin' would lead the average consumer to believe that this is a three milligram melatonin tablet when in fact there are no milligrams of melatonin in the tablet at all.
This product is not even prepared in accordance with homeopathic principles. Homeopathic principles are based on the `law of similars', so you should be preparing this with something other than melatonin. It is not prepared in accordance with homeopathic principles, which means that it is not prepared in accordance with the TGA's requirements and should not receive homeopathic registration. I would like to know, when this can be investigated by the TGA—with the normal period of time one would expect for that—why a product can be sold which does not even meet homeopathic standards. If they are to be sold as homeopathic products they should be prepared in accordance with the 17th century principles of the inventors of these products. They should meet the standards which are required of homeopathic products—which are bizarre and absurd, but if one is to practise these things one should practise them in accordance with the original standards.
Obviously I do not have time to go through all of the examples, but these industries must now put up or shut up. They should demonstrate the proof behind these products—and we as a parliament should require them to meet the standards of efficacy we expect from the regular pharmaceutical industries, which are required to show the efficacy and efficiency of their products—when they charge prices like this: $22. This is the price of regular drugs, and you take these tablets in large quantities—one to three times daily and two, three or five tablets—so the reality is that you run out very quickly.
Vitamins are the same. We now have large numbers of studies of 20,000 to 30,000 people in some cases and 5,000 to 10,000 in others from the United Kingdom and in America which show that many vitamins—including vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene—when taken in the normal prescribed quantities have no impact whatsoever on heart disease or stroke. For example, a large study recently conducted in the United Kingdom by a reputable organisation—the 21 million, five-year heart protection study by the University of Oxford's clinical trial unit—gave very disappointing results for vitamin use. It showed that, at the normal doses people take, vitamins produced absolutely no outcome whatsoever for heart protection.
When people took moderate doses of statin drugs, which were actually available at the same kind of cost, the outcomes were very positive. Large-scale trials of even healthy citizens with no elevated cholesterol outcomes who took a statin drug over a five-year period had very positive outcomes from a heart protection point of view, but the people taking vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene were not protecting themselves from cancer, heart problems, strokes or other potentially fatal diseases. That kind of evidence is starting to add up in very significant amounts. 
We still have companies like Blackmores marketing books with titles such as Real Health: the Blackmores Guide to Health and Wellbeing, which are available in every pharmacy in the country. They are associating themselves page after page with images of health and wellbeing and they quote page after page of information about how vitamins are associated with good health, about how we all need good nutrition for good health, about how free radicals in your blood will cause damage and how vitamins are antioxidants and will mop up this damage for you, about how eventually this damage will accumulate and cause heart attacks and the like, how their bottle of tablets when taken in these quantities will assist in repairing this damage and so on. Of course, it will do so at substantial cost to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to any other person who chooses to take it. 
The difficulty with this is that they can quote a single small study, as one can with any of those things, and claim therefore that there is evidence to support their claims, but of course at nothing like the level that one would be required to do with any of the medicines which appear on the PBS or which are marketed by pharmaceutical companies which are not permitted to advertise in this manner in any shape or form. In a pharmacy in Canberra yesterday I saw a drug, a lipid, marketed by these companies—one by Blackmores, for example, is called Lyprinol, which is an extract from a New Zealand green lipped mussel. It is marketed for about $29 to $30 for a box of I think 50 tablets. It is said to reduce inflammation. I have read one of their studies, which is available on the Internet, which demonstrates that there is some reduction in inflammation in rats when they are tested for inflammatory markers. There is a similar reduction when people take aspirin, for example, and there are even more significant reductions when people take any of the anti-inflammatory drugs such as Voltaren or the COX-2 inhibitors, Celebrex and the like, all of which are available in the normal way from your GP rather than self-treating with these medications from the pharmacy. The cost of the Lyprinol from Blackmores is similar to the cost of even the highly priced Celebrex, which people are concerned about on the PBS. It is actually cheaper to buy Celebrex at the private pharmacy price without the PBS subsidy than it is to buy Lyprinol from Blackmores for the starting eight-week dosage that they recommend.
So the reality is that the cost of some of these alternative medicines is becoming extremely high and the justification for their use is extraordinarily limited. The public are very ill-informed about the value, evidence and testing of these products, yet they are exposed to the most subtle and influential forms of advertising for both the worried well and the genuinely ill which we would never allow bona fide pharmacies and bona fide drug companies to provide. Retail pharmacists have effectively sold their souls to these companies, to these purveyors of snake oil in the 21st century, because of the profit margins being so high. Almost all of these alternative health companies would know the lack of evidence which is behind their products.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—I cannot confess to being as animated or as colourful as the previous speaker on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 but I hope to put some thoughts on the table today that may assist in dealing with what is a matter of serious concern not only to many people in the community, many retailers and small businesses in my electorate but to this parliament. What we are discussing today is a big deal. Some seek to portray the alternative and complementary medicine industry as a cottage industry, something akin to home brew. It is not that; it is a $1.2 billion manufacturing outfit. That is manufacturing alone, not taking into account mark-ups and retail activities.  
According to research, in the next 12 months more than half of all Australian citizens will reach for an alternative or complementary medicine. I am one. I take Echinacea and odourless garlic tablets in the hope that I do not get the dreaded Canberra lurgy coming up here. Do I know whether it helps or not? I am not certain, but I have been advised that for others it has worked, so I thought I would give it a go. I am one of those people who are part of that 50 per cent, perhaps in contrast to the previous speaker, and hold some hope that these remedies have some good going for them and that they will help with my wellbeing. 
I think that is what we are talking about today—the attractiveness and appeal of complementary and alternative medicines. We are all looking for improved wellbeing, we are all looking to maintain our health and we are all keen not to become pharmacologically dependent to achieve that, so we turn to these often natural complementary and alternative remedies for assistance. We look to science, we look to alternative cultures, we look to long histories and we look to the referrals of our friends to give us an indication of what works and what does not.
I talk about what works and what does not because at times this conversation turns into a dialogue about the efficacy of those products: do they actually do anything? The member for Bonython was quite eloquent in canvassing some of those issues. That is one issue that we need to address, but we also need to make sure that what we are consuming is what it is said to be. That is what these changes that we are discussing today are about. They are about ensuring that there is an audit trail, and that the manufacturers—and those supplying others for rebranding of their products—are doing what they say, and have in place the systems to validate the accuracy and quality of their work. These changes will ensure that manufacturers can provide that evidence to the regulator and their customers. Their customers, in many cases, are wholesalers or retailers of these products in communities right around Australia. 
These changes are about ensuring that if something is not quite right we can track it down. It is no good collecting data that does not mean anything. There is no point having records that cannot be found. It is certainly of no assistance to the integrity and credibility of this sector if people accumulate data on what they are doing that bears no resemblance to reality and, when that data needs to be relied upon to bring about a correction of a manufacturing fault, it does not take you anywhere. So we are talking about an audit trail, not just the steps and motions of quality control. We are talking about having that material available so that, where there is a need to remedy a fault or there is some nonperformance by a manufacturer, the Therapeutic Goods Administration have the regulatory tools and the cooperation—at least, not the obstruction—of those they are seeking to regulate.
This is a timely debate. It has been on the Notice Paper for some time and events in recent periods provide evidence of the need for these changes. Pan Pharmaceuticals have done the industry a great disservice. I have spoken to a number of natural remedy providers, health food store owners and naturopaths in my electorate, and they are devastated. They are devastated about being let down. Tamara, at Beleura Natural Therapies in my electorate, feels extraordinarily let down by the suppliers. She was purchasing products to retail in her business and to support her practice. Her business has been up and going for 18 years, supported by her own studies and research. Part of her business involves the retailing of these products and she has been let down by her suppliers.  
She has been let down by Pan Pharmaceuticals and by the people who purchase Pan Pharmaceuticals products and rebadge them. What has happened in recent times is extraordinarily frustrating for her because there are some who already question the credibility and efficacy of some of these remedies and products. Consumer confidence was beginning to be built up as more was learnt about these products and this path to wellbeing but consumers have been let down by those profiting from them—the manufacturers.
She is appalled and deeply concerned about the loss of consumer confidence in her industry, which has resulted from the appalling performance of Pan Pharmaceuticals. She was wondering whether there would be an opportunity for the TGA to be more interventionist. We have heard from some speakers on the other side that the TGA has been too heavy handed. We have heard from those in the industry that they have been involved in a witch-hunt. But someone in the industry is saying, `Maybe there's a case for the TGA to be more interventionist and to be absolutely rigorous in checking these issues.' It is an interesting contrast. 
That is the beauty of the arguments of those who are critical of the reforms the government is discussing today. You can have it each way. If it suits you, you can say the TGA have been too heavy handed, too interventionist, overly cautious, motivated by the consumer and not sensitive to the needs of the manufacturer. That is one argument. Or you could ask, `Why didn't they act earlier? Why didn't they pick up the fact that a few people were having bad experiences with these products and recklessly go in and rough up Pan Pharmaceuticals?' You cannot have it both ways. What is needed is a balanced approach, and these measures that are before the House today are a part of that. 
This issue raises some interesting questions. I read with some interest, and frankly some surprise, a letter by Vaughan Bullivant that has come my way. Vaughan Bullivant, living in Queensland, did quite well. He sold his business—with brands like Nature's Own, Natural Nutrition and Bio-Organics—to Mayne Health. And why wouldn't you? It was a lucrative business which, I understand, went very well. He no longer owns that business; it is Mayne's. In this extraordinary letter he is having a spray at everybody except those charged with ensuring that what they are claiming is in the product is actually in it. He says:
It's easy to knock a tall poppy.
No, Mr Bullivant; that is not what this is about. To use your language about tall poppies, it is about making sure the poppy is a poppy and not a carnation or a Schmackos dog biscuit. That is what this is about; it is not about knocking a tall poppy. If you are going to flog a product with `tall poppy' on the can, there should be tall poppy in it. If you are only going to put a poopteenth of tall poppy in amongst some other constituent parts, the amount you say is in it should be in it. That is what this is about. 
This is not some reckless, heavy handed way of fixing up the complementary medicine industry. It is nothing like what is described in this extraordinary letter that claims that the TGA have obviously gone out of their way to destroy a huge company. This is the biggest own goal in alternative medical history. They have kicked it themselves. This was their mistake at Pan Pharmaceuticals. This was their error that the TGA have rightly identified and sought to remedy so as not to place the consumers of Australia at risk. That is what this is about. It is not about, as Mr Bullivant would say, a personal vendetta against Jim Selim. The only thing that is personal about this is the grief that people feel because they have been let down by Pan Pharmaceuticals.  
In this letter you can read where he was reminiscing. Why wouldn't he reminisce? Bullivant's natural health products had a great reputation, as I understand it. They had occasional conversations with the regulator but Mr Bullivant talks about how they had 34 individual quality control checks over the time he was involved. Active herbs were identified and nothing was dispatched unless he was absolutely confident that what was on the label was in the product. It sounds as if we are on the same page of the same hymn book.
From what he is saying, he is an advocate for these changes. But his justification seeks to discredit the TGA's performance and the government's measures. It is odd. What he is saying he did is what we would like all people in the industry to do. He is talking about labelling and having the highest quality ingredients with `no artificial rubbish to cut costs, and the potency would be guaranteed to exceed the expiry date'. Great stuff! Bravo, Mr Bullivant! But he then goes on to apply his credo to Pan Pharmaceuticals and says that there has been a personal vendetta against Jim Selim. I do not think it is a personal vendetta against Jim. I know a lot of people in my electorate whose businesses have suffered because of his company's nonperformance feel that it is personal. They feel very let down.
Mr Bullivant goes on to say that freedom of choice for personal health care has always been a passion of his and Jim Selim's. He says that dealing with government regulators is like dealing with ignorance and that there is `a bias against our industry'. It is quite a remarkable outburst—and I can only describe it as an outburst. He talks about how through many years he has fought ignorance, inflexibility, incompetence—all these sorts of things—and claims that being regulated amounts to an injustice. If you are soaking up $1.2 billion from producing and selling something that claims to give certain benefits, it is not unreasonable for consumers who buy that product to get what it is claimed they are being sold.
In this letter Mr Bullivant asks, `Do they care that possibly hundreds of health product retailers could soon become bankrupt?' and he gets stuck into the TGA and the government for that. Mr Bullivant may be retired now, but he has missed the point here. It was not the government that made the product. It was not the TGA that put anywhere between zero and 700 per cent of the amount of active ingredient in products. It was not the government or the consumers that, when Pan Pharmaceuticals were asked to cough up evidence of their quality control and content in their products, could not find such evidence and there was a lost password and then a wiped disk and all sorts of uncomplimentary behaviour by the manufacturer. As Mr Bullivant says, this whole fiasco is a crime—and it is a crime. That is why I hope some people are charged and I hope some people are punished. This has done an enormous disservice to this entire industry and it has damaged consumers and small businesses in my electorate.
Let us talk about the broader issues here just for a moment. Mr Bullivant says that it needs urgent retaliation by health product retailers and the people of Australia—some retaliation for the measures that the government has taken. I am not quite sure whether this is just pure gusto and bluff, but the frustration of consumers and small businesses in my electorate with whom I have spoken as late as an hour ago is not directed at anybody other than the people who let them down, and they were the manufacturers—not all of them, just Pan Pharmaceuticals. This has been made more difficult by not knowing what that company had made or where it had gone; we could not track down what had been rebadged. Doesn't that evidence the need for an improved audit trail on these things? Isn't that screaming support for the bill that is before the parliament today? Why wouldn't we be looking for those things? 
I said earlier that, if it is going to be a tall poppy, make sure that it is a poppy and not a stalk or a carnation; make sure of what is actually in it. There is a reason for that. Some of these products are rightly recognised as foods in that there are no claims that consuming them will have any medical effect. There is no medical claim made about them. You might remember that a few years ago you could buy crystals that alleviated rheumatoid arthritis and things like that. No evidence could be provided to support those claims, so the crystals needed to be described as something else minus the claim that they will fix a lumbago problem. In that respect, the test was: sell this stuff, make no claim, but make sure it does no harm. That is the first level: make sure it does no harm. If we are not certain of what is in the product, how can consumers be sure of it not harming them? That is the first level of these products.
The second level of these products is that the history of many of them, particularly those of traditional and Chinese medicine, dates back centuries. Something happens and from their consumption some medical consequence is evidenced. You could look even more closely at things like folate consumption prior to and around the time of conception as being helpful in alleviating spina bifida cases. That is at the second level where we think there is some good, some wellbeing and some health-giving benefits from consuming these products. But again it is important to know what is in such products and for those claims of medical consequence to be validated by research.
As was said by Peta, a pharmacist at the Belvedere Park Pharmacy in my electorate, to whom I spoke this morning, there is a recognition that complementary medicines do in many cases, in many people's lives, sit alongside more pharmacological remedies. So pharmacies, through their accreditation processes and the like, are making sure that their professionals understand more about these products because there is some evidence available that supports their wellness and health-giving outcomes. If those claims are to be made, they need to be backed up and supported by evidence. And what is actually in such a product needs to be what is said to be in it. So those double-blind tests that are part of verifying such claims actually stand up, because your claims are based on a consistent ingestion of these products. So claims must be supported and Peta pointed out some examples of where that was the case. Gingko was one example where there are some rheumatoid benefits, and those claims are made. They are modestly made. They do not say that you will become an athlete overnight by consuming this product but that some inflammatory joint conditions are eased by taking gingko. So that has been proven and, again, you need to make sure that the active ingredient is what it is said to be to make those tests stand up.
The Bullivant letter is one that, understandably, many pharmacists did not bother reading past the first couple of paragraphs, as they told me when I spoke to them about it. But it goes further and the case in point is Travacalm. But you could even move into hypericum, which is a natural herb based antidepressant. It is understood to have active properties, but it is also understood that you do not combine natural herb with pharmaceutical antidepressants. With the natural herb having an active property and it being available over the counter—the claims having been measured in terms of efficacy and the contents verified in terms of the composition of the product—you still do not want to mix it with a prescribed antidepressant. So that third level shows you a risk that, if such a product is not handled properly, there can be quite profound health consequences. 
In my view, this is where we have the challenge—where you are seeing this overlap and potential cocktails of complementary and herb based medicines with prescribed medicines under the PBS. When those two come together, we have to have the smarts to recognise that that may not be in the best health interests of the patient. It also highlights what a difference that strata of products is from my occasional consumption of echinacea because a mate of mine told me it might help. This is where the argument needs to move, and that is why I support the review that the parliamentary secretary has announced.
This is not a one size fits all. There are different levels of claim. There are different medical consequences of consuming these products. There are risks associated with their overconsumption. There are risks associated if the active ingredient is in the product in excessive amounts, as in the case of Travacalm, where the excess active ingredient caused hallucinations and all sorts of horrendous health effects. There is that risk, but there is also a risk of combining a complementary medicine with a PBS medicine. We need to understand more about that. That is why these measures that we are debating today are necessary, important and timely. That is also why the review into complementary medicines in the health system, that Parliamentary Secretary Worth announced a couple of days ago, is crucially important.
My view is simple. If people offer herb based or complementary medicines but make no claim that they will have any medical effect at all, it should say that on the can: `Yes, have these. It might make you feel better. It might have a placebo effect. But we are not making any claims because we have not done any tests. You take your chances. It might make you feel better.' That is okay. Have it recognised that that is the level of activity. In the next level, where there is some medical effect, appropriate measured statements about that medical effect, backed up by testing, need to be there—above all, that there is no risk to the consumer. Then there is the third level where, if medicine is taken inappropriately or in volumes that are excessive, there are negative health consequences and that they could be particularly damaging when combined with PBS pharmaceutical products. We need to be far more rigorous about that. I see into the future a stratified level of regulation and disclosure, and this is a great step in the right direction. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I rise to support the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. The amendments to the original 1989 act and the Broadcasting Services Act are much needed and long overdue. In fact, the Australian public has the right to ask why the government has not overhauled this bill before today. Given the recent Pan Pharmaceuticals fiasco, they should be asking this government a lot more about what it is doing to regulate industry sectors such as this one and what it is doing to look after the interests of consumers generally. How embarrassing for the government it is. Government speakers in this debate are trying to push that blame somewhere else, but certainly the buck does stop somewhere, and it stops with government. However, the amendments put forward do improve the definition of what therapeutic goods are and how they can and should be advertised. The amendments do increase the application of the regulations under this act to all therapeutic goods. These are certainly all measures that are needed to increase consumer protection, industry certainty and public confidence that health needs will be looked after properly. 
Under the current legislation, some complementary products can be regulated as food and not as medicines, which means that those products are not subject to any premarket assessment or postmarket regulatory surveillance. Unless a product is specifically identified as a supplementary medicine, the checking of these products is not at all rigorous. But we all know now that in the case of one particular manufacturer, Pan Pharmaceuticals, even those products listed as therapeutic goods were not rigorously monitored and were not subjected to quality controls as the public would have expected them to be. Unfortunately, many people in Australia have suffered quite serious health consequences because of that.
Under these changes to the legislation, products will be defined as therapeutic goods and they will be subject to a fuller range of regulatory and advertising offences. Consumers rely on information presented to them in advertisements. They should not have to be scientists or health professionals to assess advertising claims. They should have confidence that government has already done that for them. Although governments obviously cannot check the claim of every advertisement, knowing that there are strong penalties for deceiving consumers certainly acts as a deterrent to deliberate misrepresentation or misinformation. In that regard, these amendments are particularly needed.
Further amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 have been introduced because of the Pan fiasco. However, having only seen them for the first time a couple of hours ago, I register my protest against a government that needs to hastily put forward changes because of its own failure to be an effective consumer watchdog or industry regulator. We hope that they have got it right. But, on preliminary assessment, these amendments do seek to stop manufacturers who seriously breach the act from regaining a licence after those breaches, and they do provide for a fit and proper person test—that is a very difficult one to ensure, isn't it? Further amendments increase the maximum penalties for the failure to comply with standards, the falsification of records required by the TGA, the misrepresentation of products conformity and the counterfeiting of therapeutic goods test results. These amendments also introduce new labelling laws that ensure manufacturers' details are placed on packaging.
The intent is there but let us hope that these amendments go far enough. As we have seen time after time, with this government it is a case of dealing with trouble long after trouble has been visited upon ordinary Australians. We have already experienced the One.Tel and HIH collapses and watched all Australians being caught up in the fallout of corporate mismanagement through higher insurance payments and the loss of community services. After those failures the public would be entitled to think that this government is becoming a little irrelevant in protecting the interests of employees, shareholders and consumers. But we would have hoped that health needs were absolutely paramount. The royal commission into HIH was critical of government's failure to properly resource its regulators, and I think we all feel that TGA should not be a scapegoat. They have responded properly in their role, but perhaps they did not have the resources to do what we would have expected them to do. It is up to government to make sure that our regulators have adequate resources, guidelines and the safety and comfort of legislation that guides them in their monitoring processes. 
It comes as no surprise when we consider that the highest taxing government in Australia's history thinks that industry self-regulation is the way to go. Trust is a wonderful thing but, unfortunately, trust is not what regulates industry. It certainly is about having processes in place, and self-regulation has been proven to fail. It is fine if companies and industry representative bodies are willing to invest dollars and technical and human resources into quality assurance and accountability processes, but they are not legally required to at this stage. It is really a trust factor. That is not good enough. Unfortunately, the Pan fiasco, coupled with the HIH debacle, does cast serious doubts on the effectiveness of self-regulation and on this government's ability to properly resource and manage the regulation, monitoring and quality-control processes in any industry in Australia. 
The therapeutic goods industry, which we are dealing with today in this legislation, does manufacture and distribute complementary health care products. No matter what you think about the value of those products to health care and wellbeing, the reality is that 60 per cent of adults in Australia regularly use those complementary medicines. The complementary health products sector is worth $1 billion to our domestic economy. It generates exports worth $200 million. That sounds like a sector about which the government needs to be very proactive. 
Everyone saw how extensive these products are when they saw the recall advertisements in newspapers—pages and pages of fine print, with the recall list jumping from 200 products to 1,700. I guess that is what prompted us all to go and look in our cupboards; and, yes, we did find them, didn't we? What products were recalled? They included the many herbal and vitamin supplements that you find in almost all medicine cabinets and kitchen cupboards in Australia. Claims about these products' usefulness range from assisting memory, warding off the common cold, increasing energy levels for people on vigorous exercise regimes, reducing the effects of stress or depression, and generally prolonging life and preventing health problems. 
Like 60 per cent of the Australian public, I am a real believer in some of these products. I have bought the student formula for my own children when they have been studying for their HSC; I have used vitamins to try to protect myself from the fallout of the stresses of a busy lifestyle, and I support those who look to alternative methods to treat medical conditions such as depression, memory loss and, of course, more serious conditions as well. For many people, these products provide security and comfort in their daily health regimes. If they and their doctors feel these products may be doing some good, then they certainly should use them, but they also should have the security and comfort of knowing that there is some quality control and regulation of those products.
I do think we have to acknowledge that the TGA did find the problem, and for that we are very grateful. It was notified promptly, but government failure was evident. There was some slowness to act, there was some mishandling of the notification to the industry and the public, and there certainly was a catch-all policy that had some serious implications for local businesses, including those in my own region of Newcastle. There are not many companies that manufacture to the extent that Pan did, so when companies are outsourcing to other companies such as Pan, they do not have a great deal of choice. They expect the biggest ones to be the best ones. It is appalling that so many companies have been let down.  
In my electorate, a company called I Think Naturally manufactures seven products, and two of their products were on the recall list. That company designs very specialised products to a very specialised formula, and it builds its reputation on its formula and its product. It designs the formula and then outsources to another company—not Pan—to manufacture the products. So the products are assembled by someone else. Then that company sends the products on to Pan to be put into capsules—that is all. Under the process that TGA has in place, the company that assembles the formula has to do rigorous testing and record the results before the product is sent off to Pan to be put into capsules. When it returns to the manufacturer it is again tested and those results are logged with TGA. Then it is given back to the original designer of the product for distribution and marketing. One would hope that all those checks and balances would have been in place and that Pan, which only puts the product into capsules, could not have contaminated that product. Unfortunately, we know that that may not be so. My local company, so far removed from Pan but so vulnerable to the failure to regulate and audit the performance of Pan, now faces serious economic loss. Do they carry insurance for that? No, I am sorry, but small business cannot afford to cover insurance for economic loss. Not any more.
TGA did have concerns about Pan Pharmaceuticals logged in January. One would think, if they had concerns about Pan, that they might have looked at the range of companies that would be affected, looked at the processes and perhaps tried to isolate the most serious ones. The other things that companies are asking me is: what does a voluntary recall mean? And what assurance is there for the public in a voluntary recall? There are some serious concerns about voluntary recalls and just what the responsibility, accountability and liability will be. You will know that many people are not seeking to send these products back, but many products have a two-year shelf life and one wonders if, down the track, we are going to see a continuation of problems caused by the failure to regulate this industry correctly. We do not know how the recovery of loss will be managed. 
In our region, where we do have good communication and media, we were not visited with largesse from the government. Our media were not given the advertised recall. It was up to them to advertise it themselves out of civic mindedness. I have to say to the government: in Newcastle we do not wait for Cobb and Co to bring our newspapers anymore. The Newcastle Herald is delivered every day as a daily newspaper, to the whole of the region, and has been for longer than I have been alive. But apparently it was very much on government's mind to inform only capital cities about this recall list, and regional Australia—not on the radar screen—missed out again. In Newcastle, the Herald did advertise a list. I have spoken to the editor, and I am told they had to get it off the web site. It was not in a form that they could download easily so they were spending a lot of time typing that list, with no assurance that they had got it right. Five days after the recall list appeared in capital city newspapers, the government did advertise in the Newcastle Herald—five days after the rest of Australia found out about it. 
Another issue of concern is that people who do not buy these products might think it is not important to them and that, if they do not rely on those complementary health products, maybe it is not something that affects them. But looking at the trading of the Pan shares, we may think, `All those people out there who are in superannuation, where are your shares invested? Is this going to affect you?' But they really will not know. The public of Australia do not know the fallout of this Pan Pharmaceuticals fiasco. Certainly in small businesses, small pharmacies and health stores, one would hope that their margins are sufficient to protect their employment of personnel and their income. But we know that particularly in small health stores there may be job losses—and that is the reality of it.  
This legislation does arise from an actual threat to public health and from a real need to regulate industry—and to regulate an important Australian industry. After listening to the speakers on this debate, it seems the government are looking around to see whom they can pass the buck to, but they are at the end of the responsibility queue and must accept responsibility for their regulation failures. Fortunately, we do have amendments before us today; but, again, it is too little too late. This legislation is still not enough to give the Australian public confidence that regulation and audit processes will be there to ensure that public health is assured to all consumers, when purchasing and using therapeutic goods. We would hope that witch-hunts will not arise from this legislation and that proper processes will be followed. We would also hope that there will be a follow-up to review the implementation of this legislation and that that review will be done rigorously and in a way that informs the public. Specialist committees and expert reviews are fine, but the public have to be informed so that their confidence can be restored in an important sector of Australian industry.

"May, Margaret, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—I feel very strongly about the amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 before the House today. This issue has been described as the biggest health issue to affect consumers for years. A few weeks ago Pan Pharmaceuticals was a company few of us outside the therapeutic goods industry knew about. We had never heard of it until it burst into the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Headlines such as `Australia's biggest drug recall' and `No apologies as Pan list grows' sent thousands of Australians scrambling to the recall lists and to the phone checking that their echinacea, travel pills or vitamins were still fit for consumption. It also sent a very strong message to some small businesses. The recall was having an enormous impact on them. I quote from a letter that I received from a business on the Gold Coast. It reads:
We operate a small store that is part of the Healthy Life franchise, and like thousands of other small businesses nationwide selling vitamin and other complementary medicine products, we have been left reeling by the Pan recall. No business could have planned for this disaster; I could have not imagined such a scenario ever occurring.
Yesterday, after several days of utter confusion, we were forced to remove hundreds of vitamin products from our shelves, many of which now lay bare. The small percentage of products unaffected by the voluntary recall, such as those made by Blackmores, will not sustain our business in the short term. This, together with the prospect of giving cash refunds in full for products purchased at our store by hundreds of customers, will put our cash flow in a parlous state.
Already, the sales reps of the companies whose products are not yet affected, are telling us that they may not be able to guarantee supply in the short term. If we have no replacement product for weeks we may be forced to walk away with a very uncertain financial future ahead of us.
To date, our customers have been reasonably understanding and sympathetic of our plight: they have asked for refunds but who will reimburse us for product—which in many cases—we have also paid for in good faith?
Who indeed will pay? I would suggest that Pan Pharmaceuticals have a lot to answer for. For many people their therapeutic medicines were clean, but for many more their tablets had to be returned under suspicion of being contaminated with foreign objects or having some ingredients—`active' ingredients we have now heard—substituted. This recall, while wide and far-reaching, should not be the focal point of these problems.  
The most serious case by far, which we have all become aware of, is that of a 10-year-old little girl who, after taking travel sickness tablets, became delirious, had hallucinations and was very agitated. We are talking about a 10-year-old little girl having those sorts of side effects. Pan Pharmaceuticals had overdosed this young girl with a single tablet of Travacalm. The single, small tablet had much higher levels of its active ingredient than was listed on the bottle. It was enough to make the active ingredient very dangerous to consume. How frightening it must have been for that 10-year-old little girl. Subsequently, the girl will have a lifelong negative reaction to the drug that was only supposed to help her tolerate long car trips with her family. Measures must be undertaken to ensure that Australians will never again have to endure such a recall, or risk sickness just so that they may take their complementary medicine. 
The recent experience of Pan Pharmaceuticals, with the suspension of their manufacturing licence and the consequent necessity to recall large numbers of their therapeutic goods, has made it very clear that the current penalties provided under the act are an inadequate deterrent to suppliers of therapeutic goods placing commercial interests over and above public health and safety. This situation is unacceptable and new measures must be introduced to ensure that the industry is aware that any risk to public health and safety will not be tolerated. The Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 is such a measure. The bill's purpose is to tighten the existing requirements placed on manufacturers and sponsors of therapeutic goods to further ensure the quality and safety of those therapeutic goods. I would like to take a few minutes today to speak on a number of ways this bill seeks to achieve this goal so that the Australian public can feel safe in the knowledge that their choices of complementary medicines do not expose them to any unacceptable level of risk and that the level of penalties to those manufacturers who fail to comply with the new regulations will be strong and swift. 
The first way this bill seeks to put this vision into practice is by increasing the maximum penalties for existing offences already in the act. Offences like failure to comply with standards, counterfeiting of therapeutic goods and a breach of a condition of a manufacturing licence will result in penalties of up to five years imprisonment or 2,000 penalty units, or both. Most offences will have a maximum penalty of 12 months imprisonment and 1,000 penalty units. These penalties are a clear message to those who produce therapeutic drugs that the government believes very strongly in the right of people to consume safe pharmaceutical products. It is also a testament to the belief of this government that it is the responsibility of companies to produce safe complementary medical products. 
This bill will also create new offences for falsification of a document that has been used for the purposes of the act. The government will take a very dim view of companies who not only produce bad pharmaceuticals but also attempt to cover up their negligence. The new prescribed maximum penalty for doing this is five years imprisonment or 2,000 penalty units, or both. I would hope that all good and decent people would think that being responsible for the health risks associated with producing dangerous complementary medicines would be punishment enough. However, I can only hope that these higher penalties, coupled with the dangers to consumers' health, will be enough of a deterrent to future companies considering the Pan Pharmaceuticals path. 
The bill before us also requires sponsors of therapeutic goods to maintain records of all manufacturers involved in the production of each batch of therapeutic goods and to have them available for inspection at any time or risk cancellation of the goods. During the Pan crisis we saw the difficulty the Therapeutic Goods Administration had in compiling a complete list of affected products. The crisis stretched on for days, with updates on which drugs were and were not affected. It was sending some very wrong signals to the general public—from day one they were not aware of which products were affected; and it went on for days. This provision is aimed at shortening that period of uncertainty—and we must do that—and to allow consumers to confidently keep consuming therapeutic goods that are unaffected.
Australia's standards are among the highest in the world. This bill is aimed at tightening the regulatory standards to make sure our standards are the absolute best that they can be. It also ensures that, in the event of such a crisis, there is a much more efficient way of dealing with the fallout. I commend this bill to the parliament as one which will do much to prevent the Pan Pharmaceuticals crisis from happening again. It will give certainty back to the general public, so that they can be sure that world's best practice in the manufacturing of complementary products is being undertaken in this country. The supply of unsafe or poor-quality therapeutic goods represents a very serious risk to public health, and this piece of legislation sends a very strong and very clear message to the industry that this government will not tolerate a repeat of this type of behaviour by any manufacturer in the future. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I rise to support the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 and the second reading amendment moved by the member for Bruce. This is an important issue which has certainly caught the attention of the public and, in particular, the consumers of those pharmaceutical goods that have been under question for some time. I welcome some of the provisions of the bill that will penalise those manufacturers and suppliers who are found to be in fundamental breach of their obligations under the law with respect to these goods. I welcome the fact that fines for individuals will be increased to up to $220,000 and fines for companies will be increased to up to $1.1 million. I am also of the view that jail sentences may need to be applied to individuals who act in such an improper and criminal way as that which appears to have been the case with those in Pan Pharmaceuticals. 
This issue has raised enormous concerns in my electorate, and I am sure that it has been no different in other electorates across Australia. Many people, particularly consumers, have been concerned and have raised their concerns with me and others. Indeed, concerns have been expressed by suppliers who will be adversely affected as a result of the complete failure of this rogue company to properly administer its business. 
The provisions introduced by the government in this bill are acceptable. One provision which I should touch upon is the announcement of the establishment of an expert committee, which has also been welcomed by the opposition, although we would have liked to have seen the composition and the terms of reference of the committee to ensure that that committee will be vigilant in the way in which it oversees these matters. However, it is very important to add that the bill still does not sufficiently address the types of problems that arose in what every Australian knows was the largest recall crisis in our history. It is fair to say that many of the problems that have arisen were foreseeable and, in fact, should have been attended to a lot earlier by this government.  
This is another example of this government acting after the horse has well and truly bolted. As already indicated by the shadow minister, the member for Bruce, this bill in its original form would still not be before the House—it would still be on the backburner—had it not been for the actions and conduct of Pan Pharmaceuticals. It is a worrying fact that the agenda of this government seems to be constantly delayed by the government putting as its priority in this place bills that seek to divide the country or to distract the community from important issues.
It has taken a recall crisis in this country for the government to act. It should be condemned for its failure in that regard. It also exemplifies the government's natural inclination against regulation. It has an enmity towards regulation other than self-regulation. It has an ideological inclination towards archaic laissez-faire forms of conduct in this country. That is something that this government needs to start to redress. It needs to consider that self-regulation of itself is not something that will be effective in many areas.
There is no more important area in this country than the public health system. I include in that the pharmaceutical industry, which provides medicines to the community. If the government cannot understand that in areas of health, as in other areas, it needs to look at proper regulation—regulation independent from industry—then we have a serious problem. The Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 does go some way to rectifying some of the problems but it fails to go the whole way. But that is not surprising.
The TGA should not be condemned so much as perhaps sympathised with, as clearly there are not sufficient resources in that administration to provide the necessary regulatory oversight that it should be able to use in this area. The government has failed to properly provide resources for the TGA. The TGA has perhaps failed, but in the end the government has to be accountable for some of the failures of the TGA.
Clearly, one of the things that has been raised in this debate has been the fact that the TGA sought to defer any prosecution against Pan Pharmaceuticals because it wanted to have nine critical breaches. Those breaches included: the manipulation of data; the deliberate substitution of products; deficient raw material and product controls; not being able to identify the source of raw materials; failure to clean equipment; unsatisfactory mechanisms, particularly with respect to documentation and compliance with such documentation. Each and every one of these breaches should be sufficient for a regulatory body to take issue with a company that may be in breach. It should not take nine separate, distinct breaches of law for a government body to act in order to ensure that a company supplying and manufacturing medicines is brought to account.
It seems to me that the regulator, whether in conjunction with the minister or not, has failed to act in the public interest to protect the consumer in order to collect, it would appear, more breaches than it had already discovered. In effect, it gambled on consumers' health in order to ensure that it found further breaches before it actually moved. If the government regulator has delayed prosecuting Pan Pharmaceuticals for this reason, then it clearly is failing the public and is failing consumers of pharmaceuticals. If indeed it failed to act because the company has a reputation for being litigious, then again it has failed to act in the public interest. Government regulators, particularly, I would argue, in relation to matters concerning public health, must err on the side of protecting the consumer first and not the manufacturer or supplier of goods and services. 
As I said, this government has become, however, very defensive about its failure to regulate. It fails to regulate directors' bonuses, even when they are paid to company directors who are overseeing failing companies. It has failed to regulate in these areas. It has failed to regulate in areas where the community is crying out for some regulation. This failure to regulate does not seem to apply, however, to the lowest paid. During the last sitting, it managed to regulate the wages of the lowest paid in our community and it seems to forever invent ways to apply prescriptive laws to those `awful' organisations, trade unions. But, generally speaking, it regards regulation as an anathema—as something it has to get itself out of if it wants to protect the consumer in these important areas. 
I did not have a particular interest in this area. I suppose I have come late to the debate in some respects. But I have had so many calls and conversations in recent weeks with both small businesses in my electorate and consumers who were concerned that I thought it was critical to involve myself in debate on this bill. I will refer to a number of local businesses that have raised concerns with me about the way the recall will affect not only them but their customers, my constituents. Herb and Sandra Tindall from the Healthy Shack in Sunbury have had to remove, as have many businesses, many products from their shelves. That has affected their business. They believe that their customers will remain loyal to them because they provide a good business, but it will certainly mean a shortfall in their profits and it may have an effect that will go beyond the next  few months. Indeed, Herb Tindall indicated that he believed that there would be a major effect on the business and that it would possibly lead to long-term insecurity if the saga continued.
The staff at the Woodend pharmacy indicated in the Sunbury Macedon Ranges Leader that:
... many people, particularly older residents, had brought in non-prescription medication, which they had been taking for months, to see if it was safe.
So there was some confusion. Having spoken to some of the pharmacists and natural health store proprietors, I think they are doing a very good job of ensuring that fears are allayed wherever possible and that people are properly dealt with, despite the anxiety that this recall crisis has caused. Natural Health Sunbury owner Charles Gaal said, also in the Sunbury Macedon Ranges Leader, that:
... up to 30 per cent of his shelves were empty, and the customers he had seen this week had all returned, not bought, goods. 
Earlier the member for Bonython mentioned some other issues about alternative health care that will have to be considered in the longer term. I think that is for another time. However, I think it is important that he introduced the issues of the efficacy and integrity of the alternative health-care system into this place. Indeed, many people rely upon these products, and I think it is important that they be provided with some guarantee that the products are beneficial and there for their use.
I spoke to Charles Gaal this morning to find out how his business was going since his comments in the local media. He indicated to me that there is more control and a little more certainty now. However, he said that many of his customers are looking to be reimbursed but have had to provide receipts for reimbursement. Unfortunately, not everyone has kept receipts, so there is an issue there. I understand that the main suppliers have allowed the replacement of alternative medicines. So, if someone were to have the product but not the receipt, they could swap the product with one that was not on the list of recalled products. Again, this has not always been satisfactory, but I suppose it goes some way to ensuring that, in this debacle, the consumer is not adversely affected by what has gone on. 
I think it is important to indicate to the government that, if they want to make sure that these things do not happen again—whether in this area or in other areas of public health—they really have to focus on the need to properly regulate. They need to ensure that regulation is vigilant and that there is sufficient funding to ensure a continuous review and proper regulation of this area and other areas.
The member for Bruce indicated that there is a Complementary Healthcare Consultative Forum, which met on five occasions prior to the last election. Its job is to facilitate consultation, and examine complementary health-care research needs, regulation, quality, safety, auditing of manufacturing processes, recall procedures and so on. But there has now been a failure of this forum to meet for all of this term—almost two years—and I think the government has to look at that. If it is going to have another committee—this time a committee of experts—let us hope that they are, firstly, experts and that they are there to serve the interests of the consumer, not the government. Let us assume for a moment that we do have a committee of experts. That committee must be properly funded and resourced and it must have the proper expertise. Also, it must meet—unlike the health-care forum which, as I understand it, has not met for just under two years now.
There is no point placing committees in legislation—or enacting provisions to enable prosecution against companies that are in breach and have placed the community's health at risk—if the government do not enforce the provisions and if the prosecuting bodies are too timid to prosecute companies or are not sufficiently funded to engage in big legal battles. So, along with the goodwill and the sensible provisions proposed by the government, I think there has to be a greater understanding of the need to provide resources and not wilt under the pressure of companies or be fearful about taking companies on. I know people think that big business is a friend of the Liberal government—and I am sure that many big businesses would say that they were—but I think that the government have to take on big business when it hurts the consumer. That applies whether it hurts working people and families or the consumer of its products. The government have to be brave and honest enough to represent the interests of the community against the self-interest of a rogue company.
I conclude by saying that I do support the provisions. I do not think they go far enough, and that is why I also support the amendment proposed by the member for Bruce. I think that the government should learn from this disaster. They are at the helm and they have to take some responsibility. I have not heard one utterance of responsibility to date. Maybe that will change, but I doubt it. This bill goes some way, if not all the way, towards rectifying some of the problems. I hope that the government can ensure that, along with the provisions, they provide the wherewithal for the regulatory bodies to enforce the provisions. I support the bill and the amendment moved by the member for Bruce.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—The Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 helps to fulfil one of the key roles of government in relation to the health system. It helps to establish and promulgate a set of standards which go to the very core of the confidence that people have when they take foods, medicines, drugs or preparations which in some way are aimed at assisting them in the care and protection of their own health. 
This bill addresses one of the core and fundamental elements in the way in which we protect our citizens and allow our citizens to protect and monitor their own health by establishing a set of standards and extending the regulations which underpin those standards in relation to therapeutic goods. It does this within a broader context, and there are two elements to the context: one is in relation to therapeutic goods.
All members of the House and all members of the Australian community are aware of the way in which Pan Pharmaceuticals had begun to breach its responsibilities and its obligations to the community. It did that for self-interest, over and above its broader obligations. As a consequence of a careful and thorough investigation, that company has been suspended from trading. I will not prejudge the final outcome, but I will say that the actions were swift, decisive and effective. It is an important message to those who would seek to produce goods for therapies and for health care within Australia that they see that the consequences of shoddy performance and a failure to adhere to standards are swift and significant. On that basis, I congratulate the Therapeutic Goods Administration for the work that they have undertaken, for the thoroughness of their operation and for the decisiveness of their action.
The second thematic point is that the regulation of therapeutic goods, medicines and health care relates to one aspect of a government's role in the provision of health and the protection and care of the day-to-day physical wellbeing of ordinary citizens. Firstly, there is the preparation of the drug and, secondly, there is the maintenance of the hospital system. We saw recently that, as part of the health care agreement with the states, the Commonwealth offered a 17 per cent real increase—an extraordinary and unprecedented 17 per cent real increase—in the funding for hospitals over a period of five years. The third element is in relation to assisting and ensuring that ordinary citizens in all parts of Australia have adequate access to doctors and medical staff.
Today—the day after the budget—I am delighted to be able to inform constituents within my own electorate of Flinders, that the entire Mornington Peninsula is now, for the first time, included within the outer-metropolitan scheme—as I know are the constituents of the Speaker's own electorate. That extension of benefits is threefold. Firstly, each new doctor who seeks to transfer to towns such as Mount Martha, Dromana, Rosebud, Rye and Sorrento—all of which have had significant difficulty in attracting doctors to this outer metropolitan area, despite its natural beauty—will receive $20,000 if they are transferring to an existing practice or $30,000 if they are establishing their own practice. That is a significant, real and substantial initiative.
The second benefit that results from this outer-metropolitan scheme, which is part of the broader concept of health provision, is a supplemental increase of approximately $6 to all non-vocationally registered doctors who seek to transfer from an inner-metropolitan area to an outer-metropolitan area. One way of looking at it is to say that it is an increase of approximately 33 per cent in the rebate which each non-vocationally registered doctor who transfers from an inner-metropolitan area to an outer-metropolitan area will receive for every consultation. The third benefit is that each doctor in an outer metropolitan area will receive approximately $7,000 to employ a practice nurse to assist with some of the most basic actions—for example, injections or preparation of dressings for ordinary citizens. All of those benefits are a tremendous step forward. 
Within the area of therapeutic goods, this bill covers not only what occurs with hospitals and doctors but also the medications available to individuals. The essence of the bill is twofold. Firstly, it provides for greater clarity and certainty for industry, consumers and regulators at the food-medicine interface where, until now, there has been uncertainty as to what are foods and what are medicines. Secondly, it addresses a potential gap in the risk management of certain complementary medicines which could pose public health and safety risks to consumers. In addressing those two objectives, I want to proceed in three stages: firstly, to address the background to the bill; secondly, to address its importance; and, thirdly, to address its key provisions.
In looking at the background to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill, we see that it is difficult to ascertain whether certain goods, because of the way they are presented, are therapeutic goods—that is, medicines—or whether they are foods. The definition of `therapeutic goods'—and this is important—currently excludes any goods that are covered by a prescribed food standard made under the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. Why is that important? It is important because this means that a food product which is effectively a medicine is free of any pre-market assessment or any of the therapeutic model post-market regulatory surveillance measures which exist as a standard and important precaution to ensuring that health products do not have adverse, unseen or detrimental effects. That is a very significant background point which leads to a problem that we face.
Why then is this bill important? The amendments contained in the bill will minimise the confusion or overlap that currently exists between those goods which in reality are medicines but which nevertheless are classified as foods and therefore can be excluded from the detailed and careful process of analysing the consequences for those who take them for therapeutic purposes. The risk is to public health and the safety of consumers. The bill enables the transfer of the provisions for the pre-approval of therapeutic goods advertisements in the broadcast media from the broadcast services legislation to the therapeutic goods legislation. Secondly, it plays a very important role in defining as therapeutic goods those things which might otherwise be deemed to be foods. Thirdly, it creates a level playing field for the provisions that apply to advertising for therapeutic goods in all forms of media. Fourthly, it simplifies the pre-approval and approval processes in a number of cases but extends the net of goods to which they apply. All of these things are critical.
The third element I wish to discuss is specifically to identify some of the key provisions of the bill. Firstly, item 1 of the amendments amends the definition of `therapeutic goods' in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Once a good has been or is declared to be a therapeutic good, even if it is essentially in the nature of a food, it will be regarded as a therapeutic good and therefore subject to the relevant processing, testing and approval standards. That is the most important area of the provisions.
Finally, in analysing the effect of the bill overall, I want to say that it comes at a time when we have seen the Therapeutic Goods Administration confront one of our major pharmaceutical companies in the area of holistic medicine or a certain category of therapeutic goods. There has been a careful and thorough investigation but one which, once there has been conclusive proof, has led to a course of action that has been swift, decisive and highly significant in terms of the force with which action has been taken. That ultimately fits into the broader government program for the protection and promotion of individual health, which essentially covers the areas of therapeutic goods, care and support for our hospitals. As I mentioned at the very outset, it also extends to the capacity to access doctors through programs such as the Outer Metropolitan Doctors Scheme. I am delighted to support this bill and I commend to the House the bill, its provisions and—above all else—its benefits for public health.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I rise in support of the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Bruce, Mr Griffin, to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. This debate is timely. Whilst the measures contained in this amendment bill are worthy of support, at the time of the initial motion for the second reading of the bill perhaps they were not, in the public mind, of such great moment as they should have been. I have had the pleasure of talking in debates about amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act on a number of occasions. I think the importance of the measures contained in an act like this has perhaps been a bit lost on the wider community. Regrettably, the events that surrounded the fiasco that is Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd have perhaps focused the minds of the wider community on these issues.
In the past I have stressed the importance of having a regime that deals with making sure that what is produced, registered and made available for purchase is safe. Of course, that is the driving motive of not just those of us on this side but the House in general. The arguments we have had about the speed of the response and the measures that perhaps were not taken earlier on are now in the political arena, and they are important in themselves in that there needs to be a reminder and the government needs to be accountable for its actions. The most important outcome we can have from the amendments that arise out of this piece of legislation before us at the moment, and the amendments that will be moved in the consideration in detail stage, is a more direct response to contemporary events.
The current circumstance that has caused the great discussion is, in the main, to do with a manufacturer that produced mainly complementary medicines or alternative medicines—whatever term we want to use as the vernacular. I think this incident has made sure that people understand that the standards we expect of things listed on the PBS, or that are seen clearly as medicines that require a doctor to prescribe and a pharmacist to dispense them, should apply to all forms of therapeutic goods. The discussions that we have had about the events of the past few weeks to do with this manufacturer, and also about the events of the last several months, are to do with that concern.
It is interesting that it was the original therapeutic goods legislation that ensured that manufacturers of complementary medicines came under the same standards and regime expected of other aspects. If we put that in context, I think the act is from about 1989 or 1990; I do not think it became operable until about 1991, so that is only a 12-year period. It is proper that we review the outcomes of pieces of legislation like this. I do not think we should get too het-up if people get excited and want to criticise what is happening under the legislation, because it is right that the piece of legislation should be open to review.
Originally, this type of manufacturing was brought in under the Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice. As I understand it, this has now been included in the Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products. The TGA's audit procedures, required to ensure that the code is followed in manufacturing practice, led to the discovery of the grave shortfalls in the processes used by Pan Pharmaceuticals.  
Other issues need to be raised. The Therapeutic Goods Administration was alerted to concerns about what was happening at Pan because adverse reactions had been experienced after the use of some batches of the drug known as Travacalm. It was appropriate that the TGA—in February of this year, I think—acted to recall that drug. Subsequently, an audit revealed a whole host of practices that needed to be condemned, if the audit is absolutely accurate, such as the substitution of different cartilage products like shark cartilage and beef cartilage and the fact that active ingredients were present at either above or below the levels stated to be in the drug. There was a list of a whole host of incidents that are shameful to think of in relation to a company that had developed a great deal of market share. It is ironic when you have a major investor in health involved—Mayne Health had bought out one of the herbal medicine companies which then had Pan producing their products on licence. 
There was discussion earlier in the debate about the extent of this industry. That is why this debate is so important. Many consumers, for a whole host of reasons, have been drawn to use the types of products we are talking about, which can be described as complementary medicines, herbal preparations, vitamin supplements and the like. In the debate the honourable member for Bonython has discussed the perhaps over-the-top claims that are made for some of these drugs. In some quarters there is a great deal of scepticism about whether these products are legitimate and whether they should have the status that they have developed. In the nineties, when I chaired the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, we did an inquiry into the prescription and supply of drugs, and the committee visited a manufacturer of herbal preparations. I only relate this story because it relates to the issue of scepticism. The particular member I am about to talk about has not been in this place for a while and I am sure that he would not mind me relating this story. 
The former member for Corinella was on the committee—not the member for Bruce, who was formerly the member for Corinella, but another former member for Corinella in this place. We were at this particular manufacturing place and we were being shown elements of the manufacturing. Ingredients were being ground in a mortar and pestle and it was explained to the committee that it was not only the ingredients themselves that were important but also the synergies in the use of the mortar and pestle and in the manufacturing. My colleague on the committee was rather ungracious about this revelation, using an expression that is unparliamentary and that relates to a substance we usually avoid when out in paddocks. It was highly embarrassing to me as the chair of the committee. That particular member for Corinella had the grace to quickly leave the laboratory so that further discussion of his comment and other comments did not continue.
Raising that aspect about these preparations goes to some of the issues we confront which go beyond, perhaps, the way we have traditionally looked at substances that people use which they believe have a positive outcome and the types of tests we have used to test their efficacy. That is the challenge that confronts the TGA, and we have to acknowledge that. It is important that our baseline not only relates to the safety of any preparation or product which is marketed but also assists, like we do with prescription drugs, with the information that is made available. I acknowledge that in totality the reasons for this original bill, the response to recent events and the additional amendments that we made in the consideration in detail stage go to a lot of those issues of information—making the consumer aware of what is actually involved in the manufacture of the things they are purchasing. It is important that when we review aspects of the Therapeutic Goods Act we provide people with information with which they can make informed decisions. So it goes to information about ingredients and to setting the types of claims that can be made for product efficacy and the reasons for taking a product. 
The latter amendments have come about from difficulties, especially at the time of the recall of the thousands of products, which revealed the important need for the source of manufacture to appear on products. That would have made the task of administration a lot easier not only in recalling products but in the public portrayal of the situation. There was a degree of confusion. I do not argue with the caution that is exercised by authorities such as the TGA but, at a time when the public consequences were uncertain, the case was put that there was a need to act as quickly and promptly as possible. There has been discussion in this debate about the measures that were taken over the several months during which Pan was subject to audit. Other measures that will be raised through amendments in the consideration in detail stage concern the character of people that are involved in the industry. That is in direct response to some of the aspects of the principals of the current public incident. It is also important for the reassurance of everyone—manufacturers who contract out, manufacturers who operate under licence, and consumers.
I wish to take the opportunity in this debate to again stress the importance of those people who give consumers advice. They must be provided with sufficient information. Why do I stress that point? Because some of the information that we provide to people needs to give recommendations that are more detailed and more scientific. There is always difficulty with the form in which we give information to the consumer. I stress that I want the consumer to be in a position to make an informed decision. I understand the limitations. Because of the complex nature of some of the products, the claims that can be made about these products may not be in any way intelligible. A very important argument about all products under the Therapeutic Goods Act is that we should be clear on what they do. That is why, especially with medicines that are listed through the PBS, we have doctors involved in prescribing and pharmacists involved in dispensing.
With over-the-counter drugs—drugs that can be bought off the shelf—we believe that we have the ability and capacity to do that in a safer manner, but we still need to make information available that allows for informed decisions. I note that the Pharmacy Guild and the AMA on behalf of the medical profession have done a lot of work in making sure that their members are made aware of information. They have made sure that their members take into account the effects of complementary medicines—which have been the main point of discussion in this debate—on the range of treatments that might be involved in patient care.
It is important that we realise that this is an industry that, as I said earlier in the debate, has developed a market share. Consumers are voting by way of their purchases. As was clearly illustrated by the member for Bonython in his contribution, we have to ensure that over-the-top claims are not made. On some occasions the placebo effect is the greatest advantage of some of the products people take. There has been great discussion about whether, if that is the way in which these things have some positive outcome, that is all that should be claimed in the label. By physiological investigation it is often very difficult to ascertain what these drugs cause. There is no doubt that, in some cases where there has been proper research into the effects of substances, they are seen to have a positive effect which cannot be clearly explained by some biochemical or physiological reaction. 
As I indicated, I support the comments that were made by the honourable member for Bruce in leading the debate for the opposition. I am sure that we will look at the measures that arise out of government action, especially over the incident involving Pan Pharmaceuticals, to continue to monitor the way in which the present legislation operates. We will look at the way in which we can perhaps help the TGA in their monitoring and policing under the Therapeutic Goods Act to ensure that we have in place a regime that leads to the expressed aims of the system. Those aims are to ensure that when therapeutic goods of any type are marketed and provided to people they have been assessed, their safety is assured and there is sufficient information given that will ensure that there is an understanding by the consumer.
It is the responsibility of legislators to ensure that we put in place an administration, laws and regulations that over time can return confidence to people in products that have developed a great following. As I said from the outset, I understand the difficult situation the administration finds itself in. It has a need to be cautious and sure in the actions that it takes because of the way in which manufacturers might seek remedy if hasty action is taken. But the important thing is that we have a responsibility to ensure that we put in place an administrative framework that enables them to do their work in the sure, confident and timely way that the community expects.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Draper, Trish, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—I rise to support this bill, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002, because it provides the Australian public with greater surety about the safety of the products available in the many pharmacies and health food stores throughout Australia. We have a duty to ensure that the products people are prescribed or purchase over the counter for their health are known to be safe and contain exactly what they are meant to contain. The recent recall of products manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals followed the suspension of their licence by the Therapeutic Goods Administration after TGA inspectors found a series of serious safety and quality breaches by the company. Almost 1,600 products have been recalled as a result. It is fair to say that this has seriously dented public confidence in complementary medicines in general and in Pan Pharmaceuticals in particular. This has had a serious effect on many small retailers and other Australian manufacturers of complementary medicines, some of whom are facing severe financial difficulty. These small businesses and their employees are suffering through no fault of their own and I am personally concerned about their future. Their situation has not been helped by some of the alarmist comments made in the media, but it is only to be expected that the public should and will react with caution. We should not forget, however, that the present crisis has only been caused by one manufacturer.
I wish to commend the Minister for Small Business and Tourism for the swift action he has taken to provide some assistance for small businesses which are facing financial pressure as a result of the present situation. Minister Hockey has written to banks, landlords and other key stakeholders, reminding them that the Pan issue is not one that small businesses could have anticipated. It cannot be in their interests or the interests of their stockholders to see these small retailers and manufacturers go under, so one can only hope that good sense will prevail and that patience and understanding will be the keystone of their business relationships. I note that Minister Hockey has met with the Complementary Health Care Council, to reassure them of the government's support for their industry, and that discussions are continuing with the major distributors, who have given a commitment to expedite claims by small retailers, such as health food stores, for refunds as soon as practicable on recalled products returned by consumers. 
Australians have long supported complementary medicines and I can fully understand their concerned response to the present situation. The Therapeutic Goods Administration is an independent body which is not subject to direction or interference from any outside source. It responded promptly and professionally to the discovery by its inspectors of serious safety breaches by Pan. I think that we should acknowledge this and take some comfort from the fact that the regulatory regime currently in place has done what it was meant to do. However, although there has been some criticism of the government regarding the recall process and the time taken for publishing lists of recalled products in the newspapers, I believe that through this experience the government has taken those concerns on board. The bill that we are currently debating will go further and provide consumers with an even greater level of information about the products they are purchasing. This action should restore confidence to the consumer and over time help to restore confidence in the industry.
One of the problems during the recent recall was that we could not tell by looking at packets or bottles whether or not they were manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals. The Pan products themselves were clearly identified but the products made by Pan for other brand names did not contain information about who made them. With the passage of this bill it will be law that the manufacturer's name must appear on all goods registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. All complementary medicines and therapeutic goods must be registered. We are adding to the reporting requirements of manufacturers so that any adverse events associated with the use of their products are reported directly to the TGA. A `fit and proper person' test will be added to the requirements for all manufacturing licence holders and an increased level of penalties will be added for a range of offences in the act that are associated with maintaining the safety, quality and efficacy of the products. There is a general acceptance within the industry that these changes must be made. It is important for consumers to have faith in the products they are taking. Consumers should have the right to know the manufacturer of the health products they purchase and they should feel confident that a manufacturer has to meet very strict requirements in relation to health and safety before it can gain a licence. This bill provides them with that confidence and it has my support. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—This bill, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002, has taken a while to get here. It was first dealt with on 27 June last year and it has been hanging around: we had a second reading speech then and it has taken almost a year to the day to get here. So one would have to ask some preliminary questions about why it has taken so long to be debated in the House, what the government's legislative program priorities are and what the impetus is for the government to now bring this bill forward into this House. We have, as we know, a recent crisis in relation to a company and action taken by the relevant government authority, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, against that company. We know that company has had its trading suspended by the Australian Stock Exchange. We know that a series of therapeutic goods that this company produces—and this company produces up to 70 per cent of Australia's therapeutic goods—were taken off the market when there were initially queries about Travacalm. On 28 April we saw something in the region of 246 products taken off the market. We saw a little bit later, at the start of May, that that had jumped to 1,546 of these items, both therapeutic and prescription, that it produces. 
We know there is a current crisis and that it has caused immense concern across the community. The government's amendments to this bill were completed and presented finally to the shadow minister only yesterday afternoon; even though the government has had a considerable amount of time to deal with this. As an opposition, we are not opposing those amendments. The shadow minister has, however, put forward his own amendment, which relates to the issues of the manner in which the government has treated this matter and its failings in both its response and its effective evasion of its responsibility in this area, because there were other priorities—campaigning priorities, might we say. The government might have thought: `This is only a therapeutic goods act. It is there, yes, and things need to be done. What is really important about it? It had a few problems before.'
What do these amendments fundamentally do? They go to the question of taking something that is a food and therefore classified as a food under Australian food standards. In the current situation—that is, without this bill being passed—even if a food supposedly has some therapeutic purpose, the people who make and market that food are not allowed to or in a position to advertise that supposed therapeutic purpose. Also, because it is covered by food standards only and it is not treated as a therapeutic good, the standard of proof about the nature of that therapeutic action is not put to test and the higher standard is not there. Under the current provisions, if it is accepted as a food then the secretary of the department, even acting in good faith, can do nothing about that.
The core amendment which we totally support—and which, by the way, we supported on 27 June 2002, almost a year ago—is that amendment which seeks to allow the secretary of the department, based on evidence that is provided to that secretary, to determine that a particular good is at one and the same time not only a food under Australian food standards but also a therapeutic good. Therefore, it would come under the aegis of this bill, under the aegis of the Therapeutic Goods Administration and under the aegis of the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code.
The other key element of this bill, which has been languishing for the past year, is in respect of the treatment of the regulations that are in place and how those regulations are dispersed. Currently, there is a series of regulations dealing with these matters. What this bill seeks to do, what it sought to do one year ago, is to take those regulations, drafted in regulatory form, and interpose them directly into the act—that is, make them part of the act. What it also seeks to do is change the Broadcasting Services Act, which is currently where you find what the legislative capacity of the government is to deal with advertisements for such goods. This bill simply says, `We'll take those provisions where they relate to therapeutic goods and the Broadcasting Services Act and put them in this main bill.' So we have a relocation of all of these matters that relate to therapeutic goods. 
In terms of the government making a determination about this, the current impetus to get this bill in and to have it accompanied by a series of regulations goes toward toughening up their potential for response to companies, such as Pan Pharmaceuticals, that are found to be wanting or can cause difficulties for the community at large. Why didn't they bring it on before? Why did they wait until there was a crisis in the therapeutic goods area before they brought it forward?
—No, this is in this House. The second reading in this House took place on 27 June 2002. We are dealing with this House, where this bill has not been brought on for debate. It has not been brought on for debate because the government has other priorities. In this House we have had one after another of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations' bills. The original single bill was brought in under the former member for Flinders, and that bill has been broken into about 12 parts. They have worked their way through the House and now they are on the shuttle. Having been knocked over, they are working their way back on the double dissolution shuttle through this House—and I think there is one due for debate in the later part of today. We may get to that. There has not been enough space, as the government has determined it, to deal with this. The result is that, if this had been in place, some of the problems that have recently occurred and given rise to the crisis may not have occurred. If the proper regulations had been transformed into full effect in this bill, it would have been gathered together and the secretary would have been able to take certain actions that may have had a beneficial effect.
The other government amendments we are dealing with today relate to how you respond to the crisis and how you deal with the situation. There is a fundamental problem in the government's approach—not the Therapeutic Goods Administration's approach—to these matters. This is a government that believes in self-assessment and self-regulation. Indeed, as people noted in the earlier debate today on the migration bill, we now have a situation on Nauru where inmates are self-managing a detention centre. The inmates have taken over and they are managing it. You could put self-management in as part of the government's general approach to these things.
In 1996, this government brought down the National Commission of Audit and said it did not want to be responsible for a single direct service to the Australian people. This government, through that audit paper which it accepted, said all it wanted to do was audit and benchmark—it wanted to be the silent participant on the sideline watching the game in progress—and if we had a crisis point, like we have a crisis point with Pan Pharmaceuticals, with faith in our regulatory system then it might be forced into a situation where it might have to do something. But where it can this government will just push things off to the states and say they are only their problem. The states do the only real work in this country; where money is spent, things are done on the ground and real administration is done. The government wants to be just the silent spectator, the journalistic overviewer, of what is happening within the society.
The general approach that has been taken has been the hands off, let them all regulate themselves approach. It is only if things really get out of hand in terms of public health and safety that there is any intervention. The upshot of that approach is what we have seen with the recent crisis. So the question of what happens here with these amendments also goes to the more general one. The shadow minister put our amendment in these terms: 
whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its track record of weakening the regulation of complementary and over-the-counter medicines and notes that we are now dealing with the logical result of its negligence.
The shadow minister pointed that out more than a year ago at the time the government was due to give its second reading speech on the bill. Prophetically, he said that if these things are not done, if the government does not take seriously the question of regulation, then we are in a position where really bad things can be done. It is quite simple. Many companies are involved in providing pharmaceuticals or complementary medicines, including vitamins and other products. About $2.3 billion is spent on complementary medicines in Australia each year. Pan Pharmaceuticals, on licence, was pumping out about 70 per cent of those. It only takes one company, no matter how small—in this case, no matter how large a part of that production capacity—to nobble the whole system. If you allow those who are doing the manufacturing and the asserting to have almost total control over their situation and if you let them self-assess, let them totally self-manage, let them self-regulate, you end up with the sort of situation we have had in regard to HIH and in other areas. There is all that self-regulation and self-assessment; the government is not involved, letting the market decide what is going to happen. There are people in this economy who do not want to operate in the way the majority of companies do.
I refer to a Bulletin article, appropriately entitled `A hard act to swallow', by Alan Deans, who dealt with the fact that it was not only the Therapeutic Goods Administration that had taken action but also the Australian Stock Exchange, which had taken action for good reason. When this company was floated, what it purported to be its situation in Australia in terms of what it exported—the purported strength of the company—has now come under question. What it has argued and advertised itself as being in its prospectuses and so on is questionable as well. Alan Deans does not go into why there is a problem with this, but he does say that there was:
... a 1995 conviction in NSW when it—
Pan Pharmaceuticals—
was fined $280,000 for importing evening primrose oil from Thailand. (The appeal is still pending).
The article further states:
The prospectus claimed that “Pan is not involved in any material litigation or administrative action”.
So there is a bit of a problem for the Australian Stock Exchange in relation to that. But there is a bit of a problem in terms of the track record of this company. It is a much more telling situation than that, in that the key person in the company got into some trouble before. The article states:
The offer document also claimed that “Pan has been recognised by the Therapeutic Goods Administration as having world-class facilities and best practice procedures”. Yet it made no mention of its founder, major shareholder and disgraced former chief executive Jim Selim having been suspended from practicing as a pharmacist in 1976 for professional misconduct related to his making paracetamol tablets that contained little paracetamol.
That is one of the problems in terms of what has been turned up by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. What is supposed to be in tablets that have been produced by this company is not there in the right concentrations. There is either too much, as in the case of the Travacalm product, or the product does not actually contain the active ingredient, as was the case in 1976 with the tablets that were being manufactured. That was two years after this company, Pan Pharmaceuticals, started. 
This takes us to the core of the question. A lot of the debate around this has been concerned with the nature of the industry and so on. But I think this goes to the question of regulation and regulation certainty in public health and safety and the fact that we have got a long way to go. There are a lot of things that need to be taken into account and there is a place for significant government action here in the future. I think it will be a Labor government which takes this action, because I doubt that this government would get in and do what is necessary here. It has left it up to private entities—our Australian universities—which are starting to go down this road. It is not just a question of being absolutely sure about what is in a product; it is also a question of the efficacy or supposed efficacy of goods that are produced as complementary medicines. There is a significant problem if you can overdose on a product or if you use a product, such as a paracetamol tablet, that does not have enough of the active agent in it; you may in fact suffer detrimental health as a result of that because you are not getting the right medication, even if it works properly.
There is a much broader problem, of course, which is alluded to in relation to the advertising controls over this industry. We do not know what the efficacy of complementary medicines is in any concrete, provable, scientific way. That has been the situation forever and a day. It is the situation with Chinese complementary medicine. It is the situation with a vast range of products that are used. There is some scientific evidence with regard to complementary medicine, as the member for Corangamite would well know. Complementary medicines can sometimes have a good effect.
I have had a look at the research on ginkgo biloba. I do not know why—it may just be the stress of work—but at times the mind is not working well enough and you cannot snap back and get the facts that you need. Evidence from scientific trials is that if you take 7,500 milligrams or more of ginkgo biloba a day—not if you take some of the other products containing 1,000 milligrams or so; they do not give you enough to make it active—it helps circulation of the blood and can increase the amount of oxygen in the blood. There are two noted effects of that that have been reasonably argued, one would think. One is that increased blood circulation helps people who have problems with pins and needles in the fingers and feet—in their extremities. The other effect is that increased circulation of blood through the brain assists with memory and the snappiness with which you can recall things. I suppose it helps to make the synapses work a bit better.
I do not know about ginkgo biloba at the moment. I have not checked out the particular one that I bought to see whether it has been affected by this but, as a consumer, that is something I need to look at. What I do know is that I would like to see the scientific work that has been done on ginkgo biloba have an absolute surety behind it. I would like to see the Therapeutic Goods Authority be able to go to scientific research that is being done now in some Australian universities on the basis of trying to prove whether or not there is a real health effect and a real health benefit in a range of these goods.
I cannot remember whether it was Landline or another program that dealt with this and, I think, Griffith University—if I had had the ginkgo biloba, the details might have been able to come back to greater effect! What they have been doing for a number of years is taking a range of complementary medicines and subjecting those medicines to the kind of treatment that prescribed medicines are dealt. They have to go through the same kinds of tests, the same kinds of double blind trials and the same kinds of control group tests that have, since the 17th century or so, been the underpinning of certainty within the scientific method. 
If you have, as part of the economy, a $2.3 billion industry that not only is not regulated enough—basically, it is up to the self-assessment of people as to whether they run it properly or not—but also has no fundamental basis where there can be certainty for the public that they are buying what is being purported to be sold to them, and that is a key part of the problems that have given rise to Pan Pharmaceuticals, it also raises the question of science. If you are putting a prescribed medicine up, you can see the scientific backing and the history of that medicine, and it has had to be proven by the company before they could go to market. We need that within the complementary area as well.
We support these amendments, which were a long time in coming. We support this bill, which should have been through this place last year. I support the shadow minister in his criticisms of the government and its laxity in regard to this, but I also give notice that we in the Labor Party will look at this area—in particular, to provide scientific undergirding in terms of complementary medicine—so that people are not in a position where they do not know that the real effect on public health and their public safety is just at the whim of the company or that it is at the whim of the company until the company gets caught and the government is forced to take action.

"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—Today I rise to speak to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. In speaking to my constituents, I have seen an absolute alarm at the need to recall the substances, rather than at the recalling of the 1,500 products. People in my community are concerned that a company like Pan Pharmaceuticals has breached its trust with the community, that it would place commercial interests over that of public health and safety and that, for the sake of a few dollars, it would put people's lives at risk just to make things expedient. Pan Pharmaceuticals, by its actions, has done immense damage to both consumer confidence and business confidence in relation to pharmaceuticals as it has produced them. The effect on the small business community is one not just of confidence but also of economic hardship.
We need to have a look at what this Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 is. It is actually an amendment to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. It addresses primarily the penalties which can be placed on a company. The amendments in relation to those penalties are:
Increase maximum penalties for a range of existing offences under the act, including where there has been a failure to comply with standards, false statements made in applications for entry of goods on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods ... , breach of a condition of a manufacturing licence ... , false statements made in a conformity assessment declaration and the counterfeiting of therapeutic goods;
Create new offences for falsification of any document that has been created, retained or issued for the purposes of the Act and for supplying goods originating from a manufacturer or manufacturing site that has not been notified to the Secretary;
Expand the compulsory public notification and recall provisions which may be used where there is a problem with a product or its manufacture;
Insert a “fit and proper person” test into the provisions for granting a manufacturing licence or conformity assessment certificate and  suspending or revoking a manufacturing licence or conformity assessment certificate;
Insert new statutory conditions of licence to ensure compliance with the manufacturing principles and reporting of adverse effects known to a manufacturer; 
Require sponsors of therapeutic goods to maintain records of all manufacturers involved in the manufacture of each batch of therapeutic goods and have them available for inspection at any time or risk cancellation of the goods from the Register, as well as requiring them to notify the Secretary of any change of manufacturer;
Provide for better identification of therapeutic goods in the event of a recall or where a sponsor applies for re-entry of previously cancelled goods on to the Register;
Improve adverse event reporting for listed goods.
The reality is that, as I said, a company like Pan Pharmaceuticals placed commercial interests over that of public health and safety. I am glad to see that the level of penalties for the range of offences will be increased by these amendments. The maximum penalties under the legislation will be fines of $220,000 for individuals or $1.1 million for a company and the possibility of a jail term for five years—and justifiably so. The current levels of penalties are clearly inadequate to deter, as evidenced by Pan Pharmaceuticals and Curacel International, which was recently fined in a Brisbane court for manufacturing counterfeit medicines. By having more tough and stringent guidelines by which they must act and by having penalties that actually mean something, then perhaps we can clean up this industry. Governments cannot be responsible for the actions of individuals, but they can penalise those that breach the trust and the terms of the provisions under which they act. What is also important is that these new penalties reflect a community requirement and standard to be placed upon these people.
As I said, this was brought to public notice because of a drug as simple as Travacalm. As a person who goes out fishing and who takes people out in a boat, I know how important these sorts of drugs are in settling people down so they can enjoy their day. But instead of settling people down and helping them avoid seasickness—in other words, as the name implies, calming people down during travel—it has been reported that Travacalm actually excited some people and gave them illusions of what they were doing.
Stamping down on a company that has performed this act of placing dollars before safety is something that we applaud. I applaud and congratulate the actions of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Trish Worth, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration for taking a tough stance on protecting our consumers. We need to take tough stances to instil consumer confidence in the businesses that sell and wholesale these goods throughout the community. I also commend and congratulate Trish Worth on making sure that people in regional and rural areas were not disadvantaged and ill-informed. There was an action taken to make sure that regional newspapers carried the full recall list—some 17 pages, with over 1,500 products named—to make sure that every Australian had the opportunity to be informed.
The Gloucester Advocate, one of my local papers, said:
Full list of recalled products 
The full list of products issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to be recalled following the suspension of the licence of Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd of Sydney is published today in this issue. Parliamentary Secretary for Health, Trish Worth, said that the recall advertisement was spread over some 17 pages. “The sheer size of the recall, believed to be the largest drug recall anywhere in the world, means that we will ensure information reaches all parts of Australia,” Ms Worth said. “I have spoken to a number of coalition MPs in regional areas and agree that this vital information is spread as far as possible.” 
Paterson electorate member, Bob Baldwin, assisted in ensuring the government was aware the list of recalled products should appear in all regional and rural newspapers, including the Paterson electorate newspapers. It is important to inform our people, our constituents, of issues such as this because there is a possible effect on their life. 
Many people would be aware of something as simple as a peanut butter allergy. One of the effects of a peanut butter allergy is that it can produce anaphylactic shock, which can be fatal. Who knows what ingredients have been mixed in these products? When people buy therapeutic goods they look at the list of ingredients to see if there is anything they are allergic to. Allergies can be as simple as a skin rash or result in the onset of asthma, but quite often they can also induce anaphylactic shock. Anaphylactic shock is when the airways shut down and make it impossible for people to breathe. It is a very dangerous situation.
As I said, there is also an effect on small business. I have received a letter this week from Des's Health Foods at Maitland. In that letter Noelene Pankhurst, who is one of my constituents, said:
We are corresponding with you as a retailer of health foods in Maitland and the consequences of Pan Pharmaceutical recall and how devastating it has been to our small family owned business. In the past week we have had to recall thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stock and, in some cases, it is recalled one day and back the next.
The letter goes on to say:
We have owned this business for 10 years and this is the most devastating time we have had. We need both help financially and morally. Can you please help the innocent victims?
I say to Noelene Pankhurst that, yes, we will do what we can to support her. But it is important that we do not blame the government for taking the hard decisions. We should blame the manufacturer Pan Pharmaceuticals for putting commercial interests ahead of the interests of consumers. I believe that businesses out there should take action, whether it be a class action or an individual action, to recover some of the losses and costs that have been incurred in this outrageous situation. This is a situation where a company or individuals purposely set about, as has been reported, sweeping the floor and throwing what they picked up into a batch just to make it easier to clean up and perhaps to fill some stock lines. Whether it was done on purpose with the aim of destroying the company or public confidence in it, or indeed of inflicting harm on anyone, is something that I guess will come out in any inquiry that is conducted.
It is important that we restore consumer confidence. I believe that this bill will restore consumer confidence because it can be seen that the Howard government is prepared to take the tough decisions in protecting consumer interests. I do not know how long it will take for an inquiry to be conducted into Pan Pharmaceuticals, and who knows how many other companies have breached regulations and consumer trust in going down this path, but I am sure that, under the guidance of someone of the quality and calibre of Trish Worth, we will see a never ending challenge to companies to make sure that they have complied with all of the requirements under which they are given their operational licences.
As a family man and a father of three grown children who take multivitamins and various goods to help them to stay healthy, I am personally disappointed. I was alarmed at the risk, and I know the greatest concern for the many mums and dads in our community who have spoken to me is that perhaps the goods that they have been taking may have had an effect on their children. Let us face it: our children are the most precious asset that we as Australians and we as a country have in our possession.  
In summing up, I commend the amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Act 1989 to the House. I ask that they be considered and put through without delay so that these penalties can be put in place to make sure that companies like Pan Pharmaceuticals are committed to complying with the law, ensuring the safety of all Australians.

—The member for Jagajaga asked me a question based in part on a remark attributed to me. It would have been made on 18 October 1999. I have now had a chance to pull out the Hansard, and the remark I made about not introducing `a loans scheme with a real or indeed any other rate of interest' were in the context of such a scheme replacing HECS.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—by leave—The House will recall that on 18 March this year it resolved to support the government's decision to commit Australian Defence Force personnel to the international coalition to disarm Iraq. The coalition undertook to enforce Iraq's compliance with its obligations under successive resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, with a view to restoring stability and security to that area of the Middle East. 
I am pleased to formally report to the House that the coalition's major combat operations in Iraq have been successfully completed. 
Australian military forces contributed to those operations with just cause, in an action properly based on international law, which resulted in the liberation of a sorely oppressed people. 
Australia's defence forces acquitted themselves with great distinction and professionalism. They rightly won the admiration of not only the Australian people but also Australia's allies in that military operation. 
I know that all Australians will join me in expressing our immense gratitude that to date no Australian casualties have been sustained.
On that point, I have been told by many senior members of the Australian Defence Force that the absence of casualties was due, in no small measure, to the predeployment of our forces some weeks before the military operation began. 
This pre-positioning added weight to the attempt to pressure Saddam Hussein into compliance and, more importantly and most importantly, it gave to our people the opportunity to acclimatise, thus enhancing not only their performance but also their physical safety and security in the event of conflict taking place. I again take the opportunity of reaffirming the correctness of the government's assessment in predeploying our forces, and I record the bitter opposition of the Australian Labor Party when that decision was taken.
Not only was the military operation completed quickly and successfully but it is also worth recording that all of the doomsday predictions, particularly the many that came from those who sit opposite, were not realised. The oilwells were not set on fire; there were not millions of refugees; the dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers were not breached to bring on catastrophic flooding; and there was no long, drawn out, bloody, Stalingrad style street-to-street fighting in Baghdad. For all of this we must be immensely grateful, but it is a reminder of the hysteria and the doomsday predictions that often accompany operations of this kind. And, just as many of the predictions about a Western Front style holocaust that were made in 1991 when the land war commenced were proved wrong, so the predictions on this occasion have been proved wrong. 
The decisive victory of the American led coalition reflects enormous credit on the strength and the determination of the leadership of President Bush. Again I remind the House of the way in which his role was vilified and traduced by many of those who sit opposite and of the way in which speaker after speaker from the Australian Labor Party impugned his integrity, assaulted his judgment and called into question his ability to lead the United States in this very difficult conflict. History has proved them wrong. The performance of the President has illustrated how infantile their protests were, and the leadership that he has given on this occasion, I believe, will bring about a permanent change in attitudes in the Middle East. 
President Bush and his administration—and this, perhaps, is the most important legacy to come from the operation in Iraq—are determined to do all they can to advance the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. 
The President made this very clear to me during our recent discussions in the United States.
Now that the major combat phase is over, efforts in Iraq must properly turn to humanitarian considerations, and we have therefore begun to bring our defence personnel home. 
This month, we will welcome home the HMAS Anzac and the HMAS Darwin. Both of them will arrive in Perth, at Stirling, on Saturday. The airmen, airwomen and support crews deployed with the FA18 Hornet aircraft will arrive at Tindal tomorrow. The majority of the Special Air Service units will be welcomed home in the appropriate circumstances for the SAS on Sunday. Later, we will welcome home the commando and Incident Response Regiment elements, the CH47 helicopter detachment and the Navy clearance diver team which did such remarkable work in the early days of the military operation.
Some military forces are still required to restore peace and security and to assist in the rehabilitation of the Iraqi nation. 
But our military deployment will be limited, given current commitments in our own region. Many other nations have indicated a willingness to provide peacekeeping assistance in Iraq. The government has made clear all along that Australia would not be in a position to provide a peacekeeping force after the conflict. Our coalition partners fully understood that and consistently accepted the Australian decision throughout all of our discussions. 
However, the following Australian Defence Force capabilities will either remain in or be deployed to Iraq: an Australian National Headquarters element; the HMAS Sydney; the HMAS Kanimbla and a naval task group command element; an Army commando element, for a brief period; two P3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft and support; two C130 Hercules transport aircraft and support; an air traffic control element to provide air operations at Baghdad International Airport; a security group for the new Australian representational mission in Baghdad; and civilian and military experts working on locating and eliminating WMD in Iraq. 
Our commitment for this phase of the operation is currently in the order of 1,200 personnel. For Australia, and the families of those involved, this remains, still, a very significant deployment.
It is our intention to ensure that the period of coalition control is kept to a minimum and that the responsibility for governing Iraq is taken up by an interim Iraqi authority as soon as practicable. This will be the first step on the pathway to representative government.  
It is worth briefly recalling the history of events that led to our decision to participate in the coalition's operations in Iraq. 
The cease-fire of 1991, which concluded the first Gulf War, prohibited Iraq from maintaining any biological, chemical or nuclear weapons capability. 
For 12 years the United Nations sought to cajole and coerce Iraq into compliance. Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of the United Nations Security Council resolutions, even in the face of a substantial military threat, demonstrated that the community of nations had come to a critical point in this long running conflict. If Saddam Hussein were to be disarmed, we had to be prepared to resort to force.
I remind the House, and through it the people of Australia, that the Security Council was unanimous, through resolution 1441, in its view that Saddam Hussein had continued his weapons of mass destruction programs and that Iraq was therefore in material breach of its obligations under a long series of Security Council resolutions. 
There has always been a fear that the more nations that possess these weapons, the more likely they will eventually be used. This fear is compounded when they are in the hands of regimes that show a total disregard for common humanity and the rule of law, aggressive and belligerent regimes like that overseen in Iraq by Saddam Hussein. 
But the greatest fear has always been that these weapons one day will find their way into the hands of terrorists. The events of 11 September 2001 and the atrocity in Bali, which claimed 88 Australian lives, have clearly demonstrated that international terrorists have no regard for human life.
Through its actions in Iraq the coalition has sent a clear signal to other rogue states and terrorist groups alike that the world is prepared, where necessary, to take a stand. I say on behalf of this government and, I believe, now a majority of the Australian people that we do not regret for a moment the stand we took alongside the United States and the United Kingdom. It was right, it was lawful and it was in the long-term national interests of Australia.
This government and, I believe, all Australians are enormously proud of the magnificent job done by the Australian military forces in Iraq. They have rightly earned the praise of their coalition partners. 
Our forces performed superbly in accordance with their very fine reputation for professionalism, skill and courage. I want, on behalf of the nation, to record our deepest admiration, our respect and our gratitude to all of them. Most of all, I hope that the situation in Iraq can be stabilised relatively quickly and that all our forces will be home safely and soon with their families. I am confident that these sentiments are shared by all Australians. In a sentence, they have done their nation proud.
I know that the desire to see them home is felt most keenly by their families, and I am very grateful that over recent weeks I and other members of this House have had the opportunity of seeing their families. 
There is, as we all know, a very special bond between our nation and the armed forces of our nation which serve our interests. When our forces are deployed to combat, we feel that bond all the more keenly. At the heart of that bond is the recognition that military service peculiarly carries a commitment to sacrifice.
When I visited Qatar last week to meet members of the Australian Defence Force it was an opportunity for me to directly convey the admiration in which they are held by the Australian nation. On that note, we will all have an opportunity to welcome them home in different ways over the days and weeks ahead. In particular, all the men and women involved in both the war in Iraq and the broader international coalition against terrorism will be invited to participate in two special parades through the streets of Sydney and Perth. Details of those will be announced later. I encourage all who are able to gather and join in expressing our thanks for a successful operation and our unqualified pleasure at their safe homecoming. 
When I was in Qatar I had the pleasure of meeting Brigadier Maurie McNarn, Commander of the Australian National Headquarters in the Middle East. I would like to congratulate Brigadier McNarn, on behalf of all Australians, for commanding our forces so successfully. While I know that his family will appreciate these sentiments, I also know that their attention will be overwhelmingly focused on his homecoming, now just a few short days away. Whilst in Qatar I had the opportunity of meeting so many of our forces and being reminded of the distinctive Australian character that Australian defence personnel always bring to an operation. One marvellous illustration I was given was a T-shirt embossed with the description, `Australian Mountaineering Club'. The highest point in Qatar is 100 metres.
The military campaign in Iraq was astonishingly speedy and effective. It has been a remarkable campaign and it reflects very great tribute on American military leadership. There was no shortage of occupants of armchairs ridiculing the American Defense Secretary because the war was not over within two or three days and calling into question the military tactics that were being employed. But it was a very successful operation and, most importantly, every attempt was made by the coalition forces to ensure that civilian casualties were kept to an absolute minimum. Our quarrel was not with the Iraqi people but with the regime of Saddam Hussein. When that regime fell, we did not note or accept its fall; we welcomed it and we joined with the Iraqi people in rejoicing in the fall of that regime.
We did not rely only on technology and on the use of precision guided weapons but also relied on strict targeting policies—policies which Saddam Hussein tried to take advantage of. It is a cruel irony that the Iraqi leadership had far less regard for the wellbeing of the Iraqi people than the coalition forces. How else can you explain the placement of artillery, military communications systems, munitions stores and the like in urban areas, in schools, in kindergartens and in hospitals? That occurred all over Iraq. 
It is a testament not only to our fighting men and women but also to our defence hierarchy that, when missions were aborted out of concern for the impact on civilians, such decisions were praised and not admonished.
In this context, the government also wants to pay tribute to the contributions of the American, British and other coalition forces. They have behaved and conducted themselves with very great honour and distinction. The coalition has, I believe, set new standards of integrity and ethical behaviour in military conflict. This new attitude reflects the reality that the modern man or woman in the military is as much a conciliator and peacemaker as he or she is a war fighter.
The speed and effectiveness of the coalition campaign also reflects the lack of organised military operations by the Iraqi forces against the coalition. Perhaps we should not have been surprised at this. It was probably the first signal of the real feelings of the Iraqi people: they were not willing to sacrifice their lives to protect a brutal despot. 
Saddam Hussein was not, and never was, Iraq. Once they could be sure that his regime was crumbling and that they could be guaranteed allied sustenance and support, we saw in the streets of Baghdad, Basra and hundreds of other towns all over Iraq expressions of joy—the sheer joy of freedom. 
Of course, for some that joy is tempered by sadness. Tragically, despite all the efforts of the coalition, there have been civilian casualties. The death of innocent people—especially children—should always shock and sadden us lest we lose our basic humanity. But when we consider the civilian death and suffering in Iraq now, and we are touched by it and grieve for it, we must not forget the deaths and suffering of millions of Iraqis over the past 25 years. Nor should we forget the deaths, the torture and injury and the devastation inflicted by Saddam Hussein's regime on neighbouring Arab countries. 
Saddam Hussein and his regime stand accused of the most serious crimes against humanity. Since Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979, torture and summary executions have been a routine mechanism of state control. 
You would have all read the reports of the most diabolical and cruel punishments. The coalition forces have only just begun the task of collecting specific and hard evidence of these terrible violations of human rights. They have already uncovered considerable circumstantial evidence but the task of gathering proof will be time-consuming, difficult, frustrating and harrowing—especially for the families of the victims. 
Despite its dark past, Iraq now has a promising future. But it is a period now of enormous challenge. 
Security is the most immediate priority. The people of Iraq cannot consider their future until their day-to-day security is assured. They must be able to go to work, to go to school, to meet and to discuss issues freely. 
The coalition must also work to provide basic humanitarian support for the Iraqis. Without secure food supplies, clean drinking water, functioning sewerage systems, reliable electricity, transport and fuel, there will be little opportunity for the Iraqi people to turn their attention to their political infrastructure. 
But in this regard it is critical that the world not believe that the current dilapidated state of Iraq's infrastructure is entirely due to military conflict. Even before the conflict started, Iraq's infrastructure was severely degraded. The telecommunications network required urgent attention. Oil and gas infrastructure had deteriorated greatly. Electricity generation was less than half its nominal capacity, and that was before the military operation started. And, partly because of the poor state of the distribution system, power cuts throughout Iraq were common. Water supplies were increasingly vulnerable to contamination by raw sewage, and access to safe drinking water was a major concern. 
These deficiencies stem from longstanding neglect and diversion of resources to weapons programs by the former Iraqi regime. It is salutary to be reminded that more Iraqi lives have been lost to dirty drinking water than to the recent conflict. 
Australia takes its rehabilitation responsibilities very seriously. Our contribution—as in the conflict phase—will focus our limited resources in niche areas where we have expertise and where a concentrated effort can make a real difference. We have already committed some $100 million in aid—well in advance of many other countries that have been loud in their criticism by implication of Australia's actions. We have provided highly skilled personnel to contribute to key humanitarian planning and reconstruction efforts. 
We are very keen to play a strong role in rehabilitating Iraqi agriculture, and I am pleased to note that the respected agricultural figure Mr Trevor Flugge is sharing with an American counterpart the joint control of the department concerned with the revival and recovery of Iraqi agriculture. This is an area where our experience of dryland farming, salination and irrigation may prove very useful to the Iraqi people. Another focus of our humanitarian efforts will be in the water and sanitation sector.  
In addition to meeting these obligations, the coalition is working hard to rid Iraq of all weapons of mass destruction. The hunt for these weapons will not be easy. We know that in order to protect them from inspectors, the Iraqi regime broke them up and hid them in their disaggregated condition in different parts of the country. 
But the coalition are starting to uncover the evidence. They have found what appear to be mobile biological weapons production facilities, just like those described by Secretary of State Colin Powell to the Security Council in February, when his efforts were derided by the French foreign minister and others. 
It is going to take considerable time and resources to complete the investigation and destruction of the regime's weapons of mass destruction. But at least we will no longer be obstructed, as we have been in the past, by a hostile regime. 
Australia has joined the United States and Great Britain as partners in the coalition transitional authority in Iraq. The aim of the coalition is to create the circumstances in which the Iraqis will have the opportunity to establish a representative government of their choosing and nobody else's. We are not in the business of imposing a particular model of democracy on the Iraqi people. 
The transitional phase will be immensely challenging. Restoring political stability and promoting democracy in Iraq are daunting tasks. Iraq has no history of representative democracy and is marked by significant religious and ethnic divides. It will also take time and sustained effort to overcome the corrosive effects of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship. 
But on the plus side Iraq is a relatively modern and sophisticated country with very good economic prospects, not just because of its oil resources but because its people are strong and well-skilled and have a strong entrepreneurial ethos.
While it is not for the coalition to dictate the form of Iraq's new government, we will seek to establish a representative process so that Iraqis can, for the first time, choose their leaders via a process that respects democratic principles and respects Iraq's religious and ethnic mix. As a committed supporter of the Australian democratic system, it should be no surprise that I have speculated that a federal model may be appropriate. But again it is up to the Iraqi people to determine the best way to preserve Iraq's territorial integrity and enhance the stability of the immediate region.
The government considers that the United Nations could play a significant, practical role in support of the transitional process. 
The United Nations is best placed to help mobilise and coordinate aid efforts, help transfer power to the Iraqis, and consolidate international acceptance of the new regime. But the Security Council will need to act much more constructively than it has to date if the United Nations is to have any meaningful role in rehabilitating Iraq. That was a view that I conveyed on behalf of the government to the Secretary-General of the United Nations when I saw him in New York last week. 
My talks last week with President Bush underlined the deepening and strengthening relationship between our two nations. The relationship between Australia and the United States has never been stronger. This relationship is not forced or contrived. We are allies because we are friends—very close friends. And that friendship is based above everything else on a commonality of views. We share a view of the world that values freedom and individual liberty.  
Both our nations recognise the threat posed to our communities by international terrorists. We understand the dangers of leaving the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction unchecked. Our longstanding security alliance with the United States provides a solid and reliable basis for us to cooperate on addressing these issues. 
The shared intelligence and the access to cutting edge defence and security technologies that the alliance facilitates are vital to ensuring Australia's security and will only become more important in the future. As I have said before, the importance of the relationship with the United States will grow rather than diminish with the passage of time.
But neither the United States or Australia seeks to promote this relationship at the expense of another. The government will continue to develop and enhance relationships whenever and wherever we can see an advantage for Australia. Our national interest is always best served by a network of alliances, friendships and relationships.
I also wish to place on record my great respect for the strength of leadership displayed by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. He is a strong Labour leader in the best traditions of that term. Australia's relationship with the United Kingdom is not a relic of history. It is rich, contemporary and diverse. It extends across so many generations in so many areas and has, of course, been reinforced by recent experience. 
Without the determination demonstrated by President Bush and his administration and without the dogged resolve in the face of considerable domestic difficulty—not least within his own party—of Mr Blair, Saddam Hussein's intransigence would never have been addressed. 
The strengthening of these longstanding and important ties with America and Britain does not mean for a moment that Australia has diminished other important relationships. Indeed, we have been very careful to ensure that our region understands our involvement in Iraq. 
Earlier this year, as the House would be aware, I visited Indonesia to consult President Megawati on a number of matters, including Australia's attitude to the challenge of Iraq. Although Indonesia has taken a very different position on Iraq, the president made plain—then by her words and subsequently by the action of her government—that Indonesia did not want this issue to affect our close bilateral relationship. 
On the occasion of my visit, she specifically assured me that Indonesia would not view a military operation to oust Saddam Hussein as being in any way an attack on Islam.
Importantly, against the background of a mythology that in some way Australia was taking a stance on Iraq that was out of step with nations in our region, let me remind you that many close friends and partners of Australia in the region—particularly Japan, Korea and Singapore—were strong supporters of the coalition action. Therefore, it has always been wrong to characterise our participation in Iraq as somehow being out of step with our neighbours in the region.
Mr Speaker, I return to the question of Israel and the Palestinians. As I have indicated, I drew very great encouragement from President Bush's clearly stated determination, both in public and in private, to work as hard as possible to achieve a peace settlement between Israelis and Palestinians. Australia, as the House knows, has been a staunch friend and ally of Israel for more than 50 years. And there is no-one in this House who has a greater admiration for the stoic persistence, behaviour and resistance of the Israeli people over that 50-year period. 
But the government also believes very strongly in the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people. We believe in an independent Palestinian state, and I am pleased to report that there is a growing belief within many sections of the Jewish community in Australia that the emergence of an independent Palestinian state is also integral to a lasting settlement in the Middle East.
During the military operations, the Prime Minister of Israel telephoned me to express his gratitude for Australia's contribution to the campaign to oust Saddam Hussein, particularly having regard to the operations of some of our forces. I took the opportunity during that discussion, whilst repeating the enduring friendship of the Australian people towards Israel, of reiterating our commitment to working closely with other nations to bring about a lasting settlement. We have seen progress made. We now have a Prime Minister of the Palestinian Council. We have seen Secretary of State Colin Powell visit the area. There is the prospect of a meeting between the Palestinian Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Israel. All of these things should be a source of enormous comfort and enormous encouragement. And may I say that nobody could have put it better than the eminent British writer William Shawcross when, in his Harkness lecture in March this year, he said, in predicting some of the outcomes of a successful military operation in Iraq, that the road to a Middle East peace settlement could well lie through Baghdad. I believe that one of the lasting legacies of the successful military operation could be this momentum for a renewed attempt to bring about an end to this horrible conflict that has devoured so much, claimed so many lives and brought such sadness and so many sick hearts to people of goodwill both in Israel and amongst the Palestinians.
I know how committed both the British Prime Minister and the American President are to the cause of a peace settlement, and I am sure that this is something that can unite all members of this House. We admire and support the people of Israel, but we also recognise that in the long run there must be dignity, respect and independence for the people of former Palestine—for the Palestinians. If that can be achieved then it will be one of the great and enduring legacies of the American led action.
I have told both President Bush and the British Prime Minister that we will do everything we can to assist to achieve a successful outcome. As a nation we are held in high regard in those parts of the world, and there is a contribution that we can make. It will not be easy, but one thing should be clearly understood and give hope: that there is renewed determination amongst so many others. If ever there was a moment for Israel and the Palestinians to seize, it is this moment, and we hope that they will grab hold of the opportunity.
In concluding, can I again express on behalf of the House our sense of gratitude, our sense of relief and our sense of pleasure that our forces have escaped any casualties. The people that we think of most when we commit this nation to military conflict are, of course, the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. They fought magnificently; they behaved magnificently. They were not only war fighters; they were great conciliators and they were great peacemakers. 
Can I finally express my gratitude to all of my colleagues. This was a difficult issue and, in looking at all of you and addressing you, can I say that I know some of you at various stages had worries and reservations—that is perfectly natural; it was very difficult. So did a lot of our fellow Australians; I understood that. What I want to say to all of you is that the trust you reposed in me, the trust you reposed in the decision of the government, the way in which you all loyally supported that decision and, if I may borrow a word from the other discipline, the solidarity that you displayed during those times, was to me a source of great inspiration and great encouragement. Can I also say that I think it impressed the Australian people, because in the end, even if the Australian people may have reservations about a particular decision and may worry about it, if those who have taken that decision and those who have invested what authority they have in that decision show a sense of purpose, a sense of commitment, a sense of unity and a sense of mutual loyalty, then the Australian people will trust their judgment. I, therefore, to all of my colleagues record my gratitude. It was very important to me, and it was very important to the other members of the National Security Committee. Finally, can I also especially thank Alexander Downer, the foreign minister, and Senator Robert Hill, the defence minister, who day by day were my regular interlocutors on this matter and discharged their obligations.
Australia can be proud of what it did. We did the right thing; we did the lawful thing. We brought freedom and liberty to an oppressed people, and that is something about which we should always be, I think, properly and eternally proud.
Mr Speaker, I will not be able to listen to the Leader of the Opposition's reply because I am going to Government House to call on the Administrator designate, and I hope the Leader of the Opposition will not construe that as being in any way offensive to him. I present a copy of my ministerial statement.

Question agreed to.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,13,1
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—Thankfully, the war in Iraq is over, but the peace is still not secured—not in Iraq and certainly not in the Middle East. In the months ahead, as Australians reflect on the war in Iraq, they will remember all of the half-truths and the misinformation provided by our Prime Minister in his justification for the war. The Australian people will not forget that this government and this Prime Minister took Australia to a war that was unnecessary, illegal and unjust. They will not forget that this government was never once prepared to tell the Australian people the truth about the commitments it had made prior to the war. I do not have any quibble about the Prime Minister saying what defence forces told him about the necessity for predeployment. All I ever argued is that the Prime Minister should have had the courage to tell the troops the reason for them being predeployed in the first instance.
But mostly the Australian people will reflect on the Prime Minister's plea that this war was necessary because Iraq had nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction. In his speech today the Prime Minister hardly mentioned weapons of mass destruction. The justification has disappeared; it is something to be glossed over. He now talks about regime change and the liberation of Iraq as the reason Australia went to war; but before the war he specifically said regime change was not his policy. In terms of the weapons of mass destruction, the fact is that they do not exist in the quantities claimed by the Prime Minister in advance of the war. Just remember, in his statement to this place back on 4 February the Prime Minister stood at that dispatch box and said: 
Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program ...
The International Atomic Energy Agency now says there is no evidence of a nuclear weapons program. The Prime Minister stood at that dispatch box and also said:
all key aspects ... of Iraq's ... biological weapons program—
including weaponisation—
are active ... and more advanced than they were before the Gulf War in 1991.
That was not true either. Iraq did not present the imminent strategic threat that the Prime Minister cited as his reason for going to war. He deceived the nation, and he deceived the parliament as well.
The disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and the regime of Saddam Hussein was essential, and it was always strongly supported by the Labor Party. It was also supported unanimously by the UN Security Council in resolution 1441. The report of Dr Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei showed that progress was being made under that resolution. They argued that, given more time, they could have achieved the peaceful disarmament of Iraq. So the question still remains as to why the Prime Minister chose war when a peaceful solution was available.
The fact of it is that the commitment to war was made—wrongly, in our view and in the view of millions of Australians. But, with the country having been committed to war, Labor said that we hoped that the conflict would end quickly and that the troops would be able to come home as soon as possible. All Australians did welcome the end of the war, and they were thankful that there were no casualties among the brave men and women of the Australian Defence Force. But many people did lose their lives, including over 170 coalition soldiers and a still unknown number of innocent Iraqi civilians. As a result of this conflict, many Australians have been concerned by images of Iraqi people without food, water or shelter—particularly young children. Australians are also concerned about the increased threat to us from terrorist activity as a result of our participation in military action in Iraq. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, sitting at the table now, had the courage to admit that Australia was at greater risk from terrorism because of our involvement. It is something that the Prime Minister has never admitted. He in fact continues to deny the increased threat, but you only have to look at the increased budget spending last night on counter-terrorism measures to see how real that increased threat has become.
Today many Australians will be asking: who was behind the bombing in Saudi Arabia that has killed at least one Australian and injured another? Australians are also asking themselves: has this war made our country a more secure place or a less secure place in our region? The majority of them will say `less secure'. Many Australians are deeply disappointed at the way in which the government has been willing to flout international law and to undermine the United Nations in the pursuit of its narrow political objectives.
Above all, though—and this is where I do join wholeheartedly with the Prime Minister—we on this side of the House congratulate the Australian defence forces on the courageous and professional way in which they conducted themselves. We have heard the accolades from over there, but we know it. We know them; we have known them for many years. We have respected them, and we know that they are professionally trained and will always discharge their duties honourably. We are grateful that they suffered no casualties, and we look forward to their safe and early return to their families and to this country. 
I might say I am disappointed that I cannot be at the return of the RAAF members and the F18 fighter pilots to Tindal tomorrow. I have to, of course, deliver the response to the budget tomorrow night, and the Prime Minister was unable to assist me to attend and return in time for those purposes. The Labor Party will be represented at its next most senior level. The deputy leader of the Labor Party will be attending tomorrow, as will the member for Lingiari, on behalf of the Labor Party. I am sure that the troops themselves will understand why I am not able to be with them. I do indicate—as I indicated to the Prime Minister earlier this week when it became apparent that the troops were going to be returning this week—that I wanted to be informed as to the dates. I indicated, because of the bipartisan support we had given to our troops in this encounter, that it was important that both sides of politics were represented at their return. I will be attending on Saturday and Sunday in the west, but the fact that the government was not able to accommodate the circumstances of my attendance tomorrow is regrettable. I apologise here today to the troops. I am sure that the deputy leader will convey those apologies again tomorrow, but I know, having spoken to the parents of these fighter pilots, that they will understand the reason for my absence.
All Australians, regardless of their views on the war, acknowledge the professionalism and dedication of the men and women of our defence forces. I am especially pleased that in this conflict our community has not repeated the mistakes of the past. Although millions of Australians were so shocked and angered by the Prime Minister's commitment of Australia to this war—they in fact marched in their hundreds of thousands through the streets protesting against this war—that protest did not extend to our defence forces. I am grateful that calls made by me and others who were opposed to the war for the nation to stand united in our support for our troops were heard. I was prepared to face the troops and their families and explain that, whilst Labor were opposed to the war, we supported our troops, and always will. They have no choice. If the government of the day commits them to a war, they must go. In such circumstances, those who oppose the decision to go to war must take the protest to the decision makers, not to the troops.
Our argument has always been with the government, not with the troops, and this was clearly understood by the families and, interestingly, by the RSL. In a letter to me in March, the National President of the RSL, Major General Peter Phillips, had this to say. I preface this by making the point that the RSL themselves were opposed to this war unless under a UN mandate. Major General Phillips says in this letter:
Our executive felt strongly that when we met in Brisbane last September that we should argue publicly that Australia should not be involved without a UN mandate. Now that we are involved, we see no option but to make the best of it. Above all, we want to see our troops and their families given wholehearted support. For that reason, I am delighted that you have publicly weighed in on the side of our troops.
That was from the National President of the RSL, so this argument that there was some confusion about our commitment to the war certainly was not made by the families and certainly was not made by the organisation that represents the returned services men and women of this country. 
The position on a UN mandate for the war that the RSL said that they supported was of course Labor's position as well—a position that we had enunciated since April of last year. We took the view that no military action to disarm Iraq should be taken without the authority of the United Nations Security Council. It was not given, and we opposed Australia's participation in the war on that basis. Even today, most Australians and many community organisations—such as the RSL, from whose letter I have just read—would say that they would have preferred, if action did have to be taken, that it had occurred under the auspices of the United Nations.
In saying that we supported a UN approach to this we were not saying that we supported and shared the anti-American views of some of the protestors against the war. The Curtin Labor government founded Australia's alliance with the United States and Labor have supported it ever since. We carry in our hearts the flame of what that alliance truly means. When we have disagreed with American policy, we have expressed our disagreements as friends and as close allies. We have not shirked it. That is what true friendship is about: the ability to exchange differences and argue them. So in those circumstances Australia should now have the courage to tell the United States government that there is deep concern in the international community about the future direction of peace and stability when the world's largest military power unilaterally pursues a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes. The Prime Minister's once close friend, former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, summed up these concerns in an article in the Age newspaper on 1 May. Mr Fraser said:
The debate is between those who believe in the development of an international system founded in law and agreement, and those who believe in the exercise of American power.
Like former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and all other prime ministers before the current one, I believe that it is in Australia's long-term national interest to support a world that is ruled by international cooperation, law and justice, not by unilateralism.
It is of deep regret to me and to the Labor Party that in the current Prime Minister we have the most anti-UN Prime Minister in the history of this country, and he has chosen to take Australia down a different path—not one that we have consistently pursued, but a different path. The Prime Minister continues to ignore the most fundamental premise of the ANZUS Treaty: the commitment of both parties under article 1 of that treaty to resolve international conflict and disputes peacefully through the United Nations system. It is there; it is part of our alliance. The Prime Minister should stand up for Australia's national interests and remember that as a middle power we have no interest in a world where might is right and where the international rule of law is sidelined. How can we teach our children to respect the law if we do not respect it ourselves?
The Prime Minister has tried desperately to cover his actions in a cloak of respectability. He ignores the clear fact that he has damaged Australia's international reputation and our ability to work cooperatively with our neighbours on more important national security issues such as regional terrorism. He was well aware of the concerns expressed by countries such as Indonesia about the consequences of military action in Iraq without the authority of the United Nations. With the world's largest Muslim population, Indonesia is vital to the long-term security of Australia, but the Howard government has completely ignored the concerns of the Indonesian government, including those raised by President Megawati in her statement of 20 March this year. She said: 
War will not only fail to resolve the problem, but it will also cause humanitarian tragedy. The Government and the people of Indonesia are gravely concerned over the innocent civilian casualties and the immense material losses that may result from this military action.
Of course, it is a message our Prime Minister does not want to hear. So perhaps he should listen to the views of countries that we have considered close allies for more than a century—Canada and New Zealand. Canadians and New Zealanders have fought alongside Australians also in all the major wars of the 20th century, but they refused to participate in this war against Iraq. Why? Because, unlike Australia under John Howard, Canada and New Zealand still believe in upholding the processes through international law and order. They know that, by diminishing the role of the United Nations, Australia and the other members of the coalition of the willing have diminished their own security. Thirty-three countries contributed military forces in the 1991 Gulf War; only three countries participated in the recent one.
We must of course now turn our attention to the needs of postwar Iraq. There must be a transition in Iraq to self-rule as soon as possible. But there are already problems emerging in the civil administration arrangements and the reconstruction efforts. The Prime Minister glosses over the security problems facing Iraq, but the breakdown of law and order is a serious problem and it requires urgent attention. On 6 May, President Bush was forced to change the leadership of the US administration in Iraq and appoint Paul Bremer as Special Presidential Envoy to Iraq. Paul Bremer will oversee coalition reconstruction efforts and the process towards self-governance.
Australia, together with the United Kingdom and the US—as the three active military forces in Iraq during the war—has assumed legal obligations as an occupying power under the 1949 Geneva convention. These obligations extend to both the humanitarian requirements and the physical protection of the Iraqi population. The Prime Minister failed to tell the Australian people that this would be the consequence of taking military action outside of the United Nations. He said that Australian troops would not be involved in any peacekeeping after the war. In comments published in the Bulletin before the war, the Prime Minister gave his categorical assurance that Australian forces would not be engaged in a peacekeeping operation and would be returned to Australia following the end of the conflict. On 11 February, he said:
... an ongoing peacekeeping role is not something that I would seek for a moment ... If there is a final Australian military commitment, it will be of a scale that I've mentioned, and we would see it being of a quite short, specific, duration ... I don't see any peacekeeping.
Now we find that also not to be the case. We now know that it was another part of the Prime Minister's deceit. He is a Prime Minister pathologically incapable of telling the truth to the Australian people on the most important matters of national security.
—The Leader of the Opposition knows that that statement is a little difficult to tolerate under the standing orders in terms of imputation.
—Are you asking me to withdraw it, Mr Speaker?
—I am asking the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw that one sentence.
—I just say that the Prime Minister has shown again during this conflict his inability to come clean with the Australian people when they should be told. It is in the national interest, and he should have the courage of his convictions to front the Australian people and tell them the truth. The Australian people do not ask for anything more, but they are getting a lot less out of this Prime Minister. This exercise has demonstrated it time and time again. 
—The Leader of the Opposition has replaced the statement. I ask him to just withdraw it.
—Yes, I have replaced the previous statement with that last one. If you would like me to repeat that statement, I am happy to oblige in case there is any confusion.
—I thank the Leader of the Opposition.
—Since the war's end, the Prime Minister has committed to keeping 1,200 troops in Iraq. Of the original 2,000 troops, 1,200 are still there. He will tell us what the figure consists of but he will not explain how these figures have been arrived at. He should tell the Australian people now what agreement he has reached with President Bush and why this level of contribution is essential to fulfil Australia's obligations to secure the peace. We accept that there is an obligation as part of the occupying forces, but what we need is the explanation for why this number is required. Second, he should admit to the Australian people that this burden—this number, however arrived at—would be reduced if the United Nations assumed responsibility for the interim authority. Our commitment in Iraq is more than Australia's commitment of peacekeepers to East Timor, where we have played the lead role. How is it that we have gotten ourselves into that circumstance of proportionality? I think the Australian people are entitled to know.
This expensive, unwelcome position that the Howard government has got Australia into reinforces the need for the United Nations to take the lead role in a postwar Iraq. The government has already spent $750 million on this war, and it will cost more than $400 million to keep Australian forces there. I call on the Prime Minister to move urgently towards a United Nations sponsored civil and military administration in Iraq. Such an administration would provide the only way that Australia could legally transfer our responsibilities in Iraq to a properly constituted Iraqi government. This is because Australia would be one of 191 UN members—not just one of the three occupying powers—that would make a contribution to Iraq. A United Nations administration is the best way for Australia to get our troops home quickly and safely.
The Prime Minister has indicated that they can play some sort of supporting role, the implication being that they cannot do what he and the other two countries are committed to doing over there. But, particularly as a person who rejects the UN role, he should remember the pivotal role that the United Nations played in East Timor—a role that he has been prepared, when it suits him, to trumpet loud and clear in the past. But there is also the role that the United Nations successfully played in Cambodia. It was the efforts of Australia, under a previous Labor government, that drove the peace process in Cambodia in the early 1990s. Through persistence and determination, Australia managed to get the international community to sign on to the most comprehensive peace and reconstruction plan in the history the United Nations system. So they can do it; they can do it with the right sort of leadership and the right sort of support of the participating countries. The plan, known as the Red Book, was ironically the blueprint for Cambodia's transition from a murderous regime under the Khmer Rouge to the democratic state it is today. So do not tell us that the United Nations cannot do it. Instead of dismissing the role of the United Nations, the government should get behind it and start achieving real outcomes. 
Labor believe that the United Nations is best placed to coordinate the delivery of international humanitarian assistance and the economic reconstruction of Iraq. We believe that there should be an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations to determine an interim Iraqi authority. Participation at the conference should be drawn from all elements of Iraqi society, including the exiled community. The UN is experienced in humanitarian and reconstruction projects. We want to see a democratic government in Iraq, and Australians have been generous in their desire to see Iraq rebuilt. Australia has a great deal of expertise to contribute to the rebuilding of Iraq's economy and to the establishment of democratic institutions.
Labor urges the Australian government and all Australians to give urgent support to the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people, both at the government level and by supporting the various appeals that have been established. Recent reports from Iraq indicate that Australia and the other coalition members are failing to discharge their full responsibilities under the Geneva convention to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.
Yesterday the Prime Minister chastised those who dared to suggest that war in Iraq would cause a humanitarian crisis. Again that ignores the facts. He should listen to officials of the World Health Organisation. On 7 May the World Health Organisation issued a press release which catalogued the growing number of cases of disease as a result of lack of clean drinking water and adequate sewage facilities. In particular, there is a growing incidence of cholera in Basra among very young children aged between 13 months and four years. This should not be. We should be able to do better.
Furthermore, the head of Medicins Sans Frontiers has attacked the coalition stating that not one hospital is fully functioning in Baghdad, a city of five million people. The United Nations Children's Fund is working in Iraq to alleviate some of the worst problems for the children of Iraq, but the task has been made more difficult by the poor security situation on the ground. The United Nations has issued an appeal for $US2.2 billion for humanitarian assistance in Iraq. The sum of $US677 million has been met—30 per cent of it—leaving an outstanding total of $1½ billion. Australia's contribution to the UN appeal stands at just $US10 million US, which is 1.5 per cent of the total. In contrast, the noncombatant states of Canada, the Netherlands and Germany have pledged $US29.6 million, $US14.9 and $US10.2 million respectively. Having contributed to the problem, this government has a moral responsibility to do more to assist with the humanitarian reconstruction of Iraq.
The Prime Minister has spent time in his address talking about the Middle East process; I want to touch on that briefly too. I agree that the engagement by the Bush administration in the road map for peace is strongly welcomed—I do. It is the best chance there has been in a decade to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East. Each member of the quartet—the US, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia—has an important role to play in bringing the two sides together to reach a lasting solution. But peace will not be achieved without an end to the terrorist attacks that have plagued Israel in recent years. I am encouraged by the steps taken by Abu Mazen, the new Palestinian Prime Minister. More still needs to be done to end the violence, but the start is there. The vision of the two states living side by side in peace and with secure borders is a goal shared not only by the Israelis and the Palestinians but by all of us in the international community interested in peace and stability, particularly in that troubled area. 
The issue of Iraq is now back before the United Nations Security Council. It is our hope that the Security Council members can negotiate on the draft UN resolution in good faith and quickly re-establish the council's position at the forefront of international efforts to rebuild Iraq. It is Labor's view that the draft resolution should be used to achieve three critical goals. Firstly, sanctions against Iraq should be lifted. Secondly, the UN weapons inspectors, under Hans Blix, should be returned immediately to Iraq to verify the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Hans Blix has the credibility, the international community knows it, and it is in everyone's interest that he be there overseeing the post-conflict circumstances. Thirdly, the proposed United Nations special coordinator should be given sufficient executive powers so that the United Nations can take responsibility for the humanitarian, political and security reconstruction of Iraq.
The government should be arguing strenuously to the US, the UN and the UK for this outcome. Only through a speedy transition to the UN of authority in Iraq will Australia be able to withdraw its remaining military forces. Labor wants to see our troops home for the sake of their families and for the sake of our national security. Australia faces numerous security challenges in our region. Security for Australia begins at home, and that is where our forces should be.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,13,1
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—Last night, I said it would take families 45 seconds to work out that they were worse off as a result of last night's budget. I have to say that I underestimated them. They worked it out straight away. The feedback from families to members' offices and talkback radio suggests that Australians have already seen through this budget. As the Herald Sun said in its editorial today, the budget was a sleight of hand by the Treasurer. Australians are long past being impressed by Treasurers pulling rabbits out of hats. The Treasurer might think it is a clever political stunt, but it does not change the political reality for families. Families will be worse off as a result of this budget. It is a budget that puts a great squeeze on middle-income taxpayers—those earning from $30,000 to $50,000 a year. There was a time when you thought that the Prime Minister had a special place in his heart for battlers, people on $30,000 to $50,000 a year—I reckon they are battling. But they have found where that special place is, and it is not in the ideology of the Prime Minister. Those taxpayers will get a very small tax cut, and they will pay for it through the rising cost of health and education.
Let me illustrate in a number of ways how small the tax cut is. The Leader of the Opposition today asked a question about comments by the Minister for Family and Community Services. She said in an interview, `We could offer low-income families a $5 increase in their welfare payments, but it is not worth doing. All they'd get is a milkshake and a sandwich.' It is a long time since she bought a milkshake and a sandwich if she thinks she can get them for $5. Even so, she said it is not worth much—it is not worth doing. The problem is that the tax cut is only 80 per cent of `not worth much'. It is only 80 per cent of `not worth doing'. It is $4. There is another way to illustrate this point. The Daily Telegraph made the point well today. I do not know whether any of you saw it. They offered their readers 10 suggestions on what to do with their extra $4 a week. 
—Give us a couple.
—Let me read them all. The first one is that you could lose it in the wash.
—I've got my four. What can I do with that?
—You can lose it in the wash, but I do not know how. You could buy two scratchies and try to double your money. You could, as the Leader of the Opposition said on radio, give it to a busker. You could buy a schooner and leave an 80c tip. You could invest it in Pan Pharmaceuticals. You could buy a pet—a mouse, a goldfish or a circus flea. Seventh, and this is a doubly sad story, you could buy one Telstra share. You could save for three weeks and buy a packet of cigarettes. You could save for 10,000 weeks for a house deposit. Or you could send eight letters to Peter Costello telling him to get real. That is what the Daily Telegraph said,and I reckon they get 10 out of 10. That puts the dimensions of the tax cuts in perspective rather well.
Let me show you, to the extent the standing orders will allow, some other illustrations of the modest scale of the tax cut. This graph shows how much total income tax will increase, and the red bit shows how much the tax cuts are going to take off. There you are, Mr Minister for Employment. You might need to borrow some glasses to find out how small it is. It is a real sliver of a cut—minuscule indeed—and it is not the only example. That is total revenue from taxpayers. I can hear the answer, `But there are more taxpayers now,' which is true. So this is the graph that shows how much the increase is in tax per taxpayer—a 64 per cent increase in 12 years. That one in the middle is this year coming, so you can see that the rise in tax per taxpayer goes up and up after this tax cut. No wonder he is still regarded as the highest taxing Treasurer in history.
We had an argument in the House in question time today about what the budget papers said, and I apparently, inadvertently and unintentionally, said that the Treasurer deliberately misled the House. I do not know if it was deliberate or not. I cannot tell that. But I do know he misled, because the table to which I referred makes it crystal clear. There is a column that says—it is very complex—this complicated phrase: `total income tax'. It is really very hard to work out what that means. It says: 200304 estimates, 16.7 per cent of GDP. When the government came to office in 199596, it was 16.4 per cent. It is really very complicated. It has gone up since they came into office, even after these tax cuts. There is another column that has a slightly lower figure, and the Treasurer quoted it because it suited him. However, it does not include certain things—for example, small businesses. The people working in your electorates—the subcontractors paying company tax—are not included in the list the Treasurer mentioned. He does not seem to think that is important. The message he included did not mention the tax all those workers pay on their superannuation and all those heavy taxes on their income. It is crystal clear that the Treasurer was wrong today. I just cannot tell whether he was deliberately wrong or wrong in ignorance.
We had a second important error today, and I want to correct the record on that as well. The Leader of the Opposition asked the Treasurer a question about the lowest tax cut in history. The Treasurer tried to pretend that the so-called l-a-w tax cuts were less than his. I will get to the detail in a minute, but I want to make it clear: what was passed and delivered to taxpayers under l-a-w was twice the size of the tax cut delivered last night—100 per cent bigger. That is a slight error, a 100 per cent error, but it gets better. In question time today the Treasurer said that the tax cuts promised in the 1993 l-a-w tax cuts were smaller than his tax cuts last night. In fact, the first half of the l-a-w tax cuts was delivered earlier than promised and it constituted 5.1 per cent of personal income tax at that time, compared with last night's tax cut of 2.5 per cent. But of course there was a second half, and it was cancelled. Let's remember the story about how. The Labor government said, `We will deliver that second instalment of tax cuts as superannuation contributions for working Australians,' which was a very good policy but it did get cancelled. It got cancelled by the Howard government in 1997.  
—They said they would deliver it in the 1996 election.
—Yes, they did promise in 1996 it would be delivered in full, and then it went. It was replaced by a savings rebate and they abolished that after six weeks. Of course, we should have guessed, because there is a track record. If you define the term `tax cut' very broadly, there was one tax cut smaller than last night's. It was the one that the Prime Minister delivered when he was Treasurer in 1997, but he cancelled that absolutely. The only reason we do not count that is because zero is not a tax cut. He delivered nothing. Tax cuts have been cancelled twice and the same person is responsible: the member for Bennelong, the Prime Minister, John Howard. That is the reason we say this is the smallest tax cut in history. L-a-w was twice as big, and the one that the Prime Minister lied to the Australian people about, as the Illawarra Mercury accurately portrayed—
—The member for Fraser will withdraw the word `lied'.
—It is a quote.
—Let me give you this quote precisely and you will see if I am out of order.
—Sorry. If you were speaking to the chair I would hear.
—Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker; I understand that. The Illawarra Mercury headline read `Lies, lies, lies', and I can tell you that the Illawarra Mercury was right. It was, in fact, a serious mistake, and what did the taxpayers get? Nothing. We did have the smallest tax cut in history, and it will be overwhelmed by the increased costs in health and education faced by families.
In some ways budgets are not as important as they used to be because many of the announcements are made outside budget time. But they do tell us about our priorities. It is the time when governments outline their priorities and when you get a chance to put contrasts on the line. What this budget makes clear, and what all the analysis in newspapers and commentaries accepts, is that this is a budget fundamentally about transferring funding responsibility for core social issues in our country from the government to families. Of course, that is important for those individual families, because they have to pay the bill—and many of us will talk about that for days ahead. But is important in another way: it makes our society less fair. That is why there is now, as a result of this budget, a clear, stark and continuing philosophical difference that is evident between this side of the House and that side. We believe that there is a permanent, ongoing, necessary role for government in equalising and making more fair our society. The government is not just about rescuing the most disadvantaged—although we must do that—it is about providing opportunities for low- and middle-income families, and particularly the children in those families, to participate equally in our society. 
When they talk about the education changes, the Liberal Party seems to forget one thing: not all the bright kids come from rich families—for which most of us on this side are very grateful. If your education policy makes it easier for the rich and thick to get into universities—that is why they call it the cream of education policies: only the rich and thick benefit—but harder for bright kids from middle-income families, then it is not only less fair; we also lose the benefit of some of our best talent. The countries that succeed in the 21st century are going to be those that focus more on education, not those that withdraw and hand the task back to families.
I illustrated last week that families are already paying $123 million a year more for visits to their GP since the Howard government came to office, as a result of the fall in bulk-billing and the increase in doctors fees. The changes announced last night can only make that worse. Last week we also made clear that families are paying $900 million a year more towards the cost of educating their children at university than when the Howard government came to office; and the education policy outlined by the Treasurer last night can only mean that the burden will rise further and faster. Budgets are about priorities and so are budget replies. Tomorrow night we will be making it very clear that our priority is to focus on rescuing Medicare and bulk-billing. It is a top Labor priority, and it has been for 30 years. We keep introducing it, they keep wrecking it, and we will keep coming back to rescue it, because it is fundamental to the sort of society we want.
The government's sleight of hand on health funding has not fully been exposed yet, so let me in concluding draw this one point. 
Honourable members interjecting—
—I would like you to listen to these numbers; they are very interesting. The government announced a $917 million package to fund their changes to Medicare, and buried in the budget papers were details of a $918 million cut to hospitals. It is $917 million in and $918 million out. When you put in $917 million, how can it make health worse? There are two explanations: the first is when you spend it so badly—we can fix that; the second is when you take $918 million out—we cannot fix that until we change the government, and then we will. It is absolutely clear and blatant. The states said that they had been dudded by a billion, and now we know they were right. The inevitable conclusion of any analysis of last night's budget can only be that it is more to do with the Treasurer's aspiration to be Prime Minister than with any desire to help Aussie families. That is why we had that unseemly squabble about whose idea the tax cuts were. It will leave middle-income Australian families worse off, and it will leave Medicare and bulk-billing weakened, exposed and on the path to destruction. It is a path that needs to be reversed, and the Leader of the Opposition will deliver the first instalment on reversing it tomorrow night.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—As members opposite well know, the Treasurer has a very pressing post-budget commitment in Sydney this afternoon and this evening. I will do my best to respond on behalf of the government. As members opposite should know, the budget of Australia is a very serious business because it is dealing with the future of the Australian nation and the Australian people. It was rather tragic to hear over the last 15 minutes the shadow Treasurer of this country reduced to delivering second-hand jokes.  
This afternoon we are seeing the members opposite taking relief in mirth from the tragedy which is their current political position. It is sad that a substantial person such as the member for Fraser is reduced to these kinds of pathetic, second-hand jibes at the expense of the Australian people, who have definitely benefited from this budget—a budget that has plainly wrong-footed the opposition. They were expecting a khaki budget. What they found was certainly a strong commitment to the defence of Australia and to paying for the defence of Australia and the defence of Australia's friends and values. As well as the government's strong commitment to the defence of Australia, the opposition found our strong commitment to building a better Australia—while members opposite are having enormous trouble even building an adequate opposition.
The budget that the Treasurer brought down last night is a budget for a strong Australia in an uncertain world. It is a budget which fully pays for Australia's contribution to the war of liberation in Iraq. At the same time, it is a budget which strengthens Australia's higher education system, which strengthens Australia's health system and which better protects the great heritage which we all enjoy as Australian citizens. Not only did the Treasurer do all these things but also he kept the surplus and gave back something significant to the Australian people, to the Australian battlers.
It is wrong to underestimate the scale of the Treasurer's achievement last night. We were able to give tax cuts, to increase spending and, at the same time, to preserve the surplus. By contrast, take the other economies with which we like to compare ourselves: the United States has no surplus with tax cuts, and the United Kingdom has a surplus and no tax cuts—in fact, there are very significant tax increases. The three Labor states that have so far brought down their budgets for 2003 have very significantly increased taxes. Victoria have increased more than 300 taxes.
This government believe in a strong Australia and that a strong Australia needs strong citizens as well as strong government. Yes, we have spent more. We have carefully targeted additional spending in this budget. We have not only spent more but also restructured institutions to try to make that government spending more effective. We believe in health systems and education systems which build up Australian citizens and which do not suffocate them by imposing on them one-size-fits-all, Canberra-knows-best structures. I am proud to be part of a government which has delivered a modest but still significant tax cut to the Australian people. Like everyone, I would have preferred a bigger tax cut. We would all have preferred a bigger tax cut, but we had to give a tax cut which was deliverable and responsible. That is precisely what this government have done. 
Today the member for Fraser, as I said, has unburdened himself of some second-hand jibes in his response to the budget. Let me rest with the verdict of Alan Wood, probably Australia's foremost economic commentator, who says that Treasurer Costello certainly is not the highest taxing Treasurer and that over the life of this government he certainly has given back bracket creep. A cut is a cut is a cut. I am sure the Australian people will be grateful for the cut they got last night. Unlike members opposite, we appreciate that the money we have as a government is not really our money; it is the Australian people's money. We want to give back to them as much as we responsibly can, consistent with running a strong government which delivers decent services to the Australian people.  
Those who will benefit most from this tax cut, those who will enjoy the greatest percentage benefit, are of course people earning less than $30,000 a year. They are the real battlers of our society. They are the people who at this time most need a break. They, as well as people on middle incomes, are every inch John Howard's battlers. The fact that this government are prepared to help them in this budget is one of the many reasons why I am sure that if Ben Chifley were alive today he would be supporting the policies of the Howard government and not the confusion and indecision which you see from members opposite. 
Contrary to what the member for Fraser tried to point out again in the MPI after failing in question time to make his point, this is certainly not the highest taxing government and we certainly do not have the highest personal taxes in Australia's history. As the Treasurer so eloquently pointed out in question time, income tax as a percentage of GDP will be 11.9 per cent in 2003-04 compared to 12.3 per cent in 1995-96 and compared to a whopping 14.2 per cent of GDP back in the late 1980s.
Cutting taxes responsibly and intelligently is very much at the heart of the political mission of this government. In the year 2000, we gave, through the New Tax System, the largest personal income tax cuts in Australia's history. Last night there were further instalments of this government's desire to deliver responsible and affordable tax cuts. This is a government that is always looking for more opportunities to put more money back into the pockets of the Australian people—the people who make it, who earn it and who deserve to keep as much of it as possible. Before we have any further crocodile tears and posturing from the Leader of the Opposition and his frontbenchers, it is incumbent upon him to tell us exactly what he would do. Would he take the tax cuts back? When he gives his response to the budget tomorrow night, he needs to tell us exactly what he would do. If the tax cut was not enough, how much would he add to it? Once he has told us how much he would add to it, he then needs to tell us what he would cut to pay for it.
There was much play from the member for Fraser today about higher education. This budget delivers an additional $1.5 billion in Commonwealth spending for higher education. In 2005 there will be a real 2½ per cent increase in Commonwealth funding per student. This will grow to five per cent in 2006 and 7.5 per cent in 2007. Not only have we increased real funding per student; we have raised the threshold at which people have to repay their HECS debts, in effect we have reduced HECS interest rates over the life of this government by reducing inflation and maintaining low inflation, and last night we made loans available to everyone. This is not a completely deregulated system; it is certainly not the US system. Yes, it is a less regulated system than it was, but it is still a socially responsible system—a more socially responsible system because it enables more Australian citizens and more Australian institutions to take more responsibility for the decisions that they will make.
Listening to members opposite and their confected outrage, it is possible to forget just who introduced HECS—the members opposite, of course—and just who first introduced, in modern times, student fees. That was a Labor Party which had not forgotten its true principles; that was a Labor Party which at least sometimes during the 1983-96 period was prepared to put the national interest ahead of the partisan interest. If what the government have done in the budget on higher education is so wrong, let the Leader of the Opposition tell us what he would do. Let him tell us what he would do tomorrow night when he gives his response. If the increase is not enough, let him tell us how big it should have been and, if it should have been bigger than what the government have delivered, let him tell us how exactly he would pay for it. 
—The member opposite talks about Medicare. The government has announced a $970 million increase in total funding for Medicare. Not only that, but there is also a real increase of 17 per cent—quite contrary to the assertion of the member for Fraser in his speech just a few moments ago—in hospital funding. Let me say this to the member for Kingston: the government's Medicare changes mean that people who are currently paying their doctor in the first instance out of their own pocket should pay very much less. People who are currently being bulk-billed have every reason to expect that they will continue to be bulk-billed, because we are doing things to support the incomes of doctors and their practices. Most importantly, the pensioners of this country get as near to a guarantee as the government can possibly deliver that they will be bulk-billed. If that is not enough, if more money should be spent, the Leader of the Opposition should tell us tomorrow night exactly how much, he should tell us exactly where it is coming from and he should tell us exactly what will be cut to pay for any increase in spending that he proposes.
The member for Fraser, the shadow Treasurer, was plainly not at his best in his budget reply speech in this MPI. He is a very serious man, a man of some substance and stature, who has been reduced to peddling second-hand jokes and peddling them very badly. Why wouldn't he be far from his best? Like every member opposite, he is completely preoccupied with the parlous state of the leadership of the Labor Party. He went on television the other week to talk about what the Labor Party would do in its budget. Of course, he was asked about Simon Crean's leadership, as every Labor frontbencher is being asked. The question was:
Does Simon Crean have to put in the performance of a lifetime in replying to the Budget to save his leadership?
He replied:
I don't think that but, certainly, it is a big call.
He is then asked:
So if he doesn't get 41%—
that is, 41 per cent approval, a pathetically low approval rating—
he's in trouble?
The member for Fraser said:
No, from here to 41% is not possible.
It is not possible for the Leader of the Opposition to get his approval rating up to 41 per cent. Finally, the member for Fraser said of the Labor Party's leadership problems:
I think it needs to be resolved. I think Simon and Kim have an obligation to make sure it is resolved by the end of June, and I expect it to be.
The interest of the member for Fraser is not in delivering a credible response to this budget; it is in trying to cobble together a credible opposition from the two proven failures who are now arguing over which one should preside over an election defeat coming up sometime next year. 
This is a good budget, a responsible budget, a budget that builds a better Australia. The budget is a great tribute to the Treasurer and to the Prime Minister. I have to say that this budget proves that the Treasurer is eminently qualified to be the next Prime Minister of Australia whenever the Prime Minister chooses to step down. ",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Budget 2003-04</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I want to draw the minister's attention to page 54 of his Treasurer's own budget paper, Budget Paper No. 2, Budget Measures 2003-04. If he cares to look at page 54 of that budget paper he will find, under the line item `Australian Health Care Agreements', a row of negative numbers: minus 108.9, minus 172.0, minus 264.6 and minus 372.9. With a little application of a calculator, the minister would find that they add up to $918.4 million, which is a $1 million cut more than the cost of the measures the government claims are designed to reinforce, but which will actually destroy, Medicare.
How grateful should Australian families be for their tax cuts? Not very grateful. There are tax cuts of $1.63 per week if you are on a very low income, tax cuts of $4 per week for most Australian taxpayers on ordinary incomes and tax cuts of $11 per week for taxpayers on higher incomes. They should not be very grateful, because the Treasurer has failed to hand back to families all of the bracket creep he has taken from them since his last tax cut. Those tax cuts were, in any event, substantially offset by the introduction of the GST. Now, after three years, Peter Costello is handing back only $2.4 billion of the $3.3 billion in bracket creep in 2003-04.
Why are Australian families not having returned to them the full value of bracket creep since the Treasurer's last tax cut? He could have handed back the full value of bracket creep this year and he would still, on current budget estimates, have had a surplus of $1.3 billion. If he had done that, the tax cuts would have been 37.5 per cent higher than the tax cuts he has offered. But the reason the Treasurer did not want to set the precedent of handing back the full value of bracket creep is that, if taxpayers had had the full value of bracket creep handed back to them, in the following two financial years the budget would be in deficit—a deficit of $550 million in 2004-05 and $1.55 billion in 2005-06. The Treasurer's financial administration of the Commonwealth is such that he cannot hand back to families the full value of bracket creep without putting the budget into deficit.
The Treasurer last night said that the Howard government had handed back the full value of bracket creep over the life of his government. I challenge him to publish the calculation that would justify that statement. I suspect that if he did we would find that the calculation was corrupted by the tax mix switch that occurred when the Howard government introduced the GST. A very large part of the income tax cuts that were given at the time the GST was introduced was given in compensation for additional indirect taxation in the form of the GST and the other taxes that accompanied it. The Treasurer now seems to want to claim that all of those tax cuts were given to cover bracket creep. As a barrister, Peter Costello is probably used to running mutually exclusive arguments.
—I used to be a barrister.
—I seem to have offended one of the former barristers on my own side. When you do it with the public account, you get a double count. The bracket creep estimates that I have used are Access Economics estimates of fiscal drag taken from the May 2003 Access Economics Budget Monitor. Those estimates are: for 2001-02, $1.2 billion of bracket creep; for 2002-03, $2.2 billion of bracket creep; for 2003-04, $3.3 billion of bracket creep; for 2004-05, $4.5 billion of bracket creep; for 2005-06, $5.5 billion of bracket creep; and for 2006-07, $6.6 billion of bracket creep. The Treasurer and his officers have been very reluctant to publish their own estimates of bracket creep. If you deduct the budget estimates for the tax cuts announced last night, the new calculation for bracket creep is: 2001-02, $1.2 billion; 2002-03, $2.2 billion; 2003-04, $900 million; 2004-05, $1.85 billion; 2005-06, $2.75 billion; and 2006-07, $3.7 billion. By the end of 2006-07, the Treasurer will have collected $11.9 billion in bracket creep since the GST tax cuts. 
No wonder they call the Treasurer `bracket creep Pete'. Bracket creep is how the Treasurer keeps his budget in surplus—except, of course, when it is in deficit, as it was in 2001-02. Bracket creep is the trademark of our tax and spend Treasurer. It is his modus operandi. He is the classic tax and spend Treasurer. Under this Treasurer both taxes and spending are continually rising. There is always a bit of bracket creep to pay for the extra spending. But there is also a new tax or levy—the GST, the milk tax or the Ansett levy. Taxes are constantly rising.
Under Peter Costello, what Labor did in 1995-96 with 23.1 per cent of GDP—and that was pay for Commonwealth own purpose outlays and payments to the states—in 2002-03 now takes 25.3 per cent of GDP. That is down slightly on his 25.4 per cent record in 2000-01, but it is well ahead of any previous Australian government in the modern era. Australian families are entitled to ask: why is it that we pay historically high taxes but cannot get the things we used to get, like a doctor who bulk-bills?
The Howard government have two targets: retaining a surplus and reducing debt. Australian families have heard a lot about government surpluses and reductions in debt from this government. The Howard government—and particularly the Treasurer—are always boasting about their economic credentials. Why then, with record taxation levels and a surplus, is it that families in outer metropolitan areas like Morphett Vale and Hackham cannot find a doctor who bulk-bills?
First, let us look at debt reduction. This year's budget paper says that the government has cut net government debt by $63 billion. But, if you dig a little bit deeper, you find that $55 billion of that debt reduction has been achieved with asset sales. The government has been shuffling assets and liabilities around its balance sheet and not fundamentally strengthening its financial position. That means that only $8 billion of the reduction in debt is attributable to surpluses net of asset sales. On average, that is only $1 billion for each year the government has been in office.
Debt reduction is certainly not a result of savings. While the Howard government did cut $24 billion over the budget year and forward estimates period in 1996, in every year after that the net impact of policy decisions on the budget bottom line has been negative. It was $296 million in 1997 and $20.6 billion in 1998—but that, of course, was an election year; they had a bit of spending to do. It was $11.6 billion in 1999, $7.3 billion in 2000 and $25.6 billion in 2001—another election year. It was $5.3 billion last year and now, in this budget, it is $18.5 billion of fiscal loosening. Draw your own conclusions about whether this might be an election year. Over the life of this government the net impact of policy decisions on the budget bottom line has been negative—a big negative—by $65.4 billion. Australian families are entitled to ask how and why a government can take policy decisions with a net cost of $65.4 billion, and yet they cannot find a bulk-billing doctor. The answer is that the Howard government have different priorities from those of Australian families.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—I start this afternoon by taking the opportunity to convey my congratulations to the Treasurer on handing down yet another financially sound budget. It is the sixth successive budget to deliver a surplus under the Howard government—a fact which I think all Australians should be very proud of. 
I was listening to the member for Kingston before with very little conviction. He was talking about the Labor Party's record on economic policy in relation to some of the budgets they handed down over 13 years of bleak Labor government administration in this country. This afternoon I want to address more directly the matter of public importance that has been raised by the Labor Party: the unfair impact of the budget on working families, as they claim. I want to address in some detail some of the ways in which we have been able to change fundamentally for the better the lot of Australian families.
As you have heard already, when we came to government we inherited a Labor debt of $96 billion. Since that time we have repaid $63 billion of that money, resulting in savings per annum of $5 billion. That is $5 billion that, under Labor, would have been spent on interest. Now, under the Howard government, it is being spent on areas such as education, health and all sorts of infrastructure arrangements, which are of significant benefit not just to Australian families but, indeed, also to small business and sectors right across the Australian economy.
How else have we helped Australian families? Since we came to government we have created more than 1.1 million new jobs. We inherited an unemployment rate of 8.6 per cent from the Labor Party and we have reduced that unemployment rate to 6.1 per cent. More people are in jobs, more people can afford to pay off home loans and, indeed, real wages have grown by 10.6 per cent since this government came to power. Over the 13 dark years of Labor administration in this country, real wages only increased by a paltry 2.3 per cent.
This budget has been framed against a backdrop of war. It was a war that nobody sought but one that needed to be engaged in. As we heard the Prime Minister say today, it has provided tangible benefits for the people of Iraq and, indeed, for people right across the Middle East. This budget has also been framed against a backdrop of the worst drought that this country has ever seen. If you couple that with the threat that SARS poses for the tourism industry and the Australian economy in general, and if you look at the money that this government has had to spend on defence and on continuing to secure our borders and our way of life, it has been a remarkable achievement for the Treasurer to deliver a $2.2 billion surplus. 
This surplus has been delivered whilst still being able to sustain the programs that this government has undertaken and despite the fact that we have been able to deliver to the Australian people—nine million of them—tax cuts worth $2.4 billion, which equates to approximately $17½ million worth of tax cuts for the people within my electorate of Dickson. People within local communities such as mine in Dickson are grateful for any tax cuts. I think they are particularly grateful when they come on the back of the tax cuts which were delivered by this government in July 2000, when we introduced the largest income tax cuts Australia had ever seen.
This budget delivers tax cuts to the people who most need them. Taxpayers earning between $20,000 and $27,475 will get a great benefit—a benefit of not only an increased tax threshold but also an increased tax offset. So they get tax cuts of up to $329 per annum, or about 10.7 per cent—almost 11 per cent—on their current tax bill. It is a significant saving for the families of Dickson and it is a significant saving for the people right across Australia who deserve it the most. 
It is significant to note that those tax cuts will represent expenditure by this government of $10.7 billion over the forward estimates. Some people may say that these tax cuts are modest tax cuts. Had we the choice of delivering more tax cuts to the Australian people, of course we would have. But when you are talking about a significant outlay of $10.7 billion over five years, I think it puts into perspective how significant those tax cuts are.
We have allowed a buffer of $2.2 billion in the surplus. Some people have said that that money should have been spent in other areas. But when one bears in mind some of the issues that I spoke about before that have tarnished some of the economies around the world and also some of the external pressures that have been placed on the Australian economy, one realises that it is another example of the prudent way in which this government operates and the fiscal responsibility which has been the hallmark of this government over the last six years that we continue to have that surplus to guard against any unforeseen circumstances should they arise.
One of the significant areas for which this government has been able to provide support for families is in the area of home ownership. Right across Australia, because of the economic responsibility and management of the Howard government, we have seen the implementation of the first home buyers grant—initially $14,000 and now $7,000—which is a significant start in providing young people, who otherwise would not have been able to afford to go into a new home, the opportunity to provide a home for their young families. The flow-on of that policy and that benefit should not be underestimated. 
That policy would not have been affordable had this government not taken the prudent decisions it has over the last six years to repay Labor's debt. Make no mistake about it: not only has this government been saving $5 billion a year in interest that would have been payable had it not repaid that debt but also these policies would not have been affordable by any stretch of the imagination had Labor been in power today. Labor would have continued to ramp up that debt; asset sales would have again gone to year-on-year expenditure, not to retiring debt; the economic irresponsibility of the Labor Party would have continued; and we would have been in dire straits today where the Labor debt would not have been repaid and lower interest rates would not have been delivered to families right around this great country.
It needs to be borne in mind when you are talking about interest rates that the government have been able to deliver significant savings to families. Under Labor, where interest rates were 17 per cent, young families right across Australia—including in areas such as Eatons Hill and Albany Creek in my electorate—with a $100,000 mortgage would have been paying $10,000 a year more in mortgage payments than what they now pay under the coalition. When people talk about providing benefits to families and providing benefits to the Australian people, the most significant benefit, in my view—and I think in the view of right-thinking people across this country—has been the savings on interest rates that we have been able to deliver not only to young families with high mortgages but also to small business and to sectors right across the economy.
One of the other benefits that I am very proud that this budget has been able to deliver to young families and to the Australian people is in the area of health. This budget has provided an injection of $917 million—just short of $1 billion—to underpin the Medicare system. The government remain committed to the Medicare system. Last week I was very proud to have the Minister for Health and Ageing visit my electorate to speak with local doctors and with young families in relation to some of the challenges that they face and which we are trying to address. One of the most significant measures that is going to be delivered out of this budget is that, instead of young families having to pay upfront when they take their two or three sick children to visit a doctor, they will have the ability to swipe their Medicare card, abolish that upfront fee and abolish the inconvenience that they experience when they have to go to Medicare to redeem their money. 
How else have the government assisted families? We have allocated a record amount of $8 billion worth of funding over the next four years to child care. Now, under this government, we have the most affordable child care ever in Australia. I commend this budget to all members of this House. (Time expired)

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the report of the committee relating to the proposed development of off-base housing for Defence at Adamstown, Newcastle.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's second report of 2003 entitled Proposed development of off-base housing for Defence at Adamstown, Newcastle, New South Wales. The report addresses the construction of 72 new dwellings for defence personnel at Adamstown, a suburb of Newcastle located some seven kilometres from the city centre. The work was proposed by the Defence Housing Authority and has an estimated cost of $21.6 million.
The impetus for this work came from the most recent defence housing forecast for the Newcastle area, which predicted a growth in Defence requirements from 839 homes in the current financial year to a total of 892 in the 2005-06 financial year. This figure partially reflects the increase in defence personnel expected in association with the establishment at RAAF Base Williamtown of the airborne early warning and control capability. Works associated with the implementation of this new system were the subject of the committee's second report of 2002, and evidence given to the inquiry indicated that personnel numbers at RAAF Base Williamtown would increase by 350.
A further motivation for the proposed work is the need to provide a broader range of housing options for defence personnel in the Newcastle area. At present, much of the available housing is concentrated in suburbs near the RAAF base, which is located some 30 kilometres from the Newcastle CBD. The current proposal will satisfy the requirements of those Defence Force members who have a particular need, for reasons related to spouse employment or the education of older children, to live closer to the city centre. The proposal will also increase the amount of housing stock owned and managed by the Defence Housing Authority, thereby decreasing the amount of rental allowance being paid to defence personnel renting homes through the private market.
The proposal brought before the committee consists of 72 dwellings, comprising 60 four-bedroom detached houses and 12 three-bedroom town houses and associated roadworks and utilities. This range of housing types reflects the preferences of defence personnel as expressed in a recent survey undertaken by the Defence Housing Authority. Whilst the proposal was given unqualified support by the commander of the RAAF Base Williamtown and by representatives of Defence Families of Australia, objections were raised by some local resident groups. These objections were mainly related mainly to traffic management, the level of community consultation undertaken by the Defence Housing Authority and the potentially dangerous nature of a proposed open space immediately adjacent to a local golf course.
In their evidence to the committee, representatives of local residents expressed concerns about the level of community consultation and also about traffic impacts and environmental issues. These were largely addressed in expert reports which were prepared for the Defence Housing Authority during the planning stage of the development, but residents told the committee that they had not been given access to these reports. At the public hearing, the Defence Housing Authority acknowledged the need to resolve remaining areas of community concern and undertook to make relevant expert reports available to interested residents. The committee recommended that perhaps, in future, the Defence Housing Authority could ensure that there are adequate direct community consultation processes. 
Local residents and the President of the Merewether Golf Club did have concerns about the location of the development's proposed open space, as it abuts the golf club grounds in the south-east corner of the site. Fears were raised that residents using the open space could be hit and injured by off-course golf balls. The Defence Housing Authority stated that their intention was for this area to serve as a passive open space that would double as a retention basin for run-off water, not as an active recreational area. Residents of the new development may, nevertheless, enter this area. The committee recommended that the Defence Housing Authority work with the Newcastle City Council and the Merewether Golf Club to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to guarantee public safety. The authority undertook to assist the golf club in erecting a physical barrier if necessary.
At the public hearing the committee was informed that, while the development control plan for the proposed work had been completed and submitted to the council for public comment, there is no statutory time frame within which the Newcastle City Council is obliged to make a determination on that plan. Defence Housing expected the completion of the first 35 dwellings by June 2004 and the remainder by October 2004, but this depended upon council approval for the work being granted by late April 2003. I understand that, as of today, that date has slipped to the first week in June.
The committee had some concerns about uncertainties surrounding the critical project milestones which may have some impact on the overall cost of the development. This was particularly worrying given the very small contingency provision included in the project budget. During in camera deliberations on the project costs, the committee's unease was compounded by indefinite figures and omissions noted in the budget. In view of this, the committee requested that Defence Housing provide a complete and updated feasibility study and recommended that in future the committee be provided with a full feasibility and contingency study prior to the public hearing. I understand that that feasibility study and contingency plan is now available to the committee.
Overall, the committee does acknowledge that this project represents a sensible use of valuable Defence land that is no longer useful for other purposes. It will provide much-needed housing for defence personnel. Defence Housing has been innovative in the way in which it has approached the development of this land, and this will certainly expand the range of housing available to defence personnel. Therefore, the committee has recommended that the proposed works proceed at an estimated cost of $21.6 million, pending satisfaction of the recommendations contained in its report. I thank my committee colleagues for their contribution to the inquiry and I particularly thank the member for Newcastle, who attended the inquiry. I also thank the staff of the secretariat for their support. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,19,1

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I rise to speak very briefly on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. I will not speak on its substance—that has been adequately handled by my colleague Mr Griffin, the shadow minister for consumer health—but, as shadow minister for health, with Mr Griffin I have portfolio responsibility for the bill and I want to let the government know what our intentions are in the Senate, because they have raised that with us. As I understand it, the government are anxious to ensure that this bill is passed before the Senate rises tomorrow.
The Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 deals with serious issues, particularly in light of the Pan Pharmaceuticals imbroglio. In the normal course of events we would want detailed consideration of this in the Senate, but we understand the government's desire to enact the bill as quickly as possible. The truth is that this bill has been floating around for a long time and the amendments to it which the government has proposed in response to the Pan Pharmaceuticals matter have been the subject of short consideration by us. We will, in the normal course of events, be pursuing the Pan issue and other aspects of Therapeutic Goods Administration practices. I have previously put on the record that, whilst in general terms I have confidence in the regulator, I think on this occasion they have made some mistakes which have had serious consequences, particularly in relation to advising consumers.
These issues will be pursued in the usual way at Senate estimates hearings and in other parliamentary forums, but I can state for the benefit of the government and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing that we do not propose to do anything other than conduct ourselves in the Senate in a manner which would enable the passage of the legislation before the Senate rises tomorrow. What other senators do is of course a matter for them, but the government should proceed on the basis that we will do whatever is reasonably required of us to enable the passage of the legislation. We will comply with their requests, enact this legislation as quickly as possible and then come back at estimates and other parliamentary procedures for a much more serious and detailed consideration of the matters arising from the Pan imbroglio.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—I rise to speak in this debate on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 because I feel that there needs to be some clarification of what has really happened with regard to Pan Pharmaceuticals. I have been concerned that the debate seems to have turned from looking at the way in which regulation is first put in place and the agency then carries out its duties under the legislation to an almost exclusive discussion on the benefits or otherwise of complementary medicine.
I say at the outset that I think this is an unfortunate and unfair turn of events, because Pan Pharmaceuticals is a company which manufactured antibiotics, other strictly prescription drugs—that is, orthodox medicine prescription drugs—over-the-counter drugs and complementary medicines. All manufacturing of all those things requires that the code of good manufacturing practice be followed. It is the suspension of their licence to manufacture which is now taking an enormous toll on thousands of small business people and perhaps on the employment of anything up to 5,000 individual Australians.
The fact of the matter is that there were announcements being made on the radio which I heard myself which were saying, `You don't have to worry about any prescription drugs because they are not included in the recall.' In fact, two products, doxycycline, which is an antimalarial drug, and erythromycin, an antibiotic, appeared on the recall list. But the significant thing about the drugs that were by and large, as I understand it, manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals is that for the most part they were all exported, and there is no power under the TGA to recall drugs which have been exported.  
I sat on the original inquiry of the Public Accounts Committee which resulted in the establishment of the therapeutic goods legislation and the body which polices the proper registration of drugs, over-the-counter products and complementary medicine. Prior to that establishment, the way in which exports were handled was that each state government would issue a certificate virtually of good manufacture and they were then permitted to export. It was felt that there was a need for a centralised Commonwealth body which could then speak with authority and vouch for the safety of the products that we were exporting. In fact, those drugs, antibiotics included, that are exported cannot be vouched for. They probably sit on the shelves in Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand and Thailand, and to that extent I think it was unfair for the commentary and the debate to focus solely on the question of whether or not complementary medicines could be vouched for, because the responsibility is to vouch for all of them. Over-the-counter products and the drug that was manufactured and supplied and then caused people to be very ill, the anti travel sickness drug, was in fact a pharmacy only product; it was not a complementary medicine product at all. To the best of my knowledge, there have been no reports of adverse side effects from any of those complementary medicines. That is not to say that it is not proper that because of their failure to meet the manufacturing code there should have been a recall.
I went a little further and took a look at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report for 2002 where it deals with the number of adverse incidents from drugs that are dealt with in hospital. The most up-to-date figures they have are for 1997-98, where the number was in fact 53,368 incidents from orthodox medicine drugs. So I think the most important aspect in the amendments that the government is moving is a very sensible and very good one, and that is that it is necessary that the manufacturer be a fit and proper person. I think that is very important change to make.
When we look also at part and parcel of the reason for the establishment of the TGA—and incidentally a therapeutic good includes a device as well as medicines—one of the things that was thought to be important was that there be full cost recovery, so people wanting to bring new orthodox medicine drugs for sale into Australia obviously have to prove those products. It is not enough to say, `Well, they approved it in the United Kingdom,' or `They approved it in the United States or Canada'; they have to say that they approved it here in Australia. When drug companies want those new drugs to be approved, their final aim is to get them on the pharmaceutical benefits list because that is the way in which they can ensure that they get their volumes of sales. So it is very important, when we are looking at the legislation and thinking about the whole question of what Pan has done, to note that it has affected the whole industry—that is, antibiotics and other orthodox medicine products and over-the-counter products such as the Travacalm product as well as complementary medicines. 
I understand that the government is to set up an inquiry to deal with complementary medicine. I think it is of fundamental importance that there be good consultation between the government and those people who make up the complementary medicine industry. Not to have that consultation would be most unfortunate because it would further exacerbate a lot of the angst that has been around in the community where every person prejudiced against complementary medicine has been able to have airplay. The fact of the matter is that we are seeing more and more cooperation between complementary medicine practitioners and orthodox medicine practitioners. You will see them working together and respecting each other's knowledge, and that has been to the benefit of patients. 
The other point I would like to make about the importance of the TGA with regard to the registration of new drugs that come into Australia is that, aside from wanting to get the volumes of sale and therefore get onto the pharmaceutical benefits list, drug companies also have a problem with owning a patent. I am relying on my memory, but I recall that there was an extension to the life of patents granted because it can take, say, seven years to actually get registration and seven years of the patent time has already gone, so the effective life of the patent that they have to make their profits from has been limited. If my memory serves me, it is now 25 years, but someone will correct me if I am wrong, I am sure.
New orthodox drugs have to be subject to a lot of rigour because they are unknown. I can recall that a particular drug came into Australia and was used by people suffering from Parkinson's disease. It was registered here and was being used, but then it was taken off the market in Australia. It remained on the market in New Zealand and people could import it from there. It was found that it resulted in, I think, liver disease. Again, if I am wrong I am sure someone will correct me. What I am saying is that when new drugs are brought in it is very much in the interests of people who are in need of new drugs that there be very strict rigour. 
Complementary drugs, on the other hand, have been around in most cases for decades—and in some cases for centuries. They are unable to be patented and that is why there is much less interest from manufacturing companies—because the profits are not there to be made in the way that they can be by introducing a new drug. There is nothing wrong with making profits from a new drug. There is nothing wrong with having an incentive for new ones to come on stream. It is, indeed, desirable.
I want to commend this bill to the House. I believe that the amendments that have been moved are timely, particularly the requirement for the manufacturer to be a fit and proper person. But I did want to make the point that Pan Pharmaceuticals failed in all three categories of therapeutic goods. It failed for orthodox medicine—prescription-only medicine—for over-the-counter, pharmacy-only medicine and for complementary medicine. I think it has been an unfair debate in that it has focused on prejudice against complementary medicine by people who seem to have a bias towards orthodox medicine. But as I said before, I am delighted to see that more and more of these old prejudices seem to be slipping away.
I would like to conclude by mentioning one particular product which has also come in for some discussion—and that is folic acid. Folic acid is the product which is recommended for use by women of child bearing years to prevent spina bifida in their children. Spina bifida is a terrible thing which can result in early death for the child. It can result in the child not being able to walk and being disabled. For many years naturopaths and practitioners in complementary medicine were recommending folic acid. In those days orthodox medicine would not have any part of signing on to folic acid being a preventative for spina bifida. It was not until a study in the United States ascertained just how much money hospitals were spending on looking after spina bifida children that they did research into folic acid. Now it is accepted by all. Orthodox medicine says that folic acid is an important therapeutic good to take to prevent spina bifida. So it is a case where complementary medicine practitioners were recommending its use and subsequently orthodox medicine came on board as well.  
There was some discussion in the media, after the Pan Pharmaceuticals recall, about a new test that had been brought in which showed that some folic acid capsules had not met a new standard of strength. What an irony it is that, the benefits having been denied for so long, people now realise its value and there is proper scrutiny. 
There is one further thing that I would like to say in this debate, and that is that I think the Therapeutic Goods Administration should, indeed must, set up a regime of spot checks. It is no good saying, `We're coming along,' and having them clean up the factory and get everything spick-and-span so that the audit that is carried out is satisfactory. That is necessary as well, because you need the assistance of staff to carry out that audit properly. However, spot checks are essential. Had spot checks been carried out, they could well have found the person sweeping up the product from the floor and putting it back in bins, or they could have found that the machinery had not been properly cleaned. There are probably many more tales to tell about Pan. Perhaps time will tell. In passing this legislation we are taking the right course but I do say that there is a need for spot checks. I also say that there is a need, with regard to this inquiry which is now going to be held by the federal government into complementary medicine, for proper consultation with the industry and government before names are announced so that the people who are involved in the industry can be confident that it will be a fair inquiry.
There are many people in Australia who use complementary medicines. And people pay to buy those medicines. They are not subsidised by government. They attract GST. I think the amount of GST collected is something in the vicinity of $130 million. It is an important industry, and it is one that a lot of people access when they do not get satisfactory outcomes from orthodox medicine. They may find that their wellbeing is enhanced by the use of complementary medicine. I think it is important to remember that and put aside biases that some folk might have when other people find that it benefits them and gives them wellbeing.

"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—In summing up, I thank members who have contributed to the debate on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. In particular, I thank the opposition for allowing this legislation to proceed promptly through the chamber today and the Senate tomorrow. I have noted the remarks of the member for Perth, the shadow minister for health, and they are appreciated by the government. I am sure that the public of Australia will appreciate the fact that, over issues like this, the opposition and the government can work together to ensure their safety.
Before I take a more rounded approach to the summing up, I will comment on certain things that have been said by some members. I will start with the last first. The member for Mackellar has made a couple of points which I would like to clarify. The doxycycline manufactured by Pan was actually manufactured as an antibiotic for veterinary use, although I do add that that is a serious concern if one is thinking about the equipment not being cleaned as it should have been. The erythromycin was made for export purposes only. 
—The member for Mackellar says that that is the problem. To the best of our ability, Australia has had a strong export industry in complementary medicines and over-the-counter medicines, and we would like to see our reputation in that area restored. TGA officials have been working with officials in every one of the countries to which these products have been exported and, from what I have been told, I would be very surprised if these products were still sitting on shelves in other countries.
I would also mention that unfortunately from time to time, and even in the last week, adverse reactions have been reported from complementary as well as over-the-counter and prescription medicines. It is not the prerogative of one type of medicine over another to have or not have adverse reactions reported. I think it is unfortunate if we just look at the categories and do not look at the best interest of the public. Sometimes the adverse reactions are purely because someone has an allergic reaction to something or perhaps they have doubled up through a prescription and a nonprescription medicine. I would also assure the member for Mackellar that of course there will be a fair inquiry and there will be consultation with industry. But I consider that duty of care to the Australian public must be the very first prerequisite in looking at any inquiry.
A number of members of the opposition have tried to argue that the TGA should have acted earlier in relation to the suspension of Pan Pharmaceutical's licence. Members have tried to assert that the TGA waited until it had collected nine individual critical deficiencies before it acted. Members have clearly misunderstood some of the background to this issue. It was only following the third audit of Pan Pharmaceuticals that the magnitude and extent of the problems with the company's products and processing started to become apparent—
—Yes, the third audit this year—to the extent that a recall of products manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals became a possibility. The TGA had sought, through its search of documents obtained through audits, its interviews through surveillance activities and intelligence received from other sectors of the industry, the issues to be targeted in the final audit from 7 to 14 April, which revealed the extent of the systemic and all-encompassing nature of the data manipulation and bad manufacturing practices at Pan Pharmaceuticals.
The TGA is obliged under its legislation to give companies notice of its intention to suspend or revoke a licence, unless there is an imminent risk of death, serious illness or serious injury. So, without having collected that evidence and having that evidence examined and judged as such, it could not suspend the company's licence without notice. On obtaining the audit committee's results, the TGA immediately set up an expert committee to advise as to whether its findings at Pan Pharmaceuticals posed an imminent risk of death, serious illness or serious injury. If there had not been imminent risk, the TGA would have given notice to the company and the recall could have been conducted in an orderly fashion. Hence the member for Bruce's argument—that the TGA should have gone out far in advance of having established this position to prepare for a recall for over 300 companies without having the authority to demand an immediate answer—would not have assisted.
This particularly applies when you consider such action against the certainty that Pan Pharmaceuticals would have been tipped off and may have attempted to thwart the forthcoming TGA action through the courts. This is a litigious company and the TGA had to have a watertight case, as several speakers on the opposition have remarked. The TGA had to act with hard evidence. If it had been cavalier in its approach and did not have evidence able to stand up to scrutiny in the courts, the government could have been facing potential legal action costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Without satisfactory evidence that a serious public health risk was posed, the TGA would have been derelict in its duty if it had proceeded to initiate a recall of this proportion with such a serious impact on Australian consumers and on Australia's national and international reputation as a supplier of highquality medicines.  
The member for Bruce also questioned why no other microdose products manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals were recalled following the January audit. In February 2003, when the Pan Pharmaceuticals licence to manufacture lowdose tablets requiring compliance with uniformity of content standards was withdrawn, there were no specific concerns about adverse effects associated with any products other than with Travacalm. Laboratory testing demonstrated that the content of one of the lowdose active ingredients of Travacalm had varied from zero to seven times the proper amount.
In investigating the problems at Pan Pharmaceuticals, the TGA became aware that the company had only recently taken on the manufacture of the products Travacalm Original and Travacalm HO for Key Pharmaceuticals and that, contrary to the advice from Key Pharmaceuticals, Pan Pharmaceuticals was using a different manufacturing process for these products. When the specifications required a wet granulation process, Pan Pharmaceuticals used a dry granulation process, which involved trying to get uniformity of content by shaking the contents of a plastic bag. The manufacturing processes for Travacalm had obviously never been subject to a TGA audit as it was a new contract for the company, whereas the processes for other microdose products had been subject to audits on previous occasions. The TGA specifically targeted an examination of these other microdose products in an audit on 30 and 31 January. The only other non-compliant product found was some folic acid tablets, where they detected a slightly higher content than stated. This was assessed by the TGA as to not be of clinical significance and importantly, unlike Travacalm, there was no evidence at this point of manipulation of data for these products.
The point has been raised that the recall process was not well managed by the TGA. Given the unprecedented scale of this recall and the fact that there could not have been a dry run—no practice run—I believe the TGA successfully managed this within the bounds of the legislation. Some of the amendments being moved by the government today will enable recalls to take place even more quickly and effectively. I do not support the member for Bruce's argument that hundreds of sponsors should have been contacted before Pan's licence was suspended. Even if the TGA had used the S31 power under the Therapeutic Goods Act to obtain information from sponsors in the week between Easter and Anzac Day, the TGA would not have received a comprehensive picture of what products were at risk. Because of the number of sponsors and products involved, many sponsors would not have responded within any short time frame. The necessity to publish more than one list of products to be recalled could still not have been avoided. There is also the issue that I have raised during this recall, that it was legally necessary to know whether a recall was required before wide-scale action could be taken. 
The member for Bruce asked about the prescription medicine Allegron and why the minister issued a press release saying that no prescription medicines were involved in the recall and then had to reverse this and announce that Allegron was subject to a recall. The TGA received repeated assurances from Aspen Pharmacare Pty Ltd that they had tracked the batch of tablets involved and that none had reached client outlets—in other words, that they were in warehouses. The TGA sought and received confirmation of this advice in writing from the company. However, even though it had this assurance, the TGA proactively investigated whether this was indeed the case, asked state health departments to check wholesale outlets and requested the company undertake further checks. Only after these additional efforts was information provided to the TGA that the prescription product Allegron had been released from wholesale outlets to particular pharmacies in New South Wales and Southern Queensland. Being a prescription product, the company was able to notify the relevant pharmacies who, in turn, were able to contact those consumers affected to ensure an effective recall.
On this issue, I am concerned that the member for Bruce sought to criticise the TGA for acting and recalling the affected batches of Allegron when, as he stated, they were not sure of their facts, yet in the same debate he criticised the TGA for waiting until they did have the relevant information before they acted in relation to Pan Pharmaceuticals. In relation to statements made about prescription medicines, both Dr John McEwen and I at the original press conference urged the media to urge the public to continue to take their prescription medicines, because we were both very concerned that, had there been wide-scale alarm which stopped people taking their prescription medicines, those people could have come to significant harm.
The member for Bruce also raised the article which appeared in the Medical Journal of Australia. He claimed that this article should have alerted the TGA to concerns with the quality control systems at Pan Pharmaceuticals. The member for Bruce needs to know that the article in the Medical Journal of Australia related to isoflavones, which are present in significant amounts in some foods, such as soy products. I stress to the member for Bruce that the products referred to in the paper are not microdose products. They are herbal products. The fact that there was a lower quantity of isoflavones in the products than specified on the label posed no safety risk at all. When the MJA article was published, the sponsor company, Bullivant's, tested the product and confirmed that it contained less than the stated content of marker compound isoflavones and ceased the supply of the product batches involved. The member for Bruce said that the TGA should have been alerted here because Pan Pharmaceuticals was the manufacturer. Pan Pharmaceuticals was one of 11 manufacturers approved to produce this product for Bullivant's. As there was no safety issue involved and the supply had ceased, no further regulatory action was required. The TGA was satisfied that the sponsor had taken appropriate action with lowrisk products.
—They did not even contact the academics.
—The member for Bruce is constantly interjecting. I understand that he is a new shadow minister and wants to make a name for himself and perhaps get as much as publicity as possible. Some might consider that, for a politician, that is okay. But I think, in serious things like this, the public's safety must come first.
—Mr Deputy Speaker Price, I raise a point of order. The parliamentary secretary is reflecting on me in a very unparliamentary manner, particularly in a situation where there has been a generally high level of cooperation with respect to dealing with these matters. I ask you to get her to withdraw. 
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—Are you saying that the parliamentary secretary has reflected on you?
—She has reflected upon me in suggesting that I have politicised this issue simply for personal gain. It is a disgrace.
—I do not think the parliamentary secretary has reflected on you.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was simply making the point that I have gone to some significant trouble to—
—You have not even told us about the expert committee yet. We find out about things in the media. You talk about media in this situation. That is how you have conducted the whole exercise.
—I think it is unfortunate if interjections like this continue, because I certainly sat in silence and listened to the member for Bruce. I have researched the points that he raised, because I think that, in an important debate like this—with the public taking significant interest in it because of their own concerns about medication—we need to get some of these facts right; and that is what I have been endeavouring to do. 
I listened to many of the speeches made by other members; I could not listen to all of them. I did hear the member for Bonython's contribution. Not everyone in the House may know that the member for Bonython is a former health minister from South Australia and one of the few people in this place to hold a science degree. I thought his contribution was well researched, and I know he has a keen interest in this area. The member for Dunkley had gone to quite some trouble to contact people in his electorate to find out what they had to say. I was interested that, from the health food shops that he contacted, there was no criticism of the TGA. They want the TGA to be strong and to do a good job, because then people have confidence in their products. I thought that was enlightening.
I would also remind the member for Bruce that in another debate in the Senate, when I was previously in the portfolio and there were some reforms in the form of regulations in the Senate, the opposition and the Democrats voted down those reforms. The TGA were accused by the opposition of being overly bureaucratic and heavy-handed, yet now they are not good enough. I suppose that is the way it goes. 
There are other things in this bill—apart from the amendments—which was introduced at the end of last June. The bill will facilitate greater clarity, consistency and transparency in decision making relating to the regulation of advertisements for therapeutic goods and the food-medicine interface. The amendment to the definition of therapeutic goods in subsection 3(1) of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 will enable the Therapeutic Goods Administration—the TGA—to continue to regulate goods that are presented for therapeutic use, but subject to a food standard as a therapeutic good. This will provide the necessary clarity and certainty for consumers, industry and the regulators in relation to some goods at the food-medicine interface.
The changes to the advertising provisions in the therapeutic goods legislation are divided into two categories. The first category relates to the remaining advertising offences included in the Therapeutic Goods Regulations that are to be removed and inserted into part 5(1) of the act. The second category relating to the advertising provisions concerns the removal of advertising provisions from the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and incorporating similar provisions into the therapeutic goods legislation. At present, offences in relation to the advertising of therapeutic goods are divided between the act and the Therapeutic Goods Regulations. This means that two similar offences may attract different penalties depending on whether the offence is listed in the regulations or in the act. 
Under the regulations, the penalty for breaches of advertising requirements is set at 10 penalty units. For other comparable advertising offences that are included in the act, the penalty for breaches of advertising offences is 50 to 100 penalty units. By transferring the offences from the regulations to the act, the regulators are ensuring that a level playing field is created by having consistency in penalties imposed for breaches of the advertising offences. Currently there are some differences between the provisions for the approval of advertising as specified in the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and the provisions specified in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. Advertisements about medicines that are published in broadcast media are not being regulated in the same manner as those published in print media, cinema and outdoors, as these are subject to different provisions in two sets of legislation.
The amendments to remove advertising provisions from the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and include them in the therapeutic goods legislation will ensure consistency in the regulation of advertisements for therapeutic goods. The amendment requires that advertisements for therapeutic goods comply with the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code, irrespective of the type of media in which the advertisement was published or broadcast.
The changes included in the government amendments will clarify and tighten the responsibilities placed on sponsors and manufacturers of therapeutic goods to ensure that the products they make or supply measure up to appropriate internationally recognised quality and safety standards. The amendments will also equip the TGA with greater powers to take appropriate and timely action to remove substandard or suspect products from the marketplace. The amendments will enable every manufacturer involved in the manufacture of each batch of a therapeutic good—(Time expired)

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Bill 2002 and the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Amendment Bill 2002 amend the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act 1993—the levy act—provide more efficient mechanisms for collecting levies from superannuation funds to recoup the cost of financial assistance to certain superannuation funds and propose consequential amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The SI(S) Act allows the minister to grant financial assistance to APRA-regulated superannuation funds that have suffered losses as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft. The minister has discretion as to what he or she determines to be the loss arising from fraudulent conduct or theft and what proportion of this loss, known as the eligible loss, they provide in assistance. This financial assistance may be funded either from consolidated revenue or by a levy imposed under the levy act. The SI(S) Act provides for compensation up to 100 per cent of the eligible loss as determined by the minister. However, in 1997 the government, in adopting the recommendations of the Wallis inquiry, resolved only to pay 80 per cent of any eligible losses.
On 20 June 2002 the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, made the first determination to grant assistance under the SI(S) Act. A total of 180 determinations were made in 2001-02, and 197 were made in 2002-03. Almost all of these related to misconduct by Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd—CNAL—and related entities, with one determination relating to a small employer fund in Western Australia, the Australian Independent Superannuation Fund. Senator Coonan determined to pay only 90 per cent of these losses from theft and fraud. She has tried to argue that she was being generous relative to the government's previous policy of 80 per cent compensation. 
Labor has taken a strong stance on the government's failure to provide full compensation for victims of theft and fraud. On 27 June my colleague Senator Sherry moved amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No. 2) 2002 to require 100 per cent compensation in the event of theft or fraud. These amendments were defeated by the government and the Democrats. In his policy options paper released on 2 August last year, Senator Sherry reiterated Labor's position on the need to provide 100 per cent compensation for theft and fraud. 
At present, only Labor are prepared to stand up for the rights of superannuation fund members affected by theft and fraud. While it is our firm view that the government should have provided full rather than partial compensation, Labor will support the measures contained in these bills to streamline the funding of the financial assistance that is being provided.
The levy act provides for a levy on all APRA regulated superannuation funds to fund the cost of financial assistance. Any funds in receipt of assistance in that year are exempt from levies imposed in that year. The levy act currently requires a separate levy to fund each determination for assistance. This provision was drafted with the expectation that financial assistance would be payable to a single medium to large sized fund at a time.
These provisions require changes in light of recent cases of financial assistance where some 377 determinations have been made in respect of the same number of individual small funds and where all but one of the determinations provides assistance of less than $1½ million. The amendments therefore provide for a levy to cover more than one determination. This will reduce costs for APRA in administering the levy, and for super funds in complying with it, compared to the alternative of a substantial number of separate levies.
The amendments also provide for the regulation imposing the levy to set a minimum and maximum dollar amount for the levy. The levy act in its current form only provides for a levy equal to a fixed percentage of fund assets applied across all funds. The government has stated that the application of such a provision to fund the recent set of determinations would result in some large funds paying more than $400,000, well over their maximum supervisory levy of $66,000, with other small funds paying less that 20c, an amount that it is not administratively cost effective to collect. Labor supports the government's position that, by allowing minimum and maximum levies, these amendments provide for a more equitable and cost-effective sharing of the cost between funds, consistent with the provisions with respect to supervisory levies where minimum and maximum amounts are also set for similar reasons.
I note that the government has undertaken a review of the supervisory levies which may result in changes to the current system of minimum and maximum levies but, until such time, it is appropriate that the financial assistance levies follow a similar model. The amendments provide for a higher levy for funds below a certain size compared to what they would pay under the current provisions. However, as argued by the government, this cost will be offset to some extent by the reduced compliance costs provided by the earlier amendments.
The provisions of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Bill 2002 and the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Amendment Bill 2002 were subject to an inquiry by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which tabled its report in March this year. The committee considered that, while there were some concerns about the equity of the proposed levy arrangements, appropriate consultation on the maximum and minimum amounts should resolve any such issues. The committee accepted the approach contained in the bills. 
On the related issue of continued delays in processing outstanding applications of financial assistance, the committee called on the government to act quickly to ensure all those who have lost superannuation through theft and fraud receive at least partial compensation soon. The committee also considered a number of issues that were raised by Senator Sherry in his options paper—namely, whether the limitation of compensation to theft and fraud is too narrow, whether compensation should be extended to certain post retirement investments and whether compensation of less than 100 per cent is acceptable. 
Following the release of the report by its superannuation working group in October last year, the government announced a review of the compensation provisions in the SI(S) Act. All members of the committee agreed that the issues raised by Senator Sherry should be considered as part of the government's review, but only Labor was prepared to call for specific changes to protect retirement savings. Labor notes the government's intention to review the compensation arrangements but, in the light of previous attempts by the government to water down the existing provisions, including amendments proposed in the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 2) 1999, the government's motives in reviewing the arrangements are questionable. It is essential that any review be conducted with a view to strengthening protections for the millions of Australians with superannuation.
In contrast to the government's past attempts to water down compensation for theft and fraud, their failure to provide full compensation where theft and fraud has occurred and their vague plan for a review, Labor has put forward a number of proposals to strengthen protections for fund members. These include: to legislate for full compensation in the event of theft or fraud; to expand the definition of an `eligible loss' beyond theft and fraud to include losses resulting from other serious breaches of the SI(S) Act; and to extend compensation provisions to certain post retirement products.
Urgent action is needed to protect the retirement savings of all Australians. The SI(S) Act should be amended immediately to provide for 100 per cent compensation if retirement savings are stolen or defrauded. Once a determination is made as to the value of the eligible loss, that loss should be compensated in full, without delay and without the capricious exercise of ministerial discretion we have seen in the case of Commercial Nominees and the Australian Independent Superannuation Fund.
Labor rejects totally the government's argument that providing 100 per cent compensation would create `moral hazard'. This argument is simply inappropriate in the case of theft or fraud and ignores the basic realities of superannuation. Superannuation, unlike other financial products, is compulsory, as well as being very complex. Furthermore, it fulfils the fundamental goal of providing retirement incomes for millions of Australians.
The nature of theft or fraud, be it random or systematic, is such that it is impossible to predict in advance if and when it will occur. The implied suggestion that fund members whose savings were stolen or fraudulently taken should have known that this was going to happen is both ridiculous and unfair. The Commercial Nominees case demonstrates that, where serious fraud occurs, it is often concealed from fund members until it is too late and the consequences too damaging for it to be repaired without adequate compensation arrangements. An argument predicated on moral hazard may have merit in the context of well-informed investors making choices between investment vehicles carrying different risks. It is not applicable to circumstances where superannuation savings are lost through theft or fraud.
Labor is not suggesting that the government can or should guarantee superannuation outcomes against market fluctuations or poor judgments made honestly within the regulatory framework. But Australians have a right to know that their superannuation savings are safe, that those in control of their money are behaving honestly and that the regulator is supervising them adequately. The—thank-fully, rare—occasions where those charged with looking after superannuation act dishonestly and the regulator fails represent a fundamental breach of trust. Consequently, the victims should be fully compensated. 
Of course, it is preferable that the circumstances where compensation is payable never arise. But the only way to avoid them is through strong regulation and by punishing the perpetrators of theft and fraud, not by punishing the victims with less than adequate compensation. The relatively rare occurrence of theft and fraud in the superannuation sector makes full compensation in such circumstances affordable. The levies can spread the risks. There are also significant policy arguments for ensuring the safety of Australians' retirement savings from the devastating consequences for individual victims of theft and fraud. Accordingly, I move Labor's second reading amendment:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:
(1)	notes ongoing community concern on the safety of superannuation and the devastating effect of recent cases of theft and fraud on individual fund members;
(2)	condemns the Government for its mean-spirited failure to provide 100 per cent compensation, as permitted under legislation, in recent cases of theft and fraud;
(3)	demands that the Government immediately amend the Superannuation Industry (Super-vision) Act 1993 (the SIS Act) to ensure 100 per cent compensation is paid where super-annuation savings are lost through theft and fraud; and
(4)	calls on the Government to give urgent consideration to further amendments to the SIS Act to expand the definition of an “eligible loss” beyond theft and fraud to include losses resulting from other serious breaches of the Act and extend compensation provisions to certain post-retirement investments.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I second the amendment. The Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Amendment Bill 2002 proposes to amend the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act 1993, known as the levy act, to provide a more efficient mechanism for collecting levies from regulated superannuation funds and approved deposit funds to recoup the costs of financial assistance to certain superannuation funds.
The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Bill 2002 proposes consequential amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, known as the SI(S) Act. The latter allows the minister to grant financial assistance, through APRA, to regulated superannuation funds that have suffered losses as a result of `fraudulent conduct or theft'. The minister has discretion as to what is determined to be the loss arising from the fraudulent conduct or theft—the `eligible loss'—and what proportion of this loss is provided in assistance. The financial assistance may be funded either from consolidated revenue or by a levy imposed under the levy act. The SI(S) Act provides for compensation of up to 100 per cent of the eligible loss as determined by the minister.
I understand that in 1997 the government, in adopting the recommendations of the financial system inquiry—the Wallis inquiry—resolved only to pay 80 per cent of any eligible losses. I also understand, as my colleague earlier provided the chronology of events, that in June 2002, upon CNAL losses to a number of superannuation participants, the minister determined to pay only 90 per cent of the eligible losses arising from the instances of theft and fraud, and argued—as the former speaker mentioned—that this was a generous position relative to the government's previous policy of 80 per cent compensation. 
As the shadow minister, the member for Kingston, made quite clear, we on this side of the House believe that those who suffer these losses should be compensated in full—that there should be 100 per cent compensation. In the Senate, Senator Sherry, who is responsible for this legislation, moved amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Bill) (No. 2) 2002 to require 100 per cent compensation in the event of theft or fraud. Unfortunately, those amendments were defeated by this government and the Democrats.
As mentioned by the shadow minister in this House, we on this side, whilst not declining to give the bills a second reading, have moved a second reading amendment. It is important that the individual parts of that amendment be noted on the record. In particular, they are based on the fact that 100 per cent compensation is not paid to those who have suffered loss because of fraud in these instances. We note in our amendment the ongoing community concern about the safety of superannuation and the devastating effect of recent cases of theft and fraud on individual fund members. That is of great concern in the unfortunate environment we are experiencing at the moment, particularly in relation to bad governance. It flows right through corporate Australia. People are very concerned about the future of their investments, particularly superannuation. If superannuation is threatened—as many other investments are, particularly if they are, unfortunately, associated with companies like AMP at the moment—people have every right to be very concerned. That is why we note that concern.
In our second reading amendment we also condemn the government for its mean-spirited failure to provide 100 per cent compensation, as permitted under legislation, in recent cases of theft and fraud, as I noted earlier and as the previous speaker, the shadow minister, noted in more detail. We also demand that the government immediately amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1991—the SI(S) Act—to ensure 100 per cent compensation is paid when superannuation savings are lost through theft and fraud.
Members in this House should remember that we are talking about people's investments and, in many cases, the primary income that they will try to survive on in the future—and they demand nothing less than 100 per cent compensation, particularly against people who are involved in theft and fraud. We also call on the government to give urgent consideration to further amendments to the SI(S) Act to expand the definition of what is deemed an eligible loss beyond theft and fraud to include losses resulting from other serious breaches of the act and to extend compensation provisions to certain post-retirement investments. I do not need to reiterate for members the importance of people's savings, particularly in superannuation, that they have invested for their future. There needs to be 100 per cent compensation for theft and fraud and also the strictest, most prudent governance of investment accounts in corporate investment.
I will not go into detail in terms of the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act 1993—the levy act—and the amendments proposed by the government. Our shadow spokespersons have said that they accept those amendments and believe that the amendments will streamline a number of very important processes. However, I wish to reiterate that we wish to look at the section providing for minimum and maximum levels should evidence be provided to suggest that these will result in inequitable outcomes for certain funds and their members. 
Again I reiterate—and no doubt my colleague the member for McMillan will reinforce this—that it is essential that Australians be offered the strong protection of 100 per cent guaranteed compensation in the event that their retirement savings, which people are so concerned about, particularly today, are stolen or defrauded. The government's argument that 100 per cent compensation in these extreme cases would create `a moral hazard' is as false as it is mean-spirited. That is why we moved our second reading amendment. We hope that the government takes our amendment on board. I hope that the government is cognisant of the fear that is in the community about the investments that people will require to live on in the future.
Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, in my latest newsletter `The Bottom Line'—unfortunately, I was not able to get your good photo in, but I will certainly keep that in mind for the future—I have a couple of articles related to superannuation. I have headed one of those articles `Work till you drop'. That is an issue that a number of people are becoming very concerned about because this government is beginning to talk about changing the preservation age. There is great concern that, like a lot of changes that are going on with this government, these changes will occur by stealth. So I would like to take this opportunity to look at the question of the superannuation preservation age.
A concern arises because of comments made by government ministers, including the Prime Minister, in which they have indicated that they may increase the age at which Australians can access their superannuation or increase the preservation age. This measure was not contained in the 2003 budget but, if you look hard enough, you see that a substantial section was devoted to the issue of participation rates for mature age workers. Clearly the government, in its usual way, is trying to soften up Australians for a higher retirement age. Currently the preservation age is 55 for persons born before 1 June 1960. In 1997 the government made changes to phase this up to 60 for persons born after 1 June 1964.
It is interesting to note the litany of leaks surrounding government ministers related to this whole question of changing the superannuation preservation age. A leaked Department of Finance and Administration document produced in April 2002 proposed increasing the superannuation access age and the age pension age to 70. No doubt, if we have this government for much longer, we will be talking about increasing it to 90. This finance department document recommended a number of measures that are now government policy, including changes to the PBS and the disability support pension. So, on that record, we expect superannuation to be next.
The member for Higgins, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, addressed the Australian Financial Review Leaders' Luncheon on 7 August 2002. I do like reading some of the comments made by the Treasurer—in fact, I have some interesting ones here.
—Go on—punish us! You are a masochist!
—I do not sleep well at night. As an insomniac, I like to read what he has to say for himself. At the leaders' luncheon, Mr Costello stated: 
The decline in participation projected in the IGR—
the Intergenerational Report—
is also driven by the fact that many Australians seem to stop work shortly after they turn 55.
I thought he was going to say after five. He continued:
More flexible working arrangements, training and re-training and raising the preservation age for superannuation would all be positive moves to address this issue.
One greater than the Treasurer, the Prime Minister, at a Financial Planning Association conference on 21 November 2002 had this to say—and this is a `core' comment:
We have to recognise that the cult of early retirement that we encouraged so enthusiastically as a community a generation ago, it should be changed ...
When asked about this issue in Senate question time, the minister directly responsible for superannuation, Senator Coonan, refused to rule out increasing the preservation age to 65 or, even higher, to 70. It was reported in the Age on 26 February 2003 that the minister briefed cabinet on increasing the preservation age. In an interview in the Australian Financial Review on 6 May 2003, John Howard said, amongst other things, that early retirement was `a very big issue' and that, clearly, `superannuation is part of it'. He confirmed that the Treasurer had briefed cabinet on early retirement in February and established a task force to examine options. Uh oh!
Labor's response, if the change is proposed, is that any increase in the preservation age is an attempt to force Australians to work longer—no more, no less. The government have failed on superannuation policy. Their only solution for retirement incomes is to force Australians to work until they drop. And, whilst you are building up your superannuation, just for good measure they will tax you as well. More Australians will be dead before they can enjoy their hard-earned retirement savings. The ABS figures are rather stark but, I think, rather revealing about this. For example, 5,124 55- to 60-year-olds, 6,601 60- to 65-year-olds and 9,046 65- to 70-year-olds died in 2001 alone. An increase in the super preservation age to 70 years, as the Liberals have failed to rule out, would therefore mean that over the next 10 years at least 200,000 people who are currently able to get their super at 55 would die before they got to spend a cent of their superannuation.
While the government may try to justify a higher preservation age in terms of rising life expectancies, this ignores the fact that many older Australians cannot work past 60, let alone past 65. Some jobs, as we know, have compulsory retirement at 60. Many jobs, particularly those in mining and construction, are too physically tough for people to continue in past 60. Many older Australians cannot find work, yet the government has done very little to help them. Certain occupations will be impacted particularly harshly. These include airline pilots, police and members of the armed services, just to name some. A vast majority of members of the armed services, for instance, are required to retire at 55. It would be the height of hypocrisy from this government if they were forced to wait 10 or maybe 15 years to access their super.
Three years ago Mr Costello, the Treasurer, argued that superannuation was the next area of the economy in need of reform. Certainly, this was not dealt with in this budget. He has done nothing about it. I would like to quote from the Treasurer's statement to the National Press Club because I think it stands as an indictment of the government's non-action on this matter. He said: 
Let's get our way through our privatisation programme which is hopefully going to continue and I have indicated that I think that there are some other areas, financial areas that need a little bit of simplification and if we were to get through these great challenges perhaps we could turn to simplifying some other areas which are very complicated at the moment. It starts with S.
He went on to say:
I think the complexity in superannuation needs improving. And I think superannuation is now so complex, that it should be simplified.
Yet recently we have had plans for the deregulation of superannuation. We can go and pick any old fund. I hardly think that simplifies it. We know the headaches that are being caused not just to employees but to employers, particularly in small business, in relation to this deregulation policy. On 6PR on 18 May 2000, the Treasurer said:
I think it needs to be simplified. I think it's too complicated. We've got too many rules, too many conflicting rules, too many different taxation treatments. I think it's beyond the ken of most people to understand it.
The government's main plan in this area remains offering tax relief but only to the very highest income earners, particularly in relation to superannuation. With regard to the legislation before us, I join with my colleagues in accepting a number of the amendments laid out by the government to streamline these issues. But we stand very firmly on the issues of protection and equity, particularly in relation to getting 100 per cent compensation, full compensation, for people who are affected in their superannuation earnings and their funds by theft, fraud and other misgovernance and mismanagement. We hope that the government will take that on board, along with the amendment outlined by the shadow minister and, no doubt, to be elaborated on by my colleagues in the House tonight.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY (SUPERVISION) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I am glad to follow my colleagues in the debate on these two bills—the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Bill 2002 and the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Amendment Bill 2002—which are being dealt with together. One deals with the question of superannuation supervision and the other with the related question of how to actually deal with the problem of financial assistance funding. These have been collated together, and we are dealing with them on that basis.
This legislation has been a long time coming as part of the government's processes regarding superannuation. Under Minister Hockey in October 2001 they put together a superannuation working group which eventually came up with a paper called Options for improving the safety of superannuation. That took them some time, but they have had it for a year or so—maybe a bit less—and this is the first emergence of any of the series of reforms they looked at. We have here two things that they have said need to be done. Essentially, instead of making repeated single iterations of changes with costs potentially borne by a superannuation fund each time a grant for financial assistance is made to that fund because somebody—through theft, fraud or other misadventure—has knocked off some of the money that people have put into it, they can effectively do it in one job lot, which means that there is less financial loss to the fund.
The background paper to this provided by the Parliamentary Library is extremely good. It is not the most direct material to deal with—certainly in terms of the explanations the government has provided. It is somewhat arcane until you work your way through it, start taking a scalpel to it and think about it in a different way. Although itseems arcane, although it seems to be relatively dry economic stuff and although it seems to be dealing with small funds, there is a greater effect. In fact the negative effect of this on small funds is greater because, even though they are trying to address it on an annual basis, they can pay proportionately higher costs. 
There is also a series of deeper questions—which our amendments go to—on the safety of super. We live in a changed world. The former member for Blaxland said, quite correctly, `When governments change, the country changes.' The priorities change, the ways in which issues are dealt with change and you get different outcomes as a result of that. I would argue that, over the 13 years in which we were in government, our greatest single accomplishment was the provision of superannuation for almost all Australians. Before we came to government we were faced with a Treasurer who could not cough up the truth—the fact that he had a deficit of $9.6 billion staring him in the face. He had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, from saying that it was about $4 billion or $4.5 billion to saying in the last week of the campaign that it might be a $6 billion deficit. In fact it was a $9.6 billion deficit, just for one year. In today's dollars that is $26 billion to $27 billion—$26 billion to $27 billion of Howard Treasurer debt that I do not think has yet been repaid.
This government is always talking about `Keating government debt', `Hawke-Keating government debt' or `Labor government debt'. In the modern period, from 1951 until recently—the period since I was born—the accounting was such that there were no government surpluses except for the first four surpluses provided by the Hawke-Keating government. Prior to that, all of the conservative governments through all of the Menzian years ran deficits and built up a hell of a lot of debt. But, in terms of how people perceived the small amount of savings they had in their bank accounts, the little bit of money they put away in friendly societies, the little bit extra they might have provided for their children's education and so on, they might have felt a bit safer then than they do now.
We have seen company after company crash and burn in the stock market, as the AMP has—and my colleague the member for Braddon alluded to that situation—and some people are naturally very jittery. In the space of a couple of weeks we have seen one of Australia's biggest companies virtually self-immolate in terms of its stock market rating. That has a big effect on people. If people have a lot of money involved directly in AMP then their savings or their super have just been burnt up during that couple of weeks and they have no recourse. There is no safety for them in these bills either, because it is not a question of fraud or theft or whatever; it is a question of the valuation in the marketplace of how that company is run.
There have also been shocks to the system in relation to insurance companies, HIH being the most singular in the past couple of years. A company people valued, put faith in and trusted—a company that provided insurance across the community and particularly public liability insurance—folded in front of people's eyes. What the royal commission into it has exposed is that that which was trusted and was a cornerstone of the insurance and financial foundations of this country was not worth trusting at all in the first place. It has exposed the manner in which it was run, the way in which people in the company conducted themselves and the frivolous nature in which they simply frittered away vast amounts of money, along with the fact that there was very little care for the shareholders or the people they were dealing with—the personal gratification and advancement of the people who were principals in that company were more important.
It is no wonder, in the face of just those two examples, that people are feeling less safe, certain and sure in regard to the funds they have in a bank, a friendly society or super investments. They might be a bit more concerned about what is happening because we know that in the past couple of years the share market has gone down considerably in a whole range of areas, from tech stocks right through to resource areas, as part of a general downturn in the economy which is continuing worldwide. 
We also know that the whole thing has been made a hell of a lot more complicated than it was in the past. Labor came to office in 1983 and embarked on a considerable journey to convince people of the rightness of putting their money into super, to convince people that we needed to change the situation that had existed, where superannuation was only for those who were most privileged, those who worked for companies that had superannuation programs in place in the private sector—and not all companies in the private sector had it, only a certain number, and a good proportion of those had it as a vested superannuation account. Basically it was like a lolly jar. People would put their money aside, the company was supposed to add to that money, but the company could in fact draw on those superannuation moneys and invest them for the company's purposes. It came to pass in a variety of different places that when people came to get their superannuation out there was not much left in the jar because it had been purloined, effectively stolen. But the vesting rules that the member for Bennelong used to have when he was responsible for this area allowed that sort of activity to go on relatively unpunished. 
There was this notion that companies should self-manage, that companies should self-provide, that companies should self-regulate and the government should not do much about it. They thought that a conservative government really did not have the responsibility to be broadening this because, apart from local councils and state governments, where they had their own public service arrangements, and the Commonwealth Public Service arrangements for superannuation, the great commonality of Australian workers should not look to the super future but a pension only, and one that was not adjusted to average male earnings or indexed. This mob finally did that when they came to government after 1996. The Australian Labor Party provided 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings on the basis of providing surety and certainty. We did not actually have to legislate it; people could trust us to do it because we said we would, and we did it year after year. In terms of super, the vast bulk of people were not covered. They now are, and they were given cover by Labor. 
Today the Prime Minister paraded the government's supposed saintliness in opposition, where if there were good things that were put up by the then Labor government then the opposition supported them and it was not just against things for the sake of being against them. Excuse me? There were issues that had been pursued by the now Prime Minister during his period in here since 1974. He knows he supported a number of things that he did not have the capacity as a Liberal Treasurer to get through Malcolm Fraser's cabinet, and it grieved him that Paul Keating was able to get them through the Hawke-Keating cabinet as Treasurer and bring in a substantial range of reforms in the financial and banking areas and then across the board. Howard actually believed in those things but was not able to punch through and achieve those reforms. 
So you would expect he would stand up and say, `I haven't got much of a problem with that.' But he gave another instance in saying that the now government, then opposition, actually accepted the HECS fees. I know what he argued at the time, as I interjected today. The member for Bennelong was all about full fees—that is what he believed in. That is what he really believes in now. He does not believe in HECS at all. He thinks HECS is only partial. This current conservative government believed in the model that they had. They have got a charity based view of medicine, still stuck back in the 19th century, and they have got an education model based on giving a certain proportion of people places in higher education, or technical and further education, which is really beyond their ken totally. But there is a view that the teachers colleges can provide that: you can provide some nursing scholarships, and now we need some specific ones for doctors, but you can save a lot of money by making sure that the costs are commensurately higher.  
They have maintained HECS this time even though they do not believe in it, but they interposed about three years ago a differential scale so that in the areas where we most need people to be trained, in mathematics and the sciences, you pay more in HECS if you take on engineering or if you take on a science based degree. One of Australia's fundamental weaknesses is that we do not produce enough scientists and we do not produce enough people who are mathematically trained. When `science met parliament' last year and parliamentarians went to dinner with a group of mathematicians and scientists, it was explained to us that we have a fundamental shortage in trained mathematicians. That is increasing. People are not beating down the doors to go and do pure or applied mathematics. We need to encourage people to do it. But this government says, `You pay a price penalty if you do so.' I do not think that is smart or sensible policy. It is not clever policy; it is a dumb approach to policy. It is a programmatic approach based on an ideological presumption about how it should be formed.
In super we have had another traducing of the situation. I actually should have gone on at some length about the Prime Minister in terms of what he supported and what the government supported when they were in opposition. There is example after example where they did not agree with Labor, where they stopped any form of change in the Senate, but the one great example that we have of the propagandistic nature of this government which has been expressed since 1996 is the farce that the Treasurer went on with today—a farce unexamined by the press gallery, which does not even bother to look at it. They did not look at it then and do not bother to look at it now. The l-a-w stuff raises cackles and hoots of laughter on the government side but it is based on a fundamental falsity. The former Prime Minister and member for Blaxland, Paul Keating, was absolutely right. The l-a-w tax cuts had been written into law by Labor. The first tranche of those tax cuts was given one year before they were originally scheduled to be given. They were given early, so their effect was greater. In the MPI today the member for Fraser pointed out that the value of that first tranche was in fact twice the value of the tax cuts laughably given by the Treasurer on Tuesday night—twice in terms of quantum but in terms of effect very much greater. It was the first tranche of a two-tranche process of giving tax cuts. We had said in giving that first tranche of tax cuts that if we had been elected in 1996 Labor would deliver the second tranche but, because of the economic circumstances we faced, having given the first tranche a year early in order to provide an economic stimulus to the economy to take us out of the period of recession we had entered into, we would delay the second tranche of the tax cuts for one year, balancing out the early payment. 
This government came to power utilising the excuse that we said we would commute those tax cuts into superannuation. We know that there is a resistance in the community, as there was from the start, because working people wanted to see the cash that they might expect to get go straight into their pockets. That is what they preferred. Labor spent more than three years convincing people at the workplace to take superannuation rather than to take straight cash in straight increases—because it was necessary for ordinary working people to start preparing and saving for the future, assisted by the government. 
In the end we could not get it done on a voluntary basis; we had to actually legislate. So the award superannuation which has now reached nine per cent—which we would have taken to 12 per cent and then to 15 per cent, because that was our goal—was sealed at nine per cent by this conservative government. They could not do anything about that; it was bound to go to nine per cent. But what they did do was take that commuted second tranche of tax cuts that was changed into superannuation and throttle it to death. The certainty that people had about getting that second tranche as super, whether they chose to like it or not, the government throttled to death. And then they argued that it was Labor that did not deliver. It was a conservative government that throttled that program. They have simply been `propagandistic' about this ever since. 
And there has been no comment from the media. We just get a crew over on the other side chortling about l-a-w tax cuts and all the rest of it. The superannuation was stolen, thieved and fraudulently dealt with by this government. It is quite right that we should support the measures in this super bill when it comes to fraud, theft and loss. We should also direct our fire at the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and all the members of the government who have fraudulently stolen the superannuation that ordinary people had—that superannuation which was originally tax cuts and was commuted. Time after time they have come in and turned over the realities, but that does not change the fact that they are not committed to superannuation for ordinary people.
If you look at what they have done throughout the whole range of superannuation measures, the killer is superannuation choice. The government have said, `We are providing choice in superannuation.' Why are they saying that? Why do they have about five different propositions that they have put up over time at five different levels? They have done that because they intensely dislike industry superannuation. They do not like unions being involved in it at all. They do not like the fact that you can have a commonality of people who join together in a strong industry fund—with people from the unions and the workplace involved in the overseeing of that. 
What is their preferred mode? Their preferred mode is for people to whack their dough in the bank at enormously low returns. That was one of their five models for how you could go about it. That was the reserved deposit scheme they had. That was a pretty dud go, but for them it was, `Well, why worry about it because it's only ordinary working people—the battlers. We'll say that this is choice.' We know that the superannuation industry has had enormous costs imposed on it because the government do not understand this area at all.
These two changes are reforms which are necessary. We will wait to see the rest of the changes that come out of this working group. The reforms have come out so slowly because this is a government that is not committed to superannuation. It is not committed to safety and further provision for ordinary Australian workers. A government that stole the superannuation that was the workers' due—that extra three per cent that should have gone to people—cannot be trusted and needs to be watched. And we are the ones to do it.

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Before I get to the guts of the legislation I want to make a few remarks about superannuation generally. We are talking about people's savings. In the case of people who do not have much money, we are talking about all their savings. I am pleased you are in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, because you are a representative of a country area, as are my good friends here: the member for Braddon and the member for Corio. We have good people here who represent country districts. They will be able to understand what I am talking about. 
We do not have the same amount of savings in country districts as people in the cities do. When people pay off their houses in the city—and often people's houses in the city become very valuable very quickly—they have that as their backup as well. They have that as their savings as well. People in country districts—and people who work in industries like food manufacturing, the timber industry and other industries where people are employed in difficult occupations—do not get much money to save, because they work in industries where people do not receive a great salary. Often the only savings that they have when they retire are their superannuation. 
This is why, when we talk about this stuff, we must never lose sight of the fact that for a large section of Australian society we are talking about all they have. Superannuation is all they have. I want to mention in my remarks on this legislation how important it is, when we consider changes to superannuation, that we do not forget that when people work in certain occupations they carry with them a reduced capacity to work in that industry for a period of time. For example, someone working as a bank manager for 40 years might reasonably be expected to exit that sector of the economy and go on and live 30 or 40 years. Is quite common and it is something which I think most people in this House would understand to be quite a reasonable thing to expect. But someone who works in the construction industry, for example, because of the physical toughness of the occupation, is unlikely to live for as long a period of time, if they retire at age 65. This is what morbidity studies have revealed. This is what a lot of the research has now revealed in relation to the life expectancy of people in certain occupations. We must not lose sight of this when we are talking about anything to do with superannuation. The opposition has made a number of sensible points in relation to this legislation, which I will talk about in more detail later on in my contribution to this debate.
I seek leave to continue my remarks when this debate is continued.

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I want to talk about the Pakenham bypass, which is a critical infrastructure project in the electorate of McMillan. When it comes to this project, the federal government have been involved in a shameful betrayal of the people of Pakenham and of the Gippsland region. This is what the budget documents say in relation to the Pakenham bypass:
The Princes Highway between Beaconsfield and Pakenham is rated as the worst crash zone in Victoria. 
Despite that fact, they have not funded the full federal commitment of $121 million in the federal budget. The state government have committed their half of the project, $121 million. But, because the federal government have not contributed their $121 million, it looks likely that the project is now going to stall.
It is reasonable to expect that the Commonwealth will pay half when it comes to Roads of National Importance. After all, they are the people who declare roads to be Roads of National Importance. This is what has happened with the Calder Highway, where the Commonwealth has paid half of the cost; the Port River Expressway in South Australia, where the Commonwealth has paid half the cost; and with the Devonport Access Road, where the Commonwealth has paid half the cost. This government has declared them all as Roads of National Importance and has contributed half the cost of their roadwork. In the case of Pakenham, people in my electorate are thinking, `What about us? Treasurer Costello, what happened to the promise you made to us before the 2001 election that you were going to commit to half the cost of the project?'
In November 1996, when talking about an agreement between the federal and state governments in relation to Roads of National Importance, the minister for transport said, `It was agreed that approved Roads of National Importance projects would be funded on a dollarfordollar basis.' That is pretty clear, I would have thought. The minister for transport then said in October 2001 that the commitment they had made to the Pakenham bypass was `rock solid'. He went on to say, `We don't make paper promises.' The people of Pakenham are probably wondering what sort of promise was made to them when he and the Treasurer came down and the commitment was made to paying half of the cost of the Pakenham bypass. The state government have their money on the table, $121 million, for their half of the project. The Commonwealth government should commit $121 million and make sure that this project gets built. This is what the Treasurer had to say about Roads of National Importance in an interview with John Faine on 16 April:
If they have a certain business case behind them they can be declared Roads of National Importance and, in respect of that road after it is assessed against competing roads right around Australia, the Commonwealth if it designates it as a road of national importance will offer 50 per cent funding.
`Fifty per cent funding' are his words. All that the people of Pakenham and of the Gippsland region are asking is that he honour his commitment and put in 50 per cent of the funding for our road, for the Pakenham bypass. Unless they do that, this road will not be built. In a press conference later on that same day, just after two o'clock, the Treasurer went on to say:
The Commonwealth is responsible for the national highways and the states are responsible for state roads. We have a program called Roads of National Importance, RONI, by which you can do an economic case and, if there is an economic benefit of a certain level in the construction of a particular road, then it can be declared a Road of National Importance and be funded 5050 by the Commonwealth and the states. 
That is what we are asking for in relation to the Pakenham bypass. All we are asking is that the coalition honour the promise they made before the 2001 federal election to people of the Pakenham district and of the Gippsland region. They wanted to get people to vote for them on the basis of this promise. But, when push comes to shove and when they are actually in a position to deliver on their promise, they are not forthcoming. This is a shameful betrayal of the people of Pakenham and of the Gippsland region. 
I say to the people on the other side and to Minister Anderson and Treasurer Costello in particular: you have said in the budget documents that you accept that this is the worst crash zone in Victoria. What happens if there is an accident caused by your obfuscation, your playing politics with this? Will you take responsibility for a death on that road? Will you take responsibility and explain to the families why it is that your playing politics has caused another death on this road? I say to those people over there: you have been involved in a shameful betrayal of the people of Pakenham and of the Gippsland region, and you stand condemned for it. You have the chance to do something about it. You should honour your promise on the Pakenham bypass.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—Today I wish to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Warren Truss, to do something very worth while for my electorate. I want him to help secure 40 new jobs in Rockhampton. You would have to say that this government owes one to us in Rockhampton. I say that because the federal government last year did nothing to assist attempts to keep open the Lakes Creek Meatworks, one of our city's largest industries, nor have we heard anything from the federal government about the crisis currently threatening the Australian Magnesium project in Rockhampton. The loss of the Lakes Creek plant cost our community over 1,000 jobs and the situation with AMC could cost another 450 full-time jobs. What have we heard from the federal government on this so far? Nothing. There has been silence on both these matters. There has been no help and there have been no words of encouragement; there has been just silence as 1,500 full-time jobs disappear from our community.
Now there is a chance for the Howard government and Mr Truss as the minister responsible for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to do something to help a small business develop and survive in this very difficult business environment and to create much needed jobs in our city. A company called Naturally Australian Foods intends to reopen a small meat processing plant in Rockhampton. It intends to employ 40 people. This means 40 new jobs for Rockhampton. AQIS, however, will not allow this to happen unless the company agrees to pay the debts outstanding to AQIS from the three previous owners of the plant. AQIS is asking Naturally Australian Foods to pay over $250,000 for inspection fees and charges provided to previous owners of the plant. This amount includes the debts of Fitzroy River Meats, Royal International and Shannonville. All of these companies were allowed to run up a substantial debt with AQIS. None of them was in a position to pay these debts, and the government effectively allowed these companies to continue to trade while insolvent.
Mr Truss and his department must take responsibility for this debt and must accept that it was simply bad management which allowed this situation to get so out of hand. We have a new company which is trying to establish itself being asked to pay for Mr Truss's bad management. AQIS expects Naturally Australian Foods to pay the outstanding $250,000. Should the new company refuse to pay the outstanding debt, it will not be allowed to open and another 40 jobs would be lost for Central Queenslanders. It was the intention of Naturally Australian Foods to commence operations on 26 May; Mr Truss can for once do something for the jobless people of Central Queensland and help ensure the survival of this fledgling company. I appeal to Mr Truss to waive the charge of $255,271.51 to Naturally Australian Foods and ask him to pursue the previous owners of the plant and the directors of those companies whose debt this is. This government owes one to Rockhampton. We cannot see another 40 jobs in our city go when we have lost 1,500 jobs in the last year.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Capricornia Electorate: Employment</title>,Statements by Members,24,1
"Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)",N/A,2003-05-14,"—Before continuing with government business, I would like to make a short statement. The House has readopted sessional order 84A for the remainder of this session. I remind members that the intention of this is to allow greater spontaneity in debate. As members will recall, the procedure allows a member to seek to ask a question concerning another member's speech. If the member `gives way', the other member is able to ask a short question relevant to the member's speech. The clock is not stopped during interventions.
The chair remains in control at all times, as for all proceedings. The chair will not allow the question to be posed if he or she is of the view that it is an abuse of the orders or the forms of the House. That would be clear if there were persistent and repetitive or mischievous interventions or if the intervention were too long. When a member has risen during another member's speech, the chair has said, `Order! Is the member seeking to ask a question?' If the other member confirms that he or she is, the chair needs to ascertain whether the member speaking will allow a question and asks, `Will you allow a question?' If the member declines, there can be no dispute—that is the end of the matter. If the member allows the question, the chair will ensure that only a brief and immediately relevant question is put.
Interventions have not been allowed during members' statements and, given the five-minute time limit, they would not be appropriate during the adjournment debate. Because of the significance of ministers' and parliamentary secretaries' second reading speeches in terms of statutory interpretation, interventions have not been regarded as appropriate, but a question could be appropriate during a minister or parliamentary secretary's summing up speech. I intend to circularise all members about the standing orders. ",REPS,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Main Committee: Procedures</title>,Business,25,1
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Family Law) Bill 2002 amends some seven acts governing the Commonwealth's military and civilian superannuation schemes to accommodate changes made to the Family Law Act 1975 in relation to superannuation benefits. This new family law regime came into effect on 28 December 2002 following the passage of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill with Labor's support in June 2001. The new regime is intended to provide a more equitable and flexible system for the division of property under the Family Law Act.
This bill is one of four bills that, together with regulations, form a total package of some 400 pages of new law. The new family law regime ensures that superannuation interests form part of the property of married couples and provides for those interests to be split between the parties in a property settlement following a marriage breakdown. The new regime provides a method for the valuation of an accrued superannuation interest in a defined benefits scheme, such as the Commonwealth schemes, at the end of marital breakdown. That value can then be taken into account for the purposes of a property settlement and can be split between the parties.
Parties to a property split may agree or the Family Court may order that the trustees of a superannuation scheme must allocate a base amount or the amount calculated by applying a percentage to the valuation to the ex or nonmember spouse of a scheme member. The new regime then provides a default option for the indexation of that amount if the benefit is not immediately payable and for this amount to be paid to the nonmember and deducted from the benefit payable to the member. Alternatively, the new regime allows superannuation scheme rules to be amended to provide for the creation of a separate interest for the nonmember and the subsequent reduction of the benefit becoming payable to the member.
Three alternative approaches have been considered for applying the new family law regime to the Commonwealth schemes: the default option, a percentage only split and a separate interest approach. Given the variety of benefit outcomes possible in the public sector schemes, it is impossible to know for certain what the final benefit will be. It is therefore possible under the default option for the adjusted base amount payable to the nonmember spouse to be greater than the benefit payable to the member spouse, leaving the member spouse with nothing. A percentage split would eliminate the possibility of the nonmember spouse being left with nothing at the benefit stage, but it would reduce certainty for the nonmember spouse. This is because the value of the nonmember spouse's benefit is dependent on the benefit actually paid to the member spouse, which can vary. In addition, both these approaches make the timing of benefit payments to the nonmember spouse dependent on the access age of the member spouse and the benefit option selected. 
This bill opts for a separate interest approach whereby a separate interest is created for the nonmember at the time of the split, equal to the base amount determined by the agreement or order. A nonmember spouse's benefits will be indexed in a similar way to a member's benefits. Where the separate interest is created during the growth phase of the member's benefit, the benefit to the nonmember will become payable when the nonmember satisfies a relevant condition of release, such as age retirement, death or permanent disability. Where the separate interest is created when the member is in receipt of a pension benefit, the nonmember benefit can become payable immediately. These provisions are to ensure that the retirement income objectives of superannuation are met. The immediate splitting of pension payments is appropriate because, had the couple remained married, they would have shared the pension payment. Certain classes of pensions, such as orphans' pensions, will not be reduced should a split be made before the pension becomes payable.
At the payment stage, a formula will be applied to reduce the benefits of the member spouse. Given the uncertain nature of benefits under the Commonwealth scheme, this could result in some separated couples receiving a combined benefit of more or less than they would have received had they not separated. Despite the potential for couples to receive a net financial gain or suffer a loss by separating, it is preferable to the alternative prospect of one spouse receiving little or no benefit at all. Furthermore, this approach, by allowing a clean break between the parties, reduces the dependence of the nonmember spouse on the payment of benefits to the member spouse.
Labor will support this bill because the separate interest approach it applies is more likely than the alternative options to provide fairness, flexibility and certainty for all parties. Labor has adopted a bipartisan approach to the complex task of ensuring this new family law regime operates in a fair and efficient manner. I should, however, draw attention to the fact that we are debating this bill only after the commencement of the new regime on 28 December last year. In fact, despite the impending deadline of 28 December, the government did not introduce this bill until 12 December—the last full sitting day of the last parliamentary year. This delay in the necessary changes to the Commonwealth schemes is unacceptable. It leaves members currently engaged in property settlements in an uncertain position and may delay settlements or the implementation of payment splits.

"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Family Law) Bill 2002 proposes amendments to a number of acts that deal with superannuation arrangements for members of Commonwealth civilian schemes and members of Australian Defence Force schemes. These superannuation arrangements are being amended as a consequence of changes to the Family Law Act 1975 and to regulations under that act in relation to the new arrangements for splitting superannuation on marriage breakdowns.
Under these new arrangements, superannuation will be treated as the property of a marriage and will be able to be divided as part of a property settlement—something that is very interesting for the electorate of Gilmore, where we have a number of people who will be affected by this legislation amendment. This will also enable separating parties or the Family Court to value a member's superannuation interest and make an agreement or order for the superannuation to be split. This bill provides a framework within the relevant scheme for dealing with an agreement made by separating parties or a Family Court order that provides, in the context of an overall property settlement, for the amount of the member's superannuation to be allocated and paid to the member's former spouse. I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration is now here, so I will ask him to continue with his speech.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—I do apologise for my late arrival. About five minutes ago I got word that the shadow Attorney-General was unable to speak and had dropped off the list, so I hurried up here. I thank my good friend the member for Gilmore for making an erudite contribution, as she does in relation to so many bills.
The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Family Law) Bill 2002 is one of those noncontroversial pieces of legislation that is privileged to enjoy the support of all parties in the House. This bill proposes amendments to a number of acts that deal with superannuation arrangements for members of the Commonwealth civilian schemes and the Australian Defence Force schemes. The bill will provide a framework within the relevant scheme for dealing with a superannuation agreement or Family Court order in relation to the division of a member's superannuation following a marriage breakdown. It will enable a separate superannuation benefit account to be created and arranged for a member's former spouse in these circumstances. This will allow for a clean break of superannuation entitlements between the parties at the time of the marriage breakdown and will also provide both parties with control over their respective individual benefits. This is a noncontroversial but important piece of legislation, which I now commend to the chamber.

"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—I move:
That this bill be now read a second time.
This is a portfolio bill which contains a number of minor policy and technical amendments to various Commonwealth criminal laws.
Details of the amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the bill. The amendments will not have any significant financial impact.
Two technical amendments are proposed for provisions in the Crimes Act 1914 dealing with the investigation of Commonwealth offences. The first makes it clear that a judge or a magistrate may order the taking of both fingerprints and a photograph of a convicted person. The second clarifies that if a suspect refuses to take part in an identification parade, then any evidence of that refusal, irrespective of whether the suspect had a reasonable excuse for refusing, cannot be used as evidence of the suspect's guilt. The amendments clarify the language of the provisions to reflect their intended purpose without impacting on their operational effect. 
A further amendment to the Crimes Act will extend the class of indictable offences that may be dealt with summarily. Currently, offences that involve property valued at more than $500 must be dealt with as an indictable offence. The amendment increases this threshold to $5,000. In addition, offences that specify a pecuniary penalty only may in certain circumstances now be dealt with as summary offences. The amendments mean more offences may be dealt with in lower courts, thereby contributing to a more efficient criminal trial process.
The bill also makes amendments to the forensic procedures provisions in the Crimes Act. Those amendments will enable the matching of the DNA profile of one unknown deceased person with the DNA profile of another unknown deceased person, clarify and expand the provisions enabling the minister to enter into arrangements with participating jurisdictions for sharing DNA information and clarify the role of CrimTrac. Such measures may assist in the identification of unknown deceased persons or the investigation of Commonwealth offences that occur in Australia.
Amendments are also proposed for the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 and the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991 to assist the expansion of the air security officer program to selected foreign destinations. They would enable air security officers travelling on flights to selected foreign destinations to deliver persons arrested on such a flight into the custody of a police force of the foreign country in which the flight ends.
On 1 January 2003 the National Crime Authority was replaced by the Australian Crime Commission. Amendments are proposed for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001 consequential upon the establishment of the ACC and the inclusion of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence in that body. The amendments ensure that, where appropriate, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Reserve Bank will be able to pass information relating to serious contraventions of the law to the ACC in the same way they were previously able to pass information to the NCA. These measures will assist in the transition from the NCA to the ACC. The amendments would also remedy a drafting error in the Australian Crime Commission Establishment Act 2002.
The Crimes at Sea Act 2000 is amended to clarify that the laws that apply in the territorial sea adjacent to the Northern Territory are the laws of the Northern Territory rather than all laws that are in force in that Territory.
The Australian Capital Territory is currently the only jurisdiction in Australia not represented on the Criminology Research Council. Amendments to the Criminology Research Act 1971 will remedy this situation by requiring that the council include a representative from the ACT.
The Foreign Evidence Act 1994 is amended to remove a provision that requires foreign material to bear an official state seal. This requirement was originally included as a means of confirmation that the requested evidence was obtained through appropriate official channels. However, a number of countries have experienced difficulties in meeting this requirement, and it is not considered necessary that foreign evidence be sealed in order for the Attorney-General to be satisfied that the material has been received through official channels. For example, a covering letter from the relevant foreign central office for mutual assistance in criminal matters would suffice. This change should increase the efficiency of the criminal justice system. 
The bill provides for several technical amendments to be made to the mutual assistance in criminal matters provisions of the International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995. 
Those provisions reflect similar amendments which were made in 1986 to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. The amendments will ensure consistency between the regimes for assistance under the International War Crimes Tribunals Act and the provisions in the amended Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act.
The Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Act 1992 is also amended by the bill to remove restrictions on the Attorney-General's delegation powers under that act. The amendments will allow the Attorney-General to delegate his powers to either the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department or to an APS employee. They also remove the requirement that the Attorney-General personally deal with a request which the delegate considers should be refused on national interest grounds. The current limitation on the delegation provision is unnecessary. Routine requests will be dealt with by the Attorney-General's delegates, and more sensitive requests will be referred to the Attorney-General for personal consideration.
Amendments are also proposed for the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to clarify that the Official Trustee has the power to sell restrained property where the Official Trustee is obliged to repay legal aid commission costs out of property of a suspect or other person covered by a restraining order.
The Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 will also be amended to enable arrest warrants issued by parole boards and other similar bodies to be executed interstate. Currently, the act allows arrest warrants issued by a court in one state to be executed in another state but does not cover arrest warrants issued by parole boards and other similar bodies. The amendment will remedy this deficiency by allowing such bodies to be prescribed by regulations for this purpose. Enabling the warrants issued by these bodies to be executed interstate under the act will contribute to the effective administration of justice by recognising the problems that may be caused when a person absconds interstate while on parole.
I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.",REPS,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION ENHANCEMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—The Crimes Legislation Enhancement Bill 2002 makes a number of minor and technical amendments to various Commonwealth criminal laws. The bill has been through various drafts. Some of the original proposed amendments have been withdrawn; others have been added. In one sense, the bill before the House today is a grab bag of amendments that tidy up some loose ends in various pieces of existing legislation. 
The amendments made by the bill before the House today will amend the Crimes Act 1914 to clarify the rules about the taking of photographs and fingerprints, making it clear that both may be taken; clarify the consequences of a refusal to participate in an identification parade; increase the monetary threshold for when a court of summary jurisdiction may hear and determine proceedings in respect of an indictable Commonwealth offence where the offence relates to property; insert a provision to allow a court of summary jurisdiction to hear and determine an indictable offence if it is not punishable by imprisonment and the pecuniary penalty for the offence is below a certain level; amend the Requirement of Foreign Evidence Act 1994 for authentication of testimony received from a foreign country by removing outdated requirements for seals; make minor technical amendments to the Crimes Act 1914, the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulations Act 1992; and augment the assistance given to international war crimes tribunals under the International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995. This includes allowing the use of video links and changing the conditions precedent to the use of force by police officers when making an arrest under the act. I will come to that later.  
I raised concerns about one of the original proposals at a briefing given by officers of the Attorney-General's Department late last year. That proposal aimed to change subparagraph 66(2)(b)(i) of the International War Crimes Tribunals Act in order to `change the conditions precedent to the use of force in making an arrest under this provision from cumulative to alternative conditions in order to avoid unintentionally inhibiting the use of force where it is necessary to protect life or prevent serious injury'. The section of the act deals with the use of force in making arrests and sets out the boundaries around the amount of force that police forces can use in making a lawful arrest under the act. It says that police must not use force or subject a person to greater indignity than is necessary and reasonable to make the arrest. 
The subsection that the original bill sought to amend deals with situations where a police officer might cause the death of a person or cause them grievous bodily harm. It does not sanction such action but requires two things of police officers before they take such drastic action as shooting: 
(i)  the police officer believes on reasonable grounds that doing that thing is necessary to protect life or to prevent serious injury to another person (including the police officer); and
(ii)  the person has, if practicable, been called on to surrender and the police officer believes on reasonable grounds that the person cannot be apprehended in any other manner. 
The proposed amendment was to replace the word `and' with the word `or'—on the face of it, such a simple change, and such an ostensibly straightforward legislative amendment. But think about what that would mean in the real world: it would mean, quite literally, that a police officer would not be required to shout out to a person facing arrest under the powers in this act, `Stop, or I will shoot'; rather, the officer could simply shoot on the grounds that he or she believed it was the right thing to do in the circumstances. I am not suggesting that police officers shoot willy-nilly at people. We can be proud in Australia that our armed police forces have shown themselves to be vigilant about their use of firearms. When police do have to fire, for whatever reason, I know that it sends shock waves through the force, especially at a local level. It is not taken lightly. 
We also recognise that it is cold comfort to think that a call to surrender is all that lies between an individual and a police bullet. But my point is that such ostensibly simple amendments to legislation can amount to massive changes in how the law operates. The government and its advisers accepted my arguments against the change when I was given a briefing by the government's officers. In response to my concerns, the government amended the bill in the Senate to remove the proposed amendment relating to the use of force when making an arrest. That is why it is so important for opposition parties to keep a very close eye on legislation and it is also why the government and its agencies, motivated in part to tidy up sloppy earlier drafting of legislation, need to always come up with solid, convincing arguments for the changes they are seeking. I am very pleased that the government withdrew that proposed amendment and indeed facilitated an amendment in the Senate that led to the opposition of that proposed change. 
Let me deal with other provisions in the current bill. The government also intends to introduce a range of amendments that make further technical amendments to other Commonwealth criminal laws. They will: amend part 1D of the Crimes Act 1914 to enable the DNA profile of an unknown deceased person to be matched with another DNA profile of an unknown deceased person, and to clarify and expand the provisions enabling the minister to enter into arrangements with participating jurisdictions for sharing DNA information; make a minor technical amendment to the Australian Crime Commission Establishment Act 2002; amend the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 and the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991 to assist the deployment of air security officers on Australian flights to and from selected international destinations; amend the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to allow information to be passed to the Australian Crime Commission in the same circumstances as it may have been passed to the National Crime Authority prior to its cessation on 31 December 2002 and to remove a reference to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, which has been incorporated into the ACC; amend the Corporations Act 2001 to allow information to be passed to the ACC in the same circumstances as it may have been passed to the NCA; amend the Criminology Research Act 1971 to make it a requirement that the Criminology Research Council include one member who is a representative of the ACT; make minor technical amendments to the Proceeds of Crimes Act 2002 to clarify that the Official Trustee has the power to sell restrained property so that, as originally intended, the Official Trustee can pay a legal aid commission's legal costs out of the property of a suspect covered by a restraining order; and amend the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 to allow parole board warrants to be executed interstate.
After considering the proposals, and with the amendments incorporated, the Labor Party is supporting the bill before the House. I apologise to the remaining speakers for not being able to stay in the chamber but I have a group of students in my office and I need to return. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION ENHANCEMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2003-05-14,"—The Crimes Legislation Enhancement Bill 2002 is essentially a technical bill, as the member for Banks pointed out, which makes some minor changes and technical amendments. These amendments are being made to various Commonwealth criminal laws and deal with issues such as the taking of photographs and fingerprints, identity parades and changes to thresholds for indictable offences.
Some of the provisions in the bill make changes that reflect our changing world—a world of many conflicts. One of the specific provisions of this bill deals with war crimes. This is extremely topical, given the conflicts which raged in the 1990s in the former Yugoslavia. Currently, former President of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic is facing the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague. The provisions of this bill allow the use of video links in these types of hearings—a very practical, modern and relevant approach.
The government, in response to the concerns expressed by my colleague the member for Banks, proposes to remove the section of the bill which allowed a change in the conditions precedent to the use of force by police officers when making an arrest under the International War Crimes Tribunal Act. Other amendments to be made by the government include enabling the DNA of an unknown deceased person to be matched with another DNA profile of an unknown deceased person. This will help police work. 
In Western Australia, the state Labor government has made sweeping changes to the way DNA is used in crime fighting. The Premier, Dr Gallop, and the police minister, Michelle Roberts, developed legislation that allows the formation of a DNA bank which is used as a tool in unsolved crime. So far this initiative has been a success and has resulted in arrests for crimes that have remained unsolved. The solving of these crimes brings peace and surety to a lot of families and allows them to have closure on matters that have had tragic impacts on their lives. DNA is a vital tool in law enforcement and the changes in this bill, although minor in nature, ensure that law enforcement is able to face the challenges of this new century. The changes also allow participating jurisdictions to share DNA information. Labor believes that it is important to ensure that privacy safeguards are in place—that is, that there is adequate legislation. 
Item 2 of the bill clarifies that a judge or magistrate is empowered to make any order reasonably necessary to ensure that fingerprints and photographic evidence are obtained from a convicted person. It brings in an enforcement mechanism which carries a penalty of 12 months imprisonment for noncompliance. In the past, people accused of an offence could decline to take part in an identification parade. The provisions contained in section 3ZM allow evidence of a person's refusal to submit to an identity parade to be admissible for the purpose of explaining why no parade was held. This change has been made to remove the implication that a negative inference as to the suspect's guilt may be drawn from the evidence of a refusal to take part in the parade. It also allows other identification evidence, based on photographs or another sighting of the suspect, as admissible. Again, these changes will bring some peace and security to the community, who often believe that it is somehow wrong when people refuse to give evidence in court cases. But the changes also protect the rights of an individual to pursue a reasonable defence of themself in these court cases. So it is a balanced change, and a change that is positive. The Attorney-General should be proud of it. 
Currently, indictable offences involving property have a threshold of $500. This has been increased to $5,000. This is a positive move, as it expands the jurisdiction of lower courts in relation to Commonwealth offences. This will mean that lower courts can deal with indictable offences, freeing up the higher courts for more serious cases. That is again a very practical and sensible move. The summary of indictable offences is also changed in the new section 4JA. These changes will mean that the criminal trial process will become more efficient. Although the change will take away a jury in these cases, it certainly will clear up the court system. It is a response to changes already made by a number of Australian states. 
How will this make the courts more efficient? It is designed to provide an incentive for defendants to waive their right to a jury trial by reducing the severity of a penalty that can be imposed by a magistrate. Given community attitudes towards crime and the constant call for tougher penalties, how are these changes a good thing? The people of Stirling asked me to bring their voices into this place. They want a bill which is not soft on law and order, but they also want a bill that is fair and just. In the types of cases covered by this bill, the offences which will be affected may be characterised as less serious crimes and do not involve terms of imprisonment. These crimes are not crimes against people. Measuring the changes to caseloads in both the lower courts and the higher courts, which this legislation attempts to clear, will need to be done to gauge its effectiveness. Lower courts could find themselves in a situation where their caseloads increase and, without extra resources, they would develop waiting lists—something that nobody wants.  
Law enforcement is something I have taken very seriously during my time as the member for Stirling. One of the nightspots in my electorate, Scarborough Beach, was previously a trouble spot for residents, particularly on weekends. There would be a lot of fighting, drug and drinking offences, stolen goods offences—a whole raft of antisocial behaviour that was of concern not only to the residents but to the many tourists who come to beautiful Scarborough Beach. Through a collaborative strategy, the police, the City of Stirling, the member for Innaloo John Quigley, the Scarborough Beach Residents Association, the Scarborough and District Progress Association, the local drug action committee and my office put together a new patrol regime with an increased police presence in the area. As a result we have seen that Scarborough Beach is a now a far safer nightspot for young people to enjoy. As well, the beachfront is much safer for residents, tourists and casual visitors. Law enforcement begins on this basic level of caring for people in risky areas. When we have this sort of crime control right, it makes legislation of this nature far easier. 
Some minor changes will be introduced by the government to address concerns expressed by the member for Banks. These include amendments to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 which will allow information to be passed on to the Australian Crime Commission. These changes recognise the cessation of the National Crime Authority. 
Given community attitudes towards corporate crime and the recent findings of the HIH royal commission and other high profile corporate collapses, these measures will give the public some confidence that we as law-makers will target white-collar crime. Criminal charges are expected to be laid from the HIH royal commission, and I think it is vital that perpetrators of corporate crime are seen to be punished. Too often in the past, high profile and rich defendants were able to get off charges such as fraud. This was mostly due to the fact that they were able to afford high-priced lawyers to avoid justice. The government needs to be told that tougher corporate governance is required. There is no doubt that corporate Australia is unable to govern itself, and we should not have to rely on expensive royal commissions to get to the bottom of corporate fraud. If law enforcement agencies are to clean up the bad eggs in our corporate world that give the majority of honest businesspeople a bad name, these agencies need support.
On this issue of ethics and corporate governance, it is a dilemma as to how you pass on good values to young people when they are growing up. They have responsibilities when they go into a job and work their way through the career path up to the higher levels. They have responsibilities at multiple levels: to their shareholders, to the staff under them and to the community. I grapple at times with how you can build these values and ethics into people. I am not saying you do it in the school system; I think it comes from family. Like our Parliamentary Education Program, I very much believe that, at some time, we need to grapple with how we introduce these values into people's lives—particularly if they come from families who do not have a notion of values—as a preventative measure to stop future corporate crime. I commend the government on the amendments, which I support.",REPS,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION ENHANCEMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2003-05-14,"—I would like to thank the member for Banks and the member for Stirling for their contributions to this debate. I thank the opposition for supporting the Crimes Legislation Enhancement Bill 2003. The member for Banks knows that the Minister for Justice and Customs and I are always receptive to constructive suggestions to improve legislation that we are promoting, and I think the example in this case is typical. I do not propose to respond to the more general issues raised by the member for Stirling. The events at Scarborough Beach are of interest. The Liberal Party in Western Australia usually holds its state convention at Observation City, which overlooks Scarborough Beach, so the law and order situation there is of some interest. I do not share the member for Stirling's fairly dismal view of the state of corporate governance in Australia. I think we have some bad examples, but I do not think that they are as general as her comments might have suggested. 
The Crimes Legislation Enhancement Bill 2003 will enhance a range of Commonwealth criminal justice related legislation. The measures in the bill will clarify the application of existing provisions and streamline certain criminal procedures. I commend the bill to the House.
