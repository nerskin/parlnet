"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-03-10,"—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by 22 June 2005:
any Australian involvement in, or knowledge of, the practice known as rendition (the transfer of people for interrogation in countries which allow torture);
any Australian involvement in, or knowledge of, the practice of torture overseas; and
any related matters.
I want to underline how strongly the Greens feel about this motion. The motion we are dealing with is about the Greens’ wish to refer to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee the horrific spectre of torture being used by democratic Western countries, like the United States, Britain and now Australia. The motion is to have a Senate inquiry into Australian knowledge of and involvement in the US Bush administration’s policy of rendition and, consequent upon that, the use of torture. This policy of rendition is, in effect, contracting out torture to second or third countries. A fleet of CIA planes has been used to ferry people who have been effectively kidnapped in second countries, including nations like our own—Sweden for one—to third nations where torture is known to take place and where the object of the transfer of prisoners is to have them tortured.
The Bush White House has made a deliberate decision that torture is to be used to extract information in the age of terrorism. This is contrary to the whole ethos of the US democratic system and indeed our parallel democratic system in Australia, which has abhorred torture and has worked assiduously to bring into place international conventions against the use of torture. What we have here is an insidious backdoor approval of torture by the US President and the US administration without there being laws consequent upon full debate by the US congress. The question I put to this parliament and the Senate is: are we going to allow ourselves to become part of that pattern of behaviour, which, besides undermining the ethos of this nation, undermines the democratic process?
Attorney-General Ruddock has said that Australia will not condone torture in any circumstance, yet there is prima facie evidence from Mr Habib, an Australian citizen who was held and tortured in Egypt, that the Australian authorities not only knew that he was in Egypt and being tortured in Egypt but supplied information to the torturers in the form of a phone list from his mobile phone, which ostensibly came from a search of his house under warrant in his absence. I do not know the rights or wrongs of Mr Habib’s situation. That is not what is germane here. Australian citizens without exception are innocent until proven guilty, and Australian citizens—and indeed anybody under the system of Australian law and order—must be protected from torture without exception.
I find it extraordinary, to say the least, that we have a situation where the government does not support this move for the Senate to investigate this critical matter. I am told that the opposition will not support it either. They can argue for themselves, but let me say this: I have not moved for an inquiry that is more important than this one. We are not a vassal of any other country. We are an independent nation, proud of our democracy and our freedoms and the lead this country has taken in extending to the rest of the world, as far as we can, the democratic principles that everybody is equal under the law and nobody shall be subject to torture. What we are seeing at the moment is a reversion of that, a roll-back, without proper debate in the parliaments involved. That is a derogation of democracy itself.
I do not know what the argument of the opposition or the government can be in saying, ‘We will not allow this to be investigated.’ We know the facts. Neither the government nor the opposition will dispute the reality that prisoners are being, at the behest of the CIA, taken from second countries to third countries where torture is not only permitted but part of the police state apparatus—countries like Egypt and Uzbekistan—countries where horrific torture, unconscionable within our own borders and indeed within the United States, is practiced. Here we have governments subverting the rule of their own countries, breaking their own law, breaking their own ethos if they become involved in such practices, in such odious throwbacks to barbaric former times.
The Howard government has a case to answer here, and we will not get answers unless we inquire. I believe that the Senate has a duty to make that inquiry. I cannot believe that the Labor Party is welshing on its duty to ensure that this inquiry takes place. One must assume that there is a misguided belief that we must not upset the United States of America. I have a belief that there is a difference between the Bush administration and the history and traditions of the United States of America. I believe it is absolutely essential—not just proper but essential—that we separate from the Bush administration when it not only condones but delivers people to torture and expends taxpayers’ money in taking part in the process of torturing individuals to extract information.
If it must be that torture is now to become part of the processes of the United States and ipso facto at least part of the debate of where we are going to in this great country of Australia, let us debate it. As the Sydney Morning Herald editorial said, let us decide where the limits are to be set now that the boundaries are moving. Let us not be cowardly about this and say, ‘Let’s not talk about it; let’s just keep it going covertly,’ as if it is not happening—which has always been part of the extraordinarily immoral power play of the torturer. If torture is going to be entertained and this CIA rendition approved of by President Bush himself is going to be ticked off by the Howard government, let this parliament debate it. Let every member of parliament say how far they will go in permitting torture, and under what circumstances and on which innocent people they will allow it to be used.
Let us have a debate about the merits of the use of torture in a world in which terrorism is a scourge, because there are compelling arguments that it is counterproductive. For example, no court will convict somebody on evidence that has been extracted through torture. For example, information extracted under torture is notoriously unreliable. For example, with people who are arrested and tortured in secret, the secrecy itself can be counterproductive—as has been surmised in the case of S11, where an operative was arrested and kept covertly; but, had that arrest been made public, the people involved in that horrific act of terrorism might have called it off.
Let these matters be debated in democratic fora. Let us not leave it to ASIO or, indeed, the bureaucracy anywhere or ministers in consultation with their US, British or other counterparts to determine these matters. If we are to be a functioning democracy, it must be debated in our parliament—and, if it is going to be debated in our parliament, it has to be debated on all the information that is available. How do we get that? We get that through an inquiry. There is and has been a failure of courage here by both the government and the opposition. There is something to hide here. A vote against this motion is a vote for hiding information—for secrecy, for denying public exposure. It is a vote which injuries democracy itself.
If this government is to entertain a role in the US government’s policy of rendition, or if this opposition is to say, ‘We do not want to trespass into the odious practice of rendition, which has been ticked off by the Bush administration,’ let them get up and say so. But let us not hide from discovering the facts, because that is cowardice, which has no place in a proper democratic forum like this.
I believe that this parliament is on trial here and the big parties have to think again about this. I ask the baseline question: what harm can be done by inquiring into the fact that an Australian citizen, Mr Habib, was arrested in Pakistan; that the Australian authorities knew about it and met him there; that he was transferred to Egypt and tortured; that it is his evidence that information used in that torture process in the torture chamber in Egypt came from his home in Sydney; and that we know the USA, via the CIA, transfers prisoners to places of torture in Egypt, Uzbekistan and elsewhere?
Are the government and opposition too weak to have this matter brought into the public arena? I put this question: if there has been no wrong here, no complicity by Australia with this policy of rendition, why should we not have this inquiry? Why should the government oppose it? Why should the opposition oppose it? There is a stench in the air. There is always a stench in the air when torture is involved, and it will not be cleared by the government or opposition saying, ‘We will not have this matter canvassed by our parliament.’ It is an extraordinary matter that this motion will not succeed.
The Greens will not accede to the matter being over and done with today. We will do all we can to get to the facts of this matter. What are we defending here? Let me put this very clearly: we are defending Australian democracy and Australia’s time-honoured abhorrence of torture. We will not have a bar of it. The price of keeping the scourge of torture from our democratic forms, our thinking and our ethos in this country is vigilance against it where it occurs. This motion is for such vigilance. I can scarcely believe that it is not going to succeed, but let the opposition and government defend their point of view.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,9,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-03-10,"—Let me say this at the outset: Labor have listened to Senator Brown in respect of this matter, and we agree in terms of the substantive matters that he has put forward. We do not agree with torture. We have been at the forefront of ensuring that UN conventions against torture have been adhered to. We have supported in this parliament those issues which go to ensuring that the scourge of torture is removed from this world, and we have pressed this government on international matters—
—Well, support this.
—You have had your turn, Senator Brown. We have pressed this government to ensure they support United Nations conventions across the board—not only those on torture but those on a whole raft of international humanitarian initiatives—to ensure that these sorts of things are not done or dealt with. However, we do not have before us a motion to debate the substantive issue, as you might think. What we have is a motion that is going to send a reference off to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. That is what we have before us. Senator Brown, if you want to debate the substantive matters in relation to torture or rendition, you have—and you know very well that you have—the ability to be able to do that in a range of—

Senator Brown interjecting—

—You have had your say, Senator Brown; it is my turn now. You have the ability to raise these matters in the parliament in a number of quarters and in a number of ways. In fact, I had the ability to sit at estimates and ask the Australian Federal Police and ASIO a range of questions dealing with a raft of issues that go to this area and others that we have an interest in. I know that you were not there, Senator Brown. You might have been on more important work—I am not sure. However, estimates is one opportunity that you have to progress these matters, to question the department and to question the bureaucrats in relation to this matter.
I know that Senator Nettle did take up that opportunity. Senator Nettle, representing the Greens, did take the opportunity to participate in estimates, and some of those matters have now been put forward. As I understand it, Senator Nettle asked questions, which were put on notice, that went to what the government’s policy and practice on rendition is, whether the government has ever assisted the US government with rendering persons from Australia to another country, whether the government has ever assisted the US government with rendering persons from a country other than Australia to another country, whether the practice of rendition is legal in Australia and so on. There has been an opportunity for the Greens to progress this matter in estimates. That is a right we all have, and I do not cavil at that. What we have not heard is a response from the department about that because, as you know, Senator Brown, with the estimates process they have until 9 April to provide answers on notice in respect of those issues. So, to date, unless Senator Nettle can inform me otherwise, we have not heard a response on this matter, and therefore we do not know whether the answers to these questions will inform us about ways we can progress this matter.
We do know that when you want to give a matter to a references committee you ask, ‘Is this the appropriate forum for this matter to be pursued?’ As Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, what I do in terms of references is look at the detail. Senator Brown, you know the process in this place. If people want references pursued in this place there is the Selection of Bills Committee and there are forums where you can discuss with various leaders whether a reference is the type of reference that can be sent to a legal and constitutional committee. We know that the usual processes regarding that sort of reference take place before we come into this chamber and move a motion which sends it off to a references committee such as legal and constitutional. You have to ask yourself a couple of questions, Senator Brown. Is it the case that you want the forum here to ventilate the issue, or do you want a substantive look at the issue? If you send it to the references committee, one of the problems you will be confronted with is whether it will actually determine or be able to get to the facts that you have alluded to today, or whether it would be more appropriate to send it to a different committee, such as the ASIO committee.
—Do you know?
—I do not know the answer to that because you obviously have not canvassed it with anyone. But with the Legal and Constitutional References Committee what you would end up with, Senator Brown, is perhaps calling the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. At least from an estimates point of view, because of the nature of the classified subject matter you then have to ask: ‘Is the inquiry process in a Senate references committee an appropriate vehicle to progress the matter? Would any relevant official be in a position to provide a cogent argument or evidence to outline what you say could potentially be going on?’
I am not convinced that that would progress the debate any further. The difficulty that Labor and I have is that we cannot see clearly that you would be able to progress the issue past the point of making the statements that you have made today, other than calling one witness perhaps to give his version of events, which would then be uncontested in that sense. A Senate references committee is not a forum in which to try to come to a conclusion. What we can do is throw some light into the corner and ventilate the issues; debate does not occur there. As you know, Senator Brown, you can use a number of mechanisms to initiate a debate on this matter in the Senate. On numerous occasions you have pursued those options. I am sure that you know how to bring that forward. In this instance it is not an appropriate mechanism, in Labor’s view, to put this issue to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I do not think that that would provide the result that you are looking for. Those are the substantive reasons why Labor will not be supporting the motion. We do not think that the issues that surround it will in any event be well ventilated in that process.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,9,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-10,"—by leave—I move:
At the end of paragraph (a), insert “, after September 2001”.
At the end of paragraph (b), insert “, after September 2001”.
Senators may not feel that it is necessary, but the amendment specifies that the motion relates to any potential activity or Australian involvement after September 2001. That seems as good a cut-off date as any, purely because allegations could potentially be made about Australian involvement in various practices overseas stretching back to the Boer War. It is simply to clarify that the focus is on recent developments.
It is important to clarify the substantive motion before the chamber. We have a motion to refer a matter to a Senate committee to examine and report back to the Senate by the end of June. The matter that the Senate committee is being asked to examine is Australian involvement in or knowledge of the practice of sending people for interrogation to countries which allow torture, such as Egypt, and any potential Australian involvement in torture in overseas countries. I should say at the outset that the Democrats will support the motion. We think it is a fundamentally important matter, and certainly it is crucial to ensure that as much light as possible is shed on it.
It is not my job to defend the ALP—I hope that they remember that I am about to do it—but I understand the views that Senate Ludwig has raised. Whether or not this is the best process to get the maximum result on these matters of very serious public concern is something on which there can be different valid opinions. Whilst Senate committees are very powerful and very important, it should not be suggested that they are all-powerful and can get any information we would like. As we all know—Senator Ludwig and I probably know this more than many others because of some of the migration committees we have been involved in—a lot of the time you cannot get the information you want, even from government departments, let alone when it involves issues that undoubtedly would be portrayed as involving national security. That is a big barrier to getting adequate information on some important matters.
It may well be that committees like the ASIO, ASIS and DSD committee may be more effective in that regard. Having said that, there are counterarguments. Firstly, there is no crossbench representation on that committee, which I believe should be altered. Secondly, a lot of the time you have that catch-22—you can get some of this confidential information but only if you do not tell anybody about it—which is not of much use if what you are told is seriously concerning. You actually become complicit in, and in some respects an accomplice to, knowledge of a practice that you do not support but that you can do nothing about. They are difficult questions.
It is not helpful—if I can provide some gratuitous advice to Senator Brown—to imply that anybody who does not agree with a particular process is therefore soft on the issue, does not care about the issue and is welshing on it. I mention as an aside that one of my staff who has a Welsh background objects to the word ‘welshing’. I do not know whether that is where it comes from but they always make the point to me, so I thought I would pass it on.
As people would know—and I would hope that the media that run with stories like this one would also know—a lot of work has already been done in estimates committees, including by Labor. It is easier for them to do it because they have got more people, but nonetheless they have done a lot of work. Senator Nettle has also done some work in asking questions about this. Some information has been provided, more questions have been asked and more information will come forward, I trust. I suspect it will not answer the questions fully, particularly the answers from this government, because the other shortcoming that we face in the Senate is—and we have seen this repeatedly—that even when answers are forthcoming they tend to be incomplete, misleading and, some of the time, simply wrong. We certainly saw that with, for example, the ‘children overboard’ committee and in answers about this whole area of activity to do with what is happening in Iraq.
We have seen that time after time—the weasel words and the deliberate distortion of the facts by the careful choosing of words to misrepresent things. It has happened time and time again, and that makes life more difficult for us as well. That is why it often takes a long period of time—not just overnight—to ask the questions, test the information, go back and test it against something else and come back at the next hearing and pursue it further.
Whether or not a references committee with a reporting date in three months time would be able to do that is open for debate. I think those issues are relevant. I would also point to the example of Senator Allison, who, earlier this week, was successful in establishing a select committee on mental health. That is something that took a few weeks and a fair bit of negotiation with a range of senators in this chamber. At the end of it, we were able to get support not just from the opposition but from the government for an inquiry into what is a very important issue. This issue is equally important, I believe, although very different.
Here is a bit more gratuitous advice: if you genuinely want to get support for an inquiry, it helps to negotiate with people in advance rather than to create a situation where the first time they hear about it is when they receive calls from the media saying, ‘Do you support the motion for an inquiry?’ which is then moved the next day. Apparently, there were erroneous reports on the ABC about the ALP’s position, given that they are not supporting it, I gather, and they were reported as saying they would. Those sorts of things do not help in trying to get constructive cooperation, and neither does insinuating that people who do not support the specific process therefore do not care about the issue.
Having said that, I should remind people that the Democrats are supporting this motion. I think it is sufficiently important and, given some of the other circumstances around at the moment, appropriate to have a focused, honed examination of this particular aspect. Part of what influences my view on this matter is what I referred to before—the performance of this government in areas like the debate about interrogation et cetera. Senator Evans from the Labor Party successfully moved for an inquiry into that matter earlier this week. Again, in that case, he consulted the other parties and ended up moving the motion to set up that inquiry jointly with Senator Allison and Senator Brown. That is an example of cross-party support.
In that example, we saw extraordinary dissembling and ridiculous word play from the government and the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, about whether we had interviews or interrogation. The people who were actually there on the ground were saying, ‘I was involved in interrogation,’ and the minister was saying, ‘No, they were interviews.’ I know who I would go with, and that is the person who was actually there and can say what occurred—the people who are sufficiently experienced and capable that our government and our defence forces chose to put them in these positions. They are obviously people of high capability. As soon as they come out and say something that embarrasses the government, they get dismissed. There are insinuations that somehow or other they have hidden agendas, they are not capable or there is some other problem with them. You get insinuations and character attacks on the people involved.
That is one area that the Senate has chosen to examine further, because there are clearly a lot of question marks there. I think this is another area that the Senate should choose to examine further. In fact, whilst there are some differences, there is an argument for merging the two inquiries or issues. There is also an argument to the contrary, I might say, but I think it could at least be considered, because there are overlaps. Paragraph (b) of the terms of reference refers to ‘any Australian involvement in, or knowledge of, the practice of torture overseas’. Interrogations do not necessarily involve torture except in their more extreme form, but there is obviously a continuum there about what Australia knew and, indeed, what Australian involvement, if any, there was in some of these clearly unacceptable practices. These practices clearly breached international law—which, as Senator Ludwig rightly pointed out, the Australian government has until recent times been quite strongly promoting. So there is some overlap there.
Whilst the Democrats are supporting this motion, it appears it will not be passed. I suggest that that should not be the end of it. We should continue to explore ways in which these matters can be examined as effectively as possible. I think that can and should still be done. The matter is not whether people support this practice, because clearly we do not. The opposition does not and, one would hope, the government does not. The question is how we most effectively investigate it, so I think this approach suggested here would be useful and would bear fruit.
Obviously, this has some links with Mr Habib in particular. Mamdouh Habib presents some very vexed issues for people involved in public debate. The Democrats, particularly my colleague Senator Greig, have spoken out strongly over a long period of time about our concerns about the way Mr Habib and Mr Hicks in particular have been treated. Of course, when you do that, you are portrayed by the government as supporting people who are allegedly terrorists or involved with terrorists. Often it is at that time when it is most important to defend people’s rights. When people are unpopular and may have done heinous acts, that is when you should be particularly strong on defending people’s rights. It is easy to defend the rights of people who are popular. You have to defend the rights of all people equally because, when you are defending the rights of people such as Mamdouh Habib, you are defending the rights of all Australians. It is a simple fact that circumstances can always conspire in various unanticipated ways, where somebody’s rights can be at risk. Those rights need to be defended and, if they are not defended when it is more difficult, then there is a much greater risk that people in the community whose rights are being breached will also suffer when they should not have to.
Given the ongoing statements being made through the media by a range of people, including Mr Habib himself, I think it would be useful for him to have an opportunity to present before a Senate committee and have some of his claims tested. I am not sure whether that would end up being a positive or a negative for him, but that is not the issue for me. The issue for me is to try and get the facts out in the open and ensure that due process is followed from all perspectives. Clearly, the situation of Mr Habib is presenting ongoing difficulties for some people in the Islamic community who are torn between wanting to defend this person’s rights and being concerned about how public perceptions of their wider community are perhaps being distorted at the same time. So something that can get this matter more fully out in the open and more comprehensively tested across the board could be much more widely beneficial than just for the sake of Mr Habib. It could also be more beneficial to get the facts about what the Australian government or their agencies have or have not been involved in or what knowledge they do or do not have. I think it is sufficiently serious that it needs proper examination.
Another factor that has to be put into the mix is that, as we all know, the Senate composition will change at the end of June. The government will have the numbers and inquiries such as this will become more difficult to set up. That does not mean that we should be setting up a whole range of ill thought out inquiries just so that we have them all in place. Inquiries can continue, certainly until at least August, if they are set up before the end of June. I suggest that it would be at the government’s peril if they sought to close down any inquiries that had already been established. I think it would be highly unwise of them to do that, even though they would technically have the power to do so once the Senate reconvened in August.
In other circumstances there would be an argument for doing this in a more measured, drawn out way. The estimates process has already been mentioned. That is a less exciting process that does not get headline stories as regularly and does not get splashes on morning radio as often, but it is often more thorough. It is often drawn out over a range of different hearings—often over years—to get to the truth of matters. There are questions and answers, and then questions often follow on from the answers given. It can take a long time. Media interest tends to move on, but the substance of the matters is as important as ever, and taking that time often produces better results.
I assume that estimates committees will still operate after the government gets control of the Senate. One would certainly suggest that it would be highly inappropriate for those committees to be closed down or curtailed in any way. So that process would still be open. Most of the people who would provide information to an inquiry such as this would be the people who also appear before Senate estimates committees. There would not be too many people who would have knowledge of these matters, other than the government agencies themselves who appear before estimates. The key difference between the estimates process and this inquiry is that the inquiry will allow others to put in submissions or to appear before the committee—whether they are well-known people, such as Mr Habib, who have already made allegations or other citizens who may have information that they wish to provide to the committee and the committee may wish to test at a public hearing. That is the key difference between this inquiry and the estimates process. That is one reason why, on balance, this approach should be supported.
I suggest to all senators—in particular, the opposition and even the government—that this is a matter that should continue to exercise people’s minds, even if it does not succeed today. It is an incredibly serious issue. We are continuing to see more ways of getting around long-established, accepted standards of how people should be treated, in time of war and outside of it. I do not accept that just because the phrase ‘war on terror’ is used it means we are at war. Again, I think that is false word play that should be resisted. But it does not dispute the fact that we do have a serious challenge in the face of terrorism and it presents tests of those long-established standards of how we should behave.
As the UK courts quite wisely decided towards the end of last year, in many ways it is at that time that you need to most strongly defend the freedoms, standards, rights and traditions that our societies and democracy have been built on. Democracy was not established overnight, despite what the government might occasionally suggest has happened in Iraq. Democracy evolved literally over centuries. Those freedoms evolved with it, and you do not want to water them down or toss them out at the first sign of a threat. That is at risk of happening here. That is why this is such an important and fundamental matter and why it should be examined. In that sense, I very strongly support and endorse the very passionate comments of Senator Brown, as we support this motion.
Given that the motion is not likely to succeed today, I think we—and, I would hope, even the government—need to look at ways to engage more cooperatively. It is in all of our interests in the long term to ensure that these sorts of practices do not develop and that not only we are not involved in them but also we strongly work against them in the international community as well as in community debate in Australia.
 (Senator Sandy Macdonald)—The question is that the amendments moved by Senator Bartlett be agreed to.
Question negatived.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-03-10,"—I will close the debate in the absence of a government contribution. That itself is an indictment of the government. The government is too gutless to come in here and defend the indefensible position of the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the cabinet in effectively taking part in an illegal international process which the Bush administration has taken on.
Let me make this absolutely clear: for an Australian government or minister, including Attorney-General Ruddock, to in any way be part of a process which leads to the torture of an Australian citizen is unlawful and a breach of international law as well as, if it occurred in this country, domestic law. Let me repeat that: for any minister, be it the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General, to be complicit either actively or by default in allowing a process which leads to the torture of an Australian citizen, or anybody else for that matter, where Australian intervention could have stopped it is a breach of Australian law. That is a very serious charge. It is one of the reasons why this Senate inquiry should be proceeding. I am not satisfied with Attorney-General Ruddock saying that torture under no circumstances is permissible as far as he is concerned, any more than I am satisfied with President Bush saying the same thing and then being part of a process which not only allows torture to occur covertly but also expends taxpayers’ money in facilitating and deliberately leading to the torture of people who are taken from second countries.
There is a prima facie case here that the Australian government supports the Bush administration’s policy of rendition. Have we heard Prime Minister Howard say that he opposes it? I challenge him to stand by Australian law and say that we will have no role or part in, give no support to and absolutely oppose the US administration’s use of rendition—that is, the torture of prisoners. Will we hear Prime Minister Howard state unequivocally that he upholds Australian law and will not have part in, condone and turn his back on a process by the US or anybody else that leads to the torture of prisoners? Is Attorney-General Ruddock going to make it explicit that not only he does not condone torture in any form but also he is actively working to ensure that it does not happen, and that he opposes the US policy of rendition and will not have a bar of it? No, there is silence from our government. That must result in a shudder running down the spine of everyone who believes in our democracy. SBS Dateline last night reported:
Up until a year ago, John Radsan was legal counsel for the CIA. One of his tasks was to build a legal framework around the administration’s tough new anti-terror policy. He raises the possibility that if Habib was tortured in Egypt, then Australia may also bear responsibility for what happened.
JOHN RADSAN: If my assumptions are true—and I think they are—that Australia is a part of the convention against torture, that they have similar prohibitions against torture in Australian law, and if the Australians were involved in Mamdouh Habib’s transfer, if they had control, if they had jurisdiction over him, or if they shared jurisdiction with American authorities, then I think they’re drawn into the responsibility.
He goes on to say:
The other possibility is they’ve kept a distance and they’ve been apprised that the Americans are going to transfer that person to Egypt. That may have different implications, different legal implications, but I think from an Australians perspective you would ask, ‘Shouldn’t my Government be doing more to protect me? I’m an Australian citizen—and not to allow me to go to a country that people have a fair reason to believe, tortures people.’ But that’s a political question less a legal question.
I put the political question to this chamber: should we not have a high priority—because undoubtedly we have a responsibility—to uncover all we can about this process of governments elsewhere, if not here, breaking international and domestic law? Should we not be concerned if the Bush administration breaks its own laws—specifically if, in 1998, Congress passed a law that the US could not be involved in torture within the US or anywhere else? The CIA and the Bush administration are law breakers. Are we to turn our backs if the Howard government drifts down that line?
The only way we can ensure that this parliament, which is the supreme power in the Commonwealth of Australia, remains the watchdog over government that it should be is to get the information that is required. There is only one way to get that information, and that is through a Senate inquiry. The opposition and the Democrats may say, ‘Perhaps this isn’t the best way to do it.’ Where is their alternative? That is the test, and they have no alternative. The opposition today has failed its responsibility as an opposition in this parliament because, above all, its job is to know what the government is up to. These are not just any claims; these are serious claims which question this government upholding the law. The opposition says, ‘We don’t want an inquiry into that; leastways not this way and we have no alternative.’ This Labor opposition is weak. It is failing in its duty. It is not taking on this government when it should. It is the political decision that the opposition has made, and it leaves the Greens to do its job for it. We may not have the vote, but I can tell you that we are doing the right thing here.
It is a shameful day, with the opposition welshing on its responsibility in this place in the way it is about to. It is a shameful process. The Greens made it clear that we would give the opposition more time to consider the matter—this is too serious for that not to happen—but it did not need more time. One suspects that it just wants to get it off the plate; the same as Attorney-General Ruddock wants to get it off the plate; the same, no doubt, as Prime Minister Howard wants to get it off the plate. It will come back to haunt us. You cannot turn your back on torture, having signed international conventions and led the international debate against torture, wherever it might occur, and expect no ramifications.
Let me put this clearly again: if we are going to entertain torture anywhere in the world, then let us debate it and let us set the ground rules. Let us not be cowardly about it. Let the opposition and the government come up with their proposals as to when torture is justified. I challenge them to do it. And, Madam Acting Deputy President, do you know what? They will not. They know the abhorrence with which torture is held and they know there is no defining line once you say yes to torture. You have crossed the barrier into what US commentators have called the ‘dark side’. Vice President Cheney said that we must cross to the dark side. Well, Mr Cheney, not me, not the Greens—and, I submit, nor should this parliament, nor the Australian government, cross to the dark side. Certainly if you are going to go there, take a torch with you and let the people of the country see what you are up to. The worst thing to do here is to turn your back on it and say, ‘We’ll leave it to these covert, illegal operations—this breaking of the law by governments,’ including, extraordinarily, the US administration. If we condone them doing it, we are effectively doing it ourselves.
This ought to have been a critical inquiry. This is a critical debate. The government could not even get to its feet and stand for its untenable position, because this government has no leg to stand on here. So it has gone into a silence which echoes with trouble, which is a warning to us all that there is no debating this issue, there is no defence of torture. The government cannot defend it, and it should be on its feet now, stating explicitly that it stands by international conventions and Australian law in this matter. There is no bending or twisting of it. There is no new interpretation. There are no exceptions. That is what the government should be saying, but it is not. It is the wink, wink, nod, nod terrible usurpation of the values of this nation, that the US administration has entertained and taken on board and the Australian government itself is now entertaining. It is cowardly for the government not to be standing on this issue. It is cowardly not to be answering the claims that are arising in the public debate. Thank God, we do have the fourth estate here; thank God we do have the media; thank God we do have programs like SBS’s Dateline to alert us to the matters that this Senate apparently does not want to hear aired in the form of this committee.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Brown’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-03-10,"—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by 22 June 2005:
any Australian involvement in, or knowledge of, the practice known as rendition (the transfer of people for interrogation in countries which allow torture);
any Australian involvement in, or knowledge of, the practice of torture overseas; and
any related matters.
I want to underline how strongly the Greens feel about this motion. The motion we are dealing with is about the Greens’ wish to refer to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee the horrific spectre of torture being used by democratic Western countries, like the United States, Britain and now Australia. The motion is to have a Senate inquiry into Australian knowledge of and involvement in the US Bush administration’s policy of rendition and, consequent upon that, the use of torture. This policy of rendition is, in effect, contracting out torture to second or third countries. A fleet of CIA planes has been used to ferry people who have been effectively kidnapped in second countries, including nations like our own—Sweden for one—to third nations where torture is known to take place and where the object of the transfer of prisoners is to have them tortured.
The Bush White House has made a deliberate decision that torture is to be used to extract information in the age of terrorism. This is contrary to the whole ethos of the US democratic system and indeed our parallel democratic system in Australia, which has abhorred torture and has worked assiduously to bring into place international conventions against the use of torture. What we have here is an insidious backdoor approval of torture by the US President and the US administration without there being laws consequent upon full debate by the US congress. The question I put to this parliament and the Senate is: are we going to allow ourselves to become part of that pattern of behaviour, which, besides undermining the ethos of this nation, undermines the democratic process?
Attorney-General Ruddock has said that Australia will not condone torture in any circumstance, yet there is prima facie evidence from Mr Habib, an Australian citizen who was held and tortured in Egypt, that the Australian authorities not only knew that he was in Egypt and being tortured in Egypt but supplied information to the torturers in the form of a phone list from his mobile phone, which ostensibly came from a search of his house under warrant in his absence. I do not know the rights or wrongs of Mr Habib’s situation. That is not what is germane here. Australian citizens without exception are innocent until proven guilty, and Australian citizens—and indeed anybody under the system of Australian law and order—must be protected from torture without exception.
I find it extraordinary, to say the least, that we have a situation where the government does not support this move for the Senate to investigate this critical matter. I am told that the opposition will not support it either. They can argue for themselves, but let me say this: I have not moved for an inquiry that is more important than this one. We are not a vassal of any other country. We are an independent nation, proud of our democracy and our freedoms and the lead this country has taken in extending to the rest of the world, as far as we can, the democratic principles that everybody is equal under the law and nobody shall be subject to torture. What we are seeing at the moment is a reversion of that, a roll-back, without proper debate in the parliaments involved. That is a derogation of democracy itself.
I do not know what the argument of the opposition or the government can be in saying, ‘We will not allow this to be investigated.’ We know the facts. Neither the government nor the opposition will dispute the reality that prisoners are being, at the behest of the CIA, taken from second countries to third countries where torture is not only permitted but part of the police state apparatus—countries like Egypt and Uzbekistan—countries where horrific torture, unconscionable within our own borders and indeed within the United States, is practiced. Here we have governments subverting the rule of their own countries, breaking their own law, breaking their own ethos if they become involved in such practices, in such odious throwbacks to barbaric former times.
The Howard government has a case to answer here, and we will not get answers unless we inquire. I believe that the Senate has a duty to make that inquiry. I cannot believe that the Labor Party is welshing on its duty to ensure that this inquiry takes place. One must assume that there is a misguided belief that we must not upset the United States of America. I have a belief that there is a difference between the Bush administration and the history and traditions of the United States of America. I believe it is absolutely essential—not just proper but essential—that we separate from the Bush administration when it not only condones but delivers people to torture and expends taxpayers’ money in taking part in the process of torturing individuals to extract information.
If it must be that torture is now to become part of the processes of the United States and ipso facto at least part of the debate of where we are going to in this great country of Australia, let us debate it. As the Sydney Morning Herald editorial said, let us decide where the limits are to be set now that the boundaries are moving. Let us not be cowardly about this and say, ‘Let’s not talk about it; let’s just keep it going covertly,’ as if it is not happening—which has always been part of the extraordinarily immoral power play of the torturer. If torture is going to be entertained and this CIA rendition approved of by President Bush himself is going to be ticked off by the Howard government, let this parliament debate it. Let every member of parliament say how far they will go in permitting torture, and under what circumstances and on which innocent people they will allow it to be used.
Let us have a debate about the merits of the use of torture in a world in which terrorism is a scourge, because there are compelling arguments that it is counterproductive. For example, no court will convict somebody on evidence that has been extracted through torture. For example, information extracted under torture is notoriously unreliable. For example, with people who are arrested and tortured in secret, the secrecy itself can be counterproductive—as has been surmised in the case of S11, where an operative was arrested and kept covertly; but, had that arrest been made public, the people involved in that horrific act of terrorism might have called it off.
Let these matters be debated in democratic fora. Let us not leave it to ASIO or, indeed, the bureaucracy anywhere or ministers in consultation with their US, British or other counterparts to determine these matters. If we are to be a functioning democracy, it must be debated in our parliament—and, if it is going to be debated in our parliament, it has to be debated on all the information that is available. How do we get that? We get that through an inquiry. There is and has been a failure of courage here by both the government and the opposition. There is something to hide here. A vote against this motion is a vote for hiding information—for secrecy, for denying public exposure. It is a vote which injuries democracy itself.
If this government is to entertain a role in the US government’s policy of rendition, or if this opposition is to say, ‘We do not want to trespass into the odious practice of rendition, which has been ticked off by the Bush administration,’ let them get up and say so. But let us not hide from discovering the facts, because that is cowardice, which has no place in a proper democratic forum like this.
I believe that this parliament is on trial here and the big parties have to think again about this. I ask the baseline question: what harm can be done by inquiring into the fact that an Australian citizen, Mr Habib, was arrested in Pakistan; that the Australian authorities knew about it and met him there; that he was transferred to Egypt and tortured; that it is his evidence that information used in that torture process in the torture chamber in Egypt came from his home in Sydney; and that we know the USA, via the CIA, transfers prisoners to places of torture in Egypt, Uzbekistan and elsewhere?
Are the government and opposition too weak to have this matter brought into the public arena? I put this question: if there has been no wrong here, no complicity by Australia with this policy of rendition, why should we not have this inquiry? Why should the government oppose it? Why should the opposition oppose it? There is a stench in the air. There is always a stench in the air when torture is involved, and it will not be cleared by the government or opposition saying, ‘We will not have this matter canvassed by our parliament.’ It is an extraordinary matter that this motion will not succeed.
The Greens will not accede to the matter being over and done with today. We will do all we can to get to the facts of this matter. What are we defending here? Let me put this very clearly: we are defending Australian democracy and Australia’s time-honoured abhorrence of torture. We will not have a bar of it. The price of keeping the scourge of torture from our democratic forms, our thinking and our ethos in this country is vigilance against it where it occurs. This motion is for such vigilance. I can scarcely believe that it is not going to succeed, but let the opposition and government defend their point of view.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,9,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-03-10,"—Let me say this at the outset: Labor have listened to Senator Brown in respect of this matter, and we agree in terms of the substantive matters that he has put forward. We do not agree with torture. We have been at the forefront of ensuring that UN conventions against torture have been adhered to. We have supported in this parliament those issues which go to ensuring that the scourge of torture is removed from this world, and we have pressed this government on international matters—
—Well, support this.
—You have had your turn, Senator Brown. We have pressed this government to ensure they support United Nations conventions across the board—not only those on torture but those on a whole raft of international humanitarian initiatives—to ensure that these sorts of things are not done or dealt with. However, we do not have before us a motion to debate the substantive issue, as you might think. What we have is a motion that is going to send a reference off to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. That is what we have before us. Senator Brown, if you want to debate the substantive matters in relation to torture or rendition, you have—and you know very well that you have—the ability to be able to do that in a range of—

Senator Brown interjecting—

—You have had your say, Senator Brown; it is my turn now. You have the ability to raise these matters in the parliament in a number of quarters and in a number of ways. In fact, I had the ability to sit at estimates and ask the Australian Federal Police and ASIO a range of questions dealing with a raft of issues that go to this area and others that we have an interest in. I know that you were not there, Senator Brown. You might have been on more important work—I am not sure. However, estimates is one opportunity that you have to progress these matters, to question the department and to question the bureaucrats in relation to this matter.
I know that Senator Nettle did take up that opportunity. Senator Nettle, representing the Greens, did take the opportunity to participate in estimates, and some of those matters have now been put forward. As I understand it, Senator Nettle asked questions, which were put on notice, that went to what the government’s policy and practice on rendition is, whether the government has ever assisted the US government with rendering persons from Australia to another country, whether the government has ever assisted the US government with rendering persons from a country other than Australia to another country, whether the practice of rendition is legal in Australia and so on. There has been an opportunity for the Greens to progress this matter in estimates. That is a right we all have, and I do not cavil at that. What we have not heard is a response from the department about that because, as you know, Senator Brown, with the estimates process they have until 9 April to provide answers on notice in respect of those issues. So, to date, unless Senator Nettle can inform me otherwise, we have not heard a response on this matter, and therefore we do not know whether the answers to these questions will inform us about ways we can progress this matter.
We do know that when you want to give a matter to a references committee you ask, ‘Is this the appropriate forum for this matter to be pursued?’ As Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, what I do in terms of references is look at the detail. Senator Brown, you know the process in this place. If people want references pursued in this place there is the Selection of Bills Committee and there are forums where you can discuss with various leaders whether a reference is the type of reference that can be sent to a legal and constitutional committee. We know that the usual processes regarding that sort of reference take place before we come into this chamber and move a motion which sends it off to a references committee such as legal and constitutional. You have to ask yourself a couple of questions, Senator Brown. Is it the case that you want the forum here to ventilate the issue, or do you want a substantive look at the issue? If you send it to the references committee, one of the problems you will be confronted with is whether it will actually determine or be able to get to the facts that you have alluded to today, or whether it would be more appropriate to send it to a different committee, such as the ASIO committee.
—Do you know?
—I do not know the answer to that because you obviously have not canvassed it with anyone. But with the Legal and Constitutional References Committee what you would end up with, Senator Brown, is perhaps calling the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. At least from an estimates point of view, because of the nature of the classified subject matter you then have to ask: ‘Is the inquiry process in a Senate references committee an appropriate vehicle to progress the matter? Would any relevant official be in a position to provide a cogent argument or evidence to outline what you say could potentially be going on?’
I am not convinced that that would progress the debate any further. The difficulty that Labor and I have is that we cannot see clearly that you would be able to progress the issue past the point of making the statements that you have made today, other than calling one witness perhaps to give his version of events, which would then be uncontested in that sense. A Senate references committee is not a forum in which to try to come to a conclusion. What we can do is throw some light into the corner and ventilate the issues; debate does not occur there. As you know, Senator Brown, you can use a number of mechanisms to initiate a debate on this matter in the Senate. On numerous occasions you have pursued those options. I am sure that you know how to bring that forward. In this instance it is not an appropriate mechanism, in Labor’s view, to put this issue to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I do not think that that would provide the result that you are looking for. Those are the substantive reasons why Labor will not be supporting the motion. We do not think that the issues that surround it will in any event be well ventilated in that process.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,9,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-10,"—by leave—I move:
At the end of paragraph (a), insert “, after September 2001”.
At the end of paragraph (b), insert “, after September 2001”.
Senators may not feel that it is necessary, but the amendment specifies that the motion relates to any potential activity or Australian involvement after September 2001. That seems as good a cut-off date as any, purely because allegations could potentially be made about Australian involvement in various practices overseas stretching back to the Boer War. It is simply to clarify that the focus is on recent developments.
It is important to clarify the substantive motion before the chamber. We have a motion to refer a matter to a Senate committee to examine and report back to the Senate by the end of June. The matter that the Senate committee is being asked to examine is Australian involvement in or knowledge of the practice of sending people for interrogation to countries which allow torture, such as Egypt, and any potential Australian involvement in torture in overseas countries. I should say at the outset that the Democrats will support the motion. We think it is a fundamentally important matter, and certainly it is crucial to ensure that as much light as possible is shed on it.
It is not my job to defend the ALP—I hope that they remember that I am about to do it—but I understand the views that Senate Ludwig has raised. Whether or not this is the best process to get the maximum result on these matters of very serious public concern is something on which there can be different valid opinions. Whilst Senate committees are very powerful and very important, it should not be suggested that they are all-powerful and can get any information we would like. As we all know—Senator Ludwig and I probably know this more than many others because of some of the migration committees we have been involved in—a lot of the time you cannot get the information you want, even from government departments, let alone when it involves issues that undoubtedly would be portrayed as involving national security. That is a big barrier to getting adequate information on some important matters.
It may well be that committees like the ASIO, ASIS and DSD committee may be more effective in that regard. Having said that, there are counterarguments. Firstly, there is no crossbench representation on that committee, which I believe should be altered. Secondly, a lot of the time you have that catch-22—you can get some of this confidential information but only if you do not tell anybody about it—which is not of much use if what you are told is seriously concerning. You actually become complicit in, and in some respects an accomplice to, knowledge of a practice that you do not support but that you can do nothing about. They are difficult questions.
It is not helpful—if I can provide some gratuitous advice to Senator Brown—to imply that anybody who does not agree with a particular process is therefore soft on the issue, does not care about the issue and is welshing on it. I mention as an aside that one of my staff who has a Welsh background objects to the word ‘welshing’. I do not know whether that is where it comes from but they always make the point to me, so I thought I would pass it on.
As people would know—and I would hope that the media that run with stories like this one would also know—a lot of work has already been done in estimates committees, including by Labor. It is easier for them to do it because they have got more people, but nonetheless they have done a lot of work. Senator Nettle has also done some work in asking questions about this. Some information has been provided, more questions have been asked and more information will come forward, I trust. I suspect it will not answer the questions fully, particularly the answers from this government, because the other shortcoming that we face in the Senate is—and we have seen this repeatedly—that even when answers are forthcoming they tend to be incomplete, misleading and, some of the time, simply wrong. We certainly saw that with, for example, the ‘children overboard’ committee and in answers about this whole area of activity to do with what is happening in Iraq.
We have seen that time after time—the weasel words and the deliberate distortion of the facts by the careful choosing of words to misrepresent things. It has happened time and time again, and that makes life more difficult for us as well. That is why it often takes a long period of time—not just overnight—to ask the questions, test the information, go back and test it against something else and come back at the next hearing and pursue it further.
Whether or not a references committee with a reporting date in three months time would be able to do that is open for debate. I think those issues are relevant. I would also point to the example of Senator Allison, who, earlier this week, was successful in establishing a select committee on mental health. That is something that took a few weeks and a fair bit of negotiation with a range of senators in this chamber. At the end of it, we were able to get support not just from the opposition but from the government for an inquiry into what is a very important issue. This issue is equally important, I believe, although very different.
Here is a bit more gratuitous advice: if you genuinely want to get support for an inquiry, it helps to negotiate with people in advance rather than to create a situation where the first time they hear about it is when they receive calls from the media saying, ‘Do you support the motion for an inquiry?’ which is then moved the next day. Apparently, there were erroneous reports on the ABC about the ALP’s position, given that they are not supporting it, I gather, and they were reported as saying they would. Those sorts of things do not help in trying to get constructive cooperation, and neither does insinuating that people who do not support the specific process therefore do not care about the issue.
Having said that, I should remind people that the Democrats are supporting this motion. I think it is sufficiently important and, given some of the other circumstances around at the moment, appropriate to have a focused, honed examination of this particular aspect. Part of what influences my view on this matter is what I referred to before—the performance of this government in areas like the debate about interrogation et cetera. Senator Evans from the Labor Party successfully moved for an inquiry into that matter earlier this week. Again, in that case, he consulted the other parties and ended up moving the motion to set up that inquiry jointly with Senator Allison and Senator Brown. That is an example of cross-party support.
In that example, we saw extraordinary dissembling and ridiculous word play from the government and the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, about whether we had interviews or interrogation. The people who were actually there on the ground were saying, ‘I was involved in interrogation,’ and the minister was saying, ‘No, they were interviews.’ I know who I would go with, and that is the person who was actually there and can say what occurred—the people who are sufficiently experienced and capable that our government and our defence forces chose to put them in these positions. They are obviously people of high capability. As soon as they come out and say something that embarrasses the government, they get dismissed. There are insinuations that somehow or other they have hidden agendas, they are not capable or there is some other problem with them. You get insinuations and character attacks on the people involved.
That is one area that the Senate has chosen to examine further, because there are clearly a lot of question marks there. I think this is another area that the Senate should choose to examine further. In fact, whilst there are some differences, there is an argument for merging the two inquiries or issues. There is also an argument to the contrary, I might say, but I think it could at least be considered, because there are overlaps. Paragraph (b) of the terms of reference refers to ‘any Australian involvement in, or knowledge of, the practice of torture overseas’. Interrogations do not necessarily involve torture except in their more extreme form, but there is obviously a continuum there about what Australia knew and, indeed, what Australian involvement, if any, there was in some of these clearly unacceptable practices. These practices clearly breached international law—which, as Senator Ludwig rightly pointed out, the Australian government has until recent times been quite strongly promoting. So there is some overlap there.
Whilst the Democrats are supporting this motion, it appears it will not be passed. I suggest that that should not be the end of it. We should continue to explore ways in which these matters can be examined as effectively as possible. I think that can and should still be done. The matter is not whether people support this practice, because clearly we do not. The opposition does not and, one would hope, the government does not. The question is how we most effectively investigate it, so I think this approach suggested here would be useful and would bear fruit.
Obviously, this has some links with Mr Habib in particular. Mamdouh Habib presents some very vexed issues for people involved in public debate. The Democrats, particularly my colleague Senator Greig, have spoken out strongly over a long period of time about our concerns about the way Mr Habib and Mr Hicks in particular have been treated. Of course, when you do that, you are portrayed by the government as supporting people who are allegedly terrorists or involved with terrorists. Often it is at that time when it is most important to defend people’s rights. When people are unpopular and may have done heinous acts, that is when you should be particularly strong on defending people’s rights. It is easy to defend the rights of people who are popular. You have to defend the rights of all people equally because, when you are defending the rights of people such as Mamdouh Habib, you are defending the rights of all Australians. It is a simple fact that circumstances can always conspire in various unanticipated ways, where somebody’s rights can be at risk. Those rights need to be defended and, if they are not defended when it is more difficult, then there is a much greater risk that people in the community whose rights are being breached will also suffer when they should not have to.
Given the ongoing statements being made through the media by a range of people, including Mr Habib himself, I think it would be useful for him to have an opportunity to present before a Senate committee and have some of his claims tested. I am not sure whether that would end up being a positive or a negative for him, but that is not the issue for me. The issue for me is to try and get the facts out in the open and ensure that due process is followed from all perspectives. Clearly, the situation of Mr Habib is presenting ongoing difficulties for some people in the Islamic community who are torn between wanting to defend this person’s rights and being concerned about how public perceptions of their wider community are perhaps being distorted at the same time. So something that can get this matter more fully out in the open and more comprehensively tested across the board could be much more widely beneficial than just for the sake of Mr Habib. It could also be more beneficial to get the facts about what the Australian government or their agencies have or have not been involved in or what knowledge they do or do not have. I think it is sufficiently serious that it needs proper examination.
Another factor that has to be put into the mix is that, as we all know, the Senate composition will change at the end of June. The government will have the numbers and inquiries such as this will become more difficult to set up. That does not mean that we should be setting up a whole range of ill thought out inquiries just so that we have them all in place. Inquiries can continue, certainly until at least August, if they are set up before the end of June. I suggest that it would be at the government’s peril if they sought to close down any inquiries that had already been established. I think it would be highly unwise of them to do that, even though they would technically have the power to do so once the Senate reconvened in August.
In other circumstances there would be an argument for doing this in a more measured, drawn out way. The estimates process has already been mentioned. That is a less exciting process that does not get headline stories as regularly and does not get splashes on morning radio as often, but it is often more thorough. It is often drawn out over a range of different hearings—often over years—to get to the truth of matters. There are questions and answers, and then questions often follow on from the answers given. It can take a long time. Media interest tends to move on, but the substance of the matters is as important as ever, and taking that time often produces better results.
I assume that estimates committees will still operate after the government gets control of the Senate. One would certainly suggest that it would be highly inappropriate for those committees to be closed down or curtailed in any way. So that process would still be open. Most of the people who would provide information to an inquiry such as this would be the people who also appear before Senate estimates committees. There would not be too many people who would have knowledge of these matters, other than the government agencies themselves who appear before estimates. The key difference between the estimates process and this inquiry is that the inquiry will allow others to put in submissions or to appear before the committee—whether they are well-known people, such as Mr Habib, who have already made allegations or other citizens who may have information that they wish to provide to the committee and the committee may wish to test at a public hearing. That is the key difference between this inquiry and the estimates process. That is one reason why, on balance, this approach should be supported.
I suggest to all senators—in particular, the opposition and even the government—that this is a matter that should continue to exercise people’s minds, even if it does not succeed today. It is an incredibly serious issue. We are continuing to see more ways of getting around long-established, accepted standards of how people should be treated, in time of war and outside of it. I do not accept that just because the phrase ‘war on terror’ is used it means we are at war. Again, I think that is false word play that should be resisted. But it does not dispute the fact that we do have a serious challenge in the face of terrorism and it presents tests of those long-established standards of how we should behave.
As the UK courts quite wisely decided towards the end of last year, in many ways it is at that time that you need to most strongly defend the freedoms, standards, rights and traditions that our societies and democracy have been built on. Democracy was not established overnight, despite what the government might occasionally suggest has happened in Iraq. Democracy evolved literally over centuries. Those freedoms evolved with it, and you do not want to water them down or toss them out at the first sign of a threat. That is at risk of happening here. That is why this is such an important and fundamental matter and why it should be examined. In that sense, I very strongly support and endorse the very passionate comments of Senator Brown, as we support this motion.
Given that the motion is not likely to succeed today, I think we—and, I would hope, even the government—need to look at ways to engage more cooperatively. It is in all of our interests in the long term to ensure that these sorts of practices do not develop and that not only we are not involved in them but also we strongly work against them in the international community as well as in community debate in Australia.
 (Senator Sandy Macdonald)—The question is that the amendments moved by Senator Bartlett be agreed to.
Question negatived.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,9,2
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-03-10,"—I will close the debate in the absence of a government contribution. That itself is an indictment of the government. The government is too gutless to come in here and defend the indefensible position of the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the cabinet in effectively taking part in an illegal international process which the Bush administration has taken on.
Let me make this absolutely clear: for an Australian government or minister, including Attorney-General Ruddock, to in any way be part of a process which leads to the torture of an Australian citizen is unlawful and a breach of international law as well as, if it occurred in this country, domestic law. Let me repeat that: for any minister, be it the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General, to be complicit either actively or by default in allowing a process which leads to the torture of an Australian citizen, or anybody else for that matter, where Australian intervention could have stopped it is a breach of Australian law. That is a very serious charge. It is one of the reasons why this Senate inquiry should be proceeding. I am not satisfied with Attorney-General Ruddock saying that torture under no circumstances is permissible as far as he is concerned, any more than I am satisfied with President Bush saying the same thing and then being part of a process which not only allows torture to occur covertly but also expends taxpayers’ money in facilitating and deliberately leading to the torture of people who are taken from second countries.
There is a prima facie case here that the Australian government supports the Bush administration’s policy of rendition. Have we heard Prime Minister Howard say that he opposes it? I challenge him to stand by Australian law and say that we will have no role or part in, give no support to and absolutely oppose the US administration’s use of rendition—that is, the torture of prisoners. Will we hear Prime Minister Howard state unequivocally that he upholds Australian law and will not have part in, condone and turn his back on a process by the US or anybody else that leads to the torture of prisoners? Is Attorney-General Ruddock going to make it explicit that not only he does not condone torture in any form but also he is actively working to ensure that it does not happen, and that he opposes the US policy of rendition and will not have a bar of it? No, there is silence from our government. That must result in a shudder running down the spine of everyone who believes in our democracy. SBS Dateline last night reported:
Up until a year ago, John Radsan was legal counsel for the CIA. One of his tasks was to build a legal framework around the administration’s tough new anti-terror policy. He raises the possibility that if Habib was tortured in Egypt, then Australia may also bear responsibility for what happened.
JOHN RADSAN: If my assumptions are true—and I think they are—that Australia is a part of the convention against torture, that they have similar prohibitions against torture in Australian law, and if the Australians were involved in Mamdouh Habib’s transfer, if they had control, if they had jurisdiction over him, or if they shared jurisdiction with American authorities, then I think they’re drawn into the responsibility.
He goes on to say:
The other possibility is they’ve kept a distance and they’ve been apprised that the Americans are going to transfer that person to Egypt. That may have different implications, different legal implications, but I think from an Australians perspective you would ask, ‘Shouldn’t my Government be doing more to protect me? I’m an Australian citizen—and not to allow me to go to a country that people have a fair reason to believe, tortures people.’ But that’s a political question less a legal question.
I put the political question to this chamber: should we not have a high priority—because undoubtedly we have a responsibility—to uncover all we can about this process of governments elsewhere, if not here, breaking international and domestic law? Should we not be concerned if the Bush administration breaks its own laws—specifically if, in 1998, Congress passed a law that the US could not be involved in torture within the US or anywhere else? The CIA and the Bush administration are law breakers. Are we to turn our backs if the Howard government drifts down that line?
The only way we can ensure that this parliament, which is the supreme power in the Commonwealth of Australia, remains the watchdog over government that it should be is to get the information that is required. There is only one way to get that information, and that is through a Senate inquiry. The opposition and the Democrats may say, ‘Perhaps this isn’t the best way to do it.’ Where is their alternative? That is the test, and they have no alternative. The opposition today has failed its responsibility as an opposition in this parliament because, above all, its job is to know what the government is up to. These are not just any claims; these are serious claims which question this government upholding the law. The opposition says, ‘We don’t want an inquiry into that; leastways not this way and we have no alternative.’ This Labor opposition is weak. It is failing in its duty. It is not taking on this government when it should. It is the political decision that the opposition has made, and it leaves the Greens to do its job for it. We may not have the vote, but I can tell you that we are doing the right thing here.
It is a shameful day, with the opposition welshing on its responsibility in this place in the way it is about to. It is a shameful process. The Greens made it clear that we would give the opposition more time to consider the matter—this is too serious for that not to happen—but it did not need more time. One suspects that it just wants to get it off the plate; the same as Attorney-General Ruddock wants to get it off the plate; the same, no doubt, as Prime Minister Howard wants to get it off the plate. It will come back to haunt us. You cannot turn your back on torture, having signed international conventions and led the international debate against torture, wherever it might occur, and expect no ramifications.
Let me put this clearly again: if we are going to entertain torture anywhere in the world, then let us debate it and let us set the ground rules. Let us not be cowardly about it. Let the opposition and the government come up with their proposals as to when torture is justified. I challenge them to do it. And, Madam Acting Deputy President, do you know what? They will not. They know the abhorrence with which torture is held and they know there is no defining line once you say yes to torture. You have crossed the barrier into what US commentators have called the ‘dark side’. Vice President Cheney said that we must cross to the dark side. Well, Mr Cheney, not me, not the Greens—and, I submit, nor should this parliament, nor the Australian government, cross to the dark side. Certainly if you are going to go there, take a torch with you and let the people of the country see what you are up to. The worst thing to do here is to turn your back on it and say, ‘We’ll leave it to these covert, illegal operations—this breaking of the law by governments,’ including, extraordinarily, the US administration. If we condone them doing it, we are effectively doing it ourselves.
This ought to have been a critical inquiry. This is a critical debate. The government could not even get to its feet and stand for its untenable position, because this government has no leg to stand on here. So it has gone into a silence which echoes with trouble, which is a warning to us all that there is no debating this issue, there is no defence of torture. The government cannot defend it, and it should be on its feet now, stating explicitly that it stands by international conventions and Australian law in this matter. There is no bending or twisting of it. There is no new interpretation. There are no exceptions. That is what the government should be saying, but it is not. It is the wink, wink, nod, nod terrible usurpation of the values of this nation, that the US administration has entertained and taken on board and the Australian government itself is now entertaining. It is cowardly for the government not to be standing on this issue. It is cowardly not to be answering the claims that are arising in the public debate. Thank God, we do have the fourth estate here; thank God we do have the media; thank God we do have programs like SBS’s Dateline to alert us to the matters that this Senate apparently does not want to hear aired in the form of this committee.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Brown’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,9,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-03-10,"—It appears I am Senator Conroy today. I have not only moved his motions—
—I would not put that on the record.
—No, but I think I have. I can say I do not have the sartorial elegance of Senator Conroy, nor do I look like him. But, although I make light of it at the beginning, there is a serious debate in relation to this matter. Unfortunately other matters cropped up that Senator Conroy had to attend to. In this instance I think it is worth while to at least go back to the start, because the debate has been truncated—we left the debate yesterday. I have been following it. It is an issue that I have an interest in. In relation to broadcasting, one of my roles includes justice, customs, citizenship and multicultural affairs. The ethnic broadcaster is a terrific organisation and has been ensuring that broadcasting is out in the community and in touch.
This debate—and this was mentioned by Senator Conroy in the debate on the second reading—is about the antisiphoning regime. The intention of the antisiphoning regime is to limit the likelihood that events that have traditionally been shown on free-to-air television will migrate exclusively to pay TV. What we have said is that Labor believe that the ability of third parties, such as channel providers, to acquire events before the free-to-air networks have the opportunity to undermines the effectiveness of the regime.
We have moved amendments to try to—and I think they do—ensure that the antisiphoning regime captures related parties to pay TV licensees such as channel providers. Of course, related parties to a licensee will not be able to acquire the rights to listed events in circumstances where a licensee could not. To achieve this objective, the amendment draws on the concept of control, which is used elsewhere in the Broadcasting Act. In general terms, to achieve this object item (2) provides that a related party of licensee is defined as a person who is in a position to control the licensee or, alternatively, a person who is controlled by the licensee. These amendments address the loophole in the antisiphoning regime which, contrary to the original intent of the parliament, means that the free-to-air sector is not getting the first crack at acquiring the rights to listed events. On behalf of the Labor Party, I commend to the Senate the amendment at item (2).
It is also worth saying that this government should pick up the amendments. They have the ability to ensure that there is a proper and appropriate antisiphoning regime and that there are not loopholes that people will try to exploit that are not in the interests of the watchers, the consumers, of these products. Sometimes it is only through the course of events that you find these ways of getting around the legislation coming up. We have a unique opportunity to ensure that is now put to bed—that the government pick up on these amendments and ensure that they are adopted and that the antisiphoning regime is tough but reasonable.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,10,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2005-03-10,"—The Democrats will be supporting the two Labor amendments on sheet 4531 to close the loophole in respect of the antisiphoning list. In some ways it is an on-balance issue. We acknowledge that the pay TV industry does not believe there is a loophole—that there is no problem to be dealt with in this area—but in some ways, having looked at the evidence and through the committee Hansards, particularly at the treatment of the Ashes issue, we have come to the view that there is a loophole in this area and that it does need to be closed. I am disappointed that the government continues to refer to this particular loophole as the ‘so-called loophole’, because, when you deal with a situation where the antisiphoning list applies to Foxtel but not to channel holders such as Fox Sports, it certainly makes it very difficult in a commercial sense to achieve the commercial outcome sought of the antisiphoning list, which is that the free-to-air providers get a reasonable go at picking up items that are listed on the antisiphoning list before they are available to pay TV. There is a lot of commercial interest in this area. The pay TV providers dispute the fundamental question that is constantly raised by free-to-air providers: if you put sport on free-to-air television you need exclusive rights as opposed to shared rights. That debate has been going on for as long as there has been an antisiphoning list in this country.
However, what is fundamental is that the antisiphoning list is a decision of this parliament. It is a decision of this parliament that we will provide the opportunity for all Australians to see key sporting events on free-to-air television. If that is the intention of this parliament—if that is the starting point for this parliament—then we have to make sure the list works effectively. The list will not work effectively in a commercial sense while we allow this loophole, which allows related parties of licence holders to buy rights in a way that is not quite picked up by the antisiphoning regime. It is a loophole worth looking at. I commend these amendments to the government. They are important. I notice they do not go quite as far as the free-to-air lobby would have liked, and that is appropriate. We are simply dealing specifically with the issue at hand, rather than seeking to provide an excessive benefit to one side in the commercial debate rather than the other. I acknowledge that these issues are matters of commercial negotiation, but I believe we have to come back to the fundamental point: for what reason do we have an antisiphoning list? If we have an antisiphoning list, let us make sure it operates effectively. These amendments help to achieve that.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,10,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-03-10,"—The Senate has got a raw deal today. We did not hear from Senator Conroy and instead we got Senator Ludwig; and, on this side, we will not be hearing from Senator Coonan but from me. So the Senate is unfortunate in that regard. But I am sure that Senator Ludwig and I will muddle through nevertheless.
It would come as no surprise to the opposition and the Democrats that the government opposes these amendments. The government does not support the amendments relating to what is referred to by some as the loophole in the antisiphoning regime. In the government’s view, it is not clear that the intention and operation of the antisiphoning scheme are being circumvented under current arrangements. As the government has said on previous occasions, this is an issue it is prepared to look at but there is no evidence to suggest that the antisiphoning rules are being infringed.
The current licence condition imposed on pay TV licensees prevents a pay TV licensee acquiring rights from an associated company before they have first been acquired by a free-to-air broadcaster or the event has been delisted. If a free-to-air broadcaster considers that it has not had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the rights to a listed event, it can still apply to the minister for the event to be retained on the list and not be subject to automatic delisting, thereby preventing exclusive pay TV broadcast of the event. In addition, the government is not convinced that a compelling case has been made by free-to-air networks in relation to the necessity for access to exclusive rights to listed events. The acquisition of free-to-air rights to the 2005 Ashes cricket series by SBS and the Seven Network demonstrates that the scheme continues to work effectively to protect the free-to-air coverage of key events that Australians have traditionally enjoyed on free-to-air television.
The government are committed to the antisiphoning regime that currently operates. Any significant changes to the way this complex regime works need to be undertaken carefully and in consultation with all relevant stakeholders. As I have said, we will continue to monitor the operation of the antisiphoning list to ensure it properly reflects the attitudes of Australians and the commercial realities of the sporting and broadcasting sectors. This bill is the completion of the commitment the government made at the time we published the revised antisiphoning list in April 2004. Along with the announcement of the revised list, we committed to extending the delisting period, and that is the purpose of this bill.
There are also compelling legal grounds which justify the rejection of these amendments. The amendments seek to address two issues: the capacity for pay television licensees to acquire free-to-air rights to listed events and the acquisition of rights to listed events by companies associated with pay television licensees. However, the amendments are poorly drafted and give rise to a number of serious concerns.
The proposed clause 10(1C) is very broad in scope. It would make pay television licensees responsible for the business decisions of their owners or controllers or other entities owned or controlled by those owners or controllers. Licensees clearly should not, as a matter of fairness, be held responsible for the actions of persons they are not in a position to control. There is some case law to suggest in fact that this provision would not even be enforceable for that reason. This amendment is so unclear it is not at all beyond the possibility that, for example, Foxtel could be put in breach of its licence if a company within the Nine Network acquires the free-to-air rights to an event but does not have arrangements for those rights to immediately flow to the Nine Network companies that hold their commercial television licences.
The purpose of proposed clause 10(1)(eaa) is not clear. It is unclear that this adds anything to proposed clause 10(1C). Clause 10(1)(eaa) provides that if a subscription television licensee broadcasts a listed event that has been acquired in breach of clause 10(1)(e)(i) then the licensee is in breach of the licence condition. However, the initial acquisition by a licensee or an associate puts the licensee in breach of the licence condition in clause 10(1)(e) because of clause 10(1C). There is therefore no need to make it an additional licence condition that the licensee must not broadcast an event that it has acquired in breach of a licence condition. For drafting reasons alone, these amendments should be rejected.
I turn to the impact on the regulator. The provision in proposed paragraph (1C) of the amendment relies on the notion of a person being ‘in a position to exercise control’ of a company. It borrows this phrase from the ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act, part 5 and schedule 1. The concept of being ‘in a position to exercise control’ is a complex one. For the ABA to determine whether a particular person is in a position to exercise control over the licensee under paragraph 10(1C)(a) of the proposed amendment—or another person, presumably another company, under paragraph 10(1C)(d)—would require the Australian Broadcasting Authority to undertake a detailed investigation.
Given the short period of time that may be involved between acquisition of rights and the actual event, relying on the ABA to make a detailed investigation into the control of companies is problematic. The ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act were specifically designed to deal with the control of broadcasting licences. This amendment takes those provisions and employs them for a significantly different purpose—tracing the relationships between what is potentially a very large network of relationships between companies both within and outside the media sector, including for example every entity in the News group, PBL group, Telstra group and SingTel group. For the range of reasons I have outlined, this amendment is opposed by the government.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-03-10,"—I have a couple of issues I want to raise with the minister. Minister Abetz, I appreciate that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts is not here, but I am sure that you are reliably assisted by the advisers. In the report into the bill, government members of the Senate communications committee recommended that ministers should consider examining the so-called loophole in the antisiphoning regime and whether this may circumvent the scheme. Is the government going to examine this issue in any greater detail than it has already, and will it take that recommendation on board? I can go on to another couple of questions, to give the advisers time. What is the minister’s position on the matter? What advice have the ABA given on this matter? If they have given advice, and I understand they have in relation to this part, will the minister make that advice public, particularly given that it would assist all parties to understand this area? Minister, I have a couple of other points but perhaps you could provide a view about what I have asked about so far.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,10,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-03-10,"—I think I am able to sound knowledgeable in relation to the matters raised thus far by Senator Ludwig, and I respond as follows. In relation to the second recommendation, that the government examine the issue of the so-called loophole, the government has previously considered this issue in response to a request from Free TV Australia. The antisiphoning license condition imposed on pay TV licensees does not prevent an associated company that is not a subscription television broadcasting licence holder, such as a pay TV channel provider, acquiring free-to-air and/or subscription rights to listed events. I must be doing badly—I have just noticed the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts coming in to assist! However, if a pay TV licensee then acquires those rights from that associated company before they have first been acquired by a free-to-air broadcaster or the event has been delisted then that pay TV licensee is in breach of its licence conditions. The committee rejected the argument that the antisiphoning provisions were intended to provide free-to-air broadcasters with exclusive access to the broadcasting rights of listed events. Don’t you go anywhere, Minister!
I am aware that the committee considered the issue raised by Free TV Australia of whether a pay TV licensee acquires the rights to listed events from a pay TV content provider when it broadcasts that event in the absence of any formal transfer of rights. Advice obtained by the government indicates that a licensee effectively obtains the rights to events by broadcasting them even in the absence of the formal transfer of rights. As a consequence, the critical safeguard of the scheme remains in place. If a free-to-air broadcaster considers that it has not had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the rights to a listed event, it can still apply to the minister for the event to be retained on the list and be not subject to automatic delisting, thereby preventing an exclusive pay TV broadcast of the event. Nevertheless, the government agrees with the committee’s second recommendation and will continue to monitor the scheme for any evidence that rights holders are seeking to circumvent the intent of the antisiphoning scheme in the manner suggested to the committee. Can I say that the questions are now getting easy, and I feel comfortable in handing over to Senator Coonan.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,10,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-03-10,"—The nub of that answer seems to be that you are going to monitor this. It seems that the ABA are going to monitor it. Particularly, will you be able to provide the published view that the ABA have about it now? If they are going to monitor it, will you continue to provide the ABA’s findings and outcomes of that monitoring process? That is the only way you are going to ensure transparency in the system. You say there is no loophole and we say there is a loophole, and I think that during the committee stage and the legislation committee’s examination we have been able to demonstrate that there potentially is a loophole. There certainly seems to be evidence of one. If you say there is not and we say that there may be, then put a transparent process in place.

Indeed, I just caught the end of Senator Ludwig’s question. But, as I understand it—and I will be corrected if I am wrong—there has not been a formal report of the ABA since 2001.
—That’s the point, Minister.
—Yes, there has not been one, but we will give consideration to how we think it should best be monitored. I am not going to be giving commitments here, but I will acknowledge that there can be some advantages to making the process perhaps more public and more transparent. It is difficult, but we take on board the issues relating to the operation of the scheme. We have said that obviously we will keep a very close eye on it. Just how formal you really want to make it is obviously a matter for debate. For the purposes of today, I would say and put on record that we will be keeping a very close eye on it.

Bill, as amended, agreed to.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-03-10,"—As the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs and reconciliation, I am today delivering the opposition’s speech on the second reading debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 [2005]. This bill abolishes ATSIC. The opposition agrees with the government that there needs to be a major revamp of the form of national representation of Australia’s Indigenous people—but that is where we part company with the government. We fundamentally disagree with the government’s approach to implementing its new arrangements. However, we acknowledge that the abolition of ATSIC is an administrative fait accompli.
Labor has a firm policy in support of the principle of a national Indigenous representative body. The government’s new National Indigenous Council is not chosen by Indigenous people and does not represent them in any meaningful way. It has lacked legitimacy from the start, and the secretive way in which it operates has served only to confirm the worst in terms of its role.
In December 1992, in launching the 1993 Year of the World’s Indigenous People, former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating gave a speech. It is one of the great speeches given by an Australian Prime Minister about Indigenous affairs. Of the newly established ATSIC, he said:
ATSIC emerges from the vision of indigenous self-determination and self-management.
                  …         …           …
All over Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are taking charge of their own lives.
So they were. But that is no longer to be. In failing to replace ATSIC with another representative body—a body funded by the government to do its job—this government has chosen to close its eyes to the vision of Indigenous self-determination and self-management. Indeed, the government’s approach through this bill, with the abolition of ATSIC and its regional councils, not only winds back the clock in terms of Indigenous representation but also removes the requirement for consultation with Indigenous people across a range of important areas. For example, under this bill there will no longer be a requirement for the minister to consult with Indigenous people before appointing new directors of either Indigenous Business Australia or the Indigenous Land Corporation. It speaks volumes about the government’s so-called partnership model that it does not even acknowledge the rights of Indigenous people to be consulted on issues of fundamental importance to their wellbeing; it speaks volumes about the government’s view of Indigenous participation in the economic development of communities and the implementation of measures to address poverty and social exclusion.
Australia’s Indigenous people have been dispossessed. They have been massacred, they have been insulted and they have been made to suffer by the actions of non-Indigenous Australians. Their needs and their rights have been monumentally ignored. Quoting again from the speech of Paul Keating:
... it might help us if we non-Aboriginal Australians imagined ourselves dispossessed of land we have lived on for 50 000 years—and then imagined ourselves told that it had never been ours.
Imagine if ours was the oldest culture in the world and we were told that it was worthless. Imagine if we had resisted this settlement, suffered and died in the defence of our land, and then were told in history books that we had given up without a fight ... Imagine if our spiritual life was denied and ridiculed.
Imagine if we had suffered the injustice and then were blamed for it.
This is still happening to Indigenous Australians today. Yet the pride, the resilience and the grace of Indigenous people, alluded to by Paul Keating, has been borne out to me and it is absolutely astounding.
As the recently appointed shadow minister for Indigenous affairs and reconciliation, I have had the pleasure and honour of meeting hundreds of Indigenous Australians. Most of them are the leaders of various Indigenous communities, and the colossal change that has occurred in Indigenous society and the damage it has done over recent years has been reflected in their stories to me. However, they also pointed out to me that over the 15 years since the establishment of ATSIC there has been an emergence and empowerment of many remarkable people. Some of the leaders I have met have commented to me that it was partly the agenda championed by the then Labor government—the reconciliation agenda and the establishment of ATSIC and representative structures—that provided them with the opportunity to develop their leadership skills.
The early nineties have been described as a time of hope for Indigenous people, both because of the Hawke and Keating governments’ commitment to Indigenous empowerment and self-determination and because that commitment was able to grow and articulate itself through the actions of Indigenous peoples themselves. The self-determination that ATSIC provided a framework for has played a significant role in building a critical mass of confident, proud Indigenous leaders who walk tall in Australian society, who command respect from us all and who ought to command respect from us all. In the policy of Indigenous affairs, they have led not only their own people but the rest of us. They have been generous with their time, knowledge and wisdom, and I believe that all Australians should be able to learn from them.
The Howard government’s approach to Indigenous policy has been described by its own apologists as being assimilationist. It has been about providing services to Indigenous peoples and communities on exactly the same basis as mainstream services for other Australians. It says it is an approach essentially designed to iron out the difference. The opposition approach—for the conservative commentators can only see two extremes—has been characterised as a separatist model, and those people who recognise that Indigenous cultures have a legitimate value and who accept the relationship to country and the sometimes different aspirations of Indigenous people are dismissed. In the run-up to the 2004 election, a former Liberal Aboriginal affairs minister, Peter Howson, described this approach as being ‘Rousseauvian sentimentalism’.
This government’s approach is now crystal clear. Its attitude to ATSIC and Indigenous people was clearly articulated in 1988, but now it has become abundantly clear for all to see. When the bill to establish ATSIC was first introduced in the parliament in 1988, it was heavily amended by the opposition of the day. The debate in the Senate lasted 40 hours. At the time, it was the most heavily amended bill by an opposition in the history of the parliament. I will come back to that in a few moments. The Liberal shadow minister at the time was Mr Chris Miles, and during the last stages of the ATSIC bill, after acknowledging that the bill would be supported by the coalition, he said:
I do not believe that the saga of ATSIC is over by any means.
                  …         …         …
We have argued our case against this legislation long and hard, rationally, clearly and extensively. ... The Bill has, in effect, just fallen over the line as legislation. We are entering into uncharted waters with this legislation, and it bears all the seeds of its own destruction.
Senator Vanstone, also speaking in the parliament at that time, said:
... the minority report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs found, firstly, that the proposal for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission ... was unjustified, unnecessary and culturally inappropriate and, secondly, that it would operate to the detriment of Aborigines and lead to worse services and to less accountability both to Aborigines and all Australians.
 That was the view at that time, and it reflects the current view of this government.
The comment about ATSIC ‘containing the seeds of its own destruction’ is a very interesting one. Coming as it did from the former Liberal shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, it might be seen now with hindsight as a promise of what a future coalition would do when it came to the abolition of ATSIC, regardless of ATSIC’s record and any achievements it might make. Actually, the ATSIC Act, as amended by the coalition in 1989, could be regarded as containing near fatal flaws because it was deliberately bastardised by the Senate, by the Liberals and by the National Party at that time. As it turned out, those amendments substantially reduced the effectiveness and workability of the legislation. They reduced its integrity as legislation. In fact, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs at that time, Mr Gerry Hand, noted in his third reading speech on the bill that he was ‘disappointed’ in some of the amendments that the Labor government had been obliged to accept. Former Labor senator Michael Tate described these as ‘modifications that will be important in the actual operations of ATSIC’. In a speech made in 1990, Mr Hand made a related point. He said that ATSIC ‘has been white-anted from the first day’. He said that the commission had been undermined by the media and the Commonwealth bureaucracy, which did not trust ATSIC.
On its election in 1996, the newly formed coalition government launched a major attack on the auditing arrangements applying to ATSIC. The new government brought in an independent company of auditors, which found very little fault, I might add, with the financial affairs and accountabilities of the commission. At the same time, the coalition government cut $470 million from ATSIC’s budget over the ensuing four years and slashed several programs by up to 30 per cent. Finally, the Howard government placed severe financial constraints on ATSIC, prescribing the exact purpose for which over 80 per cent of its budget was to be used. ATSIC became a shadow of its former self in terms of its decision making and policy formulation. In a real sense, ATSIC’s hands were tied from that point on. However, despite the restraints placed on it, ATSIC has managed successful programs which have seen communities generally take responsibility and make the most of the limited resources that are available to them. For instance, under the auspices of ATSIC, the Community Development Employment Projects scheme grew significantly, providing meaningful work for thousands of Indigenous people within their communities and supporting vital community development and cultural activities.
Another proud achievement of ATSIC is the successful Indigenous financial agency, Indigenous Business Australia, which provides grants and loans that assist Indigenous small businesses to find their feet and to grow successfully. Despite its faults, ATSIC and its regional councils have demonstrated that Indigenous self-determination can be a powerful force for community and economic development. Throughout the Northern Territory there are many important business operations occurring in mining, tourism, agriculture and a whole range of fields which have come about as a result of engagement with Indigenous people and the proper use of land rights facilities. All that is under threat and, as a result of this government’s policies, there is a clear indication and malice by this government to undermine those achievements.
There have been many examples of Indigenous controlled programs that have succeeded because, essentially, they target Indigenous people and address their specific needs. Unfortunately, this government refuses to learn the lessons of Indigenous success; it has preferred to paint all Indigenous controlled programs as corrupt failures. Now those and other programs are to be mainstreamed. Whether they can retain their unique features and, more importantly, their effectiveness—and I hope they do—remains to be seen. It remains to be seen how long the programs will be specifically identified as Indigenous. It remains to be seen how long the bureaucracy will take to swallow the programs and for the problems associated with the administration of Indigenous affairs to be swept under the carpet. That has been the history of this Commonwealth throughout the last 100 years.
A former Labor minister for Aboriginal affairs, Gerry Hand, said that he always saw ATSIC ‘as a beginning, not an end’. It was, he said, ‘a beginning to move to ... full self-determination’ for Indigenous Australians. While many Indigenous people have criticised ATSIC, to a person they seem to want to see a national representative structure again. They do not regard the government’s National Indigenous Council as anything like an adequate replacement. Nor do they see the very idea of a national representative body as divisive, or as a manifestation of apartheid or ‘separatism’—all the pejorative words that the government seeks to use when it describes this policy area. Mr Howard, throughout his political career, has referred to and used those terms. I want to quote his comments back in April 1989, when he told the House of Representatives:
... if the Government wants to divide Australian against Australian, if it wants to create a black nation within the Australian nation, it should go ahead with its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation and its treaty. In the process it will be doing a monumental disservice to the Australian community.
This was back in 1989. He said:
I think it is a very bad step for the long term unity of this country to establish the structure envisaged under the ATSIC legislation.
                  …         …         …
The ATSIC legislation strikes at the heart of the unity of the Australian people ... I say to the Minister that if the Government establishes this ATSIC legislation it will create more resentment and more division.
                  …           …         …
I ask the Government not to go ahead with the legislation.
When he became Prime Minister, he acted on those sentiments. John Howard’s scaremongering at the time of ATSIC’s establishment has proved to be entirely without foundation but it remains one of the great fantasies of the Right in Australian politics that those are the sorts of dark emotions that you churn up.
Some 10 years after the establishment of ATSIC, in 2000, hundreds of thousands of Australians—probably a million—walked across the bridges of this country to symbolise their commitment to reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. The Australian people were united in seeking true reconciliation. They were not divided, they were united. Neither Indigenous nor non-Indigenous Australians see Indigenous self-determination as a threat. The people who do see it in that way are in this government. On the contrary, the Indigenous people I have talked to see such a structure as a necessary condition—a base—for their full participation in Australian political and economic life.
The government’s ‘practical reconciliation’ agenda, the mainstreaming of service provision for Indigenous Australians, and the abolition of Indigenous representative organisations are diametrically opposed to the approach that most Indigenous people support. In fact, in pursuing its ‘assimilationist’ agenda, the government has produced division and resentment, and it has done so without achieving the practical goals it said it was aiming for. Over more than eight years in government the coalition has failed to make a dent in the inequality gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Its approach has done nothing to build economic prosperity or to end poverty or exclusion. Jon Altman, in his 2003 paper, Monitoring ‘practical’ reconciliation: evidence from the reconciliation decade 1991-2001, says:
It is of particular concern that some of the gains made between 1991 and 1996 appear to have been offset by the relatively poor performance of Indigenous outcomes between 1996 and 2001.
The Howard government has failed Indigenous Australians and it continues to do so. The second reading amendment that I will move on behalf of Labor and other parties in the chamber—the Greens and the Democrats, who I understand cosponsor the second reading amendment—seeks to highlight these issues. The opposition also wishes to foreshadow that it will seek to amend the legislation in the committee stage.
I would like to leave senators with something further from Paul Keating’s 1993 Redfern speech. The then Prime Minister frankly described the injustices that confronted Indigenous Australians and he invited the rest of us to imagine that those wrongs had been done to us. He said:
If we can imagine the injustice then we can imagine its opposite. And then we can have justice.
Labor stand beside Indigenous Australian people in their struggle for justice. We will work with them to achieve the restoration of a comprehensive national representative structure that reflects the interests of Indigenous people and protects their rights. We will stand beside them in ensuring that they get a fair share of the economic development of this country that will end the poverty and exclusion. We will ensure that people get what is rightfully theirs as part of a truly democratic country. I move:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:
notes:
that the Government’s ‘practical reconciliation’ agenda has failed to improve outcomes for Indigenous Australians,
that there is no evidence that mainstreaming of service delivery will in any way help to address Indigenous disadvantage,
the Government's failure to advance the goal of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians,
the Government's failure to negotiate a treaty with Indigenous Australians or to guarantee self-determination for Australia’s Indigenous people, and
that the abolition of Indigenous representative organisations will serve to further marginalise Australia’s Indigenous citizens;
condemns the Government for failing to:
consult or negotiate with Indigenous Australians on the provisions of the bill, and
develop a new legislative and administrative model that restores the right of Indigenous Australians to be responsible for their own future, despite the international evidence demonstrating that this approach delivers the best practical outcomes;
supports the implementation of new legislative and administrative arrangements that restore responsibility and opportunity for Indigenous Australians; and
calls on the Government to:
guarantee that Indigenous communities will be genuine partners in the policy development and the delivery of services,
ensure that a properly resourced regional representative structure is developed according to the preferences of Indigenous communities, and
consult with Indigenous people for the purpose of negotiating the establishment of a new national Indigenous representative body whose members are chosen by Indigenous people”.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,11,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2005-03-10,"—I rise to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 [2005], concerning the fate of ATSIC. The Australian Democrats strongly oppose this bill and we strongly oppose the direction in which this government is taking Indigenous affairs in this country. The Democrats believe, and I personally believe, that the ATSIC bill should be rejected in its entirety. We appreciate that the opposition have tried to negotiate a stay for regional councils, but I want to make some comments about that. To be honest, I do not think it should be lost on this place or the Australian people that it was the Labor Party who started the ball rolling in the same politically expedient way that the government deals with Indigenous people. That seems to be the hallmark of dealing with Indigenous affairs in this country: it is a ball that is thrown back and forth. Six months might help in some areas, and for that it would be worth it, but its main function seems to be to save face rather than to assist Indigenous people.
I hope that the opposition do think about what has happened as a result of their pre-election policy-on-the-run statements and about the lives that are going to be affected by the consequences. I have heard what has been said and I hope that rings true in terms of what they hope to achieve in conjunction with the government. But the reality is that we should not be here today and we should not be debating this bill. Quite frankly, we should never have given an opportunity to the government to move swiftly to deal with this particular issue.
Having said that, I want to address the substance of what the government is doing and has been doing to Indigenous people for the last nine years. As the majority report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs made clear, and as the supplementary report further emphasised, the Howard government has already caused significant harm to Indigenous Australians through its regressive policies since 1996. Right from the very start there was the immediate funding cut of some $460 million to ATSIC, the attack on native title rights in 1998, the refusal to apologise to the stolen generations and now the abolition of the national Indigenous voice and the regional networks, to name a few significant milestones in this government’s relationship with Indigenous people.
I think the committee’s report is pretty much unambiguous in its condemnation of the Howard government and its failed practical reconciliation agenda, but it appears that to the government this report is just another in the long line of reports telling it exactly the same thing—another report to be ignored. As we say in our supplementary report, the government’s rhetoric in recent times regarding these so-called new arrangements has been at best illusory and at worst nothing short of deceitful, because the disingenuous repetition of the phrases about ‘bottom up’ and ‘community control’ cannot change the reality of the policy. That is, that it is top down, it is paternalistic and it is essentially just a veiled—a very thinly veiled—policy of assimilation.
With all the rhetoric about giving control back to the communities, people could be forgiven for thinking that this government believes in self-determination for Indigenous people and that Indigenous people should have control over their own future. Let us not forget that this government believes in assimilation. It has stated time and time again that it does not support self-determination for Indigenous people. It feels no shame in stating that at the UN Working Group on the Draft Declaration on the Rights of the World’s Indigenous Peoples, and it is hard to believe that in this place and at this time it will not admit it outright as part of this debate. Why insist on the facade that the new arrangements are about Indigenous control? All the pretence achieves is an obstruction of real debate on these issues.
When you look at the government’s response to the Council for Reconciliation final report in 2000, you see that the then minister for Indigenous affairs wrote that the government:
… unequivocally supports the principle of Indigenous people having opportunities to exercise control over aspects of their affairs (as reflected in the establishment and operation of ATSIC …
If ATSIC is the government’s example of Indigenous people having control over aspects of their affairs, and if the government is abolishing ATSIC and not replacing it, isn’t this an admission from the government that it is in fact not in favour of Indigenous people having any control whatsoever? Indeed, the conclusion would seem consistent with a raft of other mainstreaming actions that have been taken in recent times by this government. The tendering of Aboriginal legal services is another example.
One of the most significant aspects of the process surrounding the abolition of ATSIC has been this unending series of government misrepresentations about ATSIC and about the process of abolition that is used to justify this unilateral decision. The truth is that there has not been any consultation with Indigenous people. Consultation is not what happens after the fact to try and legitimise a decision based on the personal ideology of the Prime Minister. Consultation is something that happens before a decision is taken. Minister Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, is calling this a quiet revolution. It is not quiet because we are all coming around to the government’s agenda; it is quiet because this government is silencing the many critics and crafting the debate.
It is about much more than consultation, because the agenda of this government began well before the troubles of ATSIC and it runs far deeper than just getting rid of ATSIC itself—so much so that the tone of government statements about Indigenous affairs has always been high-minded but rarely connected to any factual base of truth. The problems that beset ATSIC provided a window of opportunity for this government to move swiftly, and it did just that. I want to reiterate what Mick Dodson said in the committee hearings: ‘Indigenous people have again been spoken about and dealt with as though we were invisible. Not only have Indigenous people been treated as though we were invisible, we have actually been ignored when we speak up. Indigenous people have been shouting loud and clear. We want a national elected body.’
That is what the years of consultation found prior to ATSIC’s establishment. This is what the $1.4 million government commissioned ATSIC review found in 2003. This is what the select committee found from the evidence. This is what I heard from listening to Indigenous witnesses at the hearing and this is what Indigenous people are telling me, as the only Aboriginal person in this place, every day.
The abolition of ATSIC has been in this government’s sights since day one. The Prime Minister opposed ATSIC in opposition. He immediately stripped ATSIC of funds on being elected, did everything possible to make the job impossible, demonised the ATSIC board members, contributed to a mix of monumental failures of his own government departments and then shifted 100 per cent of the blame to ATSIC, while perpetuating the stereotype that blackfellas are devious and cannot manage their own money and while dividing Australia along race lines. This is not an exaggeration. I have permanently etched in my mind the television picture of the Prime Minister holding up the map of Australia with 70 per cent blacked out, telling Australians that Aboriginal people were going to take their backyards. What an absolute load of nonsense!
The real policy being served is that this government will stop at nothing to push through with its ideological agenda. It is all about an ‘us and them’ mentality for this government. It is that ‘us and them’ mentality—which the government encourages in the Australian psyche—which fuels the misrepresentations about ATSIC so that everyone out there in the Australian community believes that Aboriginal people are to blame. The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs itself found that ATSIC was not the failure that this government would have us believe. In fact, it found that ATSIC was extremely successful, given the hurdles that it was up against. ATSIC was way more than the chairperson or the deputy chair. It was a successful network of regional councils across this country, which seems to be lost on this government and the members on that side of the chamber.
I would encourage everyone to read the committee’s majority report for an outline of all of ATSIC’s successes, including extremely effective international advocacy, as well as the excellent administration of the Community Development Employment Program and the Community Housing and Infrastructure Program. Despite a chronic lack of resources and recognition, the regional councils are still, as we speak, being fair minded and decent. They are subsidising the government neglect by trying to cushion the blow for their communities. They are working hand in hand with the new Indigenous coordination centres that have been created. This government has had the nerve to ask these dedicated, passionate people to figure out how their own structure can be abolished and how the government will then talk to Indigenous people.
The committee heard evidence which confirmed what my office was already well aware of: the administration of Indigenous affairs in this country is in total disarray. Chaos reigns as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and senior public servants struggle to explain what they mean by ‘mutual obligation’ and cannot explain or produce a single piece of documentation outlining what shared responsibility agreements are, let alone how they are enforced, how they are to produce outcomes or how they are to measure any of the outcomes that might be there.
It is hard to explain just how saddening it is to sit and listen to senior public servant after senior public servant—those now in charge of running Indigenous affairs—repeating the same old, well-worn government catchphrases: ‘shared responsibility’, ‘mutual obligation’, ‘no school, no pool’, ‘This is empowering communities’, ‘I wouldn’t want to second-guess what communities want,’ and ‘The community is talking to us; we’re just listening.’ When the poster child for the government’s new arrangements is an exchange of petrol bowsers for face washing—an agreement which has not even been signed yet—I cannot believe that there has been much thought put into this at all.
The linchpin of this so-called revolution in Indigenous affairs—the SRAs—is the biggest disaster of them all. They are completely ad hoc, there are no benchmarks, there are no targets. How will these agreements—which are different every time you talk about them—result in improvements to the lives of Indigenous people across the country? The government cannot even confirm if they are legally enforceable contracts and who the parties are. The inconsistencies are glaring. How can the government, on the one hand, make agreements with Indigenous representatives and yet, on the other hand, refuse to recognise representatives for any other purposes—for example, advocacy for Indigenous rights?
The committee also heard that there is a real potential that SRAs are in breach of international human rights law. The government members tried to suggest that perhaps we should seek to change international human rights law, if that is the case. I emphatically reject that as the most insane and destructive suggestion of the committee. If SRAs are seen by the international community to be racially discriminatory then this government should change its policy, not the other way around.
SRAs are about securing a group of people to blame when things go wrong, not about improving things. That seems to be how the government pushes them. After the government has given petrol bowsers to Mulan, what happens then? Has the Commonwealth discharged its obligations regarding trachoma? The community is left to deal with the reality of the situation and is left with the blame if things do not improve. So there is nothing mutual at all about these obligations.
Another reflection of the government’s poorly thought through ‘policy on the run’ is the apparent basis of these SRAs and regional agreements: the COAG trials. The COAG trials have not even finished. They are not being evaluated in any process. It seems that there have been some failures and some successes. I have spoken many times in this chamber about Murdi Paaki in my home state of New South Wales and its success story. But its success story is not because of a shared responsibility agreement; rather, the ATSIC regional council worked themselves into the ground for the last few years to make that happen. They did that themselves; they did not need to be told by the government. Of course, the government conveniently rebadged it and called it a shared responsibility agreement and took the credit. I wonder what will happen to the success stories of regional councils across the country when regional councils are gone on 30 June.
Meanwhile, while the Prime Minister and the minister reinterpret the definition of ‘shared responsibility agreements’ every week and reinvent the meaning of ‘community control’ for each media story that comes out, Indigenous people suffer. While this government works out what it is doing, people’s lives are being affected. One of the most disturbing things about the current state of affairs is the hack job that has been done on the administration of previous ATSIC and ATSIS programs. This, on top of what can only be seen as an ‘asset grab’, leaves me without much hope for the brave new world of Indigenous affairs. The government says it is about giving power back to communities. But the reality is that it is about reneging on legitimate ATSIC decisions made before ATSIC was disbanded or which were in process at the time.
I have spoken on many occasions about the issue of the MiiMi Mothers Aboriginal Corporation and why there is a need to resolve that, and I will not repeat it again on this occasion. If the government is so determined to look at people making their decisions locally, why does it keep ranting and raving about the violence experienced by Indigenous women and children and do nothing to help a mothers group that wants to do something within its community that has youth leadership and antiviolence programs in place? They are the sorts of people we ought to be helping.
Another example is that the Indigenous Consumer Assistance Network has given the ATSIS legal team in Canberra—that is, the government department—a submission for the proper release of remaining funds in the ATSI Cultural Education and Advancement Trust of about $400,000. ATSIC are the trustees of this fund. They made their decision. It is unable to be now signed off on because Minister Vanstone has issued directions requiring 30 days notice. They are worried that they are now going to lose those funds when ATSIC is abolished. The money was designated well before we started this debate. It is not part of a pool of funding. It should not be the government’s choice just because a signature is required. The remaining funds should be allocated as they were first intended.
This is the kind of thing that is happening right across the country. Successful programs are at risk because the government does not like two particular people on the ATSIC board. The Democrats will be moving a number of amendments to try to address the administrative nightmare that has unfolded. We are trying to salvage some of the quality agencies and programs from being destroyed along with ATSIC by the government’s uninformed meddling. An example is Indigenous Business Australia. People may not know that the changes will result in the minister now having control over all of IBA’s functions, just because they are taking on programs previously held by ATSIC. I think this jeopardises the success of the organisation. They have not been in the media. They have been successful and have been getting results, and now the minister takes control. We are also going to move a second reading amendment jointly with the ALP which my colleague Senator Carr spoke about. We are united in this and I think we believe in what these words say. In many ways, this is the point at which we have arrived.
I also want to reflect on some words that were given to me earlier this week by an Aboriginal woman who came over to visit from the Ninga Mia group in Kalgoorlie and the Goldfields area. I sat down with her and her group, who, by the way, drove in a bus all the way from Kalgoorlie to Canberra. I think they are camped down in the park because they do not have any money to stay in motels. They are so passionate about this particular issue that they have come along to speak to all sides of politics to make sure that they get a chance to be listened to and that this debate is aired properly. One of the women there was Auntie Phyllis, an elder. I noticed her words. She wrote a note and handed it to me. It said:
When the first white man came to Australia, we had the land and he had the Bible. He asked us to pray, so we closed our eyes. When we opened our eyes, he had the land and we had the Bible.
In this respect, when we think about what we are dealing with here, it is much more than just the question of whether ATSIC as an institution is being abolished. It is the question of prevailing attitudes and a direct attack on Indigenous programs right across the country.
I spoke earlier in the week about the question of Redfern. No-one seemed to notice that. I was surprised yet again that it was not even reported in the media. No-one wants to hear about these things or that one group of people can be singled out for different treatment from the rest of the country. That is exactly what we are doing here in respect of the abolition of ATSIC. I would hope that on the government side of the chamber they would open their eyes and see the real truth of what is going on. We are not dealing with ATSIC in isolation of a larger agenda. There is a new moral agenda being put forward by this government. It has no factual basis. The reality is that the only people who suffer are Indigenous people.
I think we have to do more than just turn around and debate the issue of whether ATSIC ought to be abolished. We spent $1.4 million and we went out there and asked people what their views were. They told us loud and clear. The government are not listening to those views. In other words, I think they are playing wedge politics to drive this colour line between black and white in this country. I have been appalled not by what is being said but by what is not being said by the Prime Minister in showing leadership about harmony within our community. I am appalled that somehow, when young people die within our communities, whether it is in Redfern or Palm Island—or even when two young men have nooses put around their necks and are dragged behind a four-wheel-drive across a river bed in northern New South Wales on the border with Queensland—no-one steps up to say anything.
Why is it that, in this country, we have become so conditioned to not talking out in favour of those who are oppressed? Of course it does not garner broad community support, but it is not right. It is immoral, indecent and unjust. The ATSIC bill is a further part of the program that the government have put in place to perpetuate this prevailing attitude that now takes over the country. I hope that they show the right leadership and do not perpetuate what is wrong. I know that Senator Scullion is passionate about these issues in the Northern Territory. Sometimes I think they are very misguided in the way they deal with things. But the law has to apply equally. The lady of justice statue has a blindfold on for a reason—so that she cannot see the colour of a person’s skin. But in this country we take the blindfold off and allow her to see things differently. That is what has to stop. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,11,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-03-10,"—The government’s proposal to abolish the national Indigenous representative body, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission or ATSIC, is unsupportable. The government has failed to genuinely consult those people affected by the proposal—that is, Indigenous Australians. The government has failed to propose a suitable alternative to ATSIC. We acknowledge that there are varying views within the Indigenous community about ATSIC, but there is widespread support throughout Indigenous Australia for a national representative body chosen by Indigenous communities. Yet the government has failed to hear this call. The government has failed to adequately explain how its new model will operate, nor has it committed the funds to new representative bodies at a national, regional or community level.
There can be no genuine participation for Indigenous Australians without government commitment to representation. Given the relative disadvantage of Indigenous communities, a commitment to fund such bodies is required. The government will take the assets of ATSIC and regional councils but has pledged nothing for the new representative bodies. Government-selected advisory panels are no substitute for the representative voice of Indigenous people and their direct participation in the affairs of government that affect them. Effectively muted, particularly at a national level, Indigenous Australians will be relegated to the sidelines of decision making about their lives and future. The deeply-rooted disadvantage that Indigenous Australians endure and the rightness, both morally and in international law, of redressing this disadvantage and ensuring the survival and flourishing of Indigenous culture demand genuine commitment to self-determination.
The government’s proposals on representation and the mainstreaming of service delivery fall a long way short. They ignore the lessons from nations that have had more success with self-determination. For all of these reasons, the Australian Greens reject the unilateral abolition of Indigenous Australia’s national representative body and we will be opposing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 [2005]. The government announced its decision to abolish ATSIC in April of last year. It then pre-empted parliamentary debate and scrutiny by implementing all of the changes that it possibly could via regulation, presenting this parliament with a fait accompli.
The government ignored the ATSIC review that was commissioned in 2002 and reported in 2003. This review, as others have mentioned, involved extensive consultation. It put forward four possible options for restructuring ATSIC, and none of them included abolition. Little wonder that Indigenous people are highly critical of the lack of consultation about the abolition of ATSIC. The very first witnesses who appeared before the select committee that inquired into this bill—a group of women from the Yuendumu Women’s Centre at the Alice Springs hearing—had not heard before they came before the committee about the government’s proposals to abolish ATSIC and its regional council. So much for consultation.
The ATSIC bill not only abolishes the national Indigenous representative body and the regional councils, and all the work they do with communities and advancing the interests of Indigenous people; it also removes requirements for Indigenous input in important forums and processes. It removes the requirement to consult Indigenous organisations on proposals that could harm Indigenous heritage through the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. It also removes the requirement for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner from HREOC to consult Indigenous bodies about the human rights of Indigenous Australians. It also removes Indigenous representation from the board of the National Health and Medical Research Council. The government says that it will negotiate with Indigenous communities directly, but it has not yet explained exactly who it will negotiate with and nor has it made any commitment to fund any new bodies or to guarantee that they will be representative.
Part of the government’s plan for delivering services and improving coordination across government agencies is to co-locate staff from different agencies in Indigenous coordination centres, ICCs. The government regards them as pivotal, but there is massive confusion about what their role and function is and how much authority they will have to make decisions. The committee heard evidence about the difficulties for ICCs in creating a cohesive and common vision, because each of the lead agencies represented within the ICC has a different purpose, a different function, different reporting outcomes and different performance targets. These difficulties are exacerbated because staff from different departments are being paid different wages, working under different conditions, and answering to different ministers and performance requirements. Witnesses spoke about the difficulties that the new managers of ICCs were having both in learning about the communities they were going to be advocates for and work with as well as in learning to find their way through the maze of government departments and Indigenous-specific or other relevant programs.
Another difficulty for the operation of ICCs is the level of delegated authority that ICC managers are given. It seems they may not have the authority to deliver the programs in a way that the local community best needs. The manager of the CDEP program in Moree commented to the committee about the way in which the ICC is not able or empowered to make the local decisions that former ATSIC officers were able to make. The government contends that ICCs are not to be direct service delivery shopfronts, but certainly a different impression was given to the select committee. It concerns me, in looking through the evidence of the public hearings, that on nine separate occasions senators—and predominately government senators—referred to the ICCs, and explained them to the witnesses who appeared before the committees, as ‘one-stop shops’. Yet, in its reporting, the government says, ‘This is not the intention.’ If government senators on a committee looking into the administration of Indigenous affairs get an entirely different view than that of the government about the way the government is proposing that this central body will implement its new changes, how does one expect Indigenous communities to be able to understand what is being proposed by the government?
At the heart of the ICCs is a policy to mainstream the delivery of services to Indigenous communities. It is worth remembering and consistently restating that ATSIC never had full responsibility for delivering services to Indigenous people and communities, but it has always been blamed for the failures of other agencies and government departments. The deeply entrenched disadvantage that Indigenous people endure that manifests itself in poverty, discrimination, overcrowded housing, poor health and low participation in education and training all point to a systemic, long-term failure on the part of government and the implementation of government programs. To imagine that a body such as ATSIC could or should ever be responsible for redressing these historic failures on the part of the government was always plainly ridiculous.
The 2003 review of ATSIC rejected mainstreaming as an option, and international experience shows us time and time again that the best outcomes for Indigenous people occur when they exercise control over the decisions that affect their lives and when they do so through culturally appropriate institutions. Australia’s Indigenous population lags well behind on key indicators of social and economic wellbeing when compared with the indigenous populations of comparable countries such as New Zealand, Canada and the United States, which have more of a commitment to self-determination than we see from this government. The government needs to acknowledge the failure of mainstreaming and commit to the genuine process that here and overseas is allowing Indigenous people, as the primary decision makers for decisions that affect their lives, to have service delivery occur in a way which is delivering far better outcomes.
The concept of shared responsibility agreements as a way of delivering better results is also flawed. Yet these agreements, like the ICCs, are central to the government’s new policy of delivering services to Indigenous people. The Australian Greens are deeply concerned about the concept of these agreements, what they might entail and the consequences for communities and individuals of entering into them. We note the statement by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Tom Calma, which he made in November 2004. He said:
It would be unacceptable for Indigenous peoples to be denied basic citizenship services that all other Australians take for granted.
He added that the proposed introduction of coercive measures to achieve improvements in the circumstances of Indigenous people will not work and may in fact exacerbate the extent of poverty, marginalisation and powerlessness that Indigenous communities already experience. Given the entrenched disadvantage of Indigenous people, and the poverty they experience compared with other non-Indigenous Australians, it is impossible to argue that agreements of this nature can be negotiated by two equal parties.
We have already witnessed an agreement which linked two essential requirements that have nothing to do with each other. The much publicised Mulan agreement ties essential health services and parental behaviour to fuel for transportation—fuel is not a luxury in remote areas; it is essential. Let us go back to the comment that Tom Calma made. He said:
It would be unacceptable for Indigenous peoples to be denied basic citizenship services that other Australians—
including those living in rural communities—
take for granted—
and expect from their governments. These agreements have about them a tenor of paternalism, which has no place in the administration of Indigenous affairs in this nation or anywhere else.
The government’s record on Indigenous affairs gives us no grounds for optimism. The government has failed on the essential issue of reconciliation—abandoning any idea of the genuine process of healing to smooth the path ahead for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The government has failed to show the compassion or the action needed to the sorry legacy of the stolen generations. The government has never been comfortable with a representative national Indigenous body that is prepared to be outspoken, to stand up for its constituents and to take the government head on, both at home and in the international community.
The government has been gunning for ATSIC since it took office. The government sent the auditors through time and time again at the same time it was cutting ATSIC’s budget by around 11 per cent. Soon after coming into office, the government reduced the amount of money that was available for training courses to improve management skills for Indigenous administrators at the same time as these audits were being carried out.
The government imposed restrictions on how ATSIC could spend much of its funding, causing the closure of important programs. Funding for women’s resource centres, like the one run by the women of Yuendumu in Central Australia, was cut back. They were our first witnesses and they did not even know that ATSIC or regional councils were being abolished. The women from Yuendumu who gave evidence to the select committee in Alice Springs last year told of the work they were trying to do to keep children and young people out of harm. They were mediating family disputes, helping women keep in contact with their families, assisting people with Centrelink matters and running programs to promote better health for families, babies and their mothers. These are the sorts of practical social programs that suffered and had their funding removed when the budget of ATSIC was cut by 11 per cent soon after the government came into effect.
The statistics for Aboriginal disadvantage are appalling every time we hear them, but even put together they do not tell the full story of the disadvantage that Indigenous Australians face in this country. It is worth reminding ourselves of them. Twice as many Indigenous babies are born with lower weight than non-Indigenous babies. There are 2.5 times as many deaths among Indigenous infants than non-Indigenous infants in Australia. In 2001 the mean or average gross household income for Indigenous people was $364 per week, compared with $585 a week for non-Indigenous Australians. This puts almost one in three, or 72 per cent, of Indigenous people in the lowest or second lowest income quintiles—that is, the poorest Australians. Life expectancy for Indigenous people is almost 20 years lower than for non-Indigenous people and it is lower than life expectancy in some of the poorest nations on earth—places like India, sub-Saharan Africa, Burma, Papua New Guinea and Cambodia.
High school retention rates are lower for Indigenous Australians than for non-Indigenous Australians. Whilst almost one in four non-Indigenous people aged between 18 and 24 years are attending university, just one in 20 Indigenous people in this age group are studying at university. Just over half of Indigenous people of work force age are employed, 54 per cent, compared with almost three-quarters, 73 per cent, of non-Indigenous people. Indigenous Australians are often unable to access education and training. They face discrimination and they face difficulties, particularly if they are required to move from their communities and land in order to take up paid work. Some of the more pressing cultural priorities keep them tied to their country. Many Indigenous Australians work in the Community Development Employment Projects, the CDEP, scheme, which, while it has provided benefits to communities and been administered by ATSIC, is not the equivalent of doing general paid work in the community.
More than a decade after the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, Indigenous people continue to be incarcerated at high rates—16 times the rate of non-Indigenous people—at rates higher than when the commission reported in 1991. Young Indigenous people constitute around 42 per cent of all juveniles incarcerated, although they account for just four per cent of the total juvenile population. Former Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Dr Bill Jonas said the census figures showed that progress was minimal and it was difficult to see any progressive trend towards reducing the extent of inequality that Indigenous Australians experienced compared with non-Indigenous Australians. He went on to say in his 2003 report:
... there is not sufficient commitment by governments at any level to do whatever it takes to progressively improve the life chances and opportunities for Indigenous people ... we are not progressing as well as we can or as well as we need to. This needs to change …
The Greens agree wholeheartedly. Though governments are doing too little, many Indigenous communities and their leaders are driving change, and ATSIC has been involved in some of these most important developments. Where Indigenous people are given the support they need and the time, space and capacity to do it in their own way and make decisions for their own lives they are achieving tremendous feats.
The needs of Indigenous Australians are different from those of non-Indigenous Australians. There are different needs for Indigenous Australians living in the city, regions and rural areas and for those who live a largely traditional lifestyle in remote parts of this country. Non-Indigenous Australians need to recognise this and support Indigenous communities to establish their own organisations, to advocate on their own behalf, to speak, to be listened to and to have their recommendations acted upon. Hundreds of thousands of non-Indigenous Australians across the country are doing just that. They reject this government’s neglect of Indigenous affairs and its attacks on Indigenous Australia’s representative bodies. They are working in local communities to forge constructive relationships. If only the Howard government could muster the same understanding and the same genuine commitment to self-determination, we would set ourselves on a path on which we could turn around and address the tremendous statistics of disadvantage that Indigenous Australians currently face.
I indicate that I will not be moving the previously circulated second reading amendment from the Greens, because we are supporting the amendment that Senator Carr has moved. We are doing this with Senator Ridgeway.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,11,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2005-03-10,"—I would like to thank those opposite for their contribution, particularly Senator Ridgeway. He has made a wonderful contribution to Indigenous leadership in Australia. The irony is not lost on me that he came to this place through the mainstream process. I must say that I am completely miffed by the Labor Party’s contribution this morning and a little confused. Perhaps that is because the spokesman is a little out of touch with Indigenous affairs. I am not sure. I know his appointment to the position is only recent. Over eight years there have been eight separate spokespeople from the Labor Party on this particular issue. I think it was back in 2000 that it was reported that, when you were scurrying around looking for somebody else to possibly put their hand up for the position of spokesperson for Indigenous affairs, an unnamed member of parliament from the Left faction was heard to say that being given the position of spokesperson for Indigenous affairs would be like getting the job of toilet cleaner on the Titanic.
—That is disgusting!
—Exactly. I agree with you. It is a disgusting approach to Indigenous affairs. It is a very, very important issue. In my career in politics, you would totally aspire to provide leadership to the very important first people of Australia. I will just quote from the minority view:
ATSIC is no longer capable of addressing endemic problems in Indigenous communities. It has lost the confidence of much of its own constituency and the wider community.
That quote does not come from government members. It is a quote from the former Leader of the Labor Party—a bloke who, for the very first time, stood up and made some sense. Of course, he is from the Right. He actually made some sense. He said that the first Australians deserved some reform, deserved some change, and that the Labor Party would stand by that change and abolish ATSIC. The government brought forward the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 [2005] that we are looking at today. It is quite a simple thing. Now the opposition are resiling from it. I have just been listening to the spokesman for Indigenous affairs on the other side, who basically told us that there is nothing wrong with ATSIC, it is all fine with ATSIC and the government has got it wrong. I cannot really believe that they are so far out of step on this issue.
The government are fair dinkum. We are fair dinkum about reducing Indigenous disadvantage. We have spent $2.9 billion on Indigenous specific programs. That is a 39 per cent increase in real terms, and that is getting fair dinkum about this. But it is not only about the money; it is about looking at the outcomes. I have always been very keen to look at the outcomes. Senator Nettle was talking about the area of disadvantage. There is still a gap—we are not in denial about that—but the gap is closing. Infant mortality and death rates from respiratory illness have gone down. More remote communities have access to sewerage, electricity and water. More Indigenous are people working. Unemployment rates are down and employment participation rates are up. The number of students staying on to year 12 has doubled. More are going to university. The number who have got tertiary qualifications has more than doubled over the last 10 years. New Apprenticeships and TAFE attendees have almost doubled since 1996. Housing overcrowding rates have declined since 1996. The number of houses included under the Community Housing and Infrastructure Program has doubled since 1996. There has been a doubling of money provided in loans through the Home Ownership Program.
It is still not good enough; I accept that. Indigenous Australians want better results and they deserve better results. But the Howard government are absolutely determined. We are not going to work within the same flawed framework that has been designed by Labor. That is why we are going to abolish ATSIC and introduce some radical, fair dinkum changes and fair dinkum reforms. We have actually had support for that. The member for Fraser said that Indigenous Australians may be attached to ATSIC but that there is very little adverse reaction to its abolition. I was part of the committee that looked at the abolition of ATSIC. We went out there and found that, in absolute droves, Indigenous Australia was totally disinterested in what happened to ATSIC.
We have been accused of not really consulting. Consulting is something you do when you really are not fair dinkum about making a change. You say, ‘We’ll consult more.’ The second thing you do, of course, is have new committees. Consulting is a big time thing for the Labor Party. I would remind them that there were two major rounds of consultation, 8,000 copies of a discussion paper were mailed out to specific individuals who showed interest and a web site was set up. All 35 of the ATSIC regional councils were consulted. They talked to their stakeholders and they gave evidence. The committee received 156 written submissions. To say that there has not been wide consultation is absolute rubbish. Those consultations revealed widespread disillusionment and dissatisfaction with ATSIC on the part of Indigenous Australians full stop. I think that if Mark Latham had not had the courage to act Labor would have done the normal thing—nothing. We think that nothing will happen if you do nothing, but nothing has a consequence. The same levels of disillusionment and disadvantage for Indigenous people will occur. We need to thank Mark Latham for that contribution. He had the guts and the courage to stand up for what is right.
The opposition have spoken at length about mainstreaming. They have said that we all support assimilation and that we are returning to the past. They tell us that the mainstream departments have failed Indigenous people. It does not take more than a casual glance at history to show that Indigenous Australians had their programs changed by the Labor Party. They said, ‘Clearly, ATSIC is not delivering properly. Let’s change it. We’ll mainstream the delivery of health.’ That was a sensible proposition at the time. I had to heartily agree with them at the time. But you have to do the job properly. What about all the other programs left hanging around that were suffering from the same lack of leadership and administrative skills in delivery that the health programs were? You cannot do half a job. You have to be fair dinkum about it.
There are members of the Labor Party who are fair dinkum. I have to congratulate the Clare Martin Labor government in the Northern Territory, who are fair dinkum about working with our government and about mainstreaming the management of their programs. All the states and territories do, and in general they support what we propose. It seems that only those opposite are still in never-never land and persist in doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome.
Whole-of-government leadership and coordination is the key feature of our approach. That framework is going to be headed by a ministerial task force chaired by none other than the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs herself. That will ensure that we have complementary and consistent policy. Under that framework the secretaries of the departments are going to be responsible for Indigenous specific services. When I say responsible, I mean not just overseeing but being held accountable and responsible. When they appear at estimates hearings we can all beat them up and find out exactly what is happening to the outcomes. It will be the first time that the bureaucrats in the departments have been made totally and directly accountable to the Australian people for the outcomes for Indigenous Australia. All government agencies will be responsible for 100 per cent of all Australians 100 per cent of the time.
In the majority report there are certainly some issues and concerns about the assets of ATSIC. Some evidence was given to us that somehow the assets of ATSIC are not going to be used in a way that benefits Indigenous Australia. I want to assure the House that the housing fund, with the majority of the housing and business loans, is going to IBA—Indigenous Business Australia. I have to commend them on the wonderful work they have done in the past. I have a very high level of confidence that that is the very best place to put these programs and funds. The Regional Land Fund—ATSIC holdings—is going to the Indigenous Land Corporation. They have done a fantastic job in the past and I am sure they will really look after the funds for Indigenous Australia.
We have heard a lot from the other side about elected representation at the national level. Unsurprisingly, we are not going to replace ATSIC. People have talked about the United States and Canada. I think they are useful examples. Neither country has elected bodies that are somehow reflected in regulation or legislation. It certainly works, and the argument does not follow that they somehow need to be connected to some regulatory process. That is actually about self-determination and self-management: allowing Indigenous people to develop and establish their own representative bodies that they have ownership of, that are doing what they understand and that know their own people and their own issues.
Labor says our reforms go beyond the abolition of ATSIC, and they probably should go on to say that they are actually doing something practical. I can tell you what Labor is intending to do: pretty much nothing. Indigenous people have every right to be concerned about what they are going to do. Labor is going to abolish ATSIC and replace it with more of the same. We will have one nationally elected board. Surprise! That is a big change, mate. We are going to make it another nationally elected board. What a surprise. What a radical change. That will really improve the lot of Indigenous Australia. ATSIS will be turned into a commission—a bit of renaming. Regional councils will continue. It does not matter what people want to do at the local level. There will be 35 ATSICS—it is another Mini-Me. It is not good enough for Labor to pretend to the Australian public that they intend to abolish ATSIC. You have to have the guts. You have to have the same guts that Mark Latham had and say, ‘They deserve more. This isn’t good enough.’
This bill will make major changes to the Australian government’s institutional structures in Indigenous affairs and improve the lives of Indigenous Australians. We are providing better arrangements for involving Indigenous people at national and local levels in the determination of priorities and policies relating to issues that they have identified that actually affect them. The opposition talks about models of empowerment. Some people might consider that is a fact, but it disempowers the vast majority of Indigenous Australians who do not get those very few golden hats. There is an opportunity for those people opposite to do the right thing, be fair dinkum about this for Indigenous Australians and support this bill in its unamended form.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,11,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2005-03-10,"—I have to say at the outset that I am disappointed with my colleague from the Northern Territory not being able to take up his full time in debating in this place such a monumental bill in the turns of history of Indigenous people. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 [2005], as we know, formally abolishes ATSIC, but it further dampens the aspirations of Indigenous people in this country. In fact, it goes much further than that. The Howard government has never believed in our Indigenous Australians having a real say in decisions about their future, and this bill goes on to dismantle every means available to Indigenous people to have any say in such decisions. This is not to say that the Labor Party saw ATSIC as worthy of keeping—certainly not in the form it had become. For reasons outlined in March 2004, Labor believed that, as constituted, ATSIC did not have the capacity to work effectively for Indigenous Australians. However, unlike this government, we believe that Indigenous people must have an elected voice—a representative voice that is chosen by them.
From July 2005 or, in fact, from the passage of this bill, there will be no Indigenous voice in this country that is truly representative of Indigenous people. Coincidentally, from 1 July there will be no Indigenous representatives in this parliament and very few in state or territory parliaments outside of the Northern Territory. Also, if the Howard government gets its way, there will be no form of truly representative collective voice for Indigenous people anywhere in this country, other than through the Torres Strait Regional Authority.
In a statement to the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, Jackie Huggins said:
I would particularly like to direct the committee’s attention to the ... critical importance of a nationally elected representative voice.
                  …         …           …
... not one that is driven by non-Indigenous political manoeuvring.
She went on to tell of the success of the meeting of Indigenous leaders in Adelaide in June 2004. She said:
The 200 voices we heard in Adelaide, and the many more since, were united in the desire for a legitimate, Indigenous designed and owned national representative voice ...
She went on to say:
We the Indigenous people of Australia and we alone have the right to determine who represents us locally, regionally, nationally & internationally.
It is pointless wasting time debating the faults of or criticising ATSIC, but for all its faults I personally believe, and have witnessed first-hand, that ATSIC had many more achievements. Will Sanders, in the Journal of Indigenous Issues, wrote:
... over its 14 year history, ATSIC has indeed achieved much and displayed considerable strengths ...
He went on to enumerate these strengths: political participation of Indigenous people; a national Indigenous voice increasingly independent of government; distinct approp-riate programs; regionalism, working with states and territories; and, lastly, the distinctive Torres Strait arrangements. ATSIC was initially criticised as being just another government department, but in the end it became much more than that; it became a voice which would speak against government for Indigenous people. It had to do so in order to achieve legitimacy among its constituents. As has previously been pointed out, the original bill was first introduced on 27 May 2004—the anniversary of the 1967 referendum. When the Prime Minister announced the intention to abolish ATSIC, a former ATSIC chairperson—a senior traditional man from East Arnhem who is no longer with us—said:
… one of the most disappointing aspects of Mr Howard’s decision was the manner in which it was made and the language with which it was delivered.
In the classic imperial fashion, without negotiation, without understanding and with little empathy, the great white leader announced that Aboriginal people had, yet again been a ‘failure’.
On making his announcement, the Prime Minister said that the government’s goals were to improve outcomes in health, education and employment. But these programs had for years been out of the hands of ATSIC and had been mainstreamed in other government departments. So who is really to blame here?
This government’s failure to achieve outcomes for Indigenous Australians was also shown in the HREOC report for 2003. The commisson showed up the lack of outcomes—and every year the commission’s report shows that. The failure of this government to close the gap of disadvantage faced by Indigenous people in those key areas is highlighted time and time again. Mainstreaming has not worked. But, typical of their obsession with the concept of assimilation and their rhetoric and approach of blaming the victim, the Howard gov-ernment has gone back to mainstreaming to try and justify the current approach, which will force Indigenous people down a path they clearly do not want to go. The government thinks that with a few more bureaucratic government committees thrown in to monitor things it will work this time.
ATSIC may not have been perfect, but, as I said, it had acheivements under its belt. It had more strengths than weaknesses, as was highlighted in the report by the select committee. It is this government that has failed Indigenous people, not ATSIC. However, the Prime Minister has not criticised his ministers for education or health or employment. He has taken the easy way out and blamed ATSIC and Indigenous people once again. He has blamed the victims. Now he is doing even more to take away any voice they had in decisions vital to their future. In doing so, the Prime Minister and his government are ignoring Indigenous people. They are ignoring the review of ATSIC, which was costed at around $1½ million dollars. They are insisting on mainstreaming all Indigenous programs. It will only be a matter of time before these discrete programs will disappear.
This is a Prime Minister and a government which do not seem able to accept or understand that Indigenous people are different. This is a Prime Minister who rarely visits Indigenous people. When he does, he must keep his ears and eyes shut tight for he rarely seems to hear or see anything they tell or show him. I have to say that on Senate committees I have been on with senators from the government side I sometimes feel I may as well ship along a cardboard cut-out, because they obviously do not listen to the things that are being said to other senators on the committees. I fail to understand how some of my colleagues from the government side can stand up and deliver speeches on this bill today when they do not truly understand what was said to them over 13 days of hearings during the Senate select committee process. You would think, in fact, that they had never been there and had never heard the same words I did.
This is a Prime Minister who is already older than the age most Aboriginal people can expect to live to in this country. This is a Prime Minister who will not say sorry. He believes in practical reconciliation but to date has been unable to see or accept that this is not working. The disadvantage gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians still looms large.
Furthermore, this bill does not, as I have already indicated, just abolish ATSIC—it goes well beyond that. As it stands, this bill will vest increased powers in the minister— rather than in Indigenous people—with respect to regional council operations for the time they have left, which is until 30 June 2005. This bill provides for the wholesale transfer of ATSIC assets to the Commonwealth, although during the Senate select committee hearings we were never given the precise details about how that would operate. If assets pass to the Commonwealth, they can do with them what they please. For example, the shopping centre in Alice Springs is owned by ATSIC in trust for Indigenous people. We have recently seen how this government will deal with Indigenous people in the treatment of former commissioner Alison Anderson: they raided her Alice Springs office in order to take the Indigenous artworks away from that building.
This bill further proposes major changes in other Indigenous organisations, including the Indigenous Land Corporation and Indigenous Business Australia. It seems entirely possible that both will be expected to take on increased roles and responsibilities but with no additional resources, increased control by the minister and little accountability for Indigenous people, who will not benefit from these proposed changes.
Another significant change will be to the Office of Evaluation and Audit, which will be given a much expanded role to undertake evaluations of all or any Indigenous pro-grams in any department and to investigate individuals and organisations that have received funding under any Indigenous program, with little restriction to its scope. While accountability of itself is not a concern, this seemingly unfettered scope of the OEA could be.
I want to now turn to some of the opinions offered during the hearings of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs that I believe highlight the massive crisis in Indigenous affairs that is being created by the government’s actions. The HREOC submission to that committee stated most clearly that the Social Justice Commissioner did not support the passage of this bill. In summary, this was because the bill will operate to disempower Indigenous people and the mainstreaming of services is not accompanied by adequate mechanisms for scrutiny of the government’s performance on Indigenous issues. The abolition of ATSIC will mean the government will have to deal with Indigenous people only on the government’s terms and without reference to Indigenous people’s aspirations.
The HREOC Social justice report 2003 indicated a need not for less Indigenous input and control but for the exact opposite. HREOC went on to say:
Ultimately the Social Justice Commissioner is concerned that abolishing ATSIC will simply silence Indigenous people at the national level while the deeply entrenched crisis in Indigenous communities continues unabated.
In their submission to the committee, the Combined Aboriginal Organisations of Alice Springs said:
 ... the abolition of ATSIC ... threatens Indigenous representation at the Commonwealth level and deprives regionally based Indigenous organisations of their united voice.
Tangentyere Council in Alice Springs say:
… the provisions of the ATSIC Amendment Bill and the sketchy information on the replacement structure constitutes a denial of the right of Indigenous people to self-determination.
This is of considerable concern as self-determination needs to be enhanced and strengthened to bring about positive change.
It is contrary to the recommendations of all the major and authoritative reports conducted into Indigenous Affairs ...
The Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement say:
It is considered that the credibility of the Government is at its lowest when it comes to Indigenous Australians and denying access to justice, self determination and quality of life. On one hand the government is overseas expending millions of dollars bombing a country and installing democracy, whilst at the same time it is denying funding and dismantling democracy for Indigenous Australians ... Australia is returning to the dim dark ages of the 1950s to provide services to Indigenous Australians through a failed mainstream system ... Various Government Inquiries including the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the Grants Commission support service delivery by Indigenous organisations.
They go on to point out that ATSIC will be denied the opportunity to prove itself, that it has been actively discredited by a few individuals and by this government, and it had the potential with the right leadership to improve quality of life for Indigenous people. They say that the ATSIC review showed a way forward but:
The current Government with its misguided ideology has chosen to ignore this comprehensive Review and its recommendations.
I could go on to quote from many other submissions—well over 200 were received by the time the 2004 election was called. I said earlier that this bill goes well beyond the abolition of ATSIC, and it certainly does. Whichever way we view it, whichever way we interpret it, this bill quite clearly takes away the Indigenous voice and ownership over a wide range of areas which greatly affect their lives.
I want to finish by highlighting two stories that were placed at the beginning of the Senate select committee’s report. These stories were told to us at Gove, in Nhulunbuy, during the inquiry by an Indigenous man, Tony Binalany, who has now become the Chairman of the Northern Land Council. Those people who are listening who understand the way Indigenous people communicate and pass on deep thoughts about what they believe is happening would know that this often takes the form of stories. This story is about the magpie geese and the sea eagles. They wondered why one could not be like the other, why the sea eagles made their nests up at the top and the magpie geese laid their eggs in the weeds in the swamp. They had an argument about who was the best. The story continued:
But, if the eagle was like the magpie goose he would die and if the magpie goose was like the sea eagle he would die, so at the end of the day they agreed that one was a magpie goose and one was a sea eagle, and they both lived happily ever after.
My interpretation of this is that Aboriginal people believe that the government is trying to turn everybody into sea eagles. It fails to recognise that there are other people in this world and that they can coexist on their own terms and under their own conditions and still live harmoniously. Larissa Behrendt, from the University of Technology, Sydney, in her submission to the committee had this to say:
The notion of mutual obligation that has become the latest catchword in Indigenous policy sees the federal government attempting to reward and punish those who do not meet standards of behaviour that the government sets for them. In this form the notion is misnamed as mutual and has no home in the values of Aboriginal culture—traditional, contemporary or romanticised. The notion of reciprocity within Aboriginal communities encompasses the idea that those with resources should share them with those who do not and that those who are the recipients of this generosity have the same duty to provide and share with others.
That embodies the view of Indigenous people. It sits quite comfortably alongside the story that Tony Binalany told us in Gove. It is quite opposite to the way this government sees Indigenous people. It shows us quite clearly that Indigenous people do not believe that this government shares their aspirations, understands them or even wants to listen to them. As the report says, assimilation is far from a benign philosophy. On the contrary, it represents merely one aspect of a view of Indigenous people that is paternalistic and essentially arrogant in its superiority. It is a view that most Australians would find repugnant. Opponents of assimilation—both black and white—do not want to banish Indigenous people to apartheid inspired reservations but recognise that in order to take their rightful place in Australian society Indigenous people’s needs, history, cultures and rights must be accorded recognition and respect. The government’s agenda fails to do this. In so doing, it fails its own Indigenous citizens. For all Australians, that is a matter for shame.
Last Thursday in Alice Springs, with the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee, which is looking at the funding of Indigenous education, amongst a group of Indigenous parents and Indigenous teachers I will always remember one non-Indigenous parent from Ross Park Primary School who stood out in the crowd. She said, ‘Before you go, and before the committee finishes, I just want to place this on the record: when Indigenous people win, it is a win for all of us; when Indigenous kids achieve, it is an achievement we can all celebrate.’ She was quite adamant that no longer should Indigenous issues stay just as that. Indigenous issues are everybody’s issues. There also has to be recognition out there that Indigenous people must have a say in how they believe this country should control their lives. Indigenous people must be set on a path of self-determination and not assimilation.
I think Alison Anderson is right when she says that history will prove that in 10 years time we will come back into this place and we will re-examine what has happened on this day and we will determine that this was just another experiment on Indigenous people. I believe that in five to 10 years time we will look back and discuss what has gone wrong again. What has gone wrong is that Indigenous people have lost their voice. As of this day they will be categorically ignored by this government, despite this government’s policy and despite the aspirations for their future.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-03-10,"—I rise to speak in support of the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2005 and also indicate that, during the committee stage, I will be moving some amendments, which I think have been accepted by the government. Senator Murray will be moving a second reading amendment, which I also intend to support.
The impartial information and analysis provided by the Parliamentary Library is crucial to the effective scrutiny of government and the parliament and to ensuring that the Australian people get the highest quality debate and resulting legislation possible. No-one appreciates that more than opposition senators—and no-one among them appreciates more than me, as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, how important the role of the Library is to the effectiveness of the opposition. This bill establishes the statutory position of Parliamentary Librarian within the amal-gamated Department of Parliamentary Services. It also establishes the functions and reporting structures of the position, as well as setting out how the position and, consequently, the library itself will be resourced.
Labor has proposed amendments that give statutory status to the Parliamentary Library and expand the potential qualifications of the Parliamentary Librarian, which also provide a statutory base for the functions and operations of the Security Management Board. While we support the bill in its creation of a statutory Parliamentary Lib-rarian position, we are seriously concerned about the government’s lack of commitment to ensuring the independence and funding of the library. These concerns have been reinforced by information gained in recent Senate estimates hearings.
In his 2002 report, the Parliamentary Service Commissioner, Mr Podger, recommended the amalgamation of the three departments providing services to the parliament into one single department—what is now the Department of Parliamentary Services. The commissioner’s report made the following four recommendations regarding the Parliamentary Library:
 5.1 The position of Parliamentary Librarian be established at a senior level within the amalgamated service provision department.
5.2  The independence of the Parliamentary Library be granted by Charter from the Presiding Officers.
5.3  That the independence of the Parliamentary Library be reinforced by strengthening the current terms of reference for the Joint Library Committee.
5.4  The resources and services to be provided to the Library in the amalgamated department be specified in an annual agreement between the departmental secretary and the Parliamentary Librarian, approved by the Presiding Officers following consideration by the Joint Library Committee.
Parliamentary agreement to a resolution establishing the new department was given on the understanding that the government would implement the Podger recommendations to ensure the library’s independence. The bill currently before us does not follow through on that commitment. There is no reference to the independence of the Parliamentary Librarian. Labor’s amendments seek to remedy that glaring deficiency.
The bill does establish the statutory position of Parliamentary Librarian and describes the functions of that position as ‘to provide high-quality information, analysis and advice to senators and members of the House of Representatives in support of their parliamentary and representational roles’. The bill also clarifies the role of the Library Committee, on which I had the honour to serve early in my period in the parliament, which advises the Presiding Officers in respect of library matters. It specifies the reporting, appointment, remuneration and termination conditions of the position. It also provides for the provision of resources to the librarian through an annual agreement with the departmental secretary, approved by the Presiding Officers with advice from the Library Committee.
Labor has some concerns, which have prompted the amendments. Late in the last parliamentary period, Labor raised concerns about the qualifications of the Parliamentary Librarian being limited to professional librarians and about the lack of statutory status for the library itself. We also raised concerns about funding cuts imposed on parliamentary departments by the Department of Finance and Administration in order to pay for the security upgrades to Parliament House. These cuts were imposed without any statutory mechanism for oversight of security management. I am happy to say that the President has agreed to Labor’s amendments, which provide statutory status to the Parliamentary Library, expand the possible qualifications for the librarian to include librarianship, information management or individual qualifications and experience judged as suitable by the Presiding Officers, and provide a statutory basis for the functions and operations of the Security Management Board.
We discussed many of these matters in the recent Senate estimates hearings in February and those discussions reinforced some concerns about the protection of the library’s independence and funding. To begin with, the government has ignored Mr Podger’s recommendation that the library’s independence be guaranteed by a charter from the Presiding Officers. In addition, we think very little work has been done to strengthen the terms of reference of the Joint Library Committee—another of Mr Podger’s recommendations. The government seems to have ignored or neglected two of the key recommendations intended to guarantee the library’s independence—recommendations that were the key to the agreement to set up the new department.
We also have grave concerns about the provision of funding to the library. Mr Podger has recommended an annual resources and services agreement to be reached between the librarian and the departmental secretary. That resources and services agreement has been replaced in this bill by a resource agreement. During recent estimates hearings, the Secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services insisted that a resources agreement was the same thing as a resources and services agreement. What matters in the end is that the library has access to the resources and services it needs in order to do its work.
That said, we learned during estimates that the library has taken a funding cut in the current financial year of $382,000 and that in the next financial year it will have a further reduction, which will be a pro rata share of the department’s $1.3 million cut. In addition, the department as a whole is expecting to absorb a wage increase costing in the order of $2 million. There can be no doubt that cuts of this scale can only reduce the services and resources that the library can offer to its clients, federal MPs and senators. We are concerned that the government is not committed as strongly as it should be to providing adequate funding for the information and advice services to the parliament, which are provided by one of our four great national libraries.
I know people listening might think it is a little self-serving that senators and members are so concerned about the library, but people need to understand how central it is to our work and to our democracy that we are able to access those important resources. It is a key aspect of a parliamentarian’s capacities and, I think, a key aspect of accountability that senators are able to be resourced in this way. Labor will support this bill, which establishes the position of Parliamentary Librarian and clarifies the operation of that position. We are pleased that the government has seen fit to accept our amendments to give statutory status to the library and the Security Management Board and to broaden the possible qualifications of the Parliamentary Librarian. We are deeply concerned by the government’s failure to show a clear commitment to both the independence and the funding of the Parliamentary Library. We will continue to take a keen interest in this situation and hold the government to account on this most important issue. We will also continue to stand up for the library, which has provided outstanding service to this parliament for more than 100 years.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,12,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-10,"—The provisions of the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2005 arise directly out of the recommendations in the Podger report and the subsequent creation of the new Department of Parliamentary Services. This situation has been reviewed by the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing and, as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has outlined, has been canvassed at length in the estimates committees. Essentially, the bill creates a statutory position of Parliamentary Librarian and sets out the functions, resourcing and reporting obligations of the position. I want to put on record the Democrats’ strong agreement with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. It is probably not well understood by the community at large how integral to the functioning of our democracy through this parliament the library and the services it provides are. It is very much a pillar in the ability of individual senators and members to carry out their responsibilities adequately and effectively.
Historically, this proposal to make one service provision department by combining these three departments was floated in 1996, and legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives by the Labor government at the time but never brought on for debate. I am told there have been about 10 amalgamation proposals altogether since Federation. The first of these was nearly 100 years ago, in 1908, but most of the proposals to amalgamate all or some of the five parliamentary departments came after 1977, which some historians might categorise as pretty well the commencement of the age of economic rationalism, so described. The many years it has taken to achieve this rationalisation shows just how contentious an issue this has been. While the Democrats understand the rationale of amalgamation as a cost-saving and efficiency exercise, I again put on record our deep concerns.
The Democrats have consistently opposed all previous attempts to amalgamate any or all of the parliamentary departments, our thinking being that it potentially compromised, in particular, the independence of the library and the provision of independent services to the parliament. In a nutshell, we have feared that the costs would be greater than the benefits. To an extent this has been echoed in the Podger report, with its warning advice that there is a need to take measures to guarantee the independence of the Library. Further, it is our view that the parliamentary departments should not be wearing the cost of security. That should have been properly and separately funded, as for ministerial and other agencies, and should not impinge on the services that are available to this place. We do not think that the Department of the Senate, Hansard or the Parliamentary Library should have to shed functions and staff to find savings to cover the costs of security. These should be a general Commonwealth government cost arising from an external threat, and it should not be seen as a specific cost to the parliament.
Turning to the main provisions of the bill itself, the bill has two schedules, the first of which establishes and provides for the office of the Parliamentary Librarian. The second schedule makes minor related amendments to the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976 and the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. The main provision establishes the office of the Parliamentary Librarian, which will be established within the Department of Parliamentary Services. The Parliamentary Librarian’s function will be:
... to provide high quality information, analysis and advice to Senators and Members of the House of Representatives in support of their parliamentary and representational roles ...
That is a description which we all absolutely agree with, but of course such a description can only become a reality if independence is preserved and proper funding is provided.
The bill also defines for the first time in legislation the term ‘Library Committee’. The Library Committee is the committee or committees of the houses of parliament that advise the Presiding Officers in respect of the functions of the Parliamentary Librarian. There is now a requirement that the Parliamentary Librarian must annually report on the performance of his or her function to the Presiding Officers. The Bills Digest notes that this provision could be interpreted in a number of ways. It could be interpreted that the Parliamentary Librarian has a purely formal reporting obligation to the Library Committee. However, a narrow reading of the Parliamentary Librarian’s role and engagement with the Library Committee could limit opportunities for the free flow of ideas and expectations between senators and members and would reverse the past practice of the Parliamentary Librarian attending Library Committee meetings.
There are also provisions set out that provide for the appointment and termination of the Parliamentary Librarian. Regarding the issue of professional qualifications for appointment as the Parliamentary Librarian, the appointee will now be required to have either or both of the following: professional qualifications in librarianship or information management and/or professional membership of a recognised professional association in the discipline of librarianship or information management. This requirement for specific librarianship or information management related qualifications is consistent with the Podger report recommendations because of the nature of the services the library provides, and it stresses the importance of the requirement that the Librarian possess the relevant qualifications.
What has become quite a central issue is whether the role of Parliamentary Librarian requires professional library and/or information management qualifications. Opinion has been highly divided between the merits of appointing a professional librarian and those of appointing a nonlibrarian. The Democrats would lean towards applicants in possession of information management skills because we think such skills are highly relevant to this position; however, it has been argued that there are other relevant professional qualifications such as strong leadership, management, communication and organisation skills that may be found in other professions that would allow for applicants to be drawn from a wider pool of talent.
I recognise, for the sake of speed and clarity, that we do in fact support the Labor Party’s proposed amendments (1) and (2), on sheet 4509, to the librarian’s role. I should also say, for the sake of clarity, that we support their proposed amendment on sheet 4510, as circulated. I wish to move a second reading amendment which addresses our greatest concerns and goes to the preservation and provision of things we and many other members and senators from all parties, and Independents, value. I move my amendment, as circulated on sheet 4529:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate calls on the Presiding Officers and the Government to ensure that the parliamentary departments, in particular the Department of Parliamentary Services, are adequately funded to provide an appropriate level of services to the Houses of the Parliament, their committees and members, that those services are not reduced to pay for increased security expenditure, and especially that:
adequate funding is provided for the Parliamentary Library to provide its essential services;
transcription services are at an appropriate level;
public access to Parliament House during sittings of the Houses and public meetings of committees is not curtailed; and
public access to the Parliament House art collection is available.”
Firstly, this amendment tries to ensure that the parliamentary departments—in particular, the Department of Parliamentary Services, the library and the transcription services—are adequately funded to provide an appropriate level of services to the houses of the parliament, their committees and members and, mostly importantly, that those services are not reduced to pay for increased security expenditure. Senators and MPs, not just those in opposition and in the minor parties in this place, rely heavily on the valuable research and information services which the Parliamentary Library provides. I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that the coalition’s current backbench ginger group which is active on tax reform matters—probably thus incurring some raised eyebrows from the Treasurer—will be relying heavily on the Parliamentary Library. That is just one example where members of the government backbench use these services.
The library provides us with knowledge and information that are obviously not a priority for the government and executive, who have their own resources and their own extensive information sources. It is important that the parliament is able to be resourced in order to provide a well-informed counterbalance to government opinion. It is a matter of fundamental importance in the separation of powers. A weaker, less-informed parliament is not in the national interest. I come from a long line of parliamentarians, going back centuries, who regard the parliament as the ultimate protection against an overmighty executive. It is very important that, in recognising all these things, we protect those things which keep the people strong in the face of an executive. It does not matter who the executive is; it does not matter whether it is the coalition, Labor or some other party. The history of mankind is that the people you fear are kings and executives, not parliaments.
Secondly, the amendment seeks to ensure that the public are allowed to enjoy continued access to the amenities of Parliament House during sitting weeks and that access to public meetings of committees is not curtailed. Parliament House has always been a house for the people. It should not become a house for the elite, whereby access is selective. We are here as elected representatives of the people. Open and free public access to this building and its inmates is an absolutely essential part of our Australian democracy.
Lastly, the Parliament House art collection is not easily accessed by anyone other than the regulars in the building. The Parliament House art collection belongs to the people. It should be available to as many of the public as possible. It must be accessible via any other electronic means as well, and it is important that people are given unencumbered access to our national artworks. It is my understanding that the placement of this art collection on an electronic register has been suspended because of cost. If it has been suspended, that should be regarded as a delay, not as a termination.
I conclude by saying that, while we are always sympathetic to the need for cost savings and efficiencies and very much recognise the obligation of the Presiding Officers in that respect—and we are confident, in fact, that they have their eye on that particular ball—we Democrats strongly believe that it should not be at the cost of reducing core and valuable services that the Parliamentary Library research and information provide in the interests of a strong Australian democracy.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,12,1
"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2005-03-10,"—I indicate, as President, that I have no objections to the second reading amendment moved by you, Senator Murray. I interpret it—correctly, I hope—as support for the President and the Speaker in their responsibilities to oversee the operation of Parliament House and the provision of services to senators and members. I make the observation to the Senate that, although the appropriations to the parliamentary departments are provided for quite correctly in separate legislation to other annual government expenditure, in terms of budget stringency and the need to constantly operate efficiently and within our means, the parliamentary departments are no different from any other agency funded by the public purse.
In saying that, I also say to the Senate that, as President, I take very seriously my obligations to ensure that adequate funding is provided to ensure this chamber and its members can carry out their legislative responsibilities properly. In regard to paragraph (a) of Senator Murray’s amendment, I note that the bill being debated today provides for an annual resource agreement between the Parliamentary Librarian and the Secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services so that the funding for library services is known and is considered by the joint Library Committee.
I note the comments about public access to Parliament House during sittings and public meetings of committees. I also note the part of the amendment relating to public access to the Parliament House art collection. Might I remind the Senate that, whilst a few works are in the public areas, the purpose of the collection has never been to provide a public art display. Since the first acquisitions in 1986, the collection was designed to provide Australian art in the suites of senators and members and in other areas of Parliament House. The art in the public areas is largely provided by portraits from the Historic Memorials Collection. The Speaker and I have no plans to diminish that because seeing these portraits of former prime ministers, governors-general and other historical figures forms part of the attraction for visitors to our parliament.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-03-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today.
Today in question time a number of questions were asked, both of Senator Minchin and Senator Abetz, on the latest OECD report in relation to tax and wages. The report, entitled Taxing wages, was released and made available this morning. It is interesting that, about 24 hours after using the OECD’s comments and discussion in a different context as a defence against some of the criticisms that have been made against the Howard government, what we see now is an OECD report being criticised or undermined. Senator Abetz does not believe that it is necessary for him to have read it or that the issue of effective marginal tax rates is an issue associated with work force participation.
The fact is that the OECD report that has been released is an indictment of this government. It demonstrates quite clearly the continued failure by this government to properly deal with the disincentives that hardworking Australians have when it comes to moving from welfare to work or simply increasing their work force participation—increasing the number of hours they work. This is a government that talks a lot about work force participation, usually in the context of having a go at a number of cohorts of benefit recipients. They talk a lot about the need to move people from welfare to work. On this side of the chamber, we believe that it is a good thing to encourage and support those who are able to work to do so. We do not believe it is a good thing for them to be punished financially for doing so. This government has failed to deal with the punishing effective marginal tax rates that rob people in this country of the incentive to work.
Senator Minchin suggested that the OECD report does not deal with the changes to family tax benefit B. That is not the case. If you read the report, it is quite clear that the changes which were introduced by this government to the FTB withdrawal rate have been taken into account and we still have a situation where we retain some of the highest effective marginal tax rates in the world. In fact, when a second income earner in Australia moves from a third of average earnings to two-thirds of average earnings they face an effective marginal tax rate of over 52c for every dollar they earn. This is vastly higher than that which exists in comparable OECD countries. The next highest, I believe, is Belgium at around 35 per cent. That is a 17 per cent differential between Australia and the next country on the list in terms of effective marginal tax rates. How can this government be taken seriously on the issue of work force participation if it is simply unable or unwilling to deal with the disincentives people face to moving from welfare to work or to increasing their work force participation?
It is interesting to note that when the Minister for Workforce Participation first took this portfolio he talked about the importance of EMTRs, effective marginal tax rates, and about the importance of removing disincentives. He talked the talk, but he is not really walking the walk, because we know from what has been leaked by this government to the Australian in the context of their strategy cabinet meeting that the government has indicated that it is not going to deal with the effective marginal tax rate issue, because it is too difficult. I hope I am wrong. I hope those reports are wrong. I hope that the government is prepared to listen to the wake-up call that has been given to it by the OECD and deal with the issue of the disincentives which are punishing Australians who want to work, which rob Australians who want to work of the incentive to work. But we wait to see if this government will do it.
The government talks long and hard particularly about the participation rate of women. No doubt we do have to do better in this country in encouraging and supporting women to work and increasing the participation rates for women. But the government is not prepared to do the things which are required to increase women’s participation rates. It is not prepared to deal with the work and family issue, despite the fact that this has been trumpeted for years as a barbecue stopper. We have seen almost no reform of any kind on this front by this government. Women disproportionately face the burden of EMTRs. Women are very often the second income earner moving into employment. These are the people who are facing these punishing tax rates, and these are the people in Australia who this government has let down, who this government is refusing to support. The government talks about work force participation but it is not serious about removing the disincentives.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,14,1
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2005-03-10,"—The claims made by the Labor opposition about the tax policies and the impact of tax on Australian workers derived from the OECD statistics just show how statistics can be misused. The Labor Party is using these statistics to falsely claim that the present government, the Howard government, is the highest taxing government in Australia’s history. That ignores the fact that within these OECD statistics are contained state taxes—payroll tax is included in these statistics, a state tax, a tax levied by the six state Labor governments around this country. To say on that basis that the federal government is the highest taxing government in Australia’s history is demonstrable nonsense.
The second point Labor ignores, very conveniently, is that the OECD report very clearly shows that average Australian workers in 2004, as was the case in 2003, had the second highest disposable incomes of average workers anywhere within the OECD countries. Taking tax and benefits into account, this means that average Australian workers have higher real incomes than average workers in any country other than Korea. Higher real incomes is the key to the purchasing power of the wages earned by average Australian workers. Because of the federal government’s policies over the last nine years, wage increases have been matched by productivity increases, so they had been noninflationary and they have increased the purchasing power of the average Australian worker. That is to the great credit of the policies of the present Howard government.
You need to look at not only tax rates but also family payments—the benefits that are received by workers on particular income levels. As we know, in the last budget the government significantly increased family payments. Families that have two children and earn 100 per cent of the average production wage, as it is defined, have an increase in family tax benefit A. That, combined with the lowering of the taper rate in the current budget, means that a person earning the single-income average production wage who has two children is this year receiving more than $1,800 in additional family assistance. When you combine that with the last budget’s tax cuts that came into effect on 1 July last year and the additional family tax benefit B announced during the election, such a family is now more than $40 per week better off. So the numbers being used by the Labor Party to put forward their arguments are demonstrably false.
A single-income family, for example, with a child aged under five does not even become a net taxpayer until its income exceeds $41,800. There have been a number of claims made on this issue—for example, that the tax burden on Australians has increased over the past eight years. This is based, again, on the OECD findings, but the OECD press release notes that the tax wedge on earnings rose in more than half of the OECD countries last year. The increases are different for different groups of taxpayers. For a single person earning 100 per cent of the average production wage, Australia has a tax rate of 28.6 per cent, which is well below the OECD average of 36.5 per cent. It is important to note that the OECD has not allowed for the inclusion of payroll tax in the tables prior to 2002. So you are not comparing like with like when you are looking at the eight-year period over which this claim is made by the Labor Party that the tax burden has increased. In one period you have got payroll tax included, and in another period payroll tax is not included. So the comparison simply is not valid.
An important point needs to be made with regard to family benefits being paid to taxpayers. The OECD report claims that the increase in tax has been worse for those with a mixture of family payments and earned income. This ignores family benefits. When they are taken into account, this group has been a net beneficiary. This is very clear. If you read the OECD report completely, you will see than on page 88 it clearly shows that fact, so Labor’s claims cannot be substantiated. (Time expired)

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2005-03-10,"—I acknowledge the comments of my colleague Senator Wong, who did point out the very useful leak from the cabinet about the fact that the government is not going to do anything about effective marginal tax rates. I find myself wondering where Senator Fifield is today in this debate. I know he has an interest in reducing effective marginal tax rates. I thought he might have chosen to enter into this debate, given that we do read about him extensively these days in relation to being a member of the new ginger group
Our contention that this government is the highest taxing government in Australia’s history is correct. Mr Costello gets away with it by saying, ‘Ah yes, but the GST is not a federal tax; it is a state tax.’ It is time to put something on the record here in relation to the GST. The new tax, the GST, collects around $30 billion-odd per annum, recurrent. It replaced the old wholesale sales tax, which was collected by the Commonwealth and was worth about $16 billion per annum. The GST, in fact, grows at twice the rate of the old wholesale sales tax. The Commonwealth no longer has to reimburse the states through general purpose payments, so there it is saving itself around $14 billion net. As it no longer has to pay that sum to the states and with the period of the IGA—the intergovernmental agreement on the GST—having expired, the Commonwealth is now $14 billion in the black, recurrent, per annum—because of the GST. That is a fairly simple concept I would have thought. This is in addition to the bracket creep, to which Senator Wong referred, which is the second point, resulting in an even bigger tax take.
The GST is a growth tax, so it just keeps growing and growing, and that $14 billion gain that the Commonwealth is getting direct to its coffers just keeps getting bigger and bigger. But there is more. Way back in the nineties, the High Court determined that it was unconstitutional for the states to collect tobacco, liquor and petrol excise; I do not know if many senators will recall that. At that point, to ensure that this situation did not disadvantage the states, the Commonwealth correctly took over the collection of those taxes and reimbursed the states for the lost revenue of tobacco, liquor and petrol excise. Fair enough so far; that is fine. But that is not the end of this story.
Since the GST was brought in and the minimum guarantee on the GST to the states has finished, the Commonwealth has not reimbursed the states for petrol, alcohol and tobacco excise. But guess what? The Commonwealth—on my calculations, and I am getting some work done—is now around $8 billion better off per year. I have not heard Mr Costello talking about that. Why hasn’t Mr Costello abolished petrol excise, for example? If you look at the amount of money the Commonwealth is saving from the expiration of the IGA, the intergovernmental agreement on GST, you are looking at $14 billion per annum recurrent plus this $8 billion, which Mr Costello never talks about. The Commonwealth, as a result of the GST alone, is now $22 billion per year better off, recurrent.
I notice that Senator Brandis also wants to speak in this debate and I will be happy and interested to hear his response. Nobody is talking about this particular aspect. Anyway, that is the reality of the situation: this is the highest taxing government that Australia has ever had. The GST is not a state tax; it is a Commonwealth tax. The Commonwealth benefits to the tune of $14 billion per annum and it is adding up, and there is this mystery $8 billion. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-03-10,"—Saying that this is the highest taxing government in Australian history is wrong. If you want to work out whether a government is high taxing or low taxing, you look at the tax rates. Under the Howard-Costello government, the rate of personal taxation has fallen. When the new tax system came in, the largest personal tax cut in Australian history was introduced. If you look at the rates of corporate taxation, in the life of the Howard-Costello government they have been reduced from 36 per cent to 33 per cent and then to 30 per cent. So we have the lowest personal tax rates that we have had for many years and we have the lowest company tax rates we have had for decades.
You half understand the point, Senator Mackay—because, although the tax rates have been reduced, the revenues have been increased. Do you know why that is, Senator Mackay? Because of the economic management of the Howard-Costello government, company profits are higher than they have been literally in decades.
—GST!
—I will come to the GST in a minute, Senator Mackay. So, from a 30 per cent company tax rate, there is more revenue generated than there was when the company tax rate under your government was 36 per cent, because companies are so much more profitable. It is the same with personal income tax. There are more people paying personal income tax at higher levels than was the case in the past. Do you know why, Senator Mackay? Because fewer people are out of work, more people are in full-time employment and real wages have increased during the life of this government by more than 15 per cent. That is why people are paying more tax, even though the rates of tax have gone down—because people are doing better, people are earning more and real wages have gone up, just like company profits have gone up, and so revenues have gone up.
But Senator Mackay has asked me to address the question of the GST. Senator Mackay, make my day. In 1999 the states and the Commonwealth entered into an agreement which was called the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations—it was signed on 9 April 1999. It set the GST at 10 per cent. As even you know, Senator Mackay, the rate of the GST has not increased. The amount of revenue raised through the GST is greater than projected because the economy is doing so well, people have more disposable income, there are higher real wages and higher corporate profits and so people are spending more. As a result of people spending more, more revenue is being raised through the GST. But the rate of the GST—10 per cent—has not shifted, as you, Senator Mackay, would know.
Where has all this extra revenue gone? We cannot say this often enough: 100 per cent of the GST collected goes unconditionally to the states. It is not a tied grant under section 96 of the Constitution. One hundred per cent of the GST revenue goes unconditionally to the states, and 100 per cent of the surplus revenue beyond the projected amounts of the GST revenues also goes to the states.

Senator Mackay interjecting—

—Senator Mackay, you should take the trouble to read the GST agreement. Do you know what the Labor state and territory governments promised to do? They promised to use any surplus GST revenue to reduce taxes. Have we seen a reduction in state taxes? No, we have not. This year, in my own state of Queensland, which gets about $8 billion of GST money, the Queensland Treasury will get a $760.6 million windfall beyond what was budgeted for. But have they cut payroll tax? No. Have they cut stamp duties? No. Have they cut gambling taxes? No. Have they reduced or abolished land tax? No. The Queensland government is pocketing the GST surplus, but it is not doing its part of the deal and using that surplus to fund a reduction in state taxes. If you want to know the real story about overtaxation in this country, Senator Mackay, look to the state and territory governments, which just coincidently are all in the hands of the Australian Labor Party.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,14,1
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2005-03-10,"—It is clear from what we have heard today that the Howard government, our highest taxing government ever, is committing ordinary Australians to a bleak economic future. Senator Chapman, in his comments a few moments ago, wanted us to believe that the government is not the highest taxing government. He will never convince the Australian people of that, nor will the bluster of Senator Brandis. He just will not convince the Australian people. Earlier today, in answer to a question, Senator Abetz told us—and I think it is quite farcical that he said it—that he had not seen the report from the OECD. I actually believe that he probably has not read it. He probably has not looked at it. He probably has not looked at the front page of the Australian today to see what has been written. I believe that, the same as I would believe any minister who told me that, because this government tends not to pay any attention to anything that might be critical of it. It lives in a fantasy world where it is not hurting ordinary Australians.
However, the report points out something that is very clear and should be taken note of by all politicians from all parties, federally and on a state basis. It points out that a person earning around $90,000 has already had a tax increase of around 1.4 per cent. That is for $90,000. However, the people who are paying around nine per cent extra in tax are the single parents who have two children and are earning about $35,000 a year. They are earning one-third less than the average weekly wage, but they are paying the most in tax increases. This is something that we should be ashamed to associate with. Of course, the shame belongs to the Liberal Party, because you have to ask: who is worse off—the single person earning $90,000 or the single parent with two children? It is very easy to tell. That is what is in the report. That is the report this government wants to dissociate itself from.
The folk who are worse off are people like those we see coming here and sitting in the gallery. They are the parents of the children we see coming in here day after day to see their parliament at work. They are the people who are out there doing their bit for Australia but they are being treated as second-rate citizens by the Howard-Costello government. They are the people who are struggling to pay for their mortgages and their cars, let alone for the fuel to run their cars. They are the people who are seeing their medical bills and the cost of their children’s education increasing regularly. They are the people who are worse off. It is not the wealthy in our society who are suffering; it is those people who are undertaking those jobs that many people do not want to undertake—those people who are already struggling—who are suffering, because those are the people the government never actually talks to. The government cannot hide from the real facts that are being produced. It cannot hide from the fact that taxes under this government have increased. It cannot hide from the fact that, despite all of the bluster of Senator Brandis, it is the highest taxing government this country has had. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-10,"—I want to pull this discussion back down to where it really matters, which is not a political bunfight between Labor and Liberal or between the federal government and state governments but what it means for the quality of life and the basic opportunities for survival of everyday Australians. I do that to pull the discussion back to the question that I asked Senator Patterson today because tomorrow we will have a key opportunity at the coalface. People throw figures backwards and forwards about whether it is the states’ fault or the federal government’s fault. That is an appropriate debate to have. I can understand some of the concerns about the adequacy of the actions of some state governments in how they have been allocating their revenue, particularly given that they, particularly my state of Queensland, have undoubtedly received extra revenue from the GST. Debate about whether the GST is a good thing is irrelevant to whether state governments are adequately spending the money that they receive from it.
Similarly, there are legitimate concerns about the adequate focus and priority of the federal government. But my concern that my question went to today, and it was not addressed by the government, was whether Australians who are in need are going to become the victims of this federal and state Labor-Liberal stoush that we have seen played out in this chamber over the last 25 minutes. It may or may not be the case that individual state governments have dropped the ball on providing proper funding for homelessness and housing, for example. But, if they have, the federal government should not make homeless people or people at risk of homelessness the victims of such a stoush. I could not get a clear guarantee from the Minister for Family and Community Services today that the stoush that is happening over the next round of funding for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, which targets homelessness, will not pan out with homeless people being the losers.
As often happens with these agreements, the federal government puts forward an offer. The federal government is proposing to put in extra money if the state governments match it in a certain way. That is fine as part of negotiations but we have to guarantee that, if the states do not do what the federal government wants, homeless people and issues regarding homelessness in general do not end up being the losers. If there is one group in the community who, more than any other, cannot afford to end up with less support it is people at risk of homelessness.
I remind the Senate that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Australia is a signatory, expresses the right to adequate levels of health, housing and necessary social services. The right to housing is central to other fundamental rights, and that is how we need to approach housing policy in Australia. We need to place housing at the centre of a broader social policy agenda, as people need homes as a fundamental starting point for their emotional and physical wellbeing. They need homes before they can participate fully in society. They need homes in order to gain education, to seek employment and to access health services. If we do not get the housing policies right—whether it is the federal government or the state and territory governments—we cannot expect to deliver on education, health or employment policies either. All the arguing backwards and forwards about whether the states or the federal government have spent the right amount of money becomes just a lot of hot air. If we cannot get basic policies right on housing then all the other delivery programs being delivered or proposed under education, health and employment are going to fall short as well. In question time earlier this week the minister said:
Homelessness is basically the priority of the state and territory governments and it is their responsibility.
That raises my concerns. It should be a shared responsibility but the federal government has to take leadership and it certainly should not raise the spectre at all as part of these political stoushes and state and federal stand-offs. It would be backing away from the core responsibility of ensuring that housing is provided and that at least people at risk of homelessness are provided with assistance. It is that guarantee that we must get as part of the negotiations that will occur tomorrow between the federal and state and territory housing ministers. (Time expired)

That the Senate take note of the statements.
‘Long on rhetoric and short on detail’ would probably be an apt way to describe the statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Australia’s aid program. In the statement there is little mention of the focus on the international aid community’s objective of poverty alleviation but there is much mention of security, and that is Australia’s security rather than the security of many of our vulnerable neighbours. This of course reflects the government’s official objective of the aid program to advance Australia’s national interest, and this is the lens through which Australia’s aid programs are now delivered. The government’s objective only after this broad-reaching statement goes on to consider issues such as poverty alleviation and sustainable development. That is reflected in the Australian government’s response to the tsunami relief program, which evidence suggests may be more about Australia’s strategic interests within Indonesia than the interests of the Acehnese who were so badly affected in the 26 December disaster.
Looking at where the tsunami aid money will be spent, the popular perception based on reports in some sections of the media is that most of the money, if not all, will be spent on reconstruction and infrastructure building projects in Aceh, which is one of the poorest and most conflict ridden provinces of Indonesia. That may not necessarily be the case. Whilst the package does focus on areas affected by the tsunami its application is Indonesia-wide. The Prime Minister stated:
While there will naturally be a clear focus on the areas devastated by the tsunami, all areas of Indonesia will be eligible for assistance under the partnership ...
These areas of priority need are exactly those identified by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in May 2004 in his statement on the 2004-05 budget as ‘emerging areas of support’.
It is quite possible that most of the grant aid and the loans component will be spent on projects outside Aceh as a part of the expanded assistance program to Indonesia, the details of which were already being worked out by AusAID prior to the tsunami. Thus, it would appear that the tsunami disaster provided the political will and the opportunity to provide extra funding for programs which, to a degree, were already under consideration.
Australia has come under increasing domestic and international pressure in recent years to increase its aid spending overall. Groups such as the Greens and the non-government organisations that we work with see the quality of Australia’s aid program as having greater significance in some respects than the quantity. Given that, it is important to understand that the Australian government has failed in its stated objective of spending 0.7 per cent of its gross national income on official development assistance in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals, to which the Australian government is a signatory.
Australia’s overseas development assistance has stagnated for the term of the Howard government. In the 10 years preceding the Howard government, overseas development aid maintained an average of 0.33 per cent of gross national income. Since the Howard government was elected to office in 1996, this figure has steadily declined and is now stagnant at 0.25 per cent of gross national income.
If Australia is to meet its target of 0.7 per cent, the real figure of our international aid program would exceed $5.8 billion this financial year, whilst the actual budget figure is only $2.1 billion. This suggests that our aid program is only around a third of what it needs to be in order to meet the targets to which the Howard government is a signatory. If Australia is to meet the set target of 0.7 per cent, the real figure of our contribution specifically to Indonesia would be exceeding $440 million annually, compared to the current $160 million per year. Thus, if we were meeting our international obligations, we would be giving an additional $400 million over five years to Indonesia, and that is without even considering our response to the tsunami assistance. Even dismissing the aforementioned concerns about the tsunami aid package, the Australian government is still delivering well below its own stipulated aim of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to the tune of $400 million over five years to Indonesia, disregarding the tsunami.
Research has been done by the non-government organisation AID/WATCH that clearly illustrates that a significant amount of money that is designated as aid returns to Australia via what is described as the ‘boomerang effect’. This is where aid money ends up in the pockets of Australian business due to a policy of giving Australian aid dollars in contracts only to Australian and New Zealand contractors. Kerry Packer has a company called GRM International that last financial year was engaged in managing $195 million of AusAID projects. It is difficult to put forward an argument that giving aid to Australia’s richest man equates to poverty alleviation.
In December 2004 the foreign minister announced a change in his policy—and it was due partly to pressure from the Papua New Guinean government and organisations like AID/WATCH—so that companies in aid recipient countries will now be able to bid for Australian aid contracts. This recent untying of aid to recipient countries should be commended, but the foreign minister has missed an opportunity to tackle the issue effectively. In regard to the aim of sustainable development, more needs to be done to ensure that recipient countries can get access to these aid contracts. We need to do things such as building capacity within the local countries to enable companies and NGOs to undertake the complex tendering process and to ensure they are able to carry out AusAID contracts.
The minister’s statement, as I said earlier, focuses on Australia’s involvement in security operations in the Solomons, PNG, the Philippines and Indonesia, as well as governance in general, and it presents this as an essential part of protecting Australia’s national interest. Yet the statement is weak on what measures Australia is taking to ensure poverty alleviation in the area. It contains no clear policy statement, no initiatives and no new thinking on how to ensure development aid does its most essential job—that is, reducing the number of people living in poverty.
The question then arises: are Australia’s new security commitments coming at the expense of robust poverty alleviation measures? Certainly, the OECD seems to think so. In the report mentioned by the minister, the Development Assistance Committee states that Australia is not doing enough to ensure poverty alleviation and is focusing too heavily on Australia’s national interest in its aid program by focusing on security and governance issues. The report talks about the need for—and I quote:
… a strengthened poverty focus ... Australian programming should give greater prominence to poverty reduction ... The relationship between poverty reduction and governance, security and the whole of government approach should be reflected in future policy statements and the poverty reduction focus should be followed through more consistently in implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
The minister’s statement makes little mention of the Millennium Development Goals or of how Australian aid programs contribute to meeting these goals. The OECD criticised the government on this point also, saying:
The MDGs are currently not used as an internationally agreed framework for the (Australian) programme within which development actions can be designed and monitored.
Instead of treating it as an either/or contest, the government should be boosting its emphasis and programming resources on poverty alleviation, in recognition that poverty and underdevelopment are major underlying causes of insecurity.
The minister’s statement holds up economic growth as the solution to poverty, but never asks the question: what sort of growth is required? Instead, it presumes that private sector led, export driven growth is the only option. Mechanisms for ensuring forms of growth and development that do more to address poverty alleviation are not seriously considered in the statement. Examples of such forms could include land reform, micro-credit, education for girls and community development programs—none of which are mentioned in the statement.
The statement also lacks any recognition that private sector led growth can make conditions worse for people in developing countries. For example, efforts to strengthen property rights for land in Papua New Guinea, where much land is communally owned, will have the likely effect of impoverishing subsistence farmers and forcing them off the land. Pressure for export earnings can put extra strain on scarce natural resources, leading to major problems of deforestation, as we see in Papua New Guinea.
The minister makes specific mention of a World Bank report on global agricultural trade to bolster his advocacy of full global agricultural trade liberalisation. But a more detailed reading of the World Bank report shows the opposite to be true. Page 123 of the report states, ‘Full food trade liberalisation would be of only marginal benefit to developing countries.’ It states a figure in the order of $10 billion to $12 billion. The report goes on to say, ‘Rather, the scenario most advantageous— (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-10,"—I welcome the ministerial statement on Australia’s aid program. I think it is a positive thing to have the details of Australia’s aid program presented in a self-contained way to parliament. It highlights an area that should be given more scrutiny and more support. It would be better if there were a stronger demonstration in the chamber from the government of their support and interest in this issue beyond the Minister for Foreign Affairs tabling a statement. Nonetheless, the information contained within it and the fact that it is tabled are positives.
Having said that, in lots of ways the statement is somewhat thin. The minister states that the government’s focus is ‘not on rhetoric but on action and results’. Yet this is a statement which, in many respects, is full of rhetoric. The minister goes on to say, ‘The government will back up our rhetoric on growth.’ The statement commences with a recognition of the generosity displayed by Australians in response to the tsunami crisis. I should note that, while the extent of the giving by Australians following the tsunami was truly inspiring, the personal contributions of Australians to overseas aid and development have risen by 12.5 per cent each year over the past five years. So it has not been a total surge of international assistance out of the blue. There is a wellspring of support amongst the Australian community for others who are in need around the world, including in our own region. I think we should recognise that fact more clearly and seek to build on it. It is for that reason that I also spoke yesterday in this chamber about the need to ensure that the aid and donations that are being provided for the tsunami victims across the entire Indian Ocean region are spent as wisely and effectively as possible so that the value of the contribution that the Australian community has made can be demonstrated and people can be encouraged to continue to increase their donations and support.
I was interested to note in the minister’s statement that ‘Australian aid personnel will stay in Aceh and other affected areas until we are satisfied their work is done’. I certainly hope that is the case. The Democrats will be monitoring the situation in Aceh carefully, as we have done for many years. The people of Aceh have for many years grappled with poverty and suffered gross violations of their human rights. It took a tragic event, such as the tsunami, for the Indonesian government to permit humanitarian organisations and the media into the region. We have to take the opportunity presented by that horrendous tragedy to ensure that some of those past problems do not become part of the future.
I was also interested to see that the government aims to help countries accelerate progress towards the millennium development goals. There has been very little evidence of this objective in previous aid budgets. A UN report last year indicated that progress in eliminating hunger and malnutrition has virtually ground to a halt. The UN had also documented evidence showing that at present more money flows from developing countries to developed countries than the other way around. In September 2000 all UN member states unanimously adopted the millennium declaration, which gave rise to the millennium development goals. The goals are a set of global objectives to be achieved by the year 2015, which is only 10 years away.
Within that time, among other things, the aim is to halve the number of people living in extreme poverty—by definition, on less than $1 a day—halve the number of people living with hunger, achieve universal access to primary education, reduce the mortality rate of children under five by two-thirds and halt the spread of AIDS within that time. Unfortunately, we are already falling well short of reaching those targets, based on the first almost five years since they were adopted. The minister’s statement acknowledges the conference coming up later this year and, as I say, notes the millennium development goals. I hope that does provide renewed commitment to them.
I acknowledge the statements that have been made. They have a lot of substance to them. One of the reasons why the amount of resources continues to drain out of the developing countries and into the richer countries in the world is not just debt but the flow of income and wealth due to the world economy. There is a lot of truth in the statements that there needs to be as much assistance and focus provided not just on development aid in the sense of grants but on increasing the opportunities for economic development through trade in particular.
The minister’s statement mentions providing secure and stable environments—that is, not just social environments, but the natural environment needs to be protected as well; improving governance and the investment climate, including property rights; opening up to trade; and helping the poor participate in such economic growth, through health, education and market access. The key issues that must be more clearly defined beyond what are generally nice-sounding statements that would be hard to disagree with are that it is the right sort of growth, the right sort of property rights and the right sort of trade—that is, fair trade and property rights that do not allow a few powerful people to grossly exploit the impoverished majority. That is a risk, and there are plenty of examples of how that has already happened.
The Democrats and I do not have a Hansonite approach to the world. We do not believe in putting up barriers to trade. But we believe that, in opening up trade, we need to make sure that it is fair, particularly to those in the most vulnerable positions. That is clearly the case with less developed countries. We have to make sure that, in pursuing this appropriate agenda of increasing the wealth of poor nations through economic development and trade, it is done in a way that genuinely enriches those countries rather than continuing to maintain the overall flow of wealth from the poor to the rich and in a way that does not allow a minority within those countries to exploit their fellow citizens. Certainly, they are valid concerns, whether you are talking about economic activity or ensuring that aid is provided effectively. That is partial support for the minister’s comments, but with a lot of caution thrown in. We need to see how those very broad concepts work in practice and how they are applied to ensure that they do generate greater wealth and a genuine meeting of the millennium development goals of helping those people currently without education and who have problems with child mortality, hunger and extreme poverty. It is not just a matter of stimulating growth; it is about ensuring that that growth operates in a way that is positive overall.
In conclusion, I would like to re-emphasise that, despite the welcome and repeatedly praised contribution—it was certainly praised by the Democrats and I—of this government to people of our region following the tsunami, we should try to ensure that that particular activity is used as a springboard for further expansion of assistance of all sorts to countries less fortunate than ours. It is not being purely altruistic, I might say; it is in our own interests to do so. I certainly hope to continue to push this government to further improve its efforts in that area.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2005-03-10,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The government’s response to parts 1 and 2 of the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which I chair, on the CLERP 9 bill, dealing with audit reform and corporate disclosure, is a bit like the curate’s egg: it is good in parts. The government accepted some of the recommendations from the committee and incorporated those amendments at the time the legislation was debated. Other recommendations are the direct responsibility of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and that has been noted by the government in its response. I will certainly ensure that the committee take up those recommendations with ASIC. The government has agreed also to consider other of our recommendations in the context of the current draft exposure of the corporations amendment bill, and I look forward to the government incorporating those recommendations in that particular legislation.
In the case of some of the recommendations which the government has rejected, I can certainly accept the government’s arguments for rejecting them. For others I believe there is probably a 50-50 case for the government’s reasons for rejecting those recommendations as opposed to the committee’s original reasons for making the recommendations. Certainly in these circumstances I am not unduly fussed by the government’s rejection of those recommendations. However, this still leaves a number of recommendations made by the committee but rejected by the government where I believe the government’s reasoning does not stand up to close scrutiny in the light of the evidence garnered by my committee and the consequent reasons for our recommendations.
These rejections have a bit of an ivory tower feel about them. For example, recommendation 11 in part 1 of our report related to the need for direct and specific rather than vague language in regulations regarding remuneration determination disclosure when those regulations are promulgated. For the life of me, I fail to understand why the government would reject such a recommendation. The government’s response refers to the requirements of the legislation, which is all well and good, but that still does not preclude the need for clear language.
The government’s rejection of recommendation 14 is also disappointing. As a general principle I believe it is not appropriate that executive directors be involved in determining their own remuneration. It is a clear conflict of interest. Determination of remuneration for executive directors should be the role of non-executive directors of a company to decide. I also disagree with the government’s rejection of our recommendation 15 in relation to equity based remuneration. Equity based remuneration has the capacity to dilute shareholders’ equity in a corporation. Therefore, I believe—as does the committee, because we made this recommendation—that shareholders should have a say in the provision of such schemes, whether those schemes relate to directors or executives.
With regard to part 2 of our report, I remain of the view that the CLERP 9 chief executive officer and chief financial officer sign-off requirements are excessively stringent and I am disappointed by the government’s rejection of our first recommendation in the second part of our report. Also, I note the government’s view regarding our recommendation on having a ‘true and fair view’ definition. Nevertheless, I believe that an appropriate definition is needed and should be achievable.
Recommendation 8, regarding the deletion of note 2 of subsection 227B(1) of the bill, was based directly on evidence from the AUASB itself and is particularly relevant in the light of Australia’s adoption of international accounting standards. The government should have accepted this recommendation. The government’s rejection of recommendation 9—that the Financial Reporting Council hold its meetings in public, with a proviso for closed meetings where sensitivity demands it—is also disappointing. I do not accept that this is a matter for the Financial Reporting Council itself to decide. Transparency is an important principle of good governance and should be mandated in this situation.
The government’s failure to accept our recommendation 10 for an independent secretariat for the Financial Reporting Council is also disappointing. The reasons provided are unconvincing. If anything, the projected heavy workload for the Financial Reporting Council reinforces the need for it to have its own secretariat independent of the Department of the Treasury. The government’s refusal to accept various of our recommendations to ease the requirements in the legislation regarding former auditors and auditor rotation is unrealistic. I certainly understand the government’s concern regarding issues related to the HIH collapse. However, I doubt that, had these particular provisions previously been in place, they would have prevented that disastrous event. The clear evidence before the committee was that the provisions are unduly onerous. In particular, I am concerned that the proposals will reduce competition among auditing firms and be especially detrimental to the audit practices of small and middle-tier firms.
In conclusion, therefore, I urge the government to reconsider its position on these particular recommendations which it has rejected. They were made on the basis of careful consideration of the evidence before the committee and of the likely real-world effects of the legislation. I believe they should have been accepted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,COMMITTEES,16,2
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-03-10,"—I rise to speak on the motion of Senator Chapman to take note of the government’s response to the committee’s report. Surprisingly, I agree with much of what Senator Chapman has to say in relation to the government’s response to the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. There were a great many recommendations made by this committee in the context of the CLERP 9 bill. By rough calculation, I think 40 of those recommendations have been rejected by the government, eight were accepted, a number were deferred or put on a ‘wait and see’ basis, and, as Senator Chapman has indicated, two have been included in the draft bill which has been put out for consultation.
We on this side of parliament are very concerned by the government’s failure to deal with many of the recommendations of the committee. We believe that these issues have been on the table for some time and the government’s failure to deal with them leaves significant gaps in the regulatory framework. Many of these recommendations were very sensible. Many of these recommendations were recommendations that Labor supported. There were some recommendations where we clearly had a different view, but we are surprised that the government has not even gone for the recommendations proposed by the committee which were, from Labor’s perspective, perhaps a softer option than the recommendations that Labor put up.
One of the areas of particular concern for us is the area of executive remuneration. I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Chapman’s views about some of the government’s thinking, as indicated in the response to this report—in particular, recommendations 10 and 11, which were directed at trying to improve disclosure of the link between executive remuneration and company performance. We are disappointed that that has not been taken up by this government. We find the government’s reasoning in relation to this to be quite obtuse as set out in the report. It seems to us that if it is the policy and legislative position that there should be an appropriate link between company performance and executive remuneration then surely the sorts of things which are referred to in recommendation 10, which recommends that ASIC release a guide about disclosure, and recommendation 11, which deals with the regulations associated with that disclosure of the link between company performance and remuneration, are appropriate. It is not good enough for the government to simply say, ‘We have a broad requirement for this in the legislation, and that is sufficient.’
What is perhaps one of the worst rejections contained in the government’s response to the report was also raised by Senator Chapman. That is the recommendation that, as a general principle, executive directors not be involved in determining their own remuneration. It is quite extraordinary that this government is defending the right of directors to set their own remuneration packages. That is clearly a conflict of interest. I note also that the committee report did in fact allow for an out. It said that, if there were reasonable grounds for a director to set their own remuneration or to be involved in determining their own remuneration, then the prohibition should be drafted so as not to extend to that person. The recommendation itself said that, unless it is not reasonable for you to do so, you should not be involved in setting your own remuneration. So there was an out.
What does the government’s failure to pick up this recommendation mean? Essentially, it means that this government stands for the right of an executive director to be involved in determining their own remuneration, even if there are not reasonable grounds for them to do so. That is what this government stands for: the right of an executive director to be involved in determining their own remuneration, even if there are not reasonable grounds for that to occur. It is an extraordinary position, and I concur wholeheartedly with the chair of this committee about the government’s reasoning on this issue.
It is unfortunate that, in the area of executive remuneration, the government has rejected a number of recommendations that essentially set control and a framework around executive remuneration. Another obvious example of that is recommendation 16, which went to a requirement that payments to directors on retirement or termination should be subject to shareholder resolution. That was not accepted by the government. What that means is, again, less accountability of directors to shareholders. It means that shareholders do not have a say in maximum annual cash payments and any retirement benefits or termination payouts of directors. That is a very unfortunate situation. It seems rather bizarre that the government has refused to put this in. I have read its response where it tries to justify the nonacceptance of this recommendation, and I fail to understand the reasoning behind it. It would seem very sensible to ensure that shareholder resolution on issues such as a termination payment should occur.
In Australia we have had, over some years, examples of inappropriate termination payments to directors. It was in part as a response to the sorts of payments received by George Trumball at AMP or Frank Cicutto at the NAB, which were $13.2 million and $14 million respectively, that the government in fact moved in CLERP 9 to deal with the issue of termination payments. Now the issue has gone politically quiet and we see the government backing away, refusing to deal with an issue that has policy importance, refusing to ensure that shareholders have some say and refusing to ensure that there is sufficient accountability by directors to their shareholders.
It is another example of the government talking up an issue but not actually doing very much about it. I recall the financial press quoting the Treasurer when the last reporting period finished, where the Treasurer was critical of some of the remuneration packages of executives of Australia’s listed companies. In this report we see that the government is simply refusing to accept recommendations for positive changes to the framework. It is refusing to ensure that the framework requires accountability and a bit of a check on executive excess and directors’ excess. That is what is required and that is what is missing in the government’s response.
In the time I have left I will very briefly refer to two other areas where Labor have some significant concerns about the government’s response. One is in relation to analysts’ independence. Recommendation 25 of the committee’s report dealt with the independence of analysts. Labor, in fact, recommended in our minority report what we consider to be a more stringent position than the committee’s recommendation. We are of the view that a hands-off and a self-regulatory approach in the area of analysts’ independence is inappropriate. This is important in terms of the integrity of the information received by the markets, and it is unfortunate the government is squibbing on this issue. The majority committee report, which, on the issue of analysts’ independence, again was not as stringent as where Labor cast itself, has not been accepted by the government. The government has said it thinks the financial services reform changes, including financial services licences, are sufficient regulation on this issue. We do not agree with that. We retain our concerns that the current regulatory framework, insofar as it relates to analysts’ independence, is inadequate.
My final point was mentioned briefly by Senator Chapman. It is in relation to the Financial Reporting Council and the 13 recommendations, I think it was, relating to the improvement of the functioning and transparency of the FRC. All of these were rejected or deferred, despite substantial feedback from industry and business, during the inquiry process, about the importance of reform in this area. In the context of our more recent inquiry into international financial reporting standards, the issue of the functioning of the FRC was again raised. It is very unfortunate from Labor’s perspective that some of the useful recommendations, which were contained both in the majority report and obviously in Labor’s minority report, to improve the transparency, the integrity and the functioning of the FRC have not been taken up by the government.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-03-10,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I rise today to speak on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report on the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2004 [2005]. There are very good reasons for this legislation, and that is why Labor has supported the general intent of this bill from day one. The bill is intended to fight crime. As a result of a world that has become increasingly interconnected, there has been a huge increase in the amount of people, money and goods crossing national borders over the last 50 years. Trade, investment and tourism have expanded in this country as a result of these changes. While traders, investors and tourists have not been slow to capitalise on more open arrangements, it is also true that criminals have not been slow either.
To combat this growing phenomenon of transnational crime, in 2000 the United Nations adopted a Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, which was supplemented by the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. Australia signed this UN convention in late 2000 and the convention entered into force generally in 2003. After a national interest analysis had been performed on the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Australia signed up to that as well in late 2002. The government has indicated its intention to ratify the protocol once legislation is in place to meet the protocol. Of course, before it can do that, it has to ensure that our laws against trafficking in persons meet the requirements of the protocol. That is what this bill is all about. It is aimed at meeting Australia’s obligations under the protocol.
However, the UN is not the sole promoter of the law in this regard. The second source of the law comes from antislavery legislation. It is worth taking a minute to reflect on the fact that it was 200 years ago this year, in 1805, that the British House of Commons passed the first antislavery bill. Although that bill was subsequently rejected, a similar bill was passed and adopted in 1807. Australia inherited its antislavery legislation from that source. In fact the current criminal provisions that exist in the Criminal Code date from as recently as 1999 and stem from a Law Reform Commission recommendation to replace the old imperial legislation with modern statutes. As a result of the 1999 legislation, there is already a regime in the Criminal Code that deals with trafficking in persons. But this bill will improve these measures and, if the government adopts the committee’s recommendations, we will have good law for the law enforcement agencies to use to fight against those who traffic in women and children.
I will talk briefly about some of the recommendations from the committee report. The committee has made 12 recommendations, all of which were supported unanimously. It is not my intention to go through each and every one of those today, but I would like to point out some of the key points One of the key findings of the committee is that the bill as it stands does not appear to be successful in meeting articles 3 and 5 of the UN protocol, which require the criminalisation of the conduct. That is more than a little disappointing given it is the whole reason for the bill. In any case the protocol has been assessed in the national interest analysis as being in the national interest, so it is clear we need to act in the national interest and ensure the bill does meet the protocol. That is exactly what the committee has sought to do in this process and the first way to do that, according to the recommendations, is to remove the reference to ‘consent’ from subsections 271.2(1) and 271.5(1).
I will not go to any of the detail within the bill because we can deal with that in the second reading debate. The committee found that the inclusion of the word ‘consent’ in these provisions is redundant. At the least it is counterproductive and at the worst it may have the potential to unnecessarily limit the scope of those offences. Moreover, the dependency of these provisions on consent is, in and of itself, inconsistent with the UN protocol. For this reason, the committee recommended the government remove ‘consent’ from that definition.
There is a second recommendation made by the committee that also concerns these two subsections in particular, and that is for the provisions to be dependent on exploitation, and for this to be included in the definition. It was only after careful consideration that the committee made this recommendation. My own original concern was that it was like the issue of consent I just mentioned: adding qualifications to the definition—in this case exploitation—tends to limit its application. Labor wanted to ensure that our Customs, Immigration and police officials have the legislative tools necessary to combat traffickers in person in every conceivable form. But it appears that general offences against people smugglers are already covered by the provisions that cover the trafficking of unauthorised arrivals under the Migration Act. So the general offence relating to smuggling or trafficking in persons is unlawful and already adequately covered in legislation. What is missing is exploitation-specific offences that relate to both lawful and unlawful entry. Further, the UN protocol specifically calls for the criminalisation of exploitative offences, not just general offences. The committee has made a recommendation to ensure the bill includes the element of a purpose of exploitation.
The third recommendation of the committee also relates to these two subsections and it recommends stating that these provisions apply to each of the means of trafficking listed in the definition of ‘trafficking in persons’ contained in article 3(a) of the UN protocol. This means things like the abuse of power or a position of vulnerability, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person and other forms of coercion should be included within it. It is a worthy end to include these meanings because we want to be sure the provisions have maximum applicability. Although there are several other recommendations that deal with the legislative specifics, I do not want to go to all of them, and will just leave it at those one or two that are cogent.
On the broader recommendations: the committee’s findings are that the Commonwealth’s consultative process was woeful. I want to give credit to the many organisations that were able to pick up that this consultative process was in place and assist the committee in its process. Particularly, I want to thank individuals like Kayte Fairfax from World Vision; Noor Blumer from Australian Women Lawyers; Kathleen Maltzahn from Project Respect; and Associate Professor Sheila Jeffreys from the Coalition Against Trafficking of Women and thank their organisations because they managed, in a very short space of time, to put together credible submissions and present them to the committee.
I want to extend my thanks to all the individuals and organisations involved in the committee process and thank those who took time to make submissions, because this is a serious issue and we need to get it right. I would also like to extend my thanks to fellow members of the committee, especially the chair, and also to the hardworking staff of the committee secretariat who had a tough job to make it all happen. Labor looks forward to the government’s response. I hope these recommendations are picked up by the government and placed within the bill.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2005-03-10,"—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I wish to present an oral report on the nomination of a new Commonwealth Auditor-General, pursuant to subsection 8A(7) of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951. Under Section 8A of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has a responsibility to approve or reject a proposed recommendation by the Prime Minister for the appointment to the office of Auditor-General. This is the first occasion on which the committee has exercised this important statutory obligation, it having been enacted during the tenure of the retiring Auditor-General, Mr Pat Barrett.
The Auditor-General is an independent officer of the parliament, and so it is both appropriate and important that the committee has the powers to scrutinise and, if it deems necessary, reject a nomination to this position. I am pleased to rise on this occasion to indicate to the Senate the committee’s unanimous approval of the appointment of Mr Ian McPhee as Auditor-General. The appointment has been approved this morning by the Executive Council.
Mr McPhee is a dedicated and highly competent person who brings a wealth of experience to the position. He was formerly a long-serving employee of the Australian National Audit Office, gaining experience at the highest levels of the organisation as Deputy Auditor-General from 1998 to 2003. He left the Audit Office to become a deputy secretary in the Department of Finance and Administration.
Mr McPhee expressed to the committee his view of the positive role of the Audit Office as a value adder. He recognises that the most effective way of achieving outcomes is through the provision of advice in a cooperative rather than an oppositional spirit. Auditors are not an enemy whose role it is to obstruct government agencies and departments. It is not the role of the Auditor-General and his staff merely to scrutinise and criticise government agencies for inefficiencies, but also to educate through the publication of better practice guides and other measures. However, the primary responsibility of the Audit Office is to ensure that government agencies and departments operate efficiently and effectively while meeting all the compliance standards that are required of publicly funded agencies. In this the Auditor-General and his staff must cooperate and operate without fear or favour, and Mr McPhee’s record is testament to his abilities in this regard.
The committee and the Audit Office are complementary instruments through which procedures in the expenditure of public funds are scrutinised and held accountable. Each organisation works best when they enjoy a close working relationship. We as a committee look forward to reinforcing and building upon the already strong lines of communication between the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, and the Audit Office during Mr McPhee’s stewardship. On behalf of the committee, I congratulate Mr McPhee on his appointment and express our complete confidence in his abilities to ensure that the Australian public gets value for its money.
Finally, I wish to acknowledge the achievements of the outgoing Auditor-General, Mr Pat Barrett AO, who has served as Commonwealth Auditor-General since May 1995. He could be said to have been the first truly independent Auditor-General. It was during Mr Barrett’s tenure that the Auditor-General Act 1997 was enacted following a 1996 report by the committee, marking a new era for the Australian National Audit Office. The act established the Auditor-General as an independent officer of the parliament, gave him much more autonomy over the budget of the Australian National Audit Office and gave him a mandate to audit all Commonwealth entities.
During Mr Barrett’s time the Audit Office has proven to be a vital instrument through which government agencies and departments have been accountable to the parliament. I wish him well for the future and I again congratulate Mr McPhee on his appointment to this important office. I have been asked by Democrats Senator Andrew Murray to state that he joins me in these comments.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-10,"—As I have said a few times, we have a large number of documents, particularly annual reports, that are tabled in this place which provide an enormous amount of valuable information and often we do not sufficiently acknowledge the significance of their content or of the policy matters that are contained within them. This document is the Housing Assistance Act 1996 annual report for 2002-03, so the data it contains is nearly two years old. The slow process of compiling these reports remains a matter of concern, but I understand why: this report contains data of the performance of all of the state governments as well as the federal government in the area of housing. As I noted earlier today in speaking about the meeting tomorrow between state and federal housing ministers to talk about the funding for the next round of the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program to deal with homelessness, housing policy is fundamental. I do not believe it gets anywhere near the priority it should at federal level—or indeed in political debate at state and territory level. Unless we get the housing issues right, our ability to get things right in all the other fundamental areas like employment, health and education is undermined.
We have to continually highlight the fact that government policies sometimes actively contribute to housing problems. In recent times we have had public debate about the deinstitutionalisation of people with mental illness and the fact that it has had the negative impact of greatly increased homelessness—which is not to say that we should not have had deinstitutionalisations, but it is to say that governments across the board were tempted to use that as an excuse to save money rather than putting in the resources necessary to provide housing for people with mental illness when they are in the community. That failure has flowed on to create further costs in other parts of the economy and other parts of the community. It is that failure at the housing level that has exacerbated many problems with, for example, mental illness.
I have raised questions about this a number of times over the years. Some of the more severe and inflexible aspects of our welfare policies, such as the breaching regime—which was a severe problem a few years ago—have made it extremely difficult for many people, particularly younger people, to keep a secure and regular roof over their heads. Other policies can contribute to failings in the area of housing and homelessness and I very much urge the federal and state governments, as I did earlier today, to make sure that they step up to the mark in meeting their responsibilities. Responsibilities at both state and federal level must be acknowledged. That is what this report is, in part, about.
I would like to focus particularly on my own state of Queensland, because the report does paint a concerning picture. It specifically notes that there has been a decline in the department’s traditional social housing responses. Overall stock numbers have declined, and increasing demand for housing was unable to be met—primarily due, according to this report, to CSHA grant reductions and increases in costs. Key trends over the previous four years include: a 5.5 per cent reduction in households assisted by public rental tenancies, which represents 3,158 households; an overall reduction of 750 public housing dwellings; and a 25 per cent increase in the public housing rental waiting list, to almost 30,000 applicants. At the same time increases in private rents have reduced housing affordability and choice for lower income earners. Again, that goes in part to taxation policies at both state and federal levels.
The continual finger-pointing that we see backwards and forwards between state and federal governments over expenditure on homelessness is simply escaping the point that we are failing at both levels on the fundamental aspect of housing. This report, I have noted briefly, shows that the government in my own state of Queensland are not doing as well as they should. They need to improve, and the federal government also needs to do more to put housing at the centre of the policy agenda across the nation.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-03-10,"—This is a useful opportunity for me to continue in the adjournment debate some remarks I was making with respect to the general business motion earlier today. I would like to continue to speak on that subject and to particularly focus on the issue of trade deficits. This government has been clocking up record trade deficits. There is no industry sector that more illustrates the fundamental neglect of industry policy and the opportunities that Australia has to manufacture and produce equipment than in the ICT or information and communication technology area.
The trade deficit in ICT alone, as Senator Cook so sharply pointed out, is almost the single biggest problem when it comes to how the trade deficit is created. In ICT alone we import some $20 billion worth of services and equipment. We export around $5 billion worth, mostly in services, leaving a trade deficit in that sector of some $15 billion. It is interesting to note that, at the start of the coalition’s period of government in 1996, it was Professor Ashley Goldsworthy who predicted the massive growth in the ICT trade deficit if neglect occurred in the area of industry development and IT policy. That prediction was made in 1996 as the movement among industry, scientists, researchers and academics grew around the government’s neglect and withdrawal of funding for those critical areas of research and development, commercialisation and industry development policies.
In 1996 the government were at great pains to say how ludicrous and irresponsible these projections were. Indeed, they made a great deal of noise about the fact that it could not possibly ever happen that way. Well, surprise, surprise—the trajectory for the trade deficit on ICT has followed almost precisely the predictions of Professor Goldsworthy in 1996. The Howard government have facilitated that trade deficit growth through their appalling handling of IT policy. As such a powerful symbol of the neglect of industry policy, the ICT trade deficit has occurred because this government has allowed opportunities to disappear. There were initiatives. We used to manufacture a reasonable proportion of ICT equipment, and we did this at a time when it was so clear that the demand for ICT equipment was going to grow dramatically. Remember that in 1996, leading into the technological revolution where computers were becoming ubiquitous in both homes and workplaces, it was predicted that if we did not maintain capability in the area of ICT equipment then that trade deficit would bloom and grow at a phenomenal rate.
But what did the Howard government do? Not only did they not take a stance on this or fight for the maintenance and support of an industry that was competitive and had an established basis in Australia; they also helped it walk out the door. One key element—I have spoken about this issue on many occasions in this place—was of course the poor procurement policies perpetrated by the Howard government. The policies in relation to IT—government is the single largest user of ICT equipment and services in Australia—meant that government agencies and departments were not encouraged but were forced to turn to the very large overseas suppliers at the expense of the multitude of small businesses in this country that made up a complex web of supplies of both equipment and services.
In an attempt to somehow fabricate a savings measure—I have to say ‘fabricate’ because the savings measure never materialised; this is the Howard government’s billion dollar ICT black hole—they managed to effectively push out the door one of the most crucial manufacturing sectors in Australia at the time, to the point where the trade deficit is now around $15 billion and our capability in ICT equipment is vastly diminished. If you add to that the reduction in research and development funding—particularly through the 1996-97 and 1998-99 financial years—and a very weak effort in paying lip service to that neglect through Backing Australia’s Ability and other policies in the year 2000, you see a government that have tried to cover the tracks of their neglect. But one of the strongest points to be made in this discussion about the economy is that they have not been able to cover their tracks at all because the gaps are starting to show.
It is in that sort of area of high-tech manufacturing that Australia is now so fundamentally weakened. We need to look no further than our manufacturing export figures to see them on the decline, particularly in the high-tech areas. One would be quite right to ask: ‘Why on earth in the late nineties, early 21st century, are they the only government, the only Western economy, not investing in research, development and commercialisation of high-tech products and services? Why are this government now relying on a hodgepodge of industry policies to try and paper over the gaps that they have left in this very important foundation of our economic future?’ The fact is that the Howard government do not care. The Howard government are happy to allow Australia to rely heavily on the resources sector at the expense of our manufacturing sector and our high-tech area in order to try and prop up the economy.
To sustain that growth we do need to be good at these things. We need to exploit one of Australia’s greatest strengths—our educated work force. We know from travelling around the world that other countries look to the Australian education system and they pay their respects to a system that has been nurtured by government after government—that is, until the Howard government. Under the Howard government we now see another fundamental crack in the foundation of a solid economy that can sustain ongoing growth, and that is in the skills of our people—the sorts of skills that we need to underpin, whether it is in the high-tech manufacturing area, our building trades or indeed the sort of sophisticated services industries that form the basis of so much of the growth that remains.
We now see a great shortage across the skills area. I take to task the earlier comments of Senator Fifield and other coalition senators who pretend that this is not a problem. They say it is a manifestation of a strong economy. How come the former Labor government had the wisdom to look forward and open up the Australian economy, hand-in-hand with strategies that would prepare the Australian economy for stronger global engagement? We invested in skills, education and training. We looked at the VET sector and said, ‘We have to do more to make sure that our citizens are able to take advantage of the sorts of opportunities that are going to come with greater exposure to the global economy.’
No such vision guided the Howard government as they exploited the ongoing economic growth that we have experienced over the last near decade or so. No such responsible action was taken by this government. Those foundations, and our capability to export high-tech equipment and services and to make sure that we had the educated work force necessary to take full advantage of those opportunities were completely neglected. Now we find ourselves playing catch-up all over the place and fundamentally weakened in the long term. It is very hard to predict now the nature of the skills shortage and how severely it will manifest itself. But it will ensure that Australia never achieves its full potential, which it would have if we had made the most of a period of reasonably steady economic growth. That potential and the possibilities because of it will never be known.
I will leave my comments there because I would like to spend the last few seconds of my adjournment speech time in mentioning an event that occurred in Parliament House earlier this week. That was the launch of a very important economic study into the disease multiple sclerosis and how it affects the lives of people. Senator Gary Humphries and I are both co-patrons of MS here in the ACT and we were very pleased to welcome to Parliament House, and hear the stories of, MS sufferers. I would like to conclude by urging my Senate colleagues to take the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the study of the economic impact of multiple sclerosis, which has been put together by Dr Rex Simmons of Canberra Hospital. He is the project manager of the MS life study, a national project designed to improve the lives of the more than 15,000 Australians with MS. (Time expired)
