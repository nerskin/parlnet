Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (09:32):  The wild rivers debate has been going on for some time now. I have already informed Senators Xenophon and Fielding and those opposite about our intentions with regard to the legislation today. The fund­amental aim of this legislation is to create some equity and consistency in the approach of the Queensland government with regard to the provision of conservation, particularly on Aboriginal land of all types. One of the most celebrated conservation outcomes in North Queensland has been the creation of quite large national parks under Premier Bligh. Many of those areas contain some particularly fantastic biodiversity and the creation of those parks was something to celebrate. Aboriginal people sat down for a very long time and discussed how they would conduct joint management of the parks.


It was similar to what happened with Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, where I come from. An agreement was reached for joint management of the park. The landowners, the Aboriginal people, would sit down as a board and have joint management of the park and Aboriginal people would be able to advise the park managers, who at that stage knew lots about conservation but little about cultural heritage or about the way that Aboriginal people interacted with their land. Then, at a later stage, as they became more confident, the Aboriginal people in the area gradually took a greater role in the bureaucracy and board. I think that Kakadu park is in fact emblematic of how it should be done.


Two examples in Queensland, in the area around Coen, are celebrated because of their now excellent conservation practices. The particular element to be excited about is not so much that it represents some of the greatest biodiversity in the world; it is the fact that Aboriginal people provided their consent. If you are creating a national park in Queensland and you are changing fund­amentally all of the ways of doing business, you need to understand that consent is absolutely fundamental to that process. Sadly, the wild rivers process in Queensland was approached differently by the Queensland government.


The region of Coen, after going through a very long process that took a couple of years, ended up with a celebrated result that protected biodiversity and ensured that all of those people involved had complete ownership of it. That deal involved joint management. All of the issues—including how many rangers were going to be involved, how the management process would work, how access would occur, how Aboriginal people would continue to conduct cultural activities, how they would interact with tourism and how they would grow in stature in terms of being able to manage the park—were resolved, setting the groundwork for the future.


This is, of course, in stark contrast to the Queensland wild rivers process. As a piece of legislation, wild rivers is not particularly different to any other conservation legis­lation, but the principles still apply. We believe it is an area of unique biodiversity and so we aim to apply protections that specifically protect that biodiversity. Wild rivers relates specifically to particular areas of biodiversity that have been identified. It is just like a national park. I commend the act in its treatment of most of the areas it covers in Queensland. I think that it is a good act and that some of the measures in it will be excellent. The reason that the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management Bill) 2011—my private member's bill—has been brought forward is that there is one stark difference between a national park in Queensland, which provides good conservation outcomes, and the Wild Rivers declaration in Queens­land, which also provides good environ­mental outcomes: one is provided with the consent and ownership of the owners of the land—the Aboriginal people of the land—and one is not. That is the only difference and, whilst it seems like a small difference, it is a very important difference, particularly to the people of Cape York.


One of the reasons the Wild Rivers legislation is of interest to the people of Cape York is that they are in fact the holders of land which, without argument, has some of the most wonderful and complex biodiversity in the world. That is why it remains a tourist attraction, and that is why the world's eyes are on places like Cape York—it is emble­matic of the remnant perfect biodiversity. It has been maintained in that state by the Aboriginal owners—the principal form of title there is native title—and the reason it is in that state is that the owners have had a connection with that country for so long. They are the reason that the biodiversity is so excellent; they are the reason that this country has been looked after so well. That is why a joint management agreement, which in a sense says, 'This is something that we can gather and this is something that we can ensure will be a fundamental building block of how we continue to look after the biodiversity,' would be so appropriate for Cape York.


Why would you ignore the single group of people who have protected this iconic biodiversity since time immemorial? In the national parks we do not; in the national parks in Queensland we have a system that completely acknowledges the role of the Aboriginal people who built those levels of protection. But, sadly, in the Wild Rivers declarations there is no such acknowledg­ment of their attachment to and association with the land. It should be no surprise and no wonder to anyone that the entire Aboriginal people of the cape apart from a very small handful—I have not met more than I can count on one hand—find the Queensland Wild Rivers legislation odious since their consent is not required. This is not conser­vation by consent, as it is with those very successful and celebrated national parks, but conservation by diktat—something you will have!—and I do not think that anyone in Australia is in any doubt that, given the circumstances, we should be supporting a change to the Wild Rivers legislation in Queensland that puts into effect the very same mechanisms that they have in, for example, national parks.


I have approached the Queensland government, as have many, because it is not the normal way for the Commonwealth to do business to intervene in a state. I can tell you that, coming from the Territory, I find it particularly odious that we should do so. But this is a circumstance that is so very important that we have made many calls on the Queensland government to change the Wild Rivers legislation. I ask myself: where is the mischief? Premier Bligh is a fine woman, and I am sure she means well.'




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Don't go over the top.




Senator SCULLION:
  But I am sure she means well because I have read her media reports about the celebrated deals that were done with the national park in Queensland. Isn't it fantastic that we have Aboriginal people on their land working side by side for conservation outcomes? I know Premier Bligh celebrates that, but neither she nor anyone else in Queensland has been able to answer me when I ask: 'Why is it that we would have this inconsistency? Why the difference in the Wild Rivers legislation, under which we simply make a declaration over that land and there is no consent required?' Instead, there is silence. Some as cynical as and more cynical than me would say, 'After all, the Premier is a politician.'




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  It's called Green preferences.




Senator SCULLION:
  We have heard about the Greens deals. Greens preferences are important.




Senator Brandis:
  It was at a West End coffee shop before the last Queensland election.




Senator SCULLION:
  It has been alleged that coffee was involved. Those of us who are a little bit cynical have accepted that there are special arrangements concerning the Wild Rivers legislation. But why would you have special arrangements? We already have arrangements in place that work: empowerment; working next to Aboriginal people who know how to look after the land because they looked after the land well before white people stood on this land. The only reason could be that they have simply done a deal.


We know about the Wilderness Society and those associated with it—they have produced some very good outcomes and are trying to protect the environment—but I think that we have lost touch with the balance. The balance for Premier Bligh was to say to the Greens: 'I need your pref­erences. What would you like in exchange?' Clearly, the exchange from Premier Bligh was, 'We'll go and have Wild Rivers.' The question would then have been, 'What is Wild Rivers going to do?' and Premier Bligh's answer would have been, 'It takes a little time to deliver national park-like mechanisms because we have to have the consent of people; we have to have people agree.' The response to that would have been, 'No, we can't have that in it.' So the legis­lation was passed with a lot of opposition—though not, obviously, with sufficient opp­osition—but without the inclusion of the notion of consent. The people of Cape York have not held this land for very long as a national park—in that sense it is still young land—yet this Wild Rivers legislation, only because of some grubby Greens preference, has a substantially different approach to how we go about a partnership approach for conservation to the approach found in other conservation legislation. It is still not too late, Premier Bligh; it is still up to you. You can change your own legislation to make it consistent with your approach to national parks. You can still do this. All the people I have spoken to across the cape wish to embrace the opportunities for conservation. They want to do that. We have got examples all over the place of that. But there should be that simple respect of saying that we will require the consent of Aboriginal people. That is exactly what the Wild Rivers (Envir­onmental Management) Bill 2011 would ensure. It is simply to ensure that Aboriginal people are fully involved, that we can get the full benefits of the wisdom of the Aborig­inals and that we get their consent—which is just about respect.


Those in the gallery and those in the chamber will recall that the President this morning rose and said that we would also like to acknowledge the Ngunawal and Nga­mberri people of the Canberra area. That is all about respecting the ownership of land. Sadly, in my view, the Queensland govern­ment, or elements of the Queensland govern­ment, have certainly been disrespectful in the way that they are treating Aboriginal people, who are the traditional owners of land and are owners of land in Queensland, in this matter.


That is the motive behind this bill. It is a very simple motive. Clearly, as I have indicated, I do not have the support today, because there are still some concerns with the bill. We will be speaking to a number of people to ensure that we have the amend­ments correctly, because this is such an important area of consideration. I under­stand, Senator Furner, that you had a great interest in this. Look into your heart to see whether there are other appropriate amend­ments or whether you can ring the premier yourself. If you want to do some real good for the people of Cape York—and I know you do, mate—you need to reach into your heart and do the business of ensuring that the Queensland government does the right thing.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,0,1
Senator FIELDING,FFP,2011-05-12,"



Senator FIELDING
 (Victoria—Leader and Whip of the Family First Party) (09:47):  I take this opportunity to speak to the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011 as a whole at this stage, as I did not speak during the second reading debate. The objective of this wild rivers bill is to circumvent the Queensland Wild Rivers Act 2005, which allows the Queensland minister to declare an area to be a wild rivers area. The effect of the Wild Rivers Act is to enable the Queensland government to make wild river declarations that limit the range of activities that may be carried out in a decl­ared area of land in order to preserve the natural value of that area. The bill before parliament today seeks to change the way in which a wild river declaration is made, tak­ing the power from the Queensland minister and putting it in the hands of other interest groups.


Since the debate on wild rivers last year I have had the chance to look at some of the wild river declared land firsthand. I have also listened to the lengthy debates from both sides of the argument and have considered the arguments through the inquiries. The more that you look at the issues, the more you realise that there are two valid and opposing arguments. Firstly, I think that some areas of this country do deserve to be protected. I am not in the camp of locking things up for the sake of it. But, equally, I am also not in the camp of bastardising the environment. Some areas of this country are special and ought to be declared as special areas in order to safeguard and preserve these areas. Under this bill, a wild river declaration can only take effect if it has the written consent of all the interested parties of the land. The practical result of this will make it extremely difficult for any wild river declarations to ever be made. This, I think, is a problem in itself.


This problem arises because of the def­inition of 'owner' in this bill. That definition of 'owner' means that a wide variety of people and groups may fall under the def­inition of owner for a particular area of land. For example, it includes people with native title interests, freehold interests, leasehold interests and other interests, too. This means that, in order for an area to be declared to be a wild river area, every one of these groups that falls under the definition of 'owner' needs to give their consent for a declaration to go ahead. To put it another way: it means that every single person or group that falls under the definition of 'owner' gets an auto­matic right of veto on a wild river dec­laration. As an example, even if eight parties affected by a wild river declaration agree to give their consent, the declaration can be nullified because of the opposition of just one party. This hardly sounds reasonable. What it really means is that the likelihood of ever getting an area to be declared as a protected or a preservation area is extremely slim. I have spoken to some members of parliament who support this bill because they do not believe in creating preservation areas and are happy to see nearly every part of the land developed. That is something that I do not agree with.


The second point I want to make is that there seems to be a lot of confusion within the communities that new development is not allowed in a declared area. This is simply not true. For example, the following types of development can still occur: tourism, eco­tourism, development of associated infra­structure, grazing and pastoral enterprises, residential and commercial developments, commercial fishing and fishing based tour­ism. However, I do recognise a real problem, and that is that people are put off from doing any development because they do not know how to wade through the entire permit app­roval process and because it looks way too hard. I believe that this is a real problem. Many people who do not have the resources to jump through all the hoops, the paperwork and the bureaucratic red tape end up missing out.


Particularly within many of the Aboriginal communities there are development plans that are never made because people within a declared wild river area do not feel that they have the resources, the money, the time, the administration or the know-how to overcome the hurdles standing in the way of the developments. This needs to change. Just like there is legal help for people who cannot afford legal representation, so too we need a type of free professional service to help people who want to do development in these areas but do not know how to navigate the approval process. This is something I have raised directly with the government and I am pleased that these concerns have been listened to. As a result, the government has promised to provide funding to establish a professional services resource that will help Indigenous Australians move forward with their plans for development in areas that have been declared wild river areas. 


The third point I want to make is that before a Queensland minister can make a wild rivers declaration there needs to be adequate consultation with the people aff­ected by any such declaration. In fact, if you are going to limit the range of activities that can be carried out on an area of land then you should have to ask the people who have a stake in the land what they think. It is clear from the inquiries into this bill that the level of consultation that has occurred thus far has been substandard in some areas. It is not enough for the Queensland government to pay lip-service to the consultation process. They need to actually sit down and speak with the people who use the land and take into account their legitimate concerns. There are plenty of people out there with very reasonable concerns and it is important that we listen to what they have to say. This is something that I have raised directly with the Queensland government and the federal government because it is a problem that needs to be addressed. I am pleased to say that the Queensland government will be establishing Indigenous reference groups to improve the consultation process. These Indigenous reference groups will provide information and recommendations to the minister on natural values, economic asp­irations and consultation processes. This information will need to be taken into consideration by the minister, along with other advice such as scientific advice, when defining the areas. These reference groups will provide legitimate and representative input to the Queensland minister. It will give parties a greater voice in the decision-making process of any declared areas.


Finally, this wild rivers issue is very difficult. I am sure that both sides of politics would agree about the tremendous difficulty in balancing environmental interests with those of landowners and development inter­ests. After considering all of the information, and given that the federal government has agreed to fund a professional services resour­ce to assist people with getting an application for permit approved, and given that the Queensland government will establish Indig­enous reference groups to ensure proper consultation, I will not be supporting this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,0,1
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-05-12,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (09:54):  I rise to contribute to this debate in committee. I commend the contributions that have been made thus far this morning by the opposition, Senator Scullion and particularly Senator Fielding. As a Queensland senator, I have intimate involvement in this area and I know there are other Queenslanders, like Senator McLucas and Senator Moore, who have travelled to the cape on many occasions and who understand the Indigenous issues—in particular in this matter concerning the environment. However, the bill in its current form is deeply flawed. If you go through the bill clause by clause, you will clearly identify the flaws in the bill. 


When it comes to economic development, we heard during the last inquiry into this bill through the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, only a few weeks ago, of the confusion, the lack of understanding and, on many occasions, the contributions by the Queensland government to the applications that have been presented in terms of economic development up in the cape. I know that there are people in this chamber who have possibly not travelled to that area, and I would suggest that most Australians have not travelled to the cape at all to get an appreciation of the situation up there. But I think people need to understand that it is a remote area. On most occasions you need to fly into Cairns and then fly into Weipa. During the wet season, which has just completed—an extended wet season, in fact—they get their food in via barge from Normanton, and there are various ways of getting their stock and requirements into that area. People need to understand that it is not just a simple matter of saying, 'This is an area that can be developed,' or that it can be considered for development in any shape or form. That is not the issue. The soil is poor; hardly anything can be grown in that area. However, those opposite run the argument about the Queensland government locking it up. Nothing has been locked up. In fact, I think Senator Fielding made the relevant point—and he is quite right; he has taken an interest in this—that things are not locked up in the cape.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You should ask the Indigenous people!




Senator FURNER:
  I have spoken to the Indigenous people, Senator Macdonald. I do not know whether you have. I know you fly in and out of places, but when you get on the ground and are involved in the wild river itself, and when you speak to Indigenous owners about what the issues are, those are the times and the opportunities when you get an opinion expressed about what the issues are.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I do more driving in Northern Australia than you ever will, you donkey!




Senator McLucas:
  Madam Temporary Chairman, I would request withdrawal of that comment.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Hurley
) (09:58):  Senator Macdonald, I did not hear the reference. Do you wish to withdraw?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Just to assist you, Madam Temporary Chairman, I did call him a donkey, which is what he is, but I withdraw it.




Senator FURNER:
  You'd only expect that from a Neanderthal. When you examine what this bill does, it claims to lock up the cape. In fact, grazing, fishing, tourism, camping, hunting and gathering continue unaffected. I have seen that myself up in the cape. I have seen Indigenous traditional owners working the cape—




Senator Boswell:
  You are a donkey!




Senator FURNER:
  And you are a ratbag and a fool.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Order! There is starting to be discussion across the chamber. Senator Furner, would you continue with your remarks and other senators cease to interject.




Senator FURNER:
  There are other matters that are able to be considered. Things like Indigenous cultural activities, ceremonies, harvesting of bush food, medicines and the enjoyment of native title are permitted and unaffected. Outstation development can continue. Recreational boat users can continue to use the rivers and creeks. Mining, grazing and irrigation cont­inue today without the declaration of wild rivers areas. Regarding new developments up in the cape, over 100 applications that have been submitted and we are working through those. 


The evidence out there does not suggest that the wild rivers scheme has blocked development on the cape; to the contrary, the scheme has led to successful Indigenous ranger programs. Real jobs have been creat­ed in terms of rangers in that area, jobs which could be lost if this amendment has its passage through this chamber. In fact, the amendment, interestingly, goes to a part­icular matter in terms of—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I think he has lost Anna's speech.




Senator Heffernan:
  I will give you the facts in about three seconds.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Order! There is too much conversation around the chamber.



Senator Boswell interjecting—



Senator Heffernan interjecting—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Order! Senator Boswell and Senator Heffernan, there is too much conversation and I cannot hear Senator Furner. I ask that Senator Furner be allowed to continue when there is silence.



Senator Boswell interjecting—




Senator FURNER:
  Geez, you're a knucklehead. The changes to clause 4 in this amendment indicate that wild rivers rangers jobs will be lost and the Australian govern­ment must somehow replace those jobs. This is a matter that I have never seen in any bill whatsoever; a situation where a state piece of legislation relies upon a federal piece of legislation to assume and pick up the loss of any jobs. In fact, in inquiry, the questions were asked: what are these jobs we are talking about; are they rangers' jobs; are they jobs of people involved in development in the cape? This issue and proposal was clearly a matter of confusion during the inquiry. So it is really difficult to know whether this clause was intended to confer an entitlement or not in regard to compensation of the loss of a job.


A number of other questions—which can­not be answered—were also raised by this clause: what kind of work is being promised? If you lose your employment as a ranger—if that is what the bill intends—what is the sort of work that is going to be applied in terms of the loss of that employment as a ranger? Where will the work be? Will rangers be employed in the cape? Will they be relocated to other parts of the state or somewhere else within the nation? These are the issues that have been raised and considered during the inquiry stage, in the legal and constitutional committee and also in the House of Repre­sentatives economics committee when it was before them. 


Additionally, it is unclear what the pay and conditions would be, because currently employment is under Queensland statute and no doubt would be under a specific award. No-one is of a view or has an understanding of what their entitlements would be beyond that, given that they are currently employed under state legislation. 


Additionally, it will be a question of who will be required to employ these people, because the bill implies or suggests that the federal government should pick up the employment or the protection of these employees, should the bill result in their un­employment. These are the issues associated with clause 4: the constitutional basis and the objective of the bill. The potential for that to lead to lengthy litigation under this bill is very real. 


So, when it comes to this fallacy portrayed by those opposite of wanting to protect Indigenous rights, wanting to have some involvement in native title, I think people need to put it in the right context. We need to remind ourselves who opposed the Native Title Act, when a Labor government intro­duced it. It was those opposite who opposed that act, so it is not a case of them going round the cape indicating they are there representing Indigenous rights and wanting to be at the forefront of protection of their lands and their entitlements. I am sure Senator Heffernan would have been there and would remember that they opposed the Native Title Act, so do not come into this chamber saying that you are here to protect Indigenous rights for Queenslanders, let alone for Australians, because you were in opposition on that particular bill.




Senator Heffernan:
  Madam Temporary Chair, I have a point of order: what this is all about is saying to the Indigenous people in Northern Australia, which is half the size—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Come to your point of order, Senator Heffernan.




Senator Heffernan:
  The point of order is that we are expecting that the great opportunity in life for Indigenous people up there will be to get their photo taken with a spear.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Heffernan, there is no point of order.




Senator FURNER:
  Once, again, unlike the coalition, the Australian Labor Party is a party of reform and wholeheartedly supports Indigenous Australians' rights and fosters and encourages Indigenous economic development. This is evident once again in the implementation of the Native Title Act in 1993. We are not disingenuous, unlike the opposition who make out that they are there to protect the rights of Indigenous people. We will continue our involvement as we have done in a variety of different circumstances—




Senator Heffernan:
  Madam Temporary Chair, I rise on a point of order. He should withdraw the remark that we are not here in the best interests of Indigenous people. I am!



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  There is no point of order, Senator Heffernan.




Senator FURNER:
  I didn't say that. You're very precious.




Senator Heffernan:
  Don't put crap on me!




Senator Sherry:
  Madam Temporary Chair, I rise on a point of order. Senator Heffernan should withdraw that comment unreservedly.




Senator Heffernan:
  No-one should put crap on me.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Have you completed your point of order, Senator Sherry?




Senator Sherry:
  I had not finished my point of order. The statement that Senator Heffernan just made in a disorderly way again reinforces my point of order. He should withdraw his comment.




Senator Heffernan:
 No-one should put sewage on me.




Senator Sherry:
  It was not related to sewage either, Senator Heffernan. Madam Temporary Chair, I ask you to require him to withdraw unreservedly.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Madam Temporary Chair, on the point of order: the debate is free-flowing. Twice now the Labor Party have interrupted it with precious points of order whilst at the same time—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  And what is your point of order, Senator Macdonald?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  the speaker before you was using terms like 'knucklehead', but nobody interrupted the debate and stopped him. I ask you to let the debate flow. If you are going to stop that sort of name-calling, I suggest you start with the speaker who has the call.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  I was endeavouring to listen to the speaker so I did not hear the interjections across the chamber. Senator Heffernan, do you wish to withdraw?




Senator Heffernan:
  No, I do not wish to withdraw, because I have been accused of not acting in the best interests of Indigenous people. I have been up there and I know what this is all about. This is an outrage. I have been up there and seen the child abuse that occurs. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Heffernan, you are continuing to debate at this stage.




Senator Heffernan:
  There are 7,500 Indigenous kids in the Northern Territory who still do not have a high school to go to, for God's sake.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  I take it that you are refusing to withdraw?




Senator Heffernan:
 No-one should pretend that I am not on the side of the Indigenous.




Senator FURNER:
  I will go back to my point. We should not forget where we stand on Indigenous rights as a Labor government. Let us not forget the apology delivered on 13 February 2008 by Kevin Rudd, the then Prime Minister. For many years those opposite spoke about how ill treated all Indigenous Australians were. They had 11½ years to deliver an apology but failed in that regard. They were not willing to deliver such an apology. It was pushed under the rug. After years of silence it was time to end the denial and to acknowledge the ill treatment received by Indigenous Australians. That is what we did on 13 February 2008 and that is what we are about.


I have had several opportunities to visit one of those pristine rivers—the Wenlock River—that have been declared under the Queensland legislation. It is a river that needs to be protected. On a number of occasions I have been up there to visit the Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve on the banks of the Wenlock River. The previous govern­ment under John Howard gave that piece of land to the Irwins and here we have the hypocrisy of reversing that position. I wonder what John Howard would do in this debate. He gave that piece of land on the Wenlock River to a conservationist. He understood the significance of it. Those opposite want to overturn it to allow strip mining, destroying the beautiful rivers.


I am sure some of you might have an opportunity to look at some of these pristine rivers. They are beautiful pieces of nature. On my first visit I was shown by Australia Zoo ranger Barry Lyon eight springs on the reserve which are located on a bauxite plateau. These springs are of great ecological value. In fact, they are a source of water for wildlife during the dry season. Bauxite does not absorb the water; instead, it acts as a giant sponge and releases the water during the dry. Research has been conducted in this area by QUT and other researchers. They have found an abundance of wildlife that relies on the existence of these beautiful springs. In 2008 a survey found 151 different vertebrate species, including 75 birds, 26 reptiles, 16 native amphibians, eight native mammals and 16 freshwater fish.


The Queensland government passed the Queensland wild rivers legislation to protect certain areas of the cape. However, the opposition want to portray that they are somehow protecting native title rights. That is not the case. We know what the agenda is here. They just want to reverse it so some of the mining companies can strip mine areas of unique significance. If you destroy these rivers, you will never get a chance to reverse that. Madam Temporary Chairman Hurley, I am sure you understand what happened to the Murray. We do not want to see that on the cape in Queensland. We want to make sure the rivers are protected and Indigenous people have a right to do the things they currently do on their lands. We do not want to hear this fallacy about locking it up continued, because that is not the case. They are free to do their traditional hunting and everything else on the land as they have done for years and years. That will continue under this arrangement. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,0,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-05-12,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:13):  I would like to make a few comments about the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011 and about the opposition's amendments that I believe deal with a number of the concerns that have been raised with me about how consent will be achieved, because that is a key issue here. I want to deal with some of the concerns of Senator Fielding that were also raised by Senator Furner. Let us put this in perspective. In the absence of a wild river declaration these pieces of legislation apply to the land in Cape York and areas that could be subject to wild river declarations: the Coastal Protection and Management Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Fisheries Act, the Forestry Act, the Fossicking Act, the Land Protection (Pest and. Stock Route Management) Act, the Mineral Resources Act, the Nature Conservation Act, the State Development and Public Works Organis­ation Act, the Sustainable Planning Act, the Transport Infrastructure Act, the Vegetation Management Act and the Water Act. There are currently 13 pieces of legislation in place that provide safeguards for the environment. The fundamental flaw is that there is a lack of consultation and consent with the Indig­enous owners of the land. That is what I find objectionable about the Queensland legisla­tion.


It is rare in this place for senators to be asked to decide between a perfect outcome and a disastrous one. Typically the decisions we are asked to make come down to deciding which way forward will bring about the better outcome—not a perfect outcome, but a better outcome. I want to refer specifically to clause 6 of the bill, because we are in committee, and the way it addresses the issue of consent. There has been a lot said in this debate, and I believe the coalition's bill has been unfairly characterised in some quarters. Let us be clear what this bill does and does not do: it does not prevent the Queensland government from making wild river declarations; it simply requires the Queensland government to seek consent from traditional owners of that land before it makes a declaration. You just have to ask first.


The government has argued that other members of society do not have this right of consent and that if a government wanted to build a freeway where my house is it could compulsorily acquire my land. This is a spurious argument for a number of reasons. Firstly, if the government wants my land to build that freeway, they take over my land. With wild rivers declarations the land is not taken over, but the government does tell you what you can and cannot do with your land. Moreover, if the government wants that freeway, they have to pay me just compensation for that land. With wild rivers there is no compensation, you just lose your rights.


The government has said that traditional owners can seek exemptions from a declaration, arguing that more than 100 have already been granted. It is something that my friend and colleague Senator Fielding referred to. But as Balkanu CEO Terry Piper has pointed out, nine of those were for one fence. And as Noel Pearson has also pointed out, the vast majority of those permits have been granted to either mining companies or state government departments. Surely this supports the argument by Indigenous groups that the application process is so complex you need the resources of a mining company or a government to go through it.


There is another issue here. Senator Fielding made the point: let us help people navigate through the wild rivers declarations. I say this, understanding that Senator Fielding is absolutely genuine in his concerns: but you are asking people to navigate where there are so many obstacles, where the boat you are given in the first place is so leaky by virtue of these wild river declarations, it is setting up impossible obstacles for these communities.


In January this year I travelled to Cape York Peninsula where I met with both supporters and opponents of the coalition's bill, and I must say wherever I went—and I travelled freely and consulted widely—I met a lot more supporters than opponents. One of the supporters was Bruce Martin from Aurukun, who I met again last night. He is one of the new generation of Indigenous leaders. He is articulate, he is smart, he is passionate about the possibility for real economic development. He wants to do something about the horrendous unemployment rates in his communities—70 per cent, 80 per cent unemployment rates. We all do.




Senator McLucas:
  Everybody does.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator McLucas says, 'Everybody does,' and I agree with that. There is no issue about the genuineness of both sides of the house wanting to deal with the shocking rates of unemployment and disadvantage in those communities. Incidentally, former senator Brian Harradine danced with members of the Aurukun community here in front of Parliament House over native title.


Bruce and his community have big plans for Aurukun, and they have mapped a path forward. Bruce says they want to look after country. They also want to get young people back to country to strengthen and maintain culture. They want to create training and employment and they want to do this by utilising the one asset they have—their land—to be able to provide for their families.


Bruce and almost all of the Indigenous people I have spoken to on this issue argue that the wild rivers legislation is an impediment to achieving this. For example, the Aurukun people are exploring the option of a cattle destocking project that would manage the 10,000 to 15,000 head of feral cattle and 5,000 wild brumbies that are currently destroying the environment up there. Over three years they want to remove 95 per cent of feral animals from key cultural and environmental areas, creating jobs and restoring their country, and providing food for their community. But plans like this, which has the support of backers like philanthropist Paul Bendat, are threatened by wild rivers declarations. Yes, the Aurukun people can attempt to seek an exemption, but there is no guarantee that they can get it. And they can argue the costs involved make it beyond their reach.


Bruce said something else that has hit home about the Wild Rivers Act. He said to me that the Queensland wild rivers legislation, like native title more broadly, only entitles him and his community 'to be native'. He went on to say:


It is now the 21st century. We need the outside world to stop viewing us as the 'noble savage'. What we are trying to do now is to keep our culture strong, stay committed to the traditions and beliefs of our ancestors and to look after country and utilise our land, but with all the benefits of modernity. Old and new in partnership.


I believe we need to be careful that our laws do not stand in the way of these fine aspirations.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:19):  Might I begin by complimenting Senator Xenophon on a fine, thoughtful and idealistic speech. On 3 April 2009, the minister for Indigenous affairs, Jenny Macklin, announced that the Labor government had decided that Australia would become a signatory to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and that has since happened. In her speech making that announcement on 3 April 2009, Ms Macklin described the declaration as a 'landmark document', both 'historic and aspirational', by which, as she said:


We show our faith in a new era of relations between states and Indigenous peoples grounded in good faith, goodwill and mutual respect.


Fine words.


Article 26 (2) of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to which the Gillard government has subscribed, provides—just listen to this, Senator Fielding, please:


Indigenous peoples have the right to own, use, develop and control the lands, territories and resources that they possess by reason of traditional ownership or other traditional occupation or use, as well as those which they have otherwise acquired.


So the Labor government and the minister for Indigenous affairs, Ms Macklin, have patted themselves on the back for subscribing to this declaration, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which contains that guarantee, the guarantee in article 26 that Indigenous people have the right to own, use, develop and control their traditional lands. By a crowning irony, on the very day that Ms Macklin made that speech, a thousand miles to the north, in Brisbane, the Bligh Labor government gazetted three major river systems in Cape York—the Archer, Lockhart and Stewart Rivers, their catchments, tributaries and floodplains—under the Queensland Wild Rivers Act 2005. The effect of the gazettal by the Queensland government on 3 April 2009 was to make it impossible for the Indigenous people—the traditional owners, the people whom we acknowledge and pay respect to every morning as this chamber convenes—to use, develop or control those traditional lands. How remarkable—the high-toned sentiments of Minister Macklin in Canberra and the reality of a cynical state Labor machine in Brisbane on the very same day saying one thing and doing another. There could not be a more stark example of the rule that the Labor Party says one thing but does the opposite. And what the Queensland Labor government did on this occasion was a peculiarly wicked thing to do. It destroyed the economic livelihood of the traditional owners of the cape. And it is to reverse this wicked decision that Senator Scullion's private senator's bill has been brought to the chamber.


I do not profess to be a specialist in this area, so do not take it from me, let us hear what the Aboriginal leaders have to say about the effect of the Queensland Wild Rivers legislation. Marcia Langton, Profes­sor of Indigenous Studies at the University of Melbourne, described the gazettal of the Lockhart, Archer and Stewart Rivers—I hope you are listening to this, Senator Fielding—as 'a terminal threat to the eco­nomic future of the local Aboriginal people'. So please, Senator Furner, do not cond­escendingly tell us about the wildlife; let us talk about the human life, let us talk about the Aboriginal people, whom the Labor Party, with all its pious rhetoric, claims to champion, yet in reality stabs a knife through their heart with this legislation. Marcia Langton says this is a terminal threat to the economic future of the local Aboriginal people.


Even Mr Tom Calma, this government's own Aboriginal Social Justice Commiss­ioner, said he had 'serious concerns about the effect of the gazettals on the exercise and enjoyment of Indigenous people's human rights—in particular, those concerning cultural and economic develop­ment rights to their lands, waters and natural resources'. Noel Pearson said that the effect of the gazettal was 'to foreclose on the future for our people'. He said 'the state'—the state Labor government, that is—'cannot rip the future out from under Indigenous children's feet'. The Young Australian of the Year, Tania Major, a very impressive young woman with whom I shared a panel on Q&A two years ago, spent that program pleading with Anna Bligh, who was also a co-panelist that night, to understand the effect on local Aboriginal people, their livelihood and their economic future, of the Queensland wild rivers legislation. But Tania Major's pleas fell on deaf ears, just as Noel Pearson's pleas, Tom Calma's pleas, Marcia Langton's pleas and Bruce Martin's pleas have done.


Do you know what is peculiarly wicked about the Queensland Wild Rivers Act? As anybody who lives in Brisbane knows, it was the result of a backroom deal in a West End coffee shop just before the 2009 Queensland state election, which the Labor Party managed to win, managed to pull out of the fire, on the back of Greens preferences. And what happened in that deal was that the Labor Party powerbrokers in Brisbane, who are no better than the Labor Party power­brokers of Sussex Street or Carlton or any of the other unattractive Labor Party power­brokers across the country, sat down with the Greens in the inner-city suburb of West End in Brisbane and traded the future of the Cape York Aboriginal and Indigenous people for Green preferences. They made a present of the future of those people in order to appeal to the conceits and vanities of inner-city Green voters in Brisbane. It is as simple as that, and everybody in Brisbane knows it.


So please let us not have from Senator Furner and, I anticipate, from Senator McLucas, who I expect will be speaking shortly, pieties about how concerned the Labor Party is about Indigenous people when they come to this chamber to oppose a bill which will reinstate the rights which this very Labor government subscribed to an international instrument in order to secure—the right, as I quoted before from article 26 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to own, use, develop and control the lands, territories and resources that they possess by reason of traditional ownership. How can you do it, Senator McLucas? How can you, because I know that you do care about social justice? I know that you are troubled by this. I know that the unattractive goons—or to use Mr Rudd's word, 'thugsters'—who control the Queensland branch of the Labor Party are hardly friends of yours. So I know you are troubled by this. But how can you in good conscience come into this chamber and oppose a bill that would restore the traditional rights of the Indigenous people of the Cape York Peninsula.




Senator McLucas:
  You are a lawyer, George.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Yes, Senator McLucas, I am a lawyer and I am very proud to be a lawyer. It is a very timely interjection, because I thought I might conclude the last few minutes of my speech by talking about the constitutional basis of this bill. Because there is no doubt at all that Senator Scullion's bill is soundly consti­tutionally based under at least—




Senator McLucas:
  It is an opinion.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Yes, it is an opinion and it happens to be correct—and you will not find a serious lawyer who will disagree with me. Let me explain it to you, Senator McLucas. Under section 51(xxvi) of the Commonwealth Constitution, the Common­wealth parliament can make laws for:


The people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws.


It is the so-called race power.




Senator McLucas:
  How long would that take to go through the High Court?




Senator BRANDIS:
  How would it go at the High Court? The argument that I am propounding would win without a shadow of a doubt, Senator McLucas. So while Senator Scullion's bill is supported by the race power in section 51(xxvi) it is also supported, as any piece of legislation in this parliament these days that relies on an international instrument, by the external affairs power—section 51(xxix) of the Commonwealth Constitution.


We have had this argument, Senator McLucas. Let me refer you to the Tasmanian dams case and volume 158 of the Commonwealth Law Reports, which I just happen to have with me, in which the High Court in 1983 upheld the Commonwealth Law in relation to the Gordon below Franklin Dam on the basis of the United Nations convention on world cultural and national heritage. So we have a clearly established precedent in the High Court in the Tasmanian dams case and in subsequent cases that environment legislation based on an international treaty is within the legislative competence of this parliament under the power conferred by section 51(xxix)—the external affairs power. 


But this case, Senator McLucas, is even clearer than the Tasmanian dams case. It is clearer for two reasons: first of all, because the jurisprudence has moved on since 1983. In all the years since the High Court's construction, the breadth or the ambit of the external affairs power has expanded; it has not diminished. So if the Tasmanian dams case was good authority for the use of the external affairs power to support environmental legislation in 1983, then it is certainly the case in 2011 that the Common­wealth parliament has the power. 


But it is even clearer in this case for a second reason, Senator McLucas—and let me finish where I began—because it was your government that acceded to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indig­enous Peoples. So under the external affairs power Senator Scullion's bill is doubly supported. It is supported by the World Heritage convention, because it is a bill in relation to the protection of the environment, but it is also a bill, plainly, for the protection of the rights of the Indigenous people and it gives effect to what your government subscribed to but your Labor Party collea­gues in Queensland, in order to buy Green votes, walked away from, and that is the right in Article 26 of that international convention of indigenous peoples to:


... Have the right to own, use, develop and control the lands, territories and resources that they possess by reason of traditional ownership ...


If you believe that, you would vote for this bill, and by your conduct in opposing this bill you really show what you stand for.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers) (10:35):  It is with great sadness that I rise in this chamber today to contribute to what I think is a divisive and hurtful argument. In 1996 I had the honour of being a member of the Cape York Regional Advis­ory Group, an organisation that was established to work with Indigenous pe­ople—with landowners, with the graziers of the cape and with the environmental groups of Cape York Peninsula. That started in 1996. That produced a document called the Cape York Peninsula land use strategy. It had three objectives: to promote the econ­omic values of Cape York; to improve the social outcomes for people who live on Cape York Peninsula; and to protect the environment of Cape York Peninsula. It was a fine document. It is a document that everyone who worked on that document was extremely proud of—and it has gone nowhere. It has gone nowhere and the people of Cape York are the victims of what happens in chambers like this, what happens around the place when people do not consider the outcomes of what people want on Cape York Peninsula, when politicians get involved in what people really want. What do people really want in Cape York? They want jobs, they want an economic outcome, they want a social outcome, they want to have control over their lands. What is happening here today does nothing to change that objective. In fact, what this bill does is increase the complexity and delay the outcome even more. I think every speaker in this argument today—this discussion in the committee stage today—has talked about complexity. Of course it is complex to deal with the issues that we deal with on a day-to-day basis in Cape York Peninsula, but this bill does nothing to improve those outcomes. In my view, it in fact puts us back.


I do go to the comments of Senator Brandis. Senator Brandis talked a lot about the law. Can I suggest that we will end up talking in courts and in places outside Cape York Peninsula for a very long time if this piece of legislation is progressed, because there will be debate about the consti­tutionality of this legislation, about whether or not it can affect the Queensland legislation and about whether or not it does improve outcomes for people who live on Cape York Peninsula. Why is it that we want to play with the lives of people who live on Cape York over and over?


There were fine words from Senator Scullion in talking about aspirations. I agree with most of what you said, Senator Scullion, except that your way of getting there should not be through a flimsy piece of legislation that in my view is about division. This is not about pulling people together. This is not about finding a way forward. The wild rivers legislation, we all know, had some very difficult consultation beginnings. We know that. That is a fact. Queensland knows that it could have done a better job of consulting with people. It has remedied that, and I acknowledge the work of Senator Fielding in ensuring that that process has been improved. But we know we have to work with people on the ground. This will provide division. Rivers traverse large numbers of traditionally owned lands. You know that, Senator Scullion, and you know that this will divide traditional owners and pit them against one another. This will pit traditional owners against one another. This is not about bringing groups of people together; this is division, and this will mean that we entrench that division that has been delivered by this discussion already.


We have talked about the different points of view that are held by people on Cape York, and there are totally different points of view. But that is why we have to get down to some facts. I think that the whole wild rivers debate has been characterised by a lot of conjecture. It is about argument making and, in many cases, it can be described as being hyperbole.




Senator Brandis:
  'Hyperbowl', according to the Prime Minister.




Senator McLUCAS:
  According to Senator McGauran also, as I remember. But all of that characterisation has resulted in division: division on the cape, division in here and division among groups of people who, I believe, honestly and truly want better things for the people of Cape York. But this will not do it. This will provide us with more time in the courts, I am sure. This will provide us with a delay in any development that is going to occur. This will delay those aspirations that we came to in the mid-nineties about economic development, social development and environmental protection that were agreed. That has been delayed, and I will put the blame on the former Howard government. Forty million dollars was allocated in the 1996 budget. How much was spent? Very, very little. No money was brought for land buyback—or very little money. Less than $1 million was allocated out of that $40 million; $17 million was meant to be spent on buyback, and less than a million was spent on buyback during the 12 years of the Howard government. That delay was politically inspired, and now we have another delaying tactic—another thing that is going to put back the aspirations of Indigenous people yet again.


I note the comments from Senator Scullion about federal intervention and how he feels uncomfortable about that. I would too if I were a senator from a territory having experienced it. I also note the very strongly made comments from Senator Brandis that he was quite sure that this would pass through a High Court decision.




Senator Brandis:
  Not a shadow of a doubt.




Senator McLUCAS:
  'Not a shadow of a doubt,' he says. I would suggest that that is an opinion. I am not a lawyer. It is an opinion, and there will be others with different opinions. That is the nature of the law. Senator Brandis nods in agreement, because that, I think, is true.


Senator Scullion talked a lot about joint management of national parks. We all agree, but what does this bill do about joint management of national parks? Nothing. It does not do anything about joint manage­ment of national parks. We are doing it. I will make the point that I think Queensland has been slower than it could have been in developing joint management arrangements on Cape York Peninsula. I would have loved to see the Shelburne Bay joint management arrangements put in place before Tapich passed away. We want to progress on joint management arrangements, but this does not do anything to progress that. You know that, Senator Scullion. What this does is put obstacles in the way of finding agreement among various traditional owner groups around national parks.


I take the point that Senator Xenophon made about resourcing of appropriate processes, but in saying so can I say that to this point in time there have been no applications not approved, and the number of applications sits around 100. I take Senator Xenophon's point that it is a reasonably complex process. There is an organisation, though, that is resourced to support people to make applications and progress economic aspirations. It is funded to do that. It has been funded for a long time to do that. It is called Balkanu Cape York Development Corporation. That is the organisation that is meant to be supporting people to make application through any process.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You've seen what Balkanu say about the process, haven't you?




Senator McLUCAS:
  Yes, that is my point, Senator Macdonald. We have an organisation that is funded to support Aboriginal people to achieve their economic aspirations, and what is it doing? It is running a campaign against wild rivers. So, if you are an Aboriginal person and you want to go and get some support to do whatever economic activity you want to do, are you going to turn up at Balkanu's door? I do not think so. It is running a political campaign.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Why?




Senator McLUCAS:
  I would suggest clearly for political reasons and you guys know that, and your laughter acknowledges that. If you are an Aboriginal person, are you going to go to Balkanu? I don't think so.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You are so condescending to Aboriginal people.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Troeth
):  Order! Senator McLucas, has the floor.




Senator McLUCAS:
  I am pleased that we have some extra money that will support people to make applications through a complex process. There are technical pro­blems with this bill and I want to go through them. The bill's proposal that the consent of Indigenous landowners is required for the making of a wild rivers declaration it totally unworkable. It is unworkable for a whole range of reasons. As I said earlier, rivers traverse various traditional owner lands. This bill will ensure—




Senator Scullion:
  So do national parks.




Senator McLUCAS:
  Exactly. National parks do. We can pull those groups together, but if you are going to say—




Senator Scullion:
  How do you get agreement there?




Senator McLUCAS:
  The outcome will be that we won't ever have any protection.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Order! Senator McLucas, I would advise you not to respond to provocation.




Senator McLUCAS:
  I thank you for that advice. I am saying that it is totally unworkable. The process cannot apply to other landholders whose agreement is required, like leaseholders. There are other landholders who have an interest in what a wild river declaration might look like and what conditions might apply to that wild river. We have Indigenous native title holders, there are leaseholders and in some cases there are some freeholders, who need to be included in a discussion about the aspirations that can be agreed to.


Under the Native Title Act, you are ensuring that we will spend a lot of time holding meetings and having discussions about things that will have no economic outcome for people who are the traditional owners of that land. The bill does not cater for the circumstance in which Indigenous people agree about whether a wild river declaration should apply or not. This is a way to ensure that we have division on Cape York.


I want to end by talking about the aspirations of people who live on Cape York. They do not want to argue. They do not want to be turning up all the time. I note the comment from Richie Ah Mat from the Cape York Land Council when he appeared at the Senate inquiry. He is sick of turning up at Senate committee inquiries and he would like people to get on with it. Let's do that. Let's allow people of Cape York to get on—




Senator Scullion:
  He supports this legislation; that is what he means.




Senator McLUCAS:
  He is sick and tired of turning up at Senate inquiries, I can tell you that.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  He wants you to pass it.




Senator McLUCAS:
  Can I tell you, if we pass this legislation, he will be turning up to inquiry after inquiry as we deal with the flow-ons and the outcomes of this legislation. People in Cape York do want economic outcomes. We know this from Murrandoo Yanner, who gave evidence to the last inquiry, about the economic outcomes he has achieved: five full-time, permanent jobs that are active out there on land, managing the rivers in the gulf area. These are jobs that were not there before but are there now for the long term, jobs that people have been crying out for for a really long time and—as Senator Macdonald indicated—jobs that we will be providing through our budget, and I am very, very proud of that.


This piece of legislation will provide no jobs. It will delay the provision of jobs for a long time. It will pit Aboriginal people against Aboriginal people, instead of pulling people together in the way that you describe, Senator Scullion, where you pull people together to talk about a national park and then some economic outcome that may come out of that. This will not do that. Queensland have made the commitment to progress with more rangers and we have seen that with the rivers in the gulf.




Senator Boswell:
  That is a government job.




Senator McLUCAS:
  Aboriginal people, Senator Boswell, have been talking about being able to manage their land with some rights—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Why don't you let them?




Senator McLUCAS:
  We are.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You are stopping them.




Senator McLUCAS:
  With the wild rivers legislation there is a commitment to have ranger jobs associated with it. Those ranger jobs are the jobs that people in Cape York have been asking for for a very long time. Yes, they want to have traditional ownership as a first step then they want to have the right to manage that land, and the way to do it is through ranger jobs then to have the economic outcome as well. I honestly hope this legislation will never pass.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,0,1
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2011-05-12,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (10:50):  I came to the intent of this par­ticular bill in about 1985-86 when millions of hectares were given to Aboriginal people under DOGIT, deed of grant in trust. That land was supposed to be allocated to the communities under the Local Government Act and anyone who wanted some land to do something would be allocated that land, whether it was 20 acres to grow tomatoes, land for a cattle station or a sawmill, or whatever it was, and that land was allocated to those particular Aboriginal people and then they made their own decisions. That was around 1985-87. I had a bit to do with it. As people would know, I was close to the Premier at the time. In fact, I went around some of these communities with Bob Katter and the Premier. We worked together to give this land to them for what they wanted to do with it. Then that land was taken away from the local communities and put under an act. Aboriginal people walked down George Street, protesting that the Labor government had taken their land away and calling for Bob Katter to come back as the minister. That was the start of it. Now we come to the Wild Rivers Act. This merely is an act that would allow people to be involved in their own communities to make a living out of the land. Not all of it but a lot of it was given under the deed of grant in trust.


So that is the history of this. Then the Labor government tried to come in over the top of a previous government and take that land away. Not only that, what they intended to do and were literally caught in the act doing was to keep that land and put it into World Heritage. It was only Warren Truss who got up in the other House and demanded of the Aboriginal minister at the time that the minister not do it unless they had the consent of the Aboriginal people. Two or three weeks ago, the then minister said, 'I've pushed the pause button and we won't go ahead with it, because we do not have the consent of the Aboriginal people.' That is the main game. That is the commitment to the Wilderness Society that this eventually would be turned into wild rivers. Wild rivers would be the first step, and then it would go into World Heritage. When the minister made his commitment that he would pause, the Wilderness Society said, 'We'll still campaign for this.'


Senator Furner got up and did not know what he was saying—and you should forgive those who do not understand these things, but I would have expected better from Senator McLucas. 'What is there to be ar­guing about,' Senator Furner says. 'You can hunt. You can shoot a pig. You can have your traditional dances. You can go out in the river. You can do all the things that native title gives you.' And that is right. You can do all those things. No-one is arguing that. But we want to go the next step. We want to say to the Aboriginal community and the Pearsons of the world: 'You have got a right to live in the 21st century. You have got a right to go out there and put a farm down that will grow vegetables and then sell those vegetables in the local community.' You cannot do that. You can grow veget­ables, sure. You can grow for your own use, but you cannot commercially put down a farm in what you would call a catchment area.


The Bligh government initially talked about how the impact would only be on a handful of pristine rivers. It turns out that they actually meant to see entire river catchments and basins and, in fact, 80 per cent of Cape York would be subject to yet another layer of regulations, effectively frustrating opportunities for Indigenous people. It captures 80 per cent of the land so you cannot do anything other than have an obscure native title right where you can hunt, fish and have ceremonies. It does not allow any way that you can commercially use that land to provide fruit, vegetables and healthy things in life; go out and have a cattle farm; or go out and do something that will be productive and commercial. Therefore, you are locking these thousands of people—there are 14,000 people who live on the cape—out of any commercial event. You are locking them out of lifting themselves out of poverty.


It is a terrible shame that the Labor Party are doing this. Because Senator Xenophon in his excellent speech quoted another traditional owner, I will quote Senator Pearson—Mr Pearson. One day he might be a senator—and what a wonderful addition he would be to this house.




The exercise of traditional rights and traditional activities is important but that will never lift our people out of poverty and misery. We have to be able to undertake land use that generates economic return for the people who live there. We are not going to be serious about closing the gap as to Indigenous disadvantage if we have this view that all that Aboriginal people should be happy with and all that they should be entitled to is to stand on one leg in the sunset picking berries. Fundamentally this is a racist expectation on the part of governments and other stakeholders to expect Aboriginal people to live in some frozen past.



There is someone who is speaking up for the Aboriginal community. Sure, he does not speak for every one of them; but he speaks for most of them. I would say he speaks for 90 per cent of them.




Senator Siewert:
  No he doesn't!




Senator BOSWELL:
  Yes, he does. And I have been up there many times. Balkanu, Pearson—those people speak for most of the people who want to lift themselves out of poverty, who want to lift their kids out of poverty. They do not want to be condemned to an everlasting life of social welfare, and that is what you are condemning them to: an everlasting life of social welfare where they and their kids will never be able to have a job and all that entails. Senator Brandis made a comment about the United Nations. He spoke very well—and so he should; he is a QC. But he put it very succinctly. He said that the Prime Minister at the time signed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. And what has the present Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, said? Commenting on the Closing the gap report, she called on the Indigenous people:




… to take a job when you find one; to create a safe environment; to send your kids to school, pay your rent, save up for a home; to respect good social norms and to respect the law; and to reach out to other Australians.



But in Cape York the Labor government is shutting down avenues for jobs and reaching out for Greens preferences on wild rivers.


What have the Aboriginals of Cape York received from this government? Sure, it signed the United Nations treaty. They were told to get a job. And we did have a 'welcome to country' put in this parliament, which no-one objects to—but that does not pay the rent. That does not give anyone a job. That does not lift people out of poverty. So what they got is tokenism—beads and mirrors. That is what this government has given the Aboriginal community: beads and mirrors. Nothing that says, 'Your kids can get a job.' Your kids cannot get a job; there are no jobs up there. And there will not be jobs up there unless you let the Aboriginals use the land that was given to them by previous state governments and that you have taken away.


Isn't it ironic that a party that has always been painted by the Labor Party as being against Aboriginals gave them millions of acres of land and put the first Aboriginal member of parliament into state parliament? I have been out campaigning with at least two—it was two or three—other Indigenous candidates when I tried to get them into parliament. It is ironic that the Labor Party that claim to be the friends and natural allies of the Indigenous people are stealing their land off them, and for Greens preferences. Senator Furner says, 'Hang on a minute, they can develop anything they like and there have been 113 developments applications,' and Senator McLucas says, 'Of course, if they want an application it will be passed.'


Let me just say that out of the 113 development applications 79 were for exploration permits. Of the 35 remaining 'development approvals', 17 were issued to government entities for activities such as fencing and gravel extraction; eight riverine protection permits and one environmentally related activity permit appears to relate to the Century Mine project, which is an existing development; three riverine protection permits are for the Stanbroke Pastoral Co., possibly for a fence; two vegetation clearing applications, for the Strathmore and Barr Creek holding, are presumably for clearing for a fence; and one approval was for Adels Grove camping park, which is an existing development. There have been none appr­oved. Yes, you can hide, you can run, you can misrepresent people, but they are the facts.


We heard—and you were there, Senator McLucas, in Cairns—when one particular community, I just forget which one, said that after the wild rivers declaration they cannot actually get their gravel out of a pit and they have to drive 20 or 30 miles there and back. They cannot even take gravel out of a gravel pit for the roads around the Aboriginal community. That is what you have done to these people.


Senator Fielding will be leaving this place in three or four weeks time and I want to give him this message. Senator, you have come in on a church vote; let me give you this message. What does it profit a man if he gets something but loses his soul? Take that with you when you leave this place.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,0,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:04):  Any fair-minded, independent Australian who heard the speeches of Senator Scullion, Senator Xenophon and Senator Brandis could not help but agree on the importance of this bill, the Wild Rivers (Environmental Manage­ment) Bill 2011, and the necessity for this parliament to pass it. I again appeal to Senator Fielding, whose vote will be crucial to the future of Indigenous people not just in Cape York but right throughout Australia, to reconsider his stance to date on this bill. I ask Senator Fielding to consider seriously the things that Senator Xenophon raised, the issues that Senator Brandis raised and the comments of both Senator Scullion and Senator Boswell. This bill will unlock opportunities for Indigenous people.


I have to say about the Labor Party—and I am careful not to say this about indi­viduals—that it seems to me that the actions of the Labor Party across the board show that the Labor Party want to keep Indigenous people on welfare forever. Why they would want to do that I cannot possibly understand, but all of their approaches to Indigenous people treat Indigenous people as second-rate citizens, as people who are incapable of looking after themselves. That is what the Labor Party does, whereas those of us on this side have a completely different view. Indigenous people are as good as, if not better than, those of us in this chamber, for example. They have the same rights as we have. They have the right to look after their own land and property and to deal with it. I challenge Senator McLucas and Senator Fielding: if a government was going to do something with their house, with their property, wouldn't you want to have a say in it? Wouldn't you think it is your right to say to a government, 'This is my land; I want a say in how this is dealt with'? Of course Senator McLucas would. She would be the first on her feet screaming and yelling if a government tried to do to her house and land what the Queensland state Labor government is doing to Indigenous people with the wild rivers legislation. I think it was Senator Fielding—it might have been Senator Furner—who said to get approval you need the consent of the owner. Welcome to Australia! What a strange thought that you should not ask the owner of the land what it is all about. I think it was Senator Furner who said you need to get the consent of 11 different groups of people. 


Let me go through the bill and point out these 11 different groups of people. It means, for Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Act, grantees of Aboriginal land under that act. That is the first lot whose approval has to be sought. There are Aboriginal people who have rights under that act. How unsurprising is that? Owner means, for land where native title exists, native title holders. Again, it is not unsurprising that they should have a say. It means, for a lease under the Aborigines and Torres Straight Islanders (Land Holding) Act, the lessee. Under that act, some Indigenous people have got land as a lessee. This requires them to be consulted and their approval sought. How unsurprising that? It means, in relation to a deed of grant in trust which Senator Boswell spoke about under the Land Act granted for the benefit of Aboriginal people, the grantee. So they have been given land and the Labor Party are saying you should not ask them or seek their approval if you are going to lock up their land.


The definition of owner goes on to be defined in relation to a reserve under the Land Act for a community purpose which includes Aboriginal purposes the trustees of the reserve. They have been given a reserve for Indigenous purposes, and this bill requires their approval too. What is so wrong with that?


For freehold land or land held in trust for an Aboriginal person or an Aboriginal corporation under the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act, owner means the registered proprietor of that land. Again, land is given to someone and this bill requires their consent. What is wrong with that? Senator McLucas would want to give her consent if it were her land being taken, but she does not afford the same right to Indigenous people.


For completeness, owner also includes, for a term lease or a perpetual lease under the Land Act held by or in trust for an Aboriginal person or an Aboriginal corporation under the Corporations Act, the lessee. Again, Indigenous people having been given that right should have the right of veto, quite correctly. Finally, for the Aurukun Shire lease, under the Local Government (Aboriginal Lands) Act, of course, the Aurukun Shire Council have to consent. Why wouldn't they?


I again challenge Senator McLucas and Senator Fielding: if you were going to do to their house and land what this bill does, wouldn't they demand a right of veto? They would want it but they do not want to give that same right to Indigenous people. I repeat that it seems to me that the Labor Party, for whatever purpose, want to keep Indigenous people on welfare forever, whereas we on this side want to support Indigenous people's right to be Australian and to have the same opportunity as every other Australian.


I repeat, for Senator Fielding's benefit particularly, the scene that Senator Brandis described as to why this legislation came into being. I would like to hear from Senator Brown on this and see if he challenges it. It is a well-known fact that this legislation on wild rivers by the Queensland Labor government came into play in a dirty deal done in a West End cafe by the then Queensland Premier with the Wilderness Society. The Labor government desperately needed Greens preferences, so to get them they sold out Aboriginal rights. They sold out the Aboriginal people just to get preferences from the Greens political party at that particular state election. That is the only reason this legislation came into being. I would like Senator Brown to deny that.


Senator Xenophon quite clearly pointed out that, if you want to preserve and look after the biodiversity and environment of any of these lands, there are 12 or 13 other pieces of state and federal legislation that can do exactly that. But they do it in a way and by a process that does respect the rights of the owners, in this case the Indigenous owners. This bill adds nothing to that. For all of Senator Furner's speech that he read from, for all his words, he did not want to address the fact that any protection that might be needed for this very special land can already be given under other pieces of legislation. I ask Senator Fielding: why introduce this new piece of legislation when all of those protections are there?


I briefly descend to the level of Senator Furner when he cast aspersions on those of us on this side who have the real interests of Indigenous people at heart. For Senator Furner—a Johnny-come-lately to this place—to suggest that I and others fly in and fly out to these areas is very offensive. I have spent my life since I have been in parliament driving on the road in remote parts of Queensland. He seems to think that because he has done it once—and I suspect he flew in and flew out anyhow—he is something special. I say this because he will not say it himself, but our leader, Tony Abbott, has actually made a practice of going and living in Indigenous communities and has done for some years. I know he has done it in Cape York. I found out by mistake almost, because when he goes there, unlike the Prime Minister, he does not take a team of media people with him; he goes and does some work and understands the Indigenous people, particularly the Indigenous people in Cape York. That is where this bill in this parliament, the Scullion bill, actually originated, from Tony Abbott's deep understanding of and involvement with Indigenous people, something that the Prime Minister and most of those on the Labor side would never understand.


Time is going to run out. I know Senator Heffernan also wants to say a few words on this bill. I want to point out what a witness, Balkanu, said in evidence to a Senate committee about the impact of a declared wild river:




…a community vegetable garden within a High Preservation Area is only permissible if it does not involve clearing vegetation. It is difficult to imagine circumstances on Cape York where a community vegetable garden could be established without some clearing of vegetation.



They went on to say:




High Preservation Areas have in almost all declarations been declared to the maximum of 1km either side of the declared wild river and its major tributaries—with no scientific justification.



Obviously, as they go on to say:




The best soils for community gardens are within th
is
 area.



Last week I was in the Gulf Country of Queensland. Of course, this does not just apply to Cape York; this has been extended now into the Gulf rivers and extended down into the Lake Eyre Basin. If it has not gone to Lake Eyre yet it is on the way, by the Queensland government, because there is an election coming up and the Queensland government again need the preferences of the Greens political party. What has the Queensland government got to sell? They have sold almost everything else in Queensland. They do not have much to give the Greens political party for their preferences anymore, so they agreed to take in the Lake Eyre rivers.


Having been in the Gulf Country last week, I can tell you people up there are petrified for all of their development plans, their proposals for their communities and their people—Indigenous and otherwise—people who want to make a living for themselves and who want to be taken off welfare. They are petrified that additional rivers in the Gulf Country are going to be declared because there is an election coming up and the Labor Party under Anna Bligh desperately needs Greens political party preferences again.




Senator Boswell:
  I don't think that will even save it this time.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Perhaps it will not even save it, but the Labor Party in Queensland are pretty desperate. That is why Senator McLucas and Senator Furner, two Queensland senators, are here in this chamber trying to knock off this bill so that the preference deal in Queensland can go through. I highlight again that this is all about Greens preferences. It does nothing for protection of the land that could not be done by other pieces of state and federal legislation. As Senator Xenophon rightly pointed out, those of us who have been to the cape and the Gulf Country with open eyes, without a preconceived position, can feel, see and count that most Indigenous people are totally opposed to the Queensland wild rivers legislation as it exists. They want to have some say in their own land. This bill gives them that say, and I think any genuine legislator—anyone in this chamber who has the real interests of Indigenous people at heart—should support this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,0,1
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (11:18):  I want to give a non-legal perspective to what this is about. You will probably use my qualifications as a farmer, a worn-out wool classer and a welder. This is about the disenfranchising of the aspirations of the Indigenous community. There is no question that the Indigenous community of Australia has been treated disgracefully. I went to a community as the Chairman of the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskf­orce and talked to a grandmother in that community in which whitefella social habits have completely destroyed the com­munity to the point where this lady was looking after a girl who had to be surgically put back together after being pack raped at 20 months. Senator Furner, do not ever tell me I do not care about Indigenous people. He can refer to my maiden speech, the first time I stood up in this parliament. All Australians should hang their heads in shame for the treatment that Indigenous people have been given.


To give you an idea of what this is all about: in the Northern Territory, where the Indigenous people learn from what is going on around them, 45 per cent of the Northern Territory has Indigenous ownership, for which they get no benefit generally—Mistake Creek and one or two places are an exception—I met a whitefella who was bragging to me, as chairman of the northern taskforce, that he had 17,000 cattle on this blackfella country, as we call it. Blackfellas do not mind me calling them blackfellas because we are mates; I am a whitefella. I said, 'Oh yeah, what are they getting out of it?' He said, ""Mate, I give them $10,000 twice a year to get on the piss.' I felt like smacking him in the bloody head—that is the treatment we hand out. This is about the aspirations for our most precious resource, like our bloody jackeroos and jillaroos, our Indigenous people are the foundation of Australia and we are saying to them, 'No, mate, you can never own your own home and write out a will and pass your home to your kids. No, we can't do that.' So we have this ridiculous proposition.


Let me put it into a global context. By 2050 with nine billion people on the planet—we need to see this in the broadest scope and then bring it down to the area of which we are talking—barring a catastrophe of some sort, 50 per cent of the world's population poor for water, 30 per cent of the productive land of Asia having gone out of production, two-thirds of the world's population living there, the food task doubling and possibly 1.6 billion people on the planet displaced—that is by 2050. By 2070, unless there is a catastrophe, approximately 12 billion people. A place like China will have to feed half its population from someone else's resources by 2050 if India does not wake up to itself because they have not so far, China has and it is trying to engineer a solution to the North China Plain. There are 57 rivers that flow into Bangladesh and 54 of those rivers flow in from India which mines next to the groundwater which becomes the river water. There are 160 million people in Bangladesh who are going to have to move as part of the 1.6 billion displaced. They live in an area half the size of Cape York Peninsula.


Cape York Peninsula is 17½ million hectares—please note I am not reading a speech—which is the same size as Victoria. If you take out the coastal towns, the 800,000 to a million feral pigs, the 30,000, approximately, wild cattle not tagged and the 14 to 17 pastoral stations, there are approximately 14,000 people. Bangladesh has 160 million people in half that area. The UN are not going to be able to sort this. Australia has to listen to Mother Nature. Mother Nature is saying—all science has vagaries; all human endeavour has failures—and if the science is half right in what it is saying we have a serious global food task problem. Science says that it is going to dry up in the south and I will not go through that. It says that the weather is going to move in an anticlockwise direction and there are going to be opportunities in the north.


Senator Macdonald and I went to Georgetown. As he said, this Wild Rivers stuff is going to be a cancer that spreads. It was pegged out in 1957 for irrigation but that has never been done. To put this into proper context I am going to fine it down. When I was chairman of the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce we took evidence in Cairns and the chairman of the Cape York Peninsula Land Council came in. I said to him, 'Mate, where do you live?' and he told me. I said, 'How big's the joint you're on—an ex-pastoral station?' He said, 'Mate, I don't know but its 90 kilometres from the mailbox to the house.' I said, 'What do you do there?' He said, 'Oh, we catch a few wild cattle.' I said, 'What' s the house like?' He said, 'The white ants have eaten it.' 'What are the fences like?' 'They've all fallen down.' It is because this is sit-down country.


This is not a fair go for our Indigenous people. So what do we do then? I actually chaired the Traveston Dam inquiry—get the facts of this. I negotiated with Peter Beattie, who was the then premier, to allow the public servants to come and give evidence to the Traveston Dam inquiry, which I chaired. I had a good relationship with Peter Beattie, who is now out of the game. He knew that I knew that the Traveston Dam proposal was a politically driven imperative because, under an arrangement made by Beattie and Goss, they sold the right dam site. Of course, eventually, we said it was a shit of a site, a shocking site, sorry.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Troeth
) (11:25):  Order! Senator Heffernan.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  I withdraw that sewage bit. I said to him, 'Peter, we're not going to savage your public servants; we're not going to play politics with people's livelihoods.' This proposition of wild rivers and the remedy to overcome that is playing politics with people's livelihoods. When I raised wild rivers with him Peter Beattie told me to my face: 'Bill, I had to do a deal to get the inner-city Brisbane preferences with the Wilderness Society and that is why we have done it. Eventually it will be turned into a World Heritage area.'


With the latest science it is an absolute insult to the human race with respect to the global food task to think that ownership of this country cannot be given as a commercial advantage to our Indigenous people. This is a disgrace. Unlike a lot of people in this place I have been and camped on the Cape York Peninsula and I understand the country. There are marvellous opportunities from some of those rivers within the first kilom­etre. They are as good as the Murrumbidgee River or the Liverpool Plains. Sure, there is a wet season and there is a dry season and we learnt the hard way from Humpty Doo that, if you go about it the wrong way, you end up with a mess on your hands. But to say to Indigenous people, 'We're not going to let you have a commercial agricultural adv­antage,' when they are going to be closest to the biggest market—two thirds of the world's population is going to live on their doorstep. You cannot tell me that the UN is going to sort out the people of Bangladesh or the 260 million people, up to 400 million people by 2070, who live on the great northern plain in China and who will have to be moved if they do not engineer a water solution. The UN is the world's largest most corrupt bureau­cracy—it does some good work but it is corrupt like most governments in Asia. Here we are today saying the Indigenous opport­unity in Cape York Peninsula ought to be tourism. Get your photo taken with a blackfella and a spear, what sort of crap is that?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (11:28):  Order! Senator Heffernan.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  What sort of rubbish is that? I cannot believe that Senator Fielding does not get this. 




Senator Siewert:
  Oh, he does.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  I do not believe he gets it. What we are saying is that we have the power as whitefellas to overpower the aspirations of the original owners of this country. These people simply want an economic opportunity. We are absolutely closing our eyes to what Mother Nature is saying about the planet. You can absolutely learn from the mistakes of the past in doing mosaic development of the north—absolutely learn from the past.


One of the greatest disgraces in the recent past is the overallocation of the Culgoa River. The Culgoa River, the Condamine-Balonne, has a mean annual flow of 1,237 gigalitres. We have allowed whitefellas without any environmental study to build 1,500 gigalitres of on-farm, off-river storage in a system that has an 830 per cent variable flow where from 1921 to 2009, 25 percent of the flow was in four years. We have allowed that to be developed to the point where those four years are every year. This is crazy. We can learn from the mistakes of the past but we can successfully allow the Indigenous people on Cape York Peninsula an economic opportunity. What is wrong with whitefellas? How cheap do we have to be to allow politics in this? Let someone deny that Peter Beattie made an arrangement with the Wilderness Society—he told it to my face—to get inner city preferences and set about a serious 100-year disadvantage by denying the greatest opportunity for our Indigenous people. If the science on the planet is right, northern Australia is going to provide an enormous opportunity in the future to participate in the global food task.


Sure, science has to take place and GM cropping has to take place, but guess who owns the bulk of the land up there, by one title or another? Our Indigenous people. We had a retort here from the Greens a second ago, 'Oh no, you're wrong, Bill'. That is all right if you are plaiting your armpits, smoking pot and living in Darling Point or somewhere. This is about reality and I am afraid that we are denying the aspirations of our Indigenous people.


To learn from the past we went over to 'We of the Never Never' at Mataranka. We went onto a property there owned by a young bloke called Kane Younghusband who had gone from Gilgandra to the Ord. He married a crackerjack sheila there—the daughter of the manager of Carlton Hill Station—and said, 'It is too dear here,' and went to Mataranka. He bought 2,800 acres for $10 an acre and cleared $1 million from melons in the year we were there simply by clearing a bit of it and putting in some irrigation.


Next door, trying their hardest, was an Indigenous property managed by the ILC. We went there and I said to this mob: 'What if one of your young Indigenous blokes wants to do what they have done next door? Would you give him a lease?' They said, 'Oh, we would give him some sort of authority to do it.' I said, 'But what happens if he got killed by a tractor and his wife wanted to go back to Darwin or somewhere? Would he be able to commercialise that lease arrange­ment?' They said, 'Oh no, he would have to surrender it.' I said to them, 'No bank will ever lend him the money to develop it if he does not have something to sell.' That is what is wrong with this system, and we bloody whitefellas are sitting here thinking, 'Gee, it's hot today; we'll turn on the air conditioner,' or 'It's cold today; we'll turn on the heater.' There is none of that up there. There are still somewhere between 4,000 and 7,000 kids in the Northern Territory who have no high school to go to and we are worried about what is going on somewhere over on the other side of the world and feeling sorry for them. What about our own mob? 


Let us go back to Cape York Peninsula. What is wrong with using the latest science to give these people an economic opportunity, for God's sake? If you go to Guyra in New South Wales you will see a 25-acre shed full of tomatoes that is a multimillion dollar enterprise. You do not need to have horizon-to-horizon develop­ment to have a successful commercial operation. What is wrong with giving these people the opportunity to do that? What is wrong with saying, 'I'm going to leave my farm to my kids?' What is wrong with that? No, it is good enough for us whitefellas but not good enough for our Indigenous people. (Time expired)

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-05-12,"



Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Minister for Sport, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness) (11:33):  I have heard a number of debates in this chamber that have disturbed me, but some of the rubbish that the last speakers have spouted has concerned me in a major way. Since the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, delivered the apology in this parliament in 2007, there has been a great deal of support and cooperation between both sides of the House and both sides of this chamber to close the gap on Indigenous inequality. Work has taken place in health, in housing and in education, and there is work taking place right now in economic development and employment.


I completely reject the comments from Senator Boswell and Senator Macdonald that somehow there is a division between parties or that the Labor Party is for welfare and is opposed to economic development. Nothing could be further from the truth. As the Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development, I am working day in, day out with our job providers, with businesses and corporations and, most importantly, with Indigenous communities across the country. So I totally reject the comments from those senators today, and I believe that the opposite is taking place.


We are now seeing Indigenous businesses sprouting up across the country. These are not just small businesses, but businesses of all sizes. These Indigenous people are taking responsibility for their own lives and their own economic development, and govern­ments are supporting that. The Gillard government is supporting it, state govern­ments are supporting it, and up until now it has been bipartisan and we have worked together. Senator Scullion, who started this debate, put his case, but he understands that both sides of this parliament have a commitment to ensuring Indigenous people chart their own course of economic development. What this debate is really about, though, is finding the right balance between economic development on the one hand and environmental protection on the other. We as a government and as a country support Indigenous people in the cape to develop businesses, grow their local economies, create jobs and lift their people out of poverty and social disadvantage. We support that. It is something that we are working on closely with Indigenous communities. But anyone who has spent time talking to the traditional owners and others involved in the debate in the cape understands that there is not one Indigenous voice; there are many Indigenous voices, and many differing opinions as to how this legislation is affecting economic develop­ment and what policies are best to stimulate economic development. It is a complex debate. At the same time, the traditional owners who talk to you about what they are doing to foster economic development also understand the importance of protecting the pristine heritage environment. They support that too.


For me, the most important thing in this debate is to look at the facts—that is, how this legislation has been used. We have had a huge amount of consultation at the state government level and there has been consultation through a Senate committee inquiry as well as a lower house, or House of Representatives, inquiry. There have been a number of submissions from the traditional owners—and I have met with a number of them—and the Queensland government has also provided a submission and answers to question on notice. One of the Queensland government submissions to the inquiry states that since 2007 there have been 140 developments approved under this legislation—




Senator Boswell:
  They haven't been.




Senator ARBIB:
  They have been approved. While this legislation has been in place, not one proposal has been blocked—not one.


Senator Macdonald raised the issue of market gardens in the wild river protection areas, and it is an important point because it has been used in a number of other arguments. Again, he has got his facts wrong. You can have market gardens in the wild river areas. In the high-protection areas right next to the rivers, they have to be a certain size and less than four hectares. In the rest of the wild river areas, you can have market gardens of any size.


We as a government are happy to come in here and debate this issue day in, day out. My understanding was that today we would debate the bill and we would vote on it. Now I have been informed by Senator Scullion and Senator Parry that that will not take place. Obviously, that is disappointing to me and the rest of the government. We are very prepared to have a vote on the bill today and certainly, Senator Scullion, we believe it would be appropriate to do so.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:41):  I have been very restrained in this debate, so I thank the chair for recognising me. Finally, after two hours, I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 7075:


(1)   Clause 2, page 2 (lines 1 to 3), omit clause, substitute:


2  Commencement


      This Act commences the day after the commencement of the Native Title Amendment (Reform) Act 2011.


The amendment seeks to add a clause to the bill so that it commences the day after the commencement of the Native Title Amend­ment (Reform) Act 2011. The reason I am moving this amendment is that I have listened to this debate two or three times now and I find the hypocrisy almost unbearable. The coalition are the party that brought in Wik amendments on native title and that have not supported Green amendments to the Native Title Act in the past to do what they say this bill does—that is, give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders free, informed, prior consent. They want to limit it to a group of people in this country. They do not in fact want it to apply to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. They did not support Australia endorsing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It was—I will give credit where credit is due—the Labor government.




Senator Boswell:
  Well, what advantage have they—




Senator SIEWERT:
  My bill, the Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill 2011, introduces other very important amendments to the Native Title Act that make it actually operable—because we know that the complex nature of that legislation has stopped people getting native title rights. So many barriers have been put in place that the native title system has become essentially unworkable in many cases. My bill seeks to put in place what the Aboriginal community have been crying out for. So who has been listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders? The Greens have been, so that we can make native title work—



Senator Boswell interjecting—




Senator SIEWERT:
  They do not, Senator Boswell! Senator Boswell, go and look at the election results in the Northern Territory. The Greens got 30 per cent of the vote in some areas, and do you know why? It is because they know that we are the ones who stand up for them—



Senator Scullion interjecting—




Senator SIEWERT:
  in the same way that we have stood up for them over native title. If you were genuine about supporting the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, you would support our native title amendments that would bring real and meaningful change for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. So do not come in here and lecture all of us about how we do not care about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, because you do not have a leg to stand on in that debate. Support our native title amendments; then I will believe you care about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. That is why we have put this amendment forward.

  I would like the senator to withdraw the statement that I do not care about our Indigenous people—

  I want Senator Siewert to withdraw the accusation that I do not care about Indigenous people.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:45):  The Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill that the Greens have introduced includes a number of very positive reforms. There are a number of very good measures here. But I do not see it as being inconsistent with this piece of legislation for a number of reasons. The bill will go through a process. I am not sure whether the bill from the Australian Greens has gone off to committee at this stage or not.




Senator SIEWERT:
  It has.




Senator XENOPHON:
  It has? Thank you. I have some concerns. Firstly, both the Queensland and Commonwealth governments, along with the Australian Greens, claim that a wild river declaration is not a future act under the Native Title Act. Therefore, the Native Title Act would not apply to wild rivers. Consequently, the bill proposed by the Australian Greens would not apply to wild rivers unless there is something within the bill that explicitly makes it apply. As I understand it, there is nothing in the Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill that would make it apply to a wild river declaration in terms of issues of consent.


Secondly, the bill that we are currently considering would require a native title agreement regardless of whether a declaration is a future act. It would also apply to Aboriginal lands. Under the bill from the Australian Greens, the references to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People are to be inserted in the objects of the Native Title Act in section 3. That is something that could be very useful and meaningful in terms of the operation of the Native Title Act. But I cannot see how this would make it apply to wild river declarations. So I am looking forward to the bill from the Greens regarding native title reform being brought on, because it contains a number of very worthy reforms. But I cannot see how this bill and the very worthy bill from the Australian Greens would be inconsistent.

Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Minister for Sport, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness) (11:47):  In relation to the amendment from Senator Siewert, while we appreciate all the efforts that have been made, the government opposes the amendment on the basis that we do not believe that the bill that has been put forward by Senator Scullion is workable in any way. Therefore, there is no purpose in amending it.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (11:48):  Just briefly, I want to correct the record. There has been so much passion around the chamber today. Everybody has wanted to speak on this bill. Obviously, there will not be the opportunity to bring it to a vote. Senator Siewert, in regards to your amendment, it is terrific to see that you now have some conditionality for your support of our legislation. I accept that. That is a very heartening. I look forward to having some further deliberations with you on that matter. Sadly, it is very difficult to support an amendment that basically says, 'Senator Scullion, if you undertake to support our bill, when our legislation goes through then your legislation will in fact become law.' We have not seen your legislation. I have to say, Senator Siewert, that I am disappointed that you would paint the coalition as not being very focussed on ensuring that Aboriginal people, through land reform, can get a better deal. That is simply not the case.


Sadly, we will not have the opportunity to have a vote on this today. We have had some very interesting contributions, particularly from those opposite. I would like to move very quickly past the fences, the dams, the cows, the chooks and the sandpit, because they fundamentally have nothing to do with this legislation. This legislation intends to ensure that we have the same rights of application over land in a national park, for example, as we do over land in any other case. It is absolutely essential that we go back to providing consent mechanisms for every time any level of government deals with Aboriginal people. It is incumbent upon all of us. I understand the views of the other side, particularly those who come from the cape. I noticed that the North Queenslanders and other Queenslanders got a little bit more agitated than others, as I and my Territory counterparts often do. If we all had our druthers, we and those opposite would possibly be in a more balanced place regarding this issue than we are now. But I have to again say that I do not think it is fair to characterise the views of the people of Cape York as divided so that there are somehow two views. That means that, if one person in a hundred has a different view, there are two views in Cape York. That is not fair. The Cape York Land Council, which represents the vast majority of the land in Cape York and the vast majority of the wild river declarations, had a vote and decided that this should not be supported.


Progress reported.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2011-05-12,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (09:32):  The wild rivers debate has been going on for some time now. I have already informed Senators Xenophon and Fielding and those opposite about our intentions with regard to the legislation today. The fund­amental aim of this legislation is to create some equity and consistency in the approach of the Queensland government with regard to the provision of conservation, particularly on Aboriginal land of all types. One of the most celebrated conservation outcomes in North Queensland has been the creation of quite large national parks under Premier Bligh. Many of those areas contain some particularly fantastic biodiversity and the creation of those parks was something to celebrate. Aboriginal people sat down for a very long time and discussed how they would conduct joint management of the parks.


It was similar to what happened with Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, where I come from. An agreement was reached for joint management of the park. The landowners, the Aboriginal people, would sit down as a board and have joint management of the park and Aboriginal people would be able to advise the park managers, who at that stage knew lots about conservation but little about cultural heritage or about the way that Aboriginal people interacted with their land. Then, at a later stage, as they became more confident, the Aboriginal people in the area gradually took a greater role in the bureaucracy and board. I think that Kakadu park is in fact emblematic of how it should be done.


Two examples in Queensland, in the area around Coen, are celebrated because of their now excellent conservation practices. The particular element to be excited about is not so much that it represents some of the greatest biodiversity in the world; it is the fact that Aboriginal people provided their consent. If you are creating a national park in Queensland and you are changing fund­amentally all of the ways of doing business, you need to understand that consent is absolutely fundamental to that process. Sadly, the wild rivers process in Queensland was approached differently by the Queensland government.


The region of Coen, after going through a very long process that took a couple of years, ended up with a celebrated result that protected biodiversity and ensured that all of those people involved had complete ownership of it. That deal involved joint management. All of the issues—including how many rangers were going to be involved, how the management process would work, how access would occur, how Aboriginal people would continue to conduct cultural activities, how they would interact with tourism and how they would grow in stature in terms of being able to manage the park—were resolved, setting the groundwork for the future.


This is, of course, in stark contrast to the Queensland wild rivers process. As a piece of legislation, wild rivers is not particularly different to any other conservation legis­lation, but the principles still apply. We believe it is an area of unique biodiversity and so we aim to apply protections that specifically protect that biodiversity. Wild rivers relates specifically to particular areas of biodiversity that have been identified. It is just like a national park. I commend the act in its treatment of most of the areas it covers in Queensland. I think that it is a good act and that some of the measures in it will be excellent. The reason that the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management Bill) 2011—my private member's bill—has been brought forward is that there is one stark difference between a national park in Queensland, which provides good conservation outcomes, and the Wild Rivers declaration in Queens­land, which also provides good environ­mental outcomes: one is provided with the consent and ownership of the owners of the land—the Aboriginal people of the land—and one is not. That is the only difference and, whilst it seems like a small difference, it is a very important difference, particularly to the people of Cape York.


One of the reasons the Wild Rivers legislation is of interest to the people of Cape York is that they are in fact the holders of land which, without argument, has some of the most wonderful and complex biodiversity in the world. That is why it remains a tourist attraction, and that is why the world's eyes are on places like Cape York—it is emble­matic of the remnant perfect biodiversity. It has been maintained in that state by the Aboriginal owners—the principal form of title there is native title—and the reason it is in that state is that the owners have had a connection with that country for so long. They are the reason that the biodiversity is so excellent; they are the reason that this country has been looked after so well. That is why a joint management agreement, which in a sense says, 'This is something that we can gather and this is something that we can ensure will be a fundamental building block of how we continue to look after the biodiversity,' would be so appropriate for Cape York.


Why would you ignore the single group of people who have protected this iconic biodiversity since time immemorial? In the national parks we do not; in the national parks in Queensland we have a system that completely acknowledges the role of the Aboriginal people who built those levels of protection. But, sadly, in the Wild Rivers declarations there is no such acknowledg­ment of their attachment to and association with the land. It should be no surprise and no wonder to anyone that the entire Aboriginal people of the cape apart from a very small handful—I have not met more than I can count on one hand—find the Queensland Wild Rivers legislation odious since their consent is not required. This is not conser­vation by consent, as it is with those very successful and celebrated national parks, but conservation by diktat—something you will have!—and I do not think that anyone in Australia is in any doubt that, given the circumstances, we should be supporting a change to the Wild Rivers legislation in Queensland that puts into effect the very same mechanisms that they have in, for example, national parks.


I have approached the Queensland government, as have many, because it is not the normal way for the Commonwealth to do business to intervene in a state. I can tell you that, coming from the Territory, I find it particularly odious that we should do so. But this is a circumstance that is so very important that we have made many calls on the Queensland government to change the Wild Rivers legislation. I ask myself: where is the mischief? Premier Bligh is a fine woman, and I am sure she means well.'




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Don't go over the top.




Senator SCULLION:
  But I am sure she means well because I have read her media reports about the celebrated deals that were done with the national park in Queensland. Isn't it fantastic that we have Aboriginal people on their land working side by side for conservation outcomes? I know Premier Bligh celebrates that, but neither she nor anyone else in Queensland has been able to answer me when I ask: 'Why is it that we would have this inconsistency? Why the difference in the Wild Rivers legislation, under which we simply make a declaration over that land and there is no consent required?' Instead, there is silence. Some as cynical as and more cynical than me would say, 'After all, the Premier is a politician.'




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  It's called Green preferences.




Senator SCULLION:
  We have heard about the Greens deals. Greens preferences are important.




Senator Brandis:
  It was at a West End coffee shop before the last Queensland election.




Senator SCULLION:
  It has been alleged that coffee was involved. Those of us who are a little bit cynical have accepted that there are special arrangements concerning the Wild Rivers legislation. But why would you have special arrangements? We already have arrangements in place that work: empowerment; working next to Aboriginal people who know how to look after the land because they looked after the land well before white people stood on this land. The only reason could be that they have simply done a deal.


We know about the Wilderness Society and those associated with it—they have produced some very good outcomes and are trying to protect the environment—but I think that we have lost touch with the balance. The balance for Premier Bligh was to say to the Greens: 'I need your pref­erences. What would you like in exchange?' Clearly, the exchange from Premier Bligh was, 'We'll go and have Wild Rivers.' The question would then have been, 'What is Wild Rivers going to do?' and Premier Bligh's answer would have been, 'It takes a little time to deliver national park-like mechanisms because we have to have the consent of people; we have to have people agree.' The response to that would have been, 'No, we can't have that in it.' So the legis­lation was passed with a lot of opposition—though not, obviously, with sufficient opp­osition—but without the inclusion of the notion of consent. The people of Cape York have not held this land for very long as a national park—in that sense it is still young land—yet this Wild Rivers legislation, only because of some grubby Greens preference, has a substantially different approach to how we go about a partnership approach for conservation to the approach found in other conservation legislation. It is still not too late, Premier Bligh; it is still up to you. You can change your own legislation to make it consistent with your approach to national parks. You can still do this. All the people I have spoken to across the cape wish to embrace the opportunities for conservation. They want to do that. We have got examples all over the place of that. But there should be that simple respect of saying that we will require the consent of Aboriginal people. That is exactly what the Wild Rivers (Envir­onmental Management) Bill 2011 would ensure. It is simply to ensure that Aboriginal people are fully involved, that we can get the full benefits of the wisdom of the Aborig­inals and that we get their consent—which is just about respect.


Those in the gallery and those in the chamber will recall that the President this morning rose and said that we would also like to acknowledge the Ngunawal and Nga­mberri people of the Canberra area. That is all about respecting the ownership of land. Sadly, in my view, the Queensland govern­ment, or elements of the Queensland govern­ment, have certainly been disrespectful in the way that they are treating Aboriginal people, who are the traditional owners of land and are owners of land in Queensland, in this matter.


That is the motive behind this bill. It is a very simple motive. Clearly, as I have indicated, I do not have the support today, because there are still some concerns with the bill. We will be speaking to a number of people to ensure that we have the amend­ments correctly, because this is such an important area of consideration. I under­stand, Senator Furner, that you had a great interest in this. Look into your heart to see whether there are other appropriate amend­ments or whether you can ring the premier yourself. If you want to do some real good for the people of Cape York—and I know you do, mate—you need to reach into your heart and do the business of ensuring that the Queensland government does the right thing.

Senator FIELDING,FFP,2011-05-12,"



Senator FIELDING
 (Victoria—Leader and Whip of the Family First Party) (09:47):  I take this opportunity to speak to the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011 as a whole at this stage, as I did not speak during the second reading debate. The objective of this wild rivers bill is to circumvent the Queensland Wild Rivers Act 2005, which allows the Queensland minister to declare an area to be a wild rivers area. The effect of the Wild Rivers Act is to enable the Queensland government to make wild river declarations that limit the range of activities that may be carried out in a decl­ared area of land in order to preserve the natural value of that area. The bill before parliament today seeks to change the way in which a wild river declaration is made, tak­ing the power from the Queensland minister and putting it in the hands of other interest groups.


Since the debate on wild rivers last year I have had the chance to look at some of the wild river declared land firsthand. I have also listened to the lengthy debates from both sides of the argument and have considered the arguments through the inquiries. The more that you look at the issues, the more you realise that there are two valid and opposing arguments. Firstly, I think that some areas of this country do deserve to be protected. I am not in the camp of locking things up for the sake of it. But, equally, I am also not in the camp of bastardising the environment. Some areas of this country are special and ought to be declared as special areas in order to safeguard and preserve these areas. Under this bill, a wild river declaration can only take effect if it has the written consent of all the interested parties of the land. The practical result of this will make it extremely difficult for any wild river declarations to ever be made. This, I think, is a problem in itself.


This problem arises because of the def­inition of 'owner' in this bill. That definition of 'owner' means that a wide variety of people and groups may fall under the def­inition of owner for a particular area of land. For example, it includes people with native title interests, freehold interests, leasehold interests and other interests, too. This means that, in order for an area to be declared to be a wild river area, every one of these groups that falls under the definition of 'owner' needs to give their consent for a declaration to go ahead. To put it another way: it means that every single person or group that falls under the definition of 'owner' gets an auto­matic right of veto on a wild river dec­laration. As an example, even if eight parties affected by a wild river declaration agree to give their consent, the declaration can be nullified because of the opposition of just one party. This hardly sounds reasonable. What it really means is that the likelihood of ever getting an area to be declared as a protected or a preservation area is extremely slim. I have spoken to some members of parliament who support this bill because they do not believe in creating preservation areas and are happy to see nearly every part of the land developed. That is something that I do not agree with.


The second point I want to make is that there seems to be a lot of confusion within the communities that new development is not allowed in a declared area. This is simply not true. For example, the following types of development can still occur: tourism, eco­tourism, development of associated infra­structure, grazing and pastoral enterprises, residential and commercial developments, commercial fishing and fishing based tour­ism. However, I do recognise a real problem, and that is that people are put off from doing any development because they do not know how to wade through the entire permit app­roval process and because it looks way too hard. I believe that this is a real problem. Many people who do not have the resources to jump through all the hoops, the paperwork and the bureaucratic red tape end up missing out.


Particularly within many of the Aboriginal communities there are development plans that are never made because people within a declared wild river area do not feel that they have the resources, the money, the time, the administration or the know-how to overcome the hurdles standing in the way of the developments. This needs to change. Just like there is legal help for people who cannot afford legal representation, so too we need a type of free professional service to help people who want to do development in these areas but do not know how to navigate the approval process. This is something I have raised directly with the government and I am pleased that these concerns have been listened to. As a result, the government has promised to provide funding to establish a professional services resource that will help Indigenous Australians move forward with their plans for development in areas that have been declared wild river areas. 


The third point I want to make is that before a Queensland minister can make a wild rivers declaration there needs to be adequate consultation with the people aff­ected by any such declaration. In fact, if you are going to limit the range of activities that can be carried out on an area of land then you should have to ask the people who have a stake in the land what they think. It is clear from the inquiries into this bill that the level of consultation that has occurred thus far has been substandard in some areas. It is not enough for the Queensland government to pay lip-service to the consultation process. They need to actually sit down and speak with the people who use the land and take into account their legitimate concerns. There are plenty of people out there with very reasonable concerns and it is important that we listen to what they have to say. This is something that I have raised directly with the Queensland government and the federal government because it is a problem that needs to be addressed. I am pleased to say that the Queensland government will be establishing Indigenous reference groups to improve the consultation process. These Indigenous reference groups will provide information and recommendations to the minister on natural values, economic asp­irations and consultation processes. This information will need to be taken into consideration by the minister, along with other advice such as scientific advice, when defining the areas. These reference groups will provide legitimate and representative input to the Queensland minister. It will give parties a greater voice in the decision-making process of any declared areas.


Finally, this wild rivers issue is very difficult. I am sure that both sides of politics would agree about the tremendous difficulty in balancing environmental interests with those of landowners and development inter­ests. After considering all of the information, and given that the federal government has agreed to fund a professional services resour­ce to assist people with getting an application for permit approved, and given that the Queensland government will establish Indig­enous reference groups to ensure proper consultation, I will not be supporting this bill.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-05-12,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (09:54):  I rise to contribute to this debate in committee. I commend the contributions that have been made thus far this morning by the opposition, Senator Scullion and particularly Senator Fielding. As a Queensland senator, I have intimate involvement in this area and I know there are other Queenslanders, like Senator McLucas and Senator Moore, who have travelled to the cape on many occasions and who understand the Indigenous issues—in particular in this matter concerning the environment. However, the bill in its current form is deeply flawed. If you go through the bill clause by clause, you will clearly identify the flaws in the bill. 


When it comes to economic development, we heard during the last inquiry into this bill through the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, only a few weeks ago, of the confusion, the lack of understanding and, on many occasions, the contributions by the Queensland government to the applications that have been presented in terms of economic development up in the cape. I know that there are people in this chamber who have possibly not travelled to that area, and I would suggest that most Australians have not travelled to the cape at all to get an appreciation of the situation up there. But I think people need to understand that it is a remote area. On most occasions you need to fly into Cairns and then fly into Weipa. During the wet season, which has just completed—an extended wet season, in fact—they get their food in via barge from Normanton, and there are various ways of getting their stock and requirements into that area. People need to understand that it is not just a simple matter of saying, 'This is an area that can be developed,' or that it can be considered for development in any shape or form. That is not the issue. The soil is poor; hardly anything can be grown in that area. However, those opposite run the argument about the Queensland government locking it up. Nothing has been locked up. In fact, I think Senator Fielding made the relevant point—and he is quite right; he has taken an interest in this—that things are not locked up in the cape.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You should ask the Indigenous people!




Senator FURNER:
  I have spoken to the Indigenous people, Senator Macdonald. I do not know whether you have. I know you fly in and out of places, but when you get on the ground and are involved in the wild river itself, and when you speak to Indigenous owners about what the issues are, those are the times and the opportunities when you get an opinion expressed about what the issues are.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I do more driving in Northern Australia than you ever will, you donkey!




Senator McLucas:
  Madam Temporary Chairman, I would request withdrawal of that comment.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Hurley
) (09:58):  Senator Macdonald, I did not hear the reference. Do you wish to withdraw?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Just to assist you, Madam Temporary Chairman, I did call him a donkey, which is what he is, but I withdraw it.




Senator FURNER:
  You'd only expect that from a Neanderthal. When you examine what this bill does, it claims to lock up the cape. In fact, grazing, fishing, tourism, camping, hunting and gathering continue unaffected. I have seen that myself up in the cape. I have seen Indigenous traditional owners working the cape—




Senator Boswell:
  You are a donkey!




Senator FURNER:
  And you are a ratbag and a fool.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Order! There is starting to be discussion across the chamber. Senator Furner, would you continue with your remarks and other senators cease to interject.




Senator FURNER:
  There are other matters that are able to be considered. Things like Indigenous cultural activities, ceremonies, harvesting of bush food, medicines and the enjoyment of native title are permitted and unaffected. Outstation development can continue. Recreational boat users can continue to use the rivers and creeks. Mining, grazing and irrigation cont­inue today without the declaration of wild rivers areas. Regarding new developments up in the cape, over 100 applications that have been submitted and we are working through those. 


The evidence out there does not suggest that the wild rivers scheme has blocked development on the cape; to the contrary, the scheme has led to successful Indigenous ranger programs. Real jobs have been creat­ed in terms of rangers in that area, jobs which could be lost if this amendment has its passage through this chamber. In fact, the amendment, interestingly, goes to a part­icular matter in terms of—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I think he has lost Anna's speech.




Senator Heffernan:
  I will give you the facts in about three seconds.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Order! There is too much conversation around the chamber.



Senator Boswell interjecting—



Senator Heffernan interjecting—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Order! Senator Boswell and Senator Heffernan, there is too much conversation and I cannot hear Senator Furner. I ask that Senator Furner be allowed to continue when there is silence.



Senator Boswell interjecting—




Senator FURNER:
  Geez, you're a knucklehead. The changes to clause 4 in this amendment indicate that wild rivers rangers jobs will be lost and the Australian govern­ment must somehow replace those jobs. This is a matter that I have never seen in any bill whatsoever; a situation where a state piece of legislation relies upon a federal piece of legislation to assume and pick up the loss of any jobs. In fact, in inquiry, the questions were asked: what are these jobs we are talking about; are they rangers' jobs; are they jobs of people involved in development in the cape? This issue and proposal was clearly a matter of confusion during the inquiry. So it is really difficult to know whether this clause was intended to confer an entitlement or not in regard to compensation of the loss of a job.


A number of other questions—which can­not be answered—were also raised by this clause: what kind of work is being promised? If you lose your employment as a ranger—if that is what the bill intends—what is the sort of work that is going to be applied in terms of the loss of that employment as a ranger? Where will the work be? Will rangers be employed in the cape? Will they be relocated to other parts of the state or somewhere else within the nation? These are the issues that have been raised and considered during the inquiry stage, in the legal and constitutional committee and also in the House of Repre­sentatives economics committee when it was before them. 


Additionally, it is unclear what the pay and conditions would be, because currently employment is under Queensland statute and no doubt would be under a specific award. No-one is of a view or has an understanding of what their entitlements would be beyond that, given that they are currently employed under state legislation. 


Additionally, it will be a question of who will be required to employ these people, because the bill implies or suggests that the federal government should pick up the employment or the protection of these employees, should the bill result in their un­employment. These are the issues associated with clause 4: the constitutional basis and the objective of the bill. The potential for that to lead to lengthy litigation under this bill is very real. 


So, when it comes to this fallacy portrayed by those opposite of wanting to protect Indigenous rights, wanting to have some involvement in native title, I think people need to put it in the right context. We need to remind ourselves who opposed the Native Title Act, when a Labor government intro­duced it. It was those opposite who opposed that act, so it is not a case of them going round the cape indicating they are there representing Indigenous rights and wanting to be at the forefront of protection of their lands and their entitlements. I am sure Senator Heffernan would have been there and would remember that they opposed the Native Title Act, so do not come into this chamber saying that you are here to protect Indigenous rights for Queenslanders, let alone for Australians, because you were in opposition on that particular bill.




Senator Heffernan:
  Madam Temporary Chair, I have a point of order: what this is all about is saying to the Indigenous people in Northern Australia, which is half the size—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Come to your point of order, Senator Heffernan.




Senator Heffernan:
  The point of order is that we are expecting that the great opportunity in life for Indigenous people up there will be to get their photo taken with a spear.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Heffernan, there is no point of order.




Senator FURNER:
  Once, again, unlike the coalition, the Australian Labor Party is a party of reform and wholeheartedly supports Indigenous Australians' rights and fosters and encourages Indigenous economic development. This is evident once again in the implementation of the Native Title Act in 1993. We are not disingenuous, unlike the opposition who make out that they are there to protect the rights of Indigenous people. We will continue our involvement as we have done in a variety of different circumstances—




Senator Heffernan:
  Madam Temporary Chair, I rise on a point of order. He should withdraw the remark that we are not here in the best interests of Indigenous people. I am!



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  There is no point of order, Senator Heffernan.




Senator FURNER:
  I didn't say that. You're very precious.




Senator Heffernan:
  Don't put crap on me!




Senator Sherry:
  Madam Temporary Chair, I rise on a point of order. Senator Heffernan should withdraw that comment unreservedly.




Senator Heffernan:
  No-one should put crap on me.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Have you completed your point of order, Senator Sherry?




Senator Sherry:
  I had not finished my point of order. The statement that Senator Heffernan just made in a disorderly way again reinforces my point of order. He should withdraw his comment.




Senator Heffernan:
 No-one should put sewage on me.




Senator Sherry:
  It was not related to sewage either, Senator Heffernan. Madam Temporary Chair, I ask you to require him to withdraw unreservedly.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Madam Temporary Chair, on the point of order: the debate is free-flowing. Twice now the Labor Party have interrupted it with precious points of order whilst at the same time—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  And what is your point of order, Senator Macdonald?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  the speaker before you was using terms like 'knucklehead', but nobody interrupted the debate and stopped him. I ask you to let the debate flow. If you are going to stop that sort of name-calling, I suggest you start with the speaker who has the call.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  I was endeavouring to listen to the speaker so I did not hear the interjections across the chamber. Senator Heffernan, do you wish to withdraw?




Senator Heffernan:
  No, I do not wish to withdraw, because I have been accused of not acting in the best interests of Indigenous people. I have been up there and I know what this is all about. This is an outrage. I have been up there and seen the child abuse that occurs. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Heffernan, you are continuing to debate at this stage.




Senator Heffernan:
  There are 7,500 Indigenous kids in the Northern Territory who still do not have a high school to go to, for God's sake.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  I take it that you are refusing to withdraw?




Senator Heffernan:
 No-one should pretend that I am not on the side of the Indigenous.




Senator FURNER:
  I will go back to my point. We should not forget where we stand on Indigenous rights as a Labor government. Let us not forget the apology delivered on 13 February 2008 by Kevin Rudd, the then Prime Minister. For many years those opposite spoke about how ill treated all Indigenous Australians were. They had 11½ years to deliver an apology but failed in that regard. They were not willing to deliver such an apology. It was pushed under the rug. After years of silence it was time to end the denial and to acknowledge the ill treatment received by Indigenous Australians. That is what we did on 13 February 2008 and that is what we are about.


I have had several opportunities to visit one of those pristine rivers—the Wenlock River—that have been declared under the Queensland legislation. It is a river that needs to be protected. On a number of occasions I have been up there to visit the Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve on the banks of the Wenlock River. The previous govern­ment under John Howard gave that piece of land to the Irwins and here we have the hypocrisy of reversing that position. I wonder what John Howard would do in this debate. He gave that piece of land on the Wenlock River to a conservationist. He understood the significance of it. Those opposite want to overturn it to allow strip mining, destroying the beautiful rivers.


I am sure some of you might have an opportunity to look at some of these pristine rivers. They are beautiful pieces of nature. On my first visit I was shown by Australia Zoo ranger Barry Lyon eight springs on the reserve which are located on a bauxite plateau. These springs are of great ecological value. In fact, they are a source of water for wildlife during the dry season. Bauxite does not absorb the water; instead, it acts as a giant sponge and releases the water during the dry. Research has been conducted in this area by QUT and other researchers. They have found an abundance of wildlife that relies on the existence of these beautiful springs. In 2008 a survey found 151 different vertebrate species, including 75 birds, 26 reptiles, 16 native amphibians, eight native mammals and 16 freshwater fish.


The Queensland government passed the Queensland wild rivers legislation to protect certain areas of the cape. However, the opposition want to portray that they are somehow protecting native title rights. That is not the case. We know what the agenda is here. They just want to reverse it so some of the mining companies can strip mine areas of unique significance. If you destroy these rivers, you will never get a chance to reverse that. Madam Temporary Chairman Hurley, I am sure you understand what happened to the Murray. We do not want to see that on the cape in Queensland. We want to make sure the rivers are protected and Indigenous people have a right to do the things they currently do on their lands. We do not want to hear this fallacy about locking it up continued, because that is not the case. They are free to do their traditional hunting and everything else on the land as they have done for years and years. That will continue under this arrangement. (Time expired)

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:13):  I would like to make a few comments about the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011 and about the opposition's amendments that I believe deal with a number of the concerns that have been raised with me about how consent will be achieved, because that is a key issue here. I want to deal with some of the concerns of Senator Fielding that were also raised by Senator Furner. Let us put this in perspective. In the absence of a wild river declaration these pieces of legislation apply to the land in Cape York and areas that could be subject to wild river declarations: the Coastal Protection and Management Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Fisheries Act, the Forestry Act, the Fossicking Act, the Land Protection (Pest and. Stock Route Management) Act, the Mineral Resources Act, the Nature Conservation Act, the State Development and Public Works Organis­ation Act, the Sustainable Planning Act, the Transport Infrastructure Act, the Vegetation Management Act and the Water Act. There are currently 13 pieces of legislation in place that provide safeguards for the environment. The fundamental flaw is that there is a lack of consultation and consent with the Indig­enous owners of the land. That is what I find objectionable about the Queensland legisla­tion.


It is rare in this place for senators to be asked to decide between a perfect outcome and a disastrous one. Typically the decisions we are asked to make come down to deciding which way forward will bring about the better outcome—not a perfect outcome, but a better outcome. I want to refer specifically to clause 6 of the bill, because we are in committee, and the way it addresses the issue of consent. There has been a lot said in this debate, and I believe the coalition's bill has been unfairly characterised in some quarters. Let us be clear what this bill does and does not do: it does not prevent the Queensland government from making wild river declarations; it simply requires the Queensland government to seek consent from traditional owners of that land before it makes a declaration. You just have to ask first.


The government has argued that other members of society do not have this right of consent and that if a government wanted to build a freeway where my house is it could compulsorily acquire my land. This is a spurious argument for a number of reasons. Firstly, if the government wants my land to build that freeway, they take over my land. With wild rivers declarations the land is not taken over, but the government does tell you what you can and cannot do with your land. Moreover, if the government wants that freeway, they have to pay me just compensation for that land. With wild rivers there is no compensation, you just lose your rights.


The government has said that traditional owners can seek exemptions from a declaration, arguing that more than 100 have already been granted. It is something that my friend and colleague Senator Fielding referred to. But as Balkanu CEO Terry Piper has pointed out, nine of those were for one fence. And as Noel Pearson has also pointed out, the vast majority of those permits have been granted to either mining companies or state government departments. Surely this supports the argument by Indigenous groups that the application process is so complex you need the resources of a mining company or a government to go through it.


There is another issue here. Senator Fielding made the point: let us help people navigate through the wild rivers declarations. I say this, understanding that Senator Fielding is absolutely genuine in his concerns: but you are asking people to navigate where there are so many obstacles, where the boat you are given in the first place is so leaky by virtue of these wild river declarations, it is setting up impossible obstacles for these communities.


In January this year I travelled to Cape York Peninsula where I met with both supporters and opponents of the coalition's bill, and I must say wherever I went—and I travelled freely and consulted widely—I met a lot more supporters than opponents. One of the supporters was Bruce Martin from Aurukun, who I met again last night. He is one of the new generation of Indigenous leaders. He is articulate, he is smart, he is passionate about the possibility for real economic development. He wants to do something about the horrendous unemployment rates in his communities—70 per cent, 80 per cent unemployment rates. We all do.




Senator McLucas:
  Everybody does.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator McLucas says, 'Everybody does,' and I agree with that. There is no issue about the genuineness of both sides of the house wanting to deal with the shocking rates of unemployment and disadvantage in those communities. Incidentally, former senator Brian Harradine danced with members of the Aurukun community here in front of Parliament House over native title.


Bruce and his community have big plans for Aurukun, and they have mapped a path forward. Bruce says they want to look after country. They also want to get young people back to country to strengthen and maintain culture. They want to create training and employment and they want to do this by utilising the one asset they have—their land—to be able to provide for their families.


Bruce and almost all of the Indigenous people I have spoken to on this issue argue that the wild rivers legislation is an impediment to achieving this. For example, the Aurukun people are exploring the option of a cattle destocking project that would manage the 10,000 to 15,000 head of feral cattle and 5,000 wild brumbies that are currently destroying the environment up there. Over three years they want to remove 95 per cent of feral animals from key cultural and environmental areas, creating jobs and restoring their country, and providing food for their community. But plans like this, which has the support of backers like philanthropist Paul Bendat, are threatened by wild rivers declarations. Yes, the Aurukun people can attempt to seek an exemption, but there is no guarantee that they can get it. And they can argue the costs involved make it beyond their reach.


Bruce said something else that has hit home about the Wild Rivers Act. He said to me that the Queensland wild rivers legislation, like native title more broadly, only entitles him and his community 'to be native'. He went on to say:


It is now the 21st century. We need the outside world to stop viewing us as the 'noble savage'. What we are trying to do now is to keep our culture strong, stay committed to the traditions and beliefs of our ancestors and to look after country and utilise our land, but with all the benefits of modernity. Old and new in partnership.


I believe we need to be careful that our laws do not stand in the way of these fine aspirations.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:19):  Might I begin by complimenting Senator Xenophon on a fine, thoughtful and idealistic speech. On 3 April 2009, the minister for Indigenous affairs, Jenny Macklin, announced that the Labor government had decided that Australia would become a signatory to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and that has since happened. In her speech making that announcement on 3 April 2009, Ms Macklin described the declaration as a 'landmark document', both 'historic and aspirational', by which, as she said:


We show our faith in a new era of relations between states and Indigenous peoples grounded in good faith, goodwill and mutual respect.


Fine words.


Article 26 (2) of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to which the Gillard government has subscribed, provides—just listen to this, Senator Fielding, please:


Indigenous peoples have the right to own, use, develop and control the lands, territories and resources that they possess by reason of traditional ownership or other traditional occupation or use, as well as those which they have otherwise acquired.


So the Labor government and the minister for Indigenous affairs, Ms Macklin, have patted themselves on the back for subscribing to this declaration, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which contains that guarantee, the guarantee in article 26 that Indigenous people have the right to own, use, develop and control their traditional lands. By a crowning irony, on the very day that Ms Macklin made that speech, a thousand miles to the north, in Brisbane, the Bligh Labor government gazetted three major river systems in Cape York—the Archer, Lockhart and Stewart Rivers, their catchments, tributaries and floodplains—under the Queensland Wild Rivers Act 2005. The effect of the gazettal by the Queensland government on 3 April 2009 was to make it impossible for the Indigenous people—the traditional owners, the people whom we acknowledge and pay respect to every morning as this chamber convenes—to use, develop or control those traditional lands. How remarkable—the high-toned sentiments of Minister Macklin in Canberra and the reality of a cynical state Labor machine in Brisbane on the very same day saying one thing and doing another. There could not be a more stark example of the rule that the Labor Party says one thing but does the opposite. And what the Queensland Labor government did on this occasion was a peculiarly wicked thing to do. It destroyed the economic livelihood of the traditional owners of the cape. And it is to reverse this wicked decision that Senator Scullion's private senator's bill has been brought to the chamber.


I do not profess to be a specialist in this area, so do not take it from me, let us hear what the Aboriginal leaders have to say about the effect of the Queensland Wild Rivers legislation. Marcia Langton, Profes­sor of Indigenous Studies at the University of Melbourne, described the gazettal of the Lockhart, Archer and Stewart Rivers—I hope you are listening to this, Senator Fielding—as 'a terminal threat to the eco­nomic future of the local Aboriginal people'. So please, Senator Furner, do not cond­escendingly tell us about the wildlife; let us talk about the human life, let us talk about the Aboriginal people, whom the Labor Party, with all its pious rhetoric, claims to champion, yet in reality stabs a knife through their heart with this legislation. Marcia Langton says this is a terminal threat to the economic future of the local Aboriginal people.


Even Mr Tom Calma, this government's own Aboriginal Social Justice Commiss­ioner, said he had 'serious concerns about the effect of the gazettals on the exercise and enjoyment of Indigenous people's human rights—in particular, those concerning cultural and economic develop­ment rights to their lands, waters and natural resources'. Noel Pearson said that the effect of the gazettal was 'to foreclose on the future for our people'. He said 'the state'—the state Labor government, that is—'cannot rip the future out from under Indigenous children's feet'. The Young Australian of the Year, Tania Major, a very impressive young woman with whom I shared a panel on Q&A two years ago, spent that program pleading with Anna Bligh, who was also a co-panelist that night, to understand the effect on local Aboriginal people, their livelihood and their economic future, of the Queensland wild rivers legislation. But Tania Major's pleas fell on deaf ears, just as Noel Pearson's pleas, Tom Calma's pleas, Marcia Langton's pleas and Bruce Martin's pleas have done.


Do you know what is peculiarly wicked about the Queensland Wild Rivers Act? As anybody who lives in Brisbane knows, it was the result of a backroom deal in a West End coffee shop just before the 2009 Queensland state election, which the Labor Party managed to win, managed to pull out of the fire, on the back of Greens preferences. And what happened in that deal was that the Labor Party powerbrokers in Brisbane, who are no better than the Labor Party power­brokers of Sussex Street or Carlton or any of the other unattractive Labor Party power­brokers across the country, sat down with the Greens in the inner-city suburb of West End in Brisbane and traded the future of the Cape York Aboriginal and Indigenous people for Green preferences. They made a present of the future of those people in order to appeal to the conceits and vanities of inner-city Green voters in Brisbane. It is as simple as that, and everybody in Brisbane knows it.


So please let us not have from Senator Furner and, I anticipate, from Senator McLucas, who I expect will be speaking shortly, pieties about how concerned the Labor Party is about Indigenous people when they come to this chamber to oppose a bill which will reinstate the rights which this very Labor government subscribed to an international instrument in order to secure—the right, as I quoted before from article 26 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to own, use, develop and control the lands, territories and resources that they possess by reason of traditional ownership. How can you do it, Senator McLucas? How can you, because I know that you do care about social justice? I know that you are troubled by this. I know that the unattractive goons—or to use Mr Rudd's word, 'thugsters'—who control the Queensland branch of the Labor Party are hardly friends of yours. So I know you are troubled by this. But how can you in good conscience come into this chamber and oppose a bill that would restore the traditional rights of the Indigenous people of the Cape York Peninsula.




Senator McLucas:
  You are a lawyer, George.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Yes, Senator McLucas, I am a lawyer and I am very proud to be a lawyer. It is a very timely interjection, because I thought I might conclude the last few minutes of my speech by talking about the constitutional basis of this bill. Because there is no doubt at all that Senator Scullion's bill is soundly consti­tutionally based under at least—




Senator McLucas:
  It is an opinion.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Yes, it is an opinion and it happens to be correct—and you will not find a serious lawyer who will disagree with me. Let me explain it to you, Senator McLucas. Under section 51(xxvi) of the Commonwealth Constitution, the Common­wealth parliament can make laws for:


The people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws.


It is the so-called race power.




Senator McLucas:
  How long would that take to go through the High Court?




Senator BRANDIS:
  How would it go at the High Court? The argument that I am propounding would win without a shadow of a doubt, Senator McLucas. So while Senator Scullion's bill is supported by the race power in section 51(xxvi) it is also supported, as any piece of legislation in this parliament these days that relies on an international instrument, by the external affairs power—section 51(xxix) of the Commonwealth Constitution.


We have had this argument, Senator McLucas. Let me refer you to the Tasmanian dams case and volume 158 of the Commonwealth Law Reports, which I just happen to have with me, in which the High Court in 1983 upheld the Commonwealth Law in relation to the Gordon below Franklin Dam on the basis of the United Nations convention on world cultural and national heritage. So we have a clearly established precedent in the High Court in the Tasmanian dams case and in subsequent cases that environment legislation based on an international treaty is within the legislative competence of this parliament under the power conferred by section 51(xxix)—the external affairs power. 


But this case, Senator McLucas, is even clearer than the Tasmanian dams case. It is clearer for two reasons: first of all, because the jurisprudence has moved on since 1983. In all the years since the High Court's construction, the breadth or the ambit of the external affairs power has expanded; it has not diminished. So if the Tasmanian dams case was good authority for the use of the external affairs power to support environmental legislation in 1983, then it is certainly the case in 2011 that the Common­wealth parliament has the power. 


But it is even clearer in this case for a second reason, Senator McLucas—and let me finish where I began—because it was your government that acceded to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indig­enous Peoples. So under the external affairs power Senator Scullion's bill is doubly supported. It is supported by the World Heritage convention, because it is a bill in relation to the protection of the environment, but it is also a bill, plainly, for the protection of the rights of the Indigenous people and it gives effect to what your government subscribed to but your Labor Party collea­gues in Queensland, in order to buy Green votes, walked away from, and that is the right in Article 26 of that international convention of indigenous peoples to:


... Have the right to own, use, develop and control the lands, territories and resources that they possess by reason of traditional ownership ...


If you believe that, you would vote for this bill, and by your conduct in opposing this bill you really show what you stand for.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers) (10:35):  It is with great sadness that I rise in this chamber today to contribute to what I think is a divisive and hurtful argument. In 1996 I had the honour of being a member of the Cape York Regional Advis­ory Group, an organisation that was established to work with Indigenous pe­ople—with landowners, with the graziers of the cape and with the environmental groups of Cape York Peninsula. That started in 1996. That produced a document called the Cape York Peninsula land use strategy. It had three objectives: to promote the econ­omic values of Cape York; to improve the social outcomes for people who live on Cape York Peninsula; and to protect the environment of Cape York Peninsula. It was a fine document. It is a document that everyone who worked on that document was extremely proud of—and it has gone nowhere. It has gone nowhere and the people of Cape York are the victims of what happens in chambers like this, what happens around the place when people do not consider the outcomes of what people want on Cape York Peninsula, when politicians get involved in what people really want. What do people really want in Cape York? They want jobs, they want an economic outcome, they want a social outcome, they want to have control over their lands. What is happening here today does nothing to change that objective. In fact, what this bill does is increase the complexity and delay the outcome even more. I think every speaker in this argument today—this discussion in the committee stage today—has talked about complexity. Of course it is complex to deal with the issues that we deal with on a day-to-day basis in Cape York Peninsula, but this bill does nothing to improve those outcomes. In my view, it in fact puts us back.


I do go to the comments of Senator Brandis. Senator Brandis talked a lot about the law. Can I suggest that we will end up talking in courts and in places outside Cape York Peninsula for a very long time if this piece of legislation is progressed, because there will be debate about the consti­tutionality of this legislation, about whether or not it can affect the Queensland legislation and about whether or not it does improve outcomes for people who live on Cape York Peninsula. Why is it that we want to play with the lives of people who live on Cape York over and over?


There were fine words from Senator Scullion in talking about aspirations. I agree with most of what you said, Senator Scullion, except that your way of getting there should not be through a flimsy piece of legislation that in my view is about division. This is not about pulling people together. This is not about finding a way forward. The wild rivers legislation, we all know, had some very difficult consultation beginnings. We know that. That is a fact. Queensland knows that it could have done a better job of consulting with people. It has remedied that, and I acknowledge the work of Senator Fielding in ensuring that that process has been improved. But we know we have to work with people on the ground. This will provide division. Rivers traverse large numbers of traditionally owned lands. You know that, Senator Scullion, and you know that this will divide traditional owners and pit them against one another. This will pit traditional owners against one another. This is not about bringing groups of people together; this is division, and this will mean that we entrench that division that has been delivered by this discussion already.


We have talked about the different points of view that are held by people on Cape York, and there are totally different points of view. But that is why we have to get down to some facts. I think that the whole wild rivers debate has been characterised by a lot of conjecture. It is about argument making and, in many cases, it can be described as being hyperbole.




Senator Brandis:
  'Hyperbowl', according to the Prime Minister.




Senator McLUCAS:
  According to Senator McGauran also, as I remember. But all of that characterisation has resulted in division: division on the cape, division in here and division among groups of people who, I believe, honestly and truly want better things for the people of Cape York. But this will not do it. This will provide us with more time in the courts, I am sure. This will provide us with a delay in any development that is going to occur. This will delay those aspirations that we came to in the mid-nineties about economic development, social development and environmental protection that were agreed. That has been delayed, and I will put the blame on the former Howard government. Forty million dollars was allocated in the 1996 budget. How much was spent? Very, very little. No money was brought for land buyback—or very little money. Less than $1 million was allocated out of that $40 million; $17 million was meant to be spent on buyback, and less than a million was spent on buyback during the 12 years of the Howard government. That delay was politically inspired, and now we have another delaying tactic—another thing that is going to put back the aspirations of Indigenous people yet again.


I note the comments from Senator Scullion about federal intervention and how he feels uncomfortable about that. I would too if I were a senator from a territory having experienced it. I also note the very strongly made comments from Senator Brandis that he was quite sure that this would pass through a High Court decision.




Senator Brandis:
  Not a shadow of a doubt.




Senator McLUCAS:
  'Not a shadow of a doubt,' he says. I would suggest that that is an opinion. I am not a lawyer. It is an opinion, and there will be others with different opinions. That is the nature of the law. Senator Brandis nods in agreement, because that, I think, is true.


Senator Scullion talked a lot about joint management of national parks. We all agree, but what does this bill do about joint management of national parks? Nothing. It does not do anything about joint manage­ment of national parks. We are doing it. I will make the point that I think Queensland has been slower than it could have been in developing joint management arrangements on Cape York Peninsula. I would have loved to see the Shelburne Bay joint management arrangements put in place before Tapich passed away. We want to progress on joint management arrangements, but this does not do anything to progress that. You know that, Senator Scullion. What this does is put obstacles in the way of finding agreement among various traditional owner groups around national parks.


I take the point that Senator Xenophon made about resourcing of appropriate processes, but in saying so can I say that to this point in time there have been no applications not approved, and the number of applications sits around 100. I take Senator Xenophon's point that it is a reasonably complex process. There is an organisation, though, that is resourced to support people to make applications and progress economic aspirations. It is funded to do that. It has been funded for a long time to do that. It is called Balkanu Cape York Development Corporation. That is the organisation that is meant to be supporting people to make application through any process.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You've seen what Balkanu say about the process, haven't you?




Senator McLUCAS:
  Yes, that is my point, Senator Macdonald. We have an organisation that is funded to support Aboriginal people to achieve their economic aspirations, and what is it doing? It is running a campaign against wild rivers. So, if you are an Aboriginal person and you want to go and get some support to do whatever economic activity you want to do, are you going to turn up at Balkanu's door? I do not think so. It is running a political campaign.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Why?




Senator McLUCAS:
  I would suggest clearly for political reasons and you guys know that, and your laughter acknowledges that. If you are an Aboriginal person, are you going to go to Balkanu? I don't think so.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You are so condescending to Aboriginal people.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Troeth
):  Order! Senator McLucas, has the floor.




Senator McLUCAS:
  I am pleased that we have some extra money that will support people to make applications through a complex process. There are technical pro­blems with this bill and I want to go through them. The bill's proposal that the consent of Indigenous landowners is required for the making of a wild rivers declaration it totally unworkable. It is unworkable for a whole range of reasons. As I said earlier, rivers traverse various traditional owner lands. This bill will ensure—




Senator Scullion:
  So do national parks.




Senator McLUCAS:
  Exactly. National parks do. We can pull those groups together, but if you are going to say—




Senator Scullion:
  How do you get agreement there?




Senator McLUCAS:
  The outcome will be that we won't ever have any protection.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Order! Senator McLucas, I would advise you not to respond to provocation.




Senator McLUCAS:
  I thank you for that advice. I am saying that it is totally unworkable. The process cannot apply to other landholders whose agreement is required, like leaseholders. There are other landholders who have an interest in what a wild river declaration might look like and what conditions might apply to that wild river. We have Indigenous native title holders, there are leaseholders and in some cases there are some freeholders, who need to be included in a discussion about the aspirations that can be agreed to.


Under the Native Title Act, you are ensuring that we will spend a lot of time holding meetings and having discussions about things that will have no economic outcome for people who are the traditional owners of that land. The bill does not cater for the circumstance in which Indigenous people agree about whether a wild river declaration should apply or not. This is a way to ensure that we have division on Cape York.


I want to end by talking about the aspirations of people who live on Cape York. They do not want to argue. They do not want to be turning up all the time. I note the comment from Richie Ah Mat from the Cape York Land Council when he appeared at the Senate inquiry. He is sick of turning up at Senate committee inquiries and he would like people to get on with it. Let's do that. Let's allow people of Cape York to get on—




Senator Scullion:
  He supports this legislation; that is what he means.




Senator McLUCAS:
  He is sick and tired of turning up at Senate inquiries, I can tell you that.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  He wants you to pass it.




Senator McLUCAS:
  Can I tell you, if we pass this legislation, he will be turning up to inquiry after inquiry as we deal with the flow-ons and the outcomes of this legislation. People in Cape York do want economic outcomes. We know this from Murrandoo Yanner, who gave evidence to the last inquiry, about the economic outcomes he has achieved: five full-time, permanent jobs that are active out there on land, managing the rivers in the gulf area. These are jobs that were not there before but are there now for the long term, jobs that people have been crying out for for a really long time and—as Senator Macdonald indicated—jobs that we will be providing through our budget, and I am very, very proud of that.


This piece of legislation will provide no jobs. It will delay the provision of jobs for a long time. It will pit Aboriginal people against Aboriginal people, instead of pulling people together in the way that you describe, Senator Scullion, where you pull people together to talk about a national park and then some economic outcome that may come out of that. This will not do that. Queensland have made the commitment to progress with more rangers and we have seen that with the rivers in the gulf.




Senator Boswell:
  That is a government job.




Senator McLUCAS:
  Aboriginal people, Senator Boswell, have been talking about being able to manage their land with some rights—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Why don't you let them?




Senator McLUCAS:
  We are.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You are stopping them.




Senator McLUCAS:
  With the wild rivers legislation there is a commitment to have ranger jobs associated with it. Those ranger jobs are the jobs that people in Cape York have been asking for for a very long time. Yes, they want to have traditional ownership as a first step then they want to have the right to manage that land, and the way to do it is through ranger jobs then to have the economic outcome as well. I honestly hope this legislation will never pass.

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2011-05-12,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (10:50):  I came to the intent of this par­ticular bill in about 1985-86 when millions of hectares were given to Aboriginal people under DOGIT, deed of grant in trust. That land was supposed to be allocated to the communities under the Local Government Act and anyone who wanted some land to do something would be allocated that land, whether it was 20 acres to grow tomatoes, land for a cattle station or a sawmill, or whatever it was, and that land was allocated to those particular Aboriginal people and then they made their own decisions. That was around 1985-87. I had a bit to do with it. As people would know, I was close to the Premier at the time. In fact, I went around some of these communities with Bob Katter and the Premier. We worked together to give this land to them for what they wanted to do with it. Then that land was taken away from the local communities and put under an act. Aboriginal people walked down George Street, protesting that the Labor government had taken their land away and calling for Bob Katter to come back as the minister. That was the start of it. Now we come to the Wild Rivers Act. This merely is an act that would allow people to be involved in their own communities to make a living out of the land. Not all of it but a lot of it was given under the deed of grant in trust.


So that is the history of this. Then the Labor government tried to come in over the top of a previous government and take that land away. Not only that, what they intended to do and were literally caught in the act doing was to keep that land and put it into World Heritage. It was only Warren Truss who got up in the other House and demanded of the Aboriginal minister at the time that the minister not do it unless they had the consent of the Aboriginal people. Two or three weeks ago, the then minister said, 'I've pushed the pause button and we won't go ahead with it, because we do not have the consent of the Aboriginal people.' That is the main game. That is the commitment to the Wilderness Society that this eventually would be turned into wild rivers. Wild rivers would be the first step, and then it would go into World Heritage. When the minister made his commitment that he would pause, the Wilderness Society said, 'We'll still campaign for this.'


Senator Furner got up and did not know what he was saying—and you should forgive those who do not understand these things, but I would have expected better from Senator McLucas. 'What is there to be ar­guing about,' Senator Furner says. 'You can hunt. You can shoot a pig. You can have your traditional dances. You can go out in the river. You can do all the things that native title gives you.' And that is right. You can do all those things. No-one is arguing that. But we want to go the next step. We want to say to the Aboriginal community and the Pearsons of the world: 'You have got a right to live in the 21st century. You have got a right to go out there and put a farm down that will grow vegetables and then sell those vegetables in the local community.' You cannot do that. You can grow veget­ables, sure. You can grow for your own use, but you cannot commercially put down a farm in what you would call a catchment area.


The Bligh government initially talked about how the impact would only be on a handful of pristine rivers. It turns out that they actually meant to see entire river catchments and basins and, in fact, 80 per cent of Cape York would be subject to yet another layer of regulations, effectively frustrating opportunities for Indigenous people. It captures 80 per cent of the land so you cannot do anything other than have an obscure native title right where you can hunt, fish and have ceremonies. It does not allow any way that you can commercially use that land to provide fruit, vegetables and healthy things in life; go out and have a cattle farm; or go out and do something that will be productive and commercial. Therefore, you are locking these thousands of people—there are 14,000 people who live on the cape—out of any commercial event. You are locking them out of lifting themselves out of poverty.


It is a terrible shame that the Labor Party are doing this. Because Senator Xenophon in his excellent speech quoted another traditional owner, I will quote Senator Pearson—Mr Pearson. One day he might be a senator—and what a wonderful addition he would be to this house.




The exercise of traditional rights and traditional activities is important but that will never lift our people out of poverty and misery. We have to be able to undertake land use that generates economic return for the people who live there. We are not going to be serious about closing the gap as to Indigenous disadvantage if we have this view that all that Aboriginal people should be happy with and all that they should be entitled to is to stand on one leg in the sunset picking berries. Fundamentally this is a racist expectation on the part of governments and other stakeholders to expect Aboriginal people to live in some frozen past.



There is someone who is speaking up for the Aboriginal community. Sure, he does not speak for every one of them; but he speaks for most of them. I would say he speaks for 90 per cent of them.




Senator Siewert:
  No he doesn't!




Senator BOSWELL:
  Yes, he does. And I have been up there many times. Balkanu, Pearson—those people speak for most of the people who want to lift themselves out of poverty, who want to lift their kids out of poverty. They do not want to be condemned to an everlasting life of social welfare, and that is what you are condemning them to: an everlasting life of social welfare where they and their kids will never be able to have a job and all that entails. Senator Brandis made a comment about the United Nations. He spoke very well—and so he should; he is a QC. But he put it very succinctly. He said that the Prime Minister at the time signed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. And what has the present Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, said? Commenting on the Closing the gap report, she called on the Indigenous people:




… to take a job when you find one; to create a safe environment; to send your kids to school, pay your rent, save up for a home; to respect good social norms and to respect the law; and to reach out to other Australians.



But in Cape York the Labor government is shutting down avenues for jobs and reaching out for Greens preferences on wild rivers.


What have the Aboriginals of Cape York received from this government? Sure, it signed the United Nations treaty. They were told to get a job. And we did have a 'welcome to country' put in this parliament, which no-one objects to—but that does not pay the rent. That does not give anyone a job. That does not lift people out of poverty. So what they got is tokenism—beads and mirrors. That is what this government has given the Aboriginal community: beads and mirrors. Nothing that says, 'Your kids can get a job.' Your kids cannot get a job; there are no jobs up there. And there will not be jobs up there unless you let the Aboriginals use the land that was given to them by previous state governments and that you have taken away.


Isn't it ironic that a party that has always been painted by the Labor Party as being against Aboriginals gave them millions of acres of land and put the first Aboriginal member of parliament into state parliament? I have been out campaigning with at least two—it was two or three—other Indigenous candidates when I tried to get them into parliament. It is ironic that the Labor Party that claim to be the friends and natural allies of the Indigenous people are stealing their land off them, and for Greens preferences. Senator Furner says, 'Hang on a minute, they can develop anything they like and there have been 113 developments applications,' and Senator McLucas says, 'Of course, if they want an application it will be passed.'


Let me just say that out of the 113 development applications 79 were for exploration permits. Of the 35 remaining 'development approvals', 17 were issued to government entities for activities such as fencing and gravel extraction; eight riverine protection permits and one environmentally related activity permit appears to relate to the Century Mine project, which is an existing development; three riverine protection permits are for the Stanbroke Pastoral Co., possibly for a fence; two vegetation clearing applications, for the Strathmore and Barr Creek holding, are presumably for clearing for a fence; and one approval was for Adels Grove camping park, which is an existing development. There have been none appr­oved. Yes, you can hide, you can run, you can misrepresent people, but they are the facts.


We heard—and you were there, Senator McLucas, in Cairns—when one particular community, I just forget which one, said that after the wild rivers declaration they cannot actually get their gravel out of a pit and they have to drive 20 or 30 miles there and back. They cannot even take gravel out of a gravel pit for the roads around the Aboriginal community. That is what you have done to these people.


Senator Fielding will be leaving this place in three or four weeks time and I want to give him this message. Senator, you have come in on a church vote; let me give you this message. What does it profit a man if he gets something but loses his soul? Take that with you when you leave this place.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:04):  Any fair-minded, independent Australian who heard the speeches of Senator Scullion, Senator Xenophon and Senator Brandis could not help but agree on the importance of this bill, the Wild Rivers (Environmental Manage­ment) Bill 2011, and the necessity for this parliament to pass it. I again appeal to Senator Fielding, whose vote will be crucial to the future of Indigenous people not just in Cape York but right throughout Australia, to reconsider his stance to date on this bill. I ask Senator Fielding to consider seriously the things that Senator Xenophon raised, the issues that Senator Brandis raised and the comments of both Senator Scullion and Senator Boswell. This bill will unlock opportunities for Indigenous people.


I have to say about the Labor Party—and I am careful not to say this about indi­viduals—that it seems to me that the actions of the Labor Party across the board show that the Labor Party want to keep Indigenous people on welfare forever. Why they would want to do that I cannot possibly understand, but all of their approaches to Indigenous people treat Indigenous people as second-rate citizens, as people who are incapable of looking after themselves. That is what the Labor Party does, whereas those of us on this side have a completely different view. Indigenous people are as good as, if not better than, those of us in this chamber, for example. They have the same rights as we have. They have the right to look after their own land and property and to deal with it. I challenge Senator McLucas and Senator Fielding: if a government was going to do something with their house, with their property, wouldn't you want to have a say in it? Wouldn't you think it is your right to say to a government, 'This is my land; I want a say in how this is dealt with'? Of course Senator McLucas would. She would be the first on her feet screaming and yelling if a government tried to do to her house and land what the Queensland state Labor government is doing to Indigenous people with the wild rivers legislation. I think it was Senator Fielding—it might have been Senator Furner—who said to get approval you need the consent of the owner. Welcome to Australia! What a strange thought that you should not ask the owner of the land what it is all about. I think it was Senator Furner who said you need to get the consent of 11 different groups of people. 


Let me go through the bill and point out these 11 different groups of people. It means, for Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Act, grantees of Aboriginal land under that act. That is the first lot whose approval has to be sought. There are Aboriginal people who have rights under that act. How unsurprising is that? Owner means, for land where native title exists, native title holders. Again, it is not unsurprising that they should have a say. It means, for a lease under the Aborigines and Torres Straight Islanders (Land Holding) Act, the lessee. Under that act, some Indigenous people have got land as a lessee. This requires them to be consulted and their approval sought. How unsurprising that? It means, in relation to a deed of grant in trust which Senator Boswell spoke about under the Land Act granted for the benefit of Aboriginal people, the grantee. So they have been given land and the Labor Party are saying you should not ask them or seek their approval if you are going to lock up their land.


The definition of owner goes on to be defined in relation to a reserve under the Land Act for a community purpose which includes Aboriginal purposes the trustees of the reserve. They have been given a reserve for Indigenous purposes, and this bill requires their approval too. What is so wrong with that?


For freehold land or land held in trust for an Aboriginal person or an Aboriginal corporation under the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act, owner means the registered proprietor of that land. Again, land is given to someone and this bill requires their consent. What is wrong with that? Senator McLucas would want to give her consent if it were her land being taken, but she does not afford the same right to Indigenous people.


For completeness, owner also includes, for a term lease or a perpetual lease under the Land Act held by or in trust for an Aboriginal person or an Aboriginal corporation under the Corporations Act, the lessee. Again, Indigenous people having been given that right should have the right of veto, quite correctly. Finally, for the Aurukun Shire lease, under the Local Government (Aboriginal Lands) Act, of course, the Aurukun Shire Council have to consent. Why wouldn't they?


I again challenge Senator McLucas and Senator Fielding: if you were going to do to their house and land what this bill does, wouldn't they demand a right of veto? They would want it but they do not want to give that same right to Indigenous people. I repeat that it seems to me that the Labor Party, for whatever purpose, want to keep Indigenous people on welfare forever, whereas we on this side want to support Indigenous people's right to be Australian and to have the same opportunity as every other Australian.


I repeat, for Senator Fielding's benefit particularly, the scene that Senator Brandis described as to why this legislation came into being. I would like to hear from Senator Brown on this and see if he challenges it. It is a well-known fact that this legislation on wild rivers by the Queensland Labor government came into play in a dirty deal done in a West End cafe by the then Queensland Premier with the Wilderness Society. The Labor government desperately needed Greens preferences, so to get them they sold out Aboriginal rights. They sold out the Aboriginal people just to get preferences from the Greens political party at that particular state election. That is the only reason this legislation came into being. I would like Senator Brown to deny that.


Senator Xenophon quite clearly pointed out that, if you want to preserve and look after the biodiversity and environment of any of these lands, there are 12 or 13 other pieces of state and federal legislation that can do exactly that. But they do it in a way and by a process that does respect the rights of the owners, in this case the Indigenous owners. This bill adds nothing to that. For all of Senator Furner's speech that he read from, for all his words, he did not want to address the fact that any protection that might be needed for this very special land can already be given under other pieces of legislation. I ask Senator Fielding: why introduce this new piece of legislation when all of those protections are there?


I briefly descend to the level of Senator Furner when he cast aspersions on those of us on this side who have the real interests of Indigenous people at heart. For Senator Furner—a Johnny-come-lately to this place—to suggest that I and others fly in and fly out to these areas is very offensive. I have spent my life since I have been in parliament driving on the road in remote parts of Queensland. He seems to think that because he has done it once—and I suspect he flew in and flew out anyhow—he is something special. I say this because he will not say it himself, but our leader, Tony Abbott, has actually made a practice of going and living in Indigenous communities and has done for some years. I know he has done it in Cape York. I found out by mistake almost, because when he goes there, unlike the Prime Minister, he does not take a team of media people with him; he goes and does some work and understands the Indigenous people, particularly the Indigenous people in Cape York. That is where this bill in this parliament, the Scullion bill, actually originated, from Tony Abbott's deep understanding of and involvement with Indigenous people, something that the Prime Minister and most of those on the Labor side would never understand.


Time is going to run out. I know Senator Heffernan also wants to say a few words on this bill. I want to point out what a witness, Balkanu, said in evidence to a Senate committee about the impact of a declared wild river:




…a community vegetable garden within a High Preservation Area is only permissible if it does not involve clearing vegetation. It is difficult to imagine circumstances on Cape York where a community vegetable garden could be established without some clearing of vegetation.



They went on to say:




High Preservation Areas have in almost all declarations been declared to the maximum of 1km either side of the declared wild river and its major tributaries—with no scientific justification.



Obviously, as they go on to say:




The best soils for community gardens are within th
is
 area.



Last week I was in the Gulf Country of Queensland. Of course, this does not just apply to Cape York; this has been extended now into the Gulf rivers and extended down into the Lake Eyre Basin. If it has not gone to Lake Eyre yet it is on the way, by the Queensland government, because there is an election coming up and the Queensland government again need the preferences of the Greens political party. What has the Queensland government got to sell? They have sold almost everything else in Queensland. They do not have much to give the Greens political party for their preferences anymore, so they agreed to take in the Lake Eyre rivers.


Having been in the Gulf Country last week, I can tell you people up there are petrified for all of their development plans, their proposals for their communities and their people—Indigenous and otherwise—people who want to make a living for themselves and who want to be taken off welfare. They are petrified that additional rivers in the Gulf Country are going to be declared because there is an election coming up and the Labor Party under Anna Bligh desperately needs Greens political party preferences again.




Senator Boswell:
  I don't think that will even save it this time.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Perhaps it will not even save it, but the Labor Party in Queensland are pretty desperate. That is why Senator McLucas and Senator Furner, two Queensland senators, are here in this chamber trying to knock off this bill so that the preference deal in Queensland can go through. I highlight again that this is all about Greens preferences. It does nothing for protection of the land that could not be done by other pieces of state and federal legislation. As Senator Xenophon rightly pointed out, those of us who have been to the cape and the Gulf Country with open eyes, without a preconceived position, can feel, see and count that most Indigenous people are totally opposed to the Queensland wild rivers legislation as it exists. They want to have some say in their own land. This bill gives them that say, and I think any genuine legislator—anyone in this chamber who has the real interests of Indigenous people at heart—should support this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (11:18):  I want to give a non-legal perspective to what this is about. You will probably use my qualifications as a farmer, a worn-out wool classer and a welder. This is about the disenfranchising of the aspirations of the Indigenous community. There is no question that the Indigenous community of Australia has been treated disgracefully. I went to a community as the Chairman of the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskf­orce and talked to a grandmother in that community in which whitefella social habits have completely destroyed the com­munity to the point where this lady was looking after a girl who had to be surgically put back together after being pack raped at 20 months. Senator Furner, do not ever tell me I do not care about Indigenous people. He can refer to my maiden speech, the first time I stood up in this parliament. All Australians should hang their heads in shame for the treatment that Indigenous people have been given.


To give you an idea of what this is all about: in the Northern Territory, where the Indigenous people learn from what is going on around them, 45 per cent of the Northern Territory has Indigenous ownership, for which they get no benefit generally—Mistake Creek and one or two places are an exception—I met a whitefella who was bragging to me, as chairman of the northern taskforce, that he had 17,000 cattle on this blackfella country, as we call it. Blackfellas do not mind me calling them blackfellas because we are mates; I am a whitefella. I said, 'Oh yeah, what are they getting out of it?' He said, ""Mate, I give them $10,000 twice a year to get on the piss.' I felt like smacking him in the bloody head—that is the treatment we hand out. This is about the aspirations for our most precious resource, like our bloody jackeroos and jillaroos, our Indigenous people are the foundation of Australia and we are saying to them, 'No, mate, you can never own your own home and write out a will and pass your home to your kids. No, we can't do that.' So we have this ridiculous proposition.


Let me put it into a global context. By 2050 with nine billion people on the planet—we need to see this in the broadest scope and then bring it down to the area of which we are talking—barring a catastrophe of some sort, 50 per cent of the world's population poor for water, 30 per cent of the productive land of Asia having gone out of production, two-thirds of the world's population living there, the food task doubling and possibly 1.6 billion people on the planet displaced—that is by 2050. By 2070, unless there is a catastrophe, approximately 12 billion people. A place like China will have to feed half its population from someone else's resources by 2050 if India does not wake up to itself because they have not so far, China has and it is trying to engineer a solution to the North China Plain. There are 57 rivers that flow into Bangladesh and 54 of those rivers flow in from India which mines next to the groundwater which becomes the river water. There are 160 million people in Bangladesh who are going to have to move as part of the 1.6 billion displaced. They live in an area half the size of Cape York Peninsula.


Cape York Peninsula is 17½ million hectares—please note I am not reading a speech—which is the same size as Victoria. If you take out the coastal towns, the 800,000 to a million feral pigs, the 30,000, approximately, wild cattle not tagged and the 14 to 17 pastoral stations, there are approximately 14,000 people. Bangladesh has 160 million people in half that area. The UN are not going to be able to sort this. Australia has to listen to Mother Nature. Mother Nature is saying—all science has vagaries; all human endeavour has failures—and if the science is half right in what it is saying we have a serious global food task problem. Science says that it is going to dry up in the south and I will not go through that. It says that the weather is going to move in an anticlockwise direction and there are going to be opportunities in the north.


Senator Macdonald and I went to Georgetown. As he said, this Wild Rivers stuff is going to be a cancer that spreads. It was pegged out in 1957 for irrigation but that has never been done. To put this into proper context I am going to fine it down. When I was chairman of the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce we took evidence in Cairns and the chairman of the Cape York Peninsula Land Council came in. I said to him, 'Mate, where do you live?' and he told me. I said, 'How big's the joint you're on—an ex-pastoral station?' He said, 'Mate, I don't know but its 90 kilometres from the mailbox to the house.' I said, 'What do you do there?' He said, 'Oh, we catch a few wild cattle.' I said, 'What' s the house like?' He said, 'The white ants have eaten it.' 'What are the fences like?' 'They've all fallen down.' It is because this is sit-down country.


This is not a fair go for our Indigenous people. So what do we do then? I actually chaired the Traveston Dam inquiry—get the facts of this. I negotiated with Peter Beattie, who was the then premier, to allow the public servants to come and give evidence to the Traveston Dam inquiry, which I chaired. I had a good relationship with Peter Beattie, who is now out of the game. He knew that I knew that the Traveston Dam proposal was a politically driven imperative because, under an arrangement made by Beattie and Goss, they sold the right dam site. Of course, eventually, we said it was a shit of a site, a shocking site, sorry.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Troeth
) (11:25):  Order! Senator Heffernan.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  I withdraw that sewage bit. I said to him, 'Peter, we're not going to savage your public servants; we're not going to play politics with people's livelihoods.' This proposition of wild rivers and the remedy to overcome that is playing politics with people's livelihoods. When I raised wild rivers with him Peter Beattie told me to my face: 'Bill, I had to do a deal to get the inner-city Brisbane preferences with the Wilderness Society and that is why we have done it. Eventually it will be turned into a World Heritage area.'


With the latest science it is an absolute insult to the human race with respect to the global food task to think that ownership of this country cannot be given as a commercial advantage to our Indigenous people. This is a disgrace. Unlike a lot of people in this place I have been and camped on the Cape York Peninsula and I understand the country. There are marvellous opportunities from some of those rivers within the first kilom­etre. They are as good as the Murrumbidgee River or the Liverpool Plains. Sure, there is a wet season and there is a dry season and we learnt the hard way from Humpty Doo that, if you go about it the wrong way, you end up with a mess on your hands. But to say to Indigenous people, 'We're not going to let you have a commercial agricultural adv­antage,' when they are going to be closest to the biggest market—two thirds of the world's population is going to live on their doorstep. You cannot tell me that the UN is going to sort out the people of Bangladesh or the 260 million people, up to 400 million people by 2070, who live on the great northern plain in China and who will have to be moved if they do not engineer a water solution. The UN is the world's largest most corrupt bureau­cracy—it does some good work but it is corrupt like most governments in Asia. Here we are today saying the Indigenous opport­unity in Cape York Peninsula ought to be tourism. Get your photo taken with a blackfella and a spear, what sort of crap is that?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (11:28):  Order! Senator Heffernan.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  What sort of rubbish is that? I cannot believe that Senator Fielding does not get this. 




Senator Siewert:
  Oh, he does.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  I do not believe he gets it. What we are saying is that we have the power as whitefellas to overpower the aspirations of the original owners of this country. These people simply want an economic opportunity. We are absolutely closing our eyes to what Mother Nature is saying about the planet. You can absolutely learn from the mistakes of the past in doing mosaic development of the north—absolutely learn from the past.


One of the greatest disgraces in the recent past is the overallocation of the Culgoa River. The Culgoa River, the Condamine-Balonne, has a mean annual flow of 1,237 gigalitres. We have allowed whitefellas without any environmental study to build 1,500 gigalitres of on-farm, off-river storage in a system that has an 830 per cent variable flow where from 1921 to 2009, 25 percent of the flow was in four years. We have allowed that to be developed to the point where those four years are every year. This is crazy. We can learn from the mistakes of the past but we can successfully allow the Indigenous people on Cape York Peninsula an economic opportunity. What is wrong with whitefellas? How cheap do we have to be to allow politics in this? Let someone deny that Peter Beattie made an arrangement with the Wilderness Society—he told it to my face—to get inner city preferences and set about a serious 100-year disadvantage by denying the greatest opportunity for our Indigenous people. If the science on the planet is right, northern Australia is going to provide an enormous opportunity in the future to participate in the global food task.


Sure, science has to take place and GM cropping has to take place, but guess who owns the bulk of the land up there, by one title or another? Our Indigenous people. We had a retort here from the Greens a second ago, 'Oh no, you're wrong, Bill'. That is all right if you are plaiting your armpits, smoking pot and living in Darling Point or somewhere. This is about reality and I am afraid that we are denying the aspirations of our Indigenous people.


To learn from the past we went over to 'We of the Never Never' at Mataranka. We went onto a property there owned by a young bloke called Kane Younghusband who had gone from Gilgandra to the Ord. He married a crackerjack sheila there—the daughter of the manager of Carlton Hill Station—and said, 'It is too dear here,' and went to Mataranka. He bought 2,800 acres for $10 an acre and cleared $1 million from melons in the year we were there simply by clearing a bit of it and putting in some irrigation.


Next door, trying their hardest, was an Indigenous property managed by the ILC. We went there and I said to this mob: 'What if one of your young Indigenous blokes wants to do what they have done next door? Would you give him a lease?' They said, 'Oh, we would give him some sort of authority to do it.' I said, 'But what happens if he got killed by a tractor and his wife wanted to go back to Darwin or somewhere? Would he be able to commercialise that lease arrange­ment?' They said, 'Oh no, he would have to surrender it.' I said to them, 'No bank will ever lend him the money to develop it if he does not have something to sell.' That is what is wrong with this system, and we bloody whitefellas are sitting here thinking, 'Gee, it's hot today; we'll turn on the air conditioner,' or 'It's cold today; we'll turn on the heater.' There is none of that up there. There are still somewhere between 4,000 and 7,000 kids in the Northern Territory who have no high school to go to and we are worried about what is going on somewhere over on the other side of the world and feeling sorry for them. What about our own mob? 


Let us go back to Cape York Peninsula. What is wrong with using the latest science to give these people an economic opportunity, for God's sake? If you go to Guyra in New South Wales you will see a 25-acre shed full of tomatoes that is a multimillion dollar enterprise. You do not need to have horizon-to-horizon develop­ment to have a successful commercial operation. What is wrong with giving these people the opportunity to do that? What is wrong with saying, 'I'm going to leave my farm to my kids?' What is wrong with that? No, it is good enough for us whitefellas but not good enough for our Indigenous people. (Time expired)

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-05-12,"



Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Minister for Sport, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness) (11:33):  I have heard a number of debates in this chamber that have disturbed me, but some of the rubbish that the last speakers have spouted has concerned me in a major way. Since the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, delivered the apology in this parliament in 2007, there has been a great deal of support and cooperation between both sides of the House and both sides of this chamber to close the gap on Indigenous inequality. Work has taken place in health, in housing and in education, and there is work taking place right now in economic development and employment.


I completely reject the comments from Senator Boswell and Senator Macdonald that somehow there is a division between parties or that the Labor Party is for welfare and is opposed to economic development. Nothing could be further from the truth. As the Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development, I am working day in, day out with our job providers, with businesses and corporations and, most importantly, with Indigenous communities across the country. So I totally reject the comments from those senators today, and I believe that the opposite is taking place.


We are now seeing Indigenous businesses sprouting up across the country. These are not just small businesses, but businesses of all sizes. These Indigenous people are taking responsibility for their own lives and their own economic development, and govern­ments are supporting that. The Gillard government is supporting it, state govern­ments are supporting it, and up until now it has been bipartisan and we have worked together. Senator Scullion, who started this debate, put his case, but he understands that both sides of this parliament have a commitment to ensuring Indigenous people chart their own course of economic development. What this debate is really about, though, is finding the right balance between economic development on the one hand and environmental protection on the other. We as a government and as a country support Indigenous people in the cape to develop businesses, grow their local economies, create jobs and lift their people out of poverty and social disadvantage. We support that. It is something that we are working on closely with Indigenous communities. But anyone who has spent time talking to the traditional owners and others involved in the debate in the cape understands that there is not one Indigenous voice; there are many Indigenous voices, and many differing opinions as to how this legislation is affecting economic develop­ment and what policies are best to stimulate economic development. It is a complex debate. At the same time, the traditional owners who talk to you about what they are doing to foster economic development also understand the importance of protecting the pristine heritage environment. They support that too.


For me, the most important thing in this debate is to look at the facts—that is, how this legislation has been used. We have had a huge amount of consultation at the state government level and there has been consultation through a Senate committee inquiry as well as a lower house, or House of Representatives, inquiry. There have been a number of submissions from the traditional owners—and I have met with a number of them—and the Queensland government has also provided a submission and answers to question on notice. One of the Queensland government submissions to the inquiry states that since 2007 there have been 140 developments approved under this legislation—




Senator Boswell:
  They haven't been.




Senator ARBIB:
  They have been approved. While this legislation has been in place, not one proposal has been blocked—not one.


Senator Macdonald raised the issue of market gardens in the wild river protection areas, and it is an important point because it has been used in a number of other arguments. Again, he has got his facts wrong. You can have market gardens in the wild river areas. In the high-protection areas right next to the rivers, they have to be a certain size and less than four hectares. In the rest of the wild river areas, you can have market gardens of any size.


We as a government are happy to come in here and debate this issue day in, day out. My understanding was that today we would debate the bill and we would vote on it. Now I have been informed by Senator Scullion and Senator Parry that that will not take place. Obviously, that is disappointing to me and the rest of the government. We are very prepared to have a vote on the bill today and certainly, Senator Scullion, we believe it would be appropriate to do so.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:41):  I have been very restrained in this debate, so I thank the chair for recognising me. Finally, after two hours, I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 7075:


(1)   Clause 2, page 2 (lines 1 to 3), omit clause, substitute:


2  Commencement


      This Act commences the day after the commencement of the Native Title Amendment (Reform) Act 2011.


The amendment seeks to add a clause to the bill so that it commences the day after the commencement of the Native Title Amend­ment (Reform) Act 2011. The reason I am moving this amendment is that I have listened to this debate two or three times now and I find the hypocrisy almost unbearable. The coalition are the party that brought in Wik amendments on native title and that have not supported Green amendments to the Native Title Act in the past to do what they say this bill does—that is, give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders free, informed, prior consent. They want to limit it to a group of people in this country. They do not in fact want it to apply to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. They did not support Australia endorsing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It was—I will give credit where credit is due—the Labor government.

  Well, what advantage have they—

  My bill, the Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill 2011, introduces other very important amendments to the Native Title Act that make it actually operable—because we know that the complex nature of that legislation has stopped people getting native title rights. So many barriers have been put in place that the native title system has become essentially unworkable in many cases. My bill seeks to put in place what the Aboriginal community have been crying out for. So who has been listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders? The Greens have been, so that we can make native title work—



Senator Boswell interjecting—




Senator SIEWERT:
  They do not, Senator Boswell! Senator Boswell, go and look at the election results in the Northern Territory. The Greens got 30 per cent of the vote in some areas, and do you know why? It is because they know that we are the ones who stand up for them—



Senator Scullion interjecting—




Senator SIEWERT:
  in the same way that we have stood up for them over native title. If you were genuine about supporting the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, you would support our native title amendments that would bring real and meaningful change for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. So do not come in here and lecture all of us about how we do not care about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, because you do not have a leg to stand on in that debate. Support our native title amendments; then I will believe you care about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. That is why we have put this amendment forward. Chair, Senator Heffernan wants to make another ad hoc statement!




Senator Heffernan:
  I would like the senator to withdraw the statement that I do not care about our Indigenous people—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator McGauran
) (11:44):  Senator Heffernan, you are taking a point of order, are you?




Senator Heffernan:
  I am taking a point of order.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Make it a good one, and not a rambling—




Senator Heffernan:
  I want Senator Siewert to withdraw the accusation that I do not care about Indigenous people.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  There is no point of order.




Senator SIEWERT:
  Senator Heffernan, if he does care about the future of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, will support my amendment to the Native Title Act. I have moved this amendment so that the benefits of native title will flow to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I commend my amendment to the chamber.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:45):  The Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill that the Greens have introduced includes a number of very positive reforms. There are a number of very good measures here. But I do not see it as being inconsistent with this piece of legislation for a number of reasons. The bill will go through a process. I am not sure whether the bill from the Australian Greens has gone off to committee at this stage or not.




Senator SIEWERT:
  It has.




Senator XENOPHON:
  It has? Thank you. I have some concerns. Firstly, both the Queensland and Commonwealth governments, along with the Australian Greens, claim that a wild river declaration is not a future act under the Native Title Act. Therefore, the Native Title Act would not apply to wild rivers. Consequently, the bill proposed by the Australian Greens would not apply to wild rivers unless there is something within the bill that explicitly makes it apply. As I understand it, there is nothing in the Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill that would make it apply to a wild river declaration in terms of issues of consent.


Secondly, the bill that we are currently considering would require a native title agreement regardless of whether a declaration is a future act. It would also apply to Aboriginal lands. Under the bill from the Australian Greens, the references to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People are to be inserted in the objects of the Native Title Act in section 3. That is something that could be very useful and meaningful in terms of the operation of the Native Title Act. But I cannot see how this would make it apply to wild river declarations. So I am looking forward to the bill from the Greens regarding native title reform being brought on, because it contains a number of very worthy reforms. But I cannot see how this bill and the very worthy bill from the Australian Greens would be inconsistent.

Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Minister for Sport, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness) (11:47):  In relation to the amendment from Senator Siewert, while we appreciate all the efforts that have been made, the government opposes the amendment on the basis that we do not believe that the bill that has been put forward by Senator Scullion is workable in any way. Therefore, there is no purpose in amending it.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2011-05-12,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (11:48):  Just briefly, I want to correct the record. There has been so much passion around the chamber today. Everybody has wanted to speak on this bill. Obviously, there will not be the opportunity to bring it to a vote. Senator Siewert, in regards to your amendment, it is terrific to see that you now have some conditionality for your support of our legislation. I accept that. That is a very heartening. I look forward to having some further deliberations with you on that matter. Sadly, it is very difficult to support an amendment that basically says, 'Senator Scullion, if you undertake to support our bill, when our legislation goes through then your legislation will in fact become law.' We have not seen your legislation. I have to say, Senator Siewert, that I am disappointed that you would paint the coalition as not being very focussed on ensuring that Aboriginal people, through land reform, can get a better deal. That is simply not the case.


Sadly, we will not have the opportunity to have a vote on this today. We have had some very interesting contributions, particularly from those opposite. I would like to move very quickly past the fences, the dams, the cows, the chooks and the sandpit, because they fundamentally have nothing to do with this legislation. This legislation intends to ensure that we have the same rights of application over land in a national park, for example, as we do over land in any other case. It is absolutely essential that we go back to providing consent mechanisms for every time any level of government deals with Aboriginal people. It is incumbent upon all of us. I understand the views of the other side, particularly those who come from the cape. I noticed that the North Queenslanders and other Queenslanders got a little bit more agitated than others, as I and my Territory counterparts often do. If we all had our druthers, we and those opposite would possibly be in a more balanced place regarding this issue than we are now. But I have to again say that I do not think it is fair to characterise the views of the people of Cape York as divided so that there are somehow two views. That means that, if one person in a hundred has a different view, there are two views in Cape York. That is not fair. The Cape York Land Council, which represents the vast majority of the land in Cape York and the vast majority of the wild river declarations, had a vote and decided that this should not be supported.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:56):   I move:


   That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



In 1988, Barry Crush was the Master and Chief Engineer of the lighthouse supply vessel MV Candela. During a supply run, the ship was caught in a gale with 35 foot waves and 70 knot winds.


Rushing to secure equipment on deck that could otherwise shift and possibly capsize the ship, Barry fell 10 metres onto the deck.


He broke his back, his ankle and his knee, and suffered massive soft tissue damage.


Barry was forced to stay on the ship while the gale raged for another three days. When he finally reached Port Pirie and medical attention, he was given Panadol and told to rest.


It wasn't until he returned to Adelaide, at the end of the supply run, that his injuries were diagnosed and treated.


It was clear he was no longer able to work.


Barry applied for, and was granted, Comcare payments. 


Over the next 13 years, Barry begged Comcare to reassess his payments, believing they had incorrectly calculated his Normal Weekly Earnings rate incorrectly.


Comcare had, but did not review his rate until 1999. After the review his rate was still incorrect, with Comcare describing his duties wrongly, and asserting he was only authorised to work within the confines of one Port.


Comcare also lost five different applications Barry made for the back pay he was owed.


It wasn't until 2001 that Barry's payments were finally assessed correctly. He received $292,000 in back payments, which did not include interest or any compensation. He lost a third of the amount in tax.


During those thirteen years, Comcare lost Barry's file multiple times, and information on his hard copy file and electronic records still do not match. Comcare also provided incorrect information to the Department of Finance and Deregulation, stating that Barry had received $1 million in entitlements, was paid $50,000 a year, and that there was no underpayment, amongst other incorrect statements.


This incorrect information was later used as the basis to refuse five Act of Grace payment applications from the Department of Finance and Deregulation.


Barry is still fighting to receive the compensation he is owed, including $233,750 of interest on his back payment.


Barry, and others like him, has only one avenue for seeking compensation from organisations such as Comcare, which are not covered by the CDDA Scheme that applies to Financial Management and Accountability Act.


Under section 73 of the Public Service Act 1999, an agency can make discretionary payments in special circumstances.


The subsection this Bill seeks to remove is the one that limits the payments to $100,000. 


If there is no other mechanism in place to deal with compensation claims for agencies that fall outside the CDDA Scheme, then we need to ensure that fair payments can be made through other means.


In 2010, the Commonwealth Ombudsman recommended that a scheme similar to the CDDA Scheme be put in place.


We are still waiting to see if this will happen.


But people like Barry, people who may only just be beginning their own battle for compensation, deserve justice.


They shouldn't have to wait any longer.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Air Cargo) Bill 2011



The legislative framework of Australia's aviation security regime consists of a suite of measures designed to deter and prevent acts of unlawful interference with aviation. The framework is constantly reviewed to ensure it adapts to evolving threats to the security of the Australian aviation industry.


The Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Air Cargo) Bill 2011 (the Bill) contains four key amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 (the Act) to simplify and strengthen the existing security regulatory framework for supply chain security. These amendments are critical in terms of improving security outcomes.


The Bill:


improves Australia's capacity to respond to events of heightened transport security threat;


provides transitionary arrangements to ease the regulatory burden on air cargo industry members while Australia moves to implement the new air cargo security initiatives announced by the Government on 9 February 2010;


allows for training requirements of air cargo industry members to be prescribed by Legislative Instrument which will increase the transparency of training requirements and allow scrutiny by the Parliament; and


simplifies the air cargo clearance process by removing terminology that is not relevant or that is inconsistent with operational procedures used in the air cargo industry.


In late October 2010, terrorists operating from Yemen concealed improvised explosive devices inside printers and sent them as air cargo consignments to the United States of America. Intelligence information led to the successful disruption of this attempted terrorist targeting of the aviation sector. This event reinforced the need to be able to respond quickly to address emerging threats.


The Australian Government took immediate action to protect the travelling public and the Australian aviation sector, strengthening measures against inbound cargo originating from Yemen and Somalia. This was achieved through Special Security Directions issued to Regulated Air Cargo Agents (RACAs) which initially required screening of inbound air cargo arriving directly from the Middle East and later banned carriage of air cargo from Yemen and Somalia.


This Bill continues to strengthen Australia's air cargo security through four measures.


First, this Bill will amend the definition of 'aviation industry participant' to include Accredited Air Cargo Agents. Under the current legislative arrangements, Accredited Air Cargo Agents are not defined as a type of aviation industry participant and therefore are not subject to the full suite of regulatory obligations that apply to aviation industry participants.


Adding Accredited Air Cargo Agents to the definition of aviation industry participants in the Act will allow Special Security Directions to be applied to Accredited Air Cargo Agents in times of heightened security threat and require them to comply with incident reporting requirements. This amendment will provide for consistent security obligations to be applied to all aviation industry participants.


Second, the Bill extends the validity of Regulated Air Cargo Agents' Transport Security Programs to ease the burden on both industry and the Department during the transition to a new air cargo security framework that aligns with world's best practice. The framework was announced by the Government on 9 February 2010 and included the establishment of a Regulated Shipper Scheme and funding to assist industry to procure appropriate examination technology such as x-ray and explosive trace detection equipment to secure air cargo. The proposed transitional provisions will enable the air cargo industry members to determine the most appropriate regulatory scheme for their business, reduce compliance costs and streamline regulatory requirements during the progressive implementation of the new framework. This amendment will extend the validity of existing Transport Security Programs to 31 December 2012 unless the Transport Security Program is revised prior to this date.


Third, the Bill will allow for a Legislative Instrument to clearly prescribe security training requirements for Regulated Air Cargo Agents and Accredited Air Cargo Agents. This will ensure consistency in training outcomes and increase the security of air cargo across the industry. A Legislative Instrument also increases the transparency and scrutiny by the Parliament of the training prescribed.


Finally, the Bill includes some minor technical amendments which will simplify the air cargo clearance process by:


removing 'certification' provisions to accurately reflect operational procedures applied by industry whilst maintaining the integrity of air cargo security measures; and


removing all references to the term 'freight' and replacing them with the term 'cargo'. Cargo is a term which is more relevant to industry practices and terminology, and is consistent with other existing provisions in the Act.


In summary, the Bill will provide a more secure air cargo environment. The proposed amendments:


increase flexibility and responsiveness to situations of heightened security threat;


reduce the regulatory burden and cost to industry members during the progressive transition to the new air cargo security framework;


allow for greater scrutiny, consistency and transparency of training requirements for air cargo industry members; and


simplify terminology appropriate to industry practices and procedures.


Such changes are necessary in the continual refinement and improvement of the security arrangements to ensure Australia is positioned to respond to emerging security threats and continue to meet world's best practice in our transport sector.


 




Customs Amendment (Export Controls And Other Measures) Bill 2011 



This Bill is part of the Government's initiatives to increase the level of security in the export cargo environment by strengthening the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service controls over international export cargo.  The Bill will enhance Customs and Border Protection's ability to respond to specific security concerns and to detect and respond to high-risk export cargo.  


These measures implement the outcomes from a joint Customs and Border Protection and Department of Infrastructure and Transport review, which formed part of the Australian Government's response to the Independent Review of Airport Security and Policing for the Government of Australia (the Wheeler Report).


The measures are both balanced and proportionate to the risks in the export cargo environment; they will not needlessly affect the movement of legitimate export cargo.  


The Bill also proposes changes that will more closely align the legislation with existing air and sea cargo industry export business processes.  These changes address concerns raised by the Australian National Audit Office in its review of the 'Cargo Management Re-engineering Project'.


This Bill will improve Customs and Border Protection's ability to deal with goods in licensed depots and warehouses as well as aligning the procedures and terminology that apply to the two schemes, providing clarity to licence holders.  This includes new provisions for the suspension and cancellation of depot licences.


The Bill will also enable the Chief Executive Officer of Customs to specify conditions on depot and warehouse licences to ensure compliance with other laws of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory, and it will introduce strict liability offences for breaches of licence conditions.   These changes are designed to support the security improvement initiatives relating to export cargo. 


In response to industry suggestions, the Bill will remove a requirement for reporting cargo on board lost or wrecked ships or aircraft where a report has already been made and it will remove some redundant provisions.


Customs and Border Protection has consulted industry extensively on the changes in this Bill through a principles paper in 2008 and the release of an exposure draft of the Bill in February 2011.


 




Family Assistance And Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care And Other Measures) Bill 2011





The 
Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011
 makes a number of administrative amendments to family assistance law to strengthen debt recovery and improve compliance and the administration of the Child Care Benefit
. 





These amendments will make important changes to the Family Assistance Administration Act and other legislation to improve accountability in the child care sector.





We know how important this is.





The overnight collapse of ABC Learning in 2008 was quite simply unprecedented.





The Government
'
s quick and decisive action meant that 90 per cent of these centres continue to operate for Australian families today. 





Had the Government
'
s support not been provided, almost 100,000 families would have had to find alternative care arrangements with little or no notice.





Since 2008 the Government has introduced a range of new measures to ensure the financial viability of child care providers including strengthening approvals processes and requiring additional notification of closures of centres
. 





This Bill will  broaden the powers of the Secretary to refuse the approval of a child care 
service for the purposes of family assistance law, to ensure that operators are fit and proper persons. 





This will give the Australian Government greater scrutiny over operators and their past practices. 





The Bill will also enable the Australian Govern
­
ment to offset and recover payments owed by one service from another services operated by the same operator. 





This will ensure that operators that run up debts to the Commonwealth in one service can be held accountable for their actions.





For instance, this will stop an operator who accumulates debts, and then exits the market, from re-entering the market under a restructured company with similar but not identical directors. 





Under current legislation, the Government can only consider the exact operator and their history in the industry. 





This will facilitate a broader consideration of the child care operators associated organisations and individuals both in the approvals and ongoing approvals processes.





The new approvals processes include financial checks for new child care centre operators to make sure they are viable from the outset and well placed to meet quality standards.





The amendments in this bill represent a part of our commitment to improving accountability within the child care market, and protecting the market from unscrupulous operators
. 





Importantly, the Bill will also support the Government
'
s $273.7 million investment in the National Quality Framework.





The changes to protected information will support the National Quality Framework by enabling the Commonwealth to share information on child care services
'
 with State and Territory regulatory bodies
. 





This will benefit services by not having to provide the same information to more than one body.





The framework, endorsed by COAG, will 



improve educator to child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention;


introduce educator qualification requirements so educators are better able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and help them learn and develop;


include a new ratings system so parents know the quality of care on offer and can make informed choices; and


reduce regulation burden so services only have to deal with one regulator. 




We are doing this because we know from years of international research that the first five years of a child
'
s life shapes their future – their health, learning and social development – and we want to make sure that future is bright.



 




Trans-Tasman Proceedings Amendment and Other Measures Bill 2011



The signing of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement in 1983, and a range of other instruments, has lead to closer business links and greater economic integration between our two countries. 


With this is an increased likelihood of cross-border legal disputes and the need for greater civil legal cooperation arrangements. 


The Trans-Tasman Regime


In 2008, the Australian and the New Zealand Government signed the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand on trans-Tasman Court Proceedings and Regulatory Enforcement.


The Agreement seeks to streamline and simplify arrangements for the service of documents, recognition and enforcement of judgments, obtaining and giving evidence, and appearing remotely in proceedings.


In March last year, this Parliament passed legislation implementing this agreement – the Trans-Tasman Proceedings Act 2010 and consequential legislation. The New Zealand Parliament passed the companion Act in August last year.  


During its passage through Parliament, several amendments were made to the New Zealand Bill in response to parliamentary committee reports and stakeholder comments.


Australia was consulted and agreed to these changes.  


Schedules 1 and 2 of the Bill I am introducing today will address, where necessary, any divergence between the Australian and New Zealand legislation to ensure the effective operation of the cooperative scheme.  The Bill will make minor amendments to harmonise the language and structure of the Australian legislation with the New Zealand Act.  It will also make some minor technical amendments to enhance the internal consistency of the Australian legislation.


Family Law Fee Validation


In addition, this Bill also contains technical measures to retrospectively validate fees charged for de facto financial proceedings under the Family Law Act 1975 in the Family Court of Australia, and certain State and Territory courts.  After most States and Territories referred their relevant powers, jurisdiction under the Family Law Act for de facto financial matters was conferred on the Family Court of Australia, and relevant State and Territory courts, on 1 March 2009.  


A technical error in the amending legislation resulted in an anomaly in the application of the fee provisions of the Family Law Regulations 1984 to de facto financial proceedings.  This affects fees paid on de facto financial matters between 1 March 2009 and 26 November 2010.  The Family Law Regulations 1984 were amended from this latter date to enable the fees to be properly collected.   


It has always been the Government's intention to have the fee apply consistently to de facto and matrimonial disputes under the Family Law Act.  


The measures in Schedule 3 of this Bill would retrospectively correct the anomaly and ensure that the fees applying to de facto financial proceedings were the same as those applying to matrimonial financial proceedings and parenting matters in the relevant period.  


It is anticipated that the Trans-Tasman Proceedings regime will commence in the second half of 2011, after both Australia and New Zealand have put in place the domestic arrangements necessary to comply with the obligations of the 2008 Agreement.


The amendments contained in this Bill are a vital step in this process.


Once implemented, this regime will stand as a significant piece of micro‑economic reform and I commend the Bill.


Debate adjourned.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:33):  Thank you, Mr Acting Chairman.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Mr Chairman is adequate.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Sorry, Mr Chair­man. I want to take up the debate where we left it last night and make the point that the addition of subsection (2) to the existing section 7A of the Sex Discrimination Act is entirely unnecessary in order to achieve the objectives of the act and is enormously burdensome in a regulatory sense. It is very bad legislative practice because it makes the obligations of an employer much less certain and much more vague than they are at the moment and, for that reason, creates very serious opportunities for abuse of the legislation in the form that the government would wish to see it for collateral purposes.


At the risk of going over some territory that was covered last night, let me remind the Senate of the structure of the legislation at the moment. Since 1992 the Sex Discrimination Act has prohibited discri­mination against people on the ground of family responsibilities. 'Family respons­ibilities' is a term defined by the act. It means:




in relation to an employee … responsibilities of the employee to care for or support:





   (a)  a dependent child of the employee; or





   (b)  any other immediate family member who is in need of care and support.



So any employee who has a dependent child, and I suspect that most employees in Australia have dependent children in their households, or who has the care of any other immediate family relatives—for example, a sick spouse, because it can be either temporary or permanent, or perhaps an elderly parent who might live with them or, whether they live with them or not, for whom they have the immediate respon­sibility of a carer—is within the scope of section 7A of the existing act. Let us be clear what we are talking about. I must confess I have not got out the statistics, but I think it would be uncontroversial to say that most employees in Australia have dependent family members, either children or other members of the household. Section 7A of the Sex Discrimination Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against an employee by reason of their family responsibilities. That has been the case since 1992, when section 7A was inserted into the act, and the coalition supports that provision. Indeed, the coalition supports the bill save for three matters, of which the matter we are debating at the moment is the most important. Section 7A, if I may remind the chamber of its terms, says:




For the purposes of this Act, an employer discriminates against an employee on the ground of the employee
'
s family responsibilities if:





(a) the employer treats the employee less favourably than the employer treats, or would treat, a person without family responsibilities in circumstances that are the same or not materially different; and





(b) the less favourable treatment is by reason of—



Remember those words, 'by reason of''—




(i) the family responsibilities of the employee; or





(ii) a characteristic that appertains generally to persons with family responsibilities; or





(iii) a characteristic that is generally imputed to persons with family responsibilities.



I am not quite sure how far (ii) and (iii) of subclause (b) of section 7A take the matter, but, be that as it may, that is a very good law. What it says is that, if you are an employer, you cannot discriminate against an employee because they have family responsibilities in the sense defined. That is a very good law—it has worked well in this country since it was introduced nearly 20 years ago—and it is in no need of reform.


This—called by some commentators 'legislative overreach' or 'legislative creep'—is where parliaments go wrong. It happens when governments take a perfectly good law which is not shown to be in any need of reform and then expand its function way beyond what is necessary to serve the public policy purpose of the relevant legislative instrument. In this case, what the government is proposing to do is to keep section 7A largely in the terms in which it is currently stated and then to add a new subsection—that is, proposed section 7A(2), which would say:




For the purposes of this Act, a person (the discriminator ) discriminates against another person (the aggrieved person) on the ground of the aggrieved person
'
s family responsibilities if the discriminator imposes, or proposes to impose, a condition, requirement or practice that has, or is likely to have, the effect of disadvantaging persons with family responsibilities.



This is what lawyers call an 'effects test'; in other words, whether or not an employer intends to discriminate against a person because of their family responsibilities, the employer would be caught if there was an effect upon people with family responsibilities. Note the difference between the nexus here: section 7A in its existing form, which would be section 7A(1) in the form that the bill proposes, uses the phrase 'by reason of'. This means that there must be a direct relationship between the discrimination and the fact that the victim of the discrimination has family respons­ibilities, and that is absolutely right in the opposition's view. But proposed subsection (2) artlessly—and I use that word with all due respect to the legislative draughtsmen—does not use the phrase 'by reason of'; it uses the preposition 'with'. There is a world of difference between conduct that is prohibited by reason of a fact, matter or circumstance and conduct which affects people who may be defined as having—that is, as being 'with'—that fact matter or circumstance. 'By reason of' establishes a direct nexus; but the preposition 'with' is no sort of nexus at all.


To repeat the example that was given by Parliamentary Secretary Feeney last night, let us take an employee who has school children. This employee takes their children to school each morning, as most parents do. Under the existing law, if that employee's boss was to discriminate—by, as in the example posited by the parliamentary secretary, changing the starting time so as to make it impossible for the employee to take their children to school—against that employee by reason of their family responsibilities, in this case transporting their children to school, that would be against the law and a clear case of discriminating against someone by reason of their family responsibilities. But, under this newly proposed and expanded legislation, if the employer, with no intention to discriminate against employees with school-age children, changed the commencement time at work for a reason entirely unrelated to the family responsibilities of their employees but for perfectly sensible business reasons, because it had an effect upon employees with family responsibilities, they would prima facie be in breach of the law.


I do not know what advice you are getting from the adviser's box, Senator Xenophon, but it will not be as good as the advice that you will be getting from me about the legal effect of an effects test on a provision of this kind. The parliamentary secretary said last night: 'That's all right, because there is a reasonableness test in the existing act. So as long as the employer acted reasonably—for example, for sensible business reasons and not in order to discriminate against empl­oyees with family responsibilities—there wouldn't be a problem.' But there are two flaws in that argument. The first flaw is that it is premised on the law in its existing form—'by reason of'. Secondly, as I pointed out last night, the onus of proving reasonableness lies upon the employer, and that argument only takes place in the court or tribunal or before the Human Rights Commission.


So a perfectly innocent employer—an employer who might be a paragon of egalitarianism, who might have a perfect track record when it comes to treating all of their employees with fairness, who would never dream of discriminating against an employee by reason of their family responsibilities—could, perhaps for a collateral reason, find themselves hauled up before a court or tribunal and the subject of a complaint because an innocent decision they made for perfectly sensible business reasons has an effect on an employee with family responsibilities, not by reason of their family responsibilities but merely because there were family responsibilities. The difference between the preposition 'with' and the phrase 'by reason of' makes all the difference in a court of law. This employer—probably a small business operator—would then find themselves having to spend tens of thousands of dollars on lawyers to try to establish that they behaved reasonably. Under section 7C of the existing act, the onus of proof lies upon the employer to prove that their conduct was reasonable.


This is not law reform; this is obfuscation. This is taking a perfectly good law—a law that has bipartisan support in this parliament—and, either through inadver­tence or for some more sinister reason, expanding its reach so far that it destroys the legislative intent of the existing act.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (12:48):  I begin on the point that my colleague Senator Brandis finished on. I have looked through the government's second reading speech on this bill, and I am struck by the fact that there is no case for change here. As Senator Brandis has outlined, this law functions well and it functions with cross-party support. I have read parts of the submissions from the committee but I have not read of a concern that it is not doing what it was intended, that it is not effectively protecting the rights of men and women around Australia, and particularly those with family respon­sibilities. No case has been established to do what Senator Brandis outlined—which was to dramatically widen the potential impact of the law.


Laws that have effects tests are quite dangerous. Senator Brandis outlined that it can be a case of legislative overreach. I would put to the chamber that a law that could see a great number of people—as Senator Brandis describes 'paragons of egalitarianism'—being drawn before a commission, a tribunal or a court completely unaware that what they may have done may now be in breach of the law is actually a reflection on the law itself, not necessarily the persons being drawn before it.


There is a particular concern that I have here, which is that I see this as yet another example of a law drafted by the Labor government that is fine for large businesses. It may be fine if you are BHP, Coles or Woolworths, with a large human resources department, processes in place that actually allow for staff to be moved around and a lot more capacity to move your staff around in order to take into account family responsibilities—to be a good employer. But, while we all support a law that prevents intentional discrimination—'by reason of', as Senator Brandis outlined—I have concerns about a law that dramatically limits the capacity of a small business with two or three employees to undertake what would otherwise be legitimate management of resources, where there was no allegation that someone was being discriminated against by reason of their family responsibilities. I think this is yet another example of the Labor Party's misunderstanding or, in this case, complete lack of understanding of the management burdens, the red tape burdens, that government imposes on smaller businesses.


I have worked in large businesses and I have worked in small businesses. It is very easy when you work for a company with thousands of employees for employers to accommodate the needs of staff—and they can be due to personal circumstance or family circumstance. The public sector is a classic example where flexible work arrange­ments are much easier to accommodate. It is much harder for a cafe employing two or three people to do so. It does not necessarily mean that, because a wish cannot be accommodated, that person is being discriminated against by reason of their family responsibilities. But to draw the law this broad and to potentially draw those people into the net because they do not have the means to comply is, I think, a step too far. Whether it is an unintended consequ­ence, I do not know. But I think it is a classic case of a complete lack of understanding of those resource constraints. I also have a concern that was expressed also during the debate on the Fair Work bills. That is: laws that are, by their nature, vague and difficult to comply with—even though it might be only a few words, even though it might seem like a fairly insignificant test to many in this place—impose a much more significant compliance burden than the words thems­elves would convey, because of the very vagueness of their terms. There could be a lack of certainty on the part of a business owner or a manager in the application of this new section proposed by the Labor government. If you do not know all the circumstances of an employee, how do you know the possible effects on their family circumstances of a decision you might make? I do not think it is reasonable. We have privacy laws. We do not necessarily want employers to be able to demand all the information about the family circumstances of their employees. But how can we judge them on the effect of their decisions if there is no allegation whatsoever that that person is being discriminated against because of their family responsibilities? I do not think these views are unreasonable, because I do not think that anyone in this parliament would say that there should be a capacity to discriminate because of family respon­sibilities. I do not, and I think that people of my generation, who went to school in the 1980s and finished university in the 1990s, come from a very different world. We cannot even contemplate a situation where women do not have the same opportunities as we do. 


Australia has undergone quite dramatic change, and this law—which, as Senator Brandis outlined, is working very effectively and is supported across the parliament—is one of the reflections of that change. We are not proposing anything that would water it down. But a law that creates this degree of vagueness, a law that could unintentionally drag a lot of people into a net that is not based on the intent of their conduct, that is not based on discriminating against someone because of their family responsibilities, is, in fact, not a good law.


There are other ways in which we can go about supporting families, and governments of both persuasions have done so. But I think there is a limit to what we can legitimately expect our small businesses to undertake. This reflects a number of the concerns with the Fair Work bills. Under the Fair Work Act there is a right to request to have considered legitimate work arrangements because of family responsibilities, but again the clause is so vague. Even industrial relations lawyers and barristers cannot tell me what it means, because everyone is waiting to find out what the various rulings of Fair Work Australia—and then probably the Federal Court after that—actually mean in practice. We know that those laws are going to be expanded and expounded as more cases are brought before the bench in both instances. This government cannot even set up a Fair Work assistance line for a small business to ring when they want to ask, 'How much do I have to pay my employee?' With the modernisation of awards happening mainly outside my home state of Victoria, and because of the unique situation Victoria was in with respect to industrial relations for many years, a small business cannot ring up and ask, 'How much do I actually pay the assistant in the pharmacy?' or, 'How much do I pay the waiter in the cafe?' Fair Work Australia does not give an answer or, if you wait on hold for a couple of hours, it will give you a vague answer. It will not give you an answer to which it is binding, and that answer cannot be relied upon if you are subsequently found, despite having acted in all good faith, to have acted incorrectly.



Senator Ludwig interjecting—




Senator RYAN:
  My point simply is, Senator Ludwig, that the creation of vague aspirational language in legislation, which happens more in the United States than it does here, is not something that has traditionally come out of the Australian parliament. We have tended to apply tests, as Senator Brandis outlined, that are more about purpose than effects. I do not necessarily like them in competition law, as I am sure some of my colleagues know after debates we have had over the last few weeks. But in this case, vague aspirational language does not do anything to advance the cause and could actually serve to undermine support if people who are acting in good faith and are virtuous employees in every sense are being inadvertently dragged in because of a vaguely drafted section inserted in the act.

 (Tasmania) (12:57):  I would like to speak in support of the amendments that have been put by Senator Brandis and that Senator Ryan has just spoken to. I wanted to note upfront that some of the points that have been expressed are consistent with and relate to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report, which was delivered in March—less than two months ago. That related to the dissenting report of the Liberal senators. In that report we referred to concerns we had about the overreach of the government's proposal with respect to family responsibilities. We said:


Liberal Senators do not support provisions of the Bill which would either expand the scope of the Sex Discrimination Act or broaden the definition of sexual harassment.


There was no evidence presented to the inquiry of any systemic or widespread discrimination on the grounds of responsibilities or circumstances of sexual harassment which are not currently adequately addressed by existing legislation. There was no evidence, that we could see, that was brought before the committee of inquiry that said that there were grounds of discrimination based on family respon­sibilities. The government clearly, in my view, have overreached in drafting the bill the way they have. The Liberal senators' dissenting report that was tabled in March does express concern about that. It also says, in 1.10, that we:


… are concerned that the combined effect of the recommendations relating to sexual harassment and family responsibilities would be to impose significant compliance costs on employers and would encourage and facilitate unfounded claims. 


Whether they are unfounded or not, there will be claims made, and if they are without foundation they will cost a lot of money. They will cost small businesses, medium businesses and larger businesses—but small businesses in particular—money. Not only that; it will be a red-tape hassle for them. There is the concern that they will have to respond to these claims, take time out of their busy schedules and respond to those. We say in our report:


In the absence of any clear basis for these changes, or evidence of systemic failure of the current legislative regime, any implementation of these recommendations is not supported.


I am thrilled and very thankful that Senator Brandis—after considering this, and no doubt after talking to business people and liaising with his colleagues—has put this amendment forward, consistent with our views made in the dissenting Liberal senators' report. We have made a number of other observations in our report. Of course we support much of the bill; but we do not agree to expanding the scope. 


Many witnesses appeared before our committee and many submissions were received. In fact, I have just noticed in this report that we actually received 21 submissions. There are the various groups who were very supportive, and others expressing different views. We had women's groups, Family Association of Australia, Office of the Anti-Discrimination Comm­issioner of Tasmania, Human Rights Law Resource Centre, Independent Education Union, Women's Legal Services New South Wales, Council on the Ageing, Uniting Church, Family Voice, Thomsons Lawyers, Equal Opportunity Commission Western Australia, National Seniors and a range of others. We thought long and hard about this, and I am disappointed that we have had to come to this juncture because our committee, the legal and constitutional affairs comm­ittee, commands a lot of respect and is held in high regard in this place and around the country. We get it right pretty much most of the time—and quite often we have unani­mous reports, and they are well received and well regarded. But on this occasion the Liberal senators provided a dissenting report, because we think that the government has just gone too far. 


The bill was brought in on 30 September 2010 and it was on 8 February this year that the Senate agreed to extend the reporting date to 22 March, which is when we delivered this committee report. So we have expressed our views. The report is quite comprehensive. Can I just note that there were some 50-odd pages in the report, including our dissenting report.


More specifically, with respect to the amendment before us, I think there is a real problem here. I think there is a real problem for small business in particular. I think there is a problem for microbusiness. About 82 per cent of small businesses in Australia are microbusinesses—that is, five or fewer people in the business. I was formerly a member of the federal government's micro­business consultative committee, appointed by Peter Reith, prior to my time in the Senate. I established, owned and oper­ated my own small business and employed some 15 people, based in Hobart and Canberra, so I know what it is like. I was also an advocate for various small businesses and various small business organisations, including the Tasmanian Independent Retailers, the National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia and a range of other business groups. In particular, I tried to advocate for small businesses. So, in this regard, let me just say: they are being dudded. If this bill goes ahead in its current form, you will find that small business will be impacted. The men, women and families behind those small businesses who have their necks on the line, will be impacted, because the bill in its current form has unintended consequences. 


I am afraid to say that the government has put forward no clear evidence or adequate arguments to the contrary, other than saying it should be 'reasonable'. That is not good enough, because of the way the bill is drafted; it is an effects test. It is quite clear that an employer or manager may not have any idea of the family responsibilities of an employee. The point is that, if they do know and are fully aware of the family respon­sibilities of the employee and if they treat that person differently, perhaps in a less favourable way than if they did not have those family responsibilities, clearly that is discrimination, and that is something the coalition and the parliament do not support. But if you have a situation where an employer has no idea of the particular family responsibilities and changes their work arrangements—the time to arrive at work, the lunchtime break, the time to depart and go home or make them work on a different day of the week—you cannot automatically say that they are being discriminatory. But they will be subject to the full force of the law. That means they will have to face an allegation and a claim. They will have to respond to that. That will take time and effort and resources. You have to remember that many of these small businesses—let's face it, most of them are microbusinesses—are in their businesses. We take our hats off to them for the time, effort and resources they do put in. They work long and hard. They are going to have to take time off to respond to those claims and prepare their own paperwork. They may employ a local solicitor or lawyer to act on their behalf, but whether or not they do, it will take time, effort and money—and, frankly, unfairly so.


As Senator Brandis noted, this bill first passed this parliament in 1992, so we are looking at nearly 20 years of success where the foundation legislation has been in force and effect and the parliament has had no issues or problems at all with family responsibilities being protected and people not being discriminated against based on their family responsibilities. That is what we are saying. What the government have done is go overboard. It is very disappointing that this has occurred. I am not sure whether it is a drafting error or oversight, or whether they got caught up by some of the submissions and claims made by some of the perhaps more left-oriented groups who are pushing for this type of legislation. I do not know, and I am not identifying any particular group or entity. Unless the way the bill is currently drafted is changed and these amendments are successful, clearly small business will be subject to the full force of the law, and the consequences will flow. That is really the problem and the effect of this legislation in its current form.


Having said all of that, I draw the attention of senators to this report, and in particular to the Liberal senators' dissenting report towards the end of the document. That is definitely worth reading because it gives you a little bit of background as to why Senator Brandis has chosen to move, on behalf of the coalition, these amendments to protect the interests of not only small business but the public. We are talking across-the-board here about providing good legislation that is transparent, accountable and properly drafted. I look forward in this committee stage to hearing the minister's response to the views expressed by Senator Brandis, Senator Ryan and me. I hope the minister sees reason and takes on board the concerns that have been expressed by coalition senators.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:10):  I want to go back to a number of issues that have caused the coalition very deep concern about this bill—that is what I have described as the bad legislative practice involved in imposing obligations of an uncertain, open-ended character upon citizens. It is fundamental to good law making—and we as the house of review ought to pride this as being one of our core values when we review bills that come from the House of Representatives, when we consider amendments and when we consider proposed bills—that we make the obligations and burdens that we impose upon citizens as narrow as possible but, even more importantly, as certain as possible. One of the deep concerns we in the opposition have is that this bill takes an obligation which is tolerably certain—existing section 7A of the Sex Discrimination Act has been part of the law of Australia since 1992 and there has been an accumulation of case law and precedent so that the concept of discriminating against employees by reason of their family responsibilities is tolerably well-known and clear—and, through either incompetence or indifference to the consequences that the bill would have, substitutes that tolerably certain obligation with a greatly uncertain obligation so that all it would take for a perfectly well-meaning, innocent, virtuous employer to find themselves in breach of the law is for a decision they make in the workplace to have a different effect upon people with family responsibilities than it has upon people without family responsibilities.


Examples of the vice of this are endless. For example, if an employer changed the hours of work for a perfectly sensible commercial reason, it may have a different bearing upon employees with kids than upon employees without kids. People who have children in their household, which as I said earlier I suspect are most people in the workforce in Australia these days, lead different lives. Because the nexus in proposed clause 7A(2) in the bill is so vague by the use of the preposition 'with' almost any commercial decision that any businessperson makes that has a bearing upon their employees could potentially be made unlawful by this foolish provision if the effects of that decision on people with children or other dependent relatives in the household were different from the effects on single people among that business's workforce. Let us take wages. We know that people with the responsibilities of children have less disposable income than people without children. The swinging single with the flamboyant lifestyle is a well-known subgroup of our population. People like that have great lives, lives free of responsibility to others. Because they do not have the responsibilities that a person in the workplace doing the same job but with kids has—who has to feed the kids, clothe the kids, pay school fees for the kids, outlay all of the other costs that having a child or children in the household involves—then of course their disposable income is much greater.


Let us say the employer decides to give a wage increase to his workers because he thinks: 'These are very good workers, these workers of mine. They're very industrious. My business has done very well because I've got a great workforce, so I'm going to give them all a wage increase.' And let us say the business employs two boilermakers at the same level and on the same salary. One of those boilermakers is a man with two kids and the other boilermaker who earns the same salary is a swinging single boilermaker who pockets most of his wage and spends it I hate to think how. And the employer says, 'I'm going to give you both a wage rise of 20 per cent.' What that means is that the swinging single's disposable income, as a percentage of his actual income, will increase by more than the disposable income of the boilermaker who is a parent. Now that would put that employer, as a result of that act of generosity towards his workforce, in breach of proposed section 7A(2) prima facie because that decision in the workplace of the employer would have a different effect upon the boilermaker who was a father than upon the boilermaker who kept most of his disposable income because he did not have children. How foolish is that?


And it is not as if the existing provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act are not good enough because section 7A of the act in its existing form completely covers the ground of conduct which ought to be made unlawful because it is an outright prohibition on discriminating against people by reason of their family responsibilities. That is the law. As people used to say some years ago during the famous republican referendum: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. This law is a good law. As a Liberal committed to antidiscrimination laws, I wholeheartedly support it and I do not want to see it ruined by legislative overreach by the legislature, in an artless and incompetent and gauche fashion, extending the law beyond its appropriate ambit.


Let us go back to my two boilermakers and their indulgent, generous employer. Were this legislation to be enacted, the employer may well be advised by his solicitor: 'I know you want to give your employees a raise, but I don't think you should do that because you've got employees with family responsibilities and employees without family responsibilities and, if you did, you'd be in breach of section 7A(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act, vouchsafed to us by the Gillard government and a negligent Senate.' And the employer would say to his lawyer: 'You've got to be kidding! No body of parliamentarians would be so stupid as to pass a law that in fact prevents me improving the conditions of my workforce merely because the effect on the lives of my staff might be different depending on whether they are single or have kids.' And yet that is what this would do. And then the government, which is being very badly advised I am bound to say—you need to get better lawyers, Senator Ludwig—comes back and says: 'No, that couldn't possibly happen because there's a reasonableness test. As long as it can be seen that the decision of the employer is reasonable then they're not in trouble.' That is all very well, but for the fact that there is a reverse onus. So the onus is cast upon the employer to show that their conduct is reasonable. It is absolutely bad and incompetent legislative practice to create a prima facie liability, a prima facie illegality, and say, 'That's all right, it doesn't matter that we've put you prima facie in breach of the laws of the Commonwealth because, if anybody takes you up on this, you'll have the opportunity to prove to the court that you acted reasonably.' That is not what parliament ought to be doing. That is not the way in which we make laws. We do not put people prima facie in breach of the law because they happen to run a business that employs both people with family responsibilities and people without. Of course, the biggest vice in this is that employers are going to think to themselves: 'My hands will be tied because any decision I make about wages and conditions or terms of employment, if it has a different bearing on people with or without family responsibilities, might land me in breach of the law. So I'm just not going to hire people with family responsibilities. I'm going to have an engineering shed composed entirely of swinging single boilermakers. How's that for discrimination!' Now, that would be discrimination. But, of course, it is very easy to mask discrimination in recruitment practices. As those of us who have practised in this area of the law would know—as I have done, albeit not very often but on occasions—it is much easier to mask discrimination in recruitment practices than it is in relation to conduct with existing employees.


This is the problem with legislative overreach: the law of unintended conseq­uences always applies. If you, my colleagues in the Senate, were to pass this law, what you would be doing is creating a disincentive for businesses, particularly for small businesses, to take on employees to whom this foolish proposed section 7A(2) might apply. For all of those reasons, the opposition opposes this amendment although we support the body of the bill.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:25):  I want to put some questions to the government in relation to this. I have been listening carefully to Senator Brandis and I have had an opportunity to discuss this matter further with him. And I am, of course, grateful to the government for the discussions I have had with them in relation to this. Let me make it clear, so that there is no misunderstanding for anyone who is listening or who reads the Hansard in relation to this, that proposed section 7A(1) is a reworking of the current section 7A of the Sex Discrimination Act and makes it very clear that, if a person discriminates against another person on the ground of the aggrieved person's family responsibilities, that is an offence, that is prohibited—as it should be. Also, it ought to be read in the context of section 7B in that, with indirect discrimination, there is a reasonableness test, and in section 7C of the act there is effectively a reverse onus of proof. Normally, a reverse onus of proof is something you would be quite cautious about, but I think it is appropriate to have a reverse onus of proof in the scheme of this legislation in order for the legislation to be effective. But here we have a situation, with subclause (2), where what is proposed is that, if a person discriminates against another person on the ground of the aggrieved person's family responsibilities, if the discriminator imposes or proposes to impose a condition, requirement or practice that has or is likely to have the effect of disadvan­taging persons with family responsibilities, there is a reverse onus of proof. The concern I have—and I would be very grateful if the minister could give his views in relation to this—is that, in the whole context of this particular subclause, there is no cause and effect. It would make it much easier for a claim without any particular substance to be brought against an employer, a small business person—a person who does not have the resources of a BHP Billiton or a Commonwealth Bank. That employer would have to be dragged through the courts and would then have to rely on section 7B of the act and also on section 7C, where there is a reverse onus of proof. So the onus is on the employer to show that what they did was reasonable—and there are considerable costs involved in that. That is my concern in relation to indirect discrimination. I do not support the opposition's other amendments, I want to make that clear, but I am concerned about unintended consequences in the context of the proposed section 7A(2) of this bill. By having the words 'with family responsibilities', there is no requirement for cause and effect, and that causes me real concern about whether there could be unintended consequences in relation to this bill.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (13:29):  Thank you, Senator Xenophon, for your question. If you read it through, it says that for the purposes of this act a person discriminates against another person on the ground of the aggrieved person's family responsibilities if the discriminator 'imposes, or proposes to impose, a condition, requirement or practice that has, or is likely to have, the effect of disadvantaging a person with family responsibilities'. That is true. You have to put it in the context of the whole section, which does have both a reasonableness test together with the reversal of the onus of proof. In other words, if you read 7A(1), it says:




For the purposes of this act … if
,
 by reason of—



and it goes through (a), (b) and (c) and then (2), because this section 7A is reflected in a range of pieces of state and territory legislation dealing with family responsibilities. But the broad issue around this section itself, which is an indirect discrimination provision which is also found in similar terms in other legislation, is about dealing with circumstances where there is indirect discrimination. If you removed 7A(1) and (2) completely—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator LUDWIG:
  If you removed the provision you would then leave a hole in the ability of the legislation to deal with indirect discrimination. That is the effect of what you would do. I know Senator Brandis interjects. I listened to him in silence, notwithstanding what I would have regarded as some pretty spurious straw-man reasoning together with some pretty wild Chicken Little arguments. Nonetheless, I will not be drawn. The provisions have been drafted very carefully by competent draftspersons to ensure that we do capture the issues around indirect discrimination, so not only those ones which are itemised in 7A through to 'if, by reason of: (a), (b) and (c)' but also those in (2) for the purposes of this act. Ultimately, the argument around this issue that employers will not be able to get on with their daily work is, I think, falsely premised.


This same argument that 'the sky will fall down' was articulated way back in 1984 when the legislation dealing with discrim­ination first came in, and of course the sky did not fall in and employers managed competently to address these issues. The Australian Human Rights Commission has managed quite competently over that long period to deal with areas where both can be right, or both can be wrong, or one is wrong and one is right, as between the employer and the employee in these issues. Yes, there are through the course of events circumstances which are thrown up where employees might feel discriminated against, either indirectly or directly, and they may find themselves pursuing an issue within the Australian Human Rights Commission. But common sense, I have found over the last 20 years, has prevailed in these arguments. Of course there are employers who quite rightly do believe that the actions they take are nondiscriminatory, that they are bastions of good employers and their actions, they believe wholeheartedly, are nondiscrim­inatory either in truth or in effect. But on a clear and close examination, objectively by another, they do discriminate, maybe indirectly, maybe directly. That is why we do have provisions in legislation like this for the purposes of dealing with both direct discrimination and indirect discrimination and why (2) deals with the effect of disadvantaging persons with family respon­sibilities.


These are sensible amendments. We have spent a considerable amount of time ventilating them, but I will take a couple more minutes on this. I have now had an opportunity this morning to go back and reapprise myself of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report. The committee ultimately recom­mended that this bill be passed and it made some suggestions. I do recognise that the coalition took a different course. The Liberal senators recommended that the bill be amended, and we are now dealing in part with some of their recommendations. So there is a genuine disagreement that is again being ventilated here. That is not to take away either of the arguments, but on balance the government believes firmly that the provisions that it has put up and that the Senate committee by a majority recom­mended, should be passed. The government continues to believe that the provisions are reasonable and will operate reasonably in the workplace and between employers and employees, and will not have the disastrous effects of causing a business to cease or that people will only employ male boilermakers in the workplace. With all of those things I think we are really getting beyond what I would call rational debate in the Senate. I think the arguments, although well pre­sented, miss the point of the whole piece. This is about ensuring that we do capture indirect discrimination in this area, and the drafters have achieved that in 7A(1) and 7A(2). We as adults can disagree. On this basis, Senator Brandis clearly disagrees that we have captured it accurately and correctly. I do not share his view and I have listened intently to the arguments he has put forward. They have not persuaded me, although I think Senator Brandis would have expected that they were not going to persuade me in any event. When I look at the provisions themselves, for my own sake I still remain unconvinced that his arguments have any merit.


To put it another way, it seems to be that these provisions would operate in a commonsense way in any event. That is how legislation has operated in this area for a very long time and it continues to operate that way. I would encourage the opposition to understand that pointing to unbelievable circumstances is a device that we all use occasionally in this place. It does provide colour and movement to use extreme examples, but the practicality of it is that these are sensible amendments, they will work and they will operate to ensure that family responsibilities will be taken into account and that employers will not discriminate, either indirectly or directly, against someone who has family responsibilities. It is a matter that is currently provided for in ensuring that we do have balanced rights for families to assist them to balance their work and family respon­sibilities. We do want to accommodate flexibility where it can be accommodated within the workforce. Employers should be able to flexibly meet those requirements.


Equally, we recognise the pressure on small businesses themselves, particularly small-business owners. The issues raised by Senator Barnett were apposite. We do have to ensure that small business can get on with the work that they do well and the bill does not require businesses to make unreasonable arrangements. In practical terms, it will not require employers to make themselves aware of all circumstances of their employees because an employee could hardly claim to have been refused flexible arrangements without first having discussed these with their employer.


I find from my interactions with small business that they regard their employees as part of the business, they talk to them daily, they discuss many of the issues we are talking about and they work around all these issues I have described. Small business generally knows their employees quite personally. Where you have one, two, three or four employees in the workplace, it would be unusual for employers not to know them personally or not to know their personal circumstances. But it may happen.


Many of the arguments that are being progressed today for some hour are misplaced. We do not support Senator Brandis's amendments. We will continue to press for the amendments which have been drafted. I have probably now provoked further discussion on this but, in answering your original question, we do not think it has the effect you have outlined. We think it will act reasonably.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:41):  I thank the minister for his response. I still have reservations about the potential operation of subclause (2), not subclause (1)—that is not an issue--which is largely a restatement of the existing section 7A of the act. My problem is with the third to last word in subclause (2), the word 'with', not 'because of', not 'due to' and not 'as a direct result of' family responsibilities. It is the word 'with' that I think extends it in a way that may not be reasonable, that will not enhance the operation of the act and that could well lead to the unintended consequence of litigation in the context of section 7B, which gives a reasonableness test. With section 7C there is a reverse onus of proof. I have reservations about this particular subclause. That is why I have difficulty in supporting it.


I make it clear that this is not about taking away the rights of those who have family responsibility. That is clearly in the legislation as it is now and it is restated in proposed subclause (1). I think there will be some very real issues here in litigation. I am not convinced that there will not be some adverse consequences for small businesses and I am concerned at the impact it may have in the way that small businesses regard the employment of those individuals with families. For Senator Ludwig—for whom I have enormous respect—to say that the sky did not fall in—no, it did not.


Anti-discrimination legislation is an essential feature of a civil society, but let us not have something that could well be contrary to the aims of that legislation, something that I think could lead to the legislation having consequences that were not intended and something that will cause damage all round, to those it is seeking to protect and to those that could be the subject of litigation.

 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:54):  I thank the Leader of the Government in the Senate for his courtesy in this regard. That then is the way we will proceed. In view of the time there are two other amendments which are on the sheet circulated in my name—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (13:55):  I think perhaps you should postpone consideration of amendments (2), (3) and (5) before moving on to the next one.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I accept your guidance because the opposition wants to consider its position in relation to amendments (4) and (6). Amendments (2), (3) and (5) are, and I think it is uncontroversial, consequential upon amend­ment No. (1) which was the subject of the division which has just been held. I seek leave to speak to amendments (2), (3) and (5) together.


Leave granted.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am mindful of the time. Let me just say this: amendment (2) is essentially a renumbering amendment which would reflect the shape of the act in the event that the principal opposition amendment—that is, the deletion of item 18—were to have been carried. Amendment (3) is also essentially a renumbering amendment which again would reflect the shape of the act in the event that if opposition amendment (1) were to be carried out, item 18 would be deleted from the bill.


Once again, opposition amendment (5) which would omit from item 65, which itself is a series of amendments to section 41A(2) of the act, would take the form of taking from section 41A(2) those words which would only have been introduced if amendment (1) which is, if I may describe it as such, the 'head' amendment were to be carried. What I anticipate will happen is that the Senate, as indicated by the Leader of the Government after taking note, will recommit the vote. The coalition senator concerned will, I anticipate in conformity with the courtesies and protocols of this place, make a brief explanation for his unintended absence. I am sure there was a confusion of some kind and, in the event that the opposition's principal amendment were to succeed on an equality of votes, then I would not anticipate there to be any controversy about opposition amendments (2), (3) and (5) which I imagine would be allowed to go through on the voices. That is where it stands at the moment and I do not know that I can take the matter any further. I am mindful of the time and I am mindful in particular that question—




Senator Carr:
  You are obviously mindful of the time, you have said the same thing for the last five minutes.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Carr, with respect, if you had been listening—



Senator Carr interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Carr, I am so often in your debt! What I in fact was doing in a slightly more painstaking fashion than is usual was explaining the textual changes to the act which would have been brought about by each of the three consequential amendments, which, as I pointed out—




Senator Carr:
  So why don't we say it all again?




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am not going to say it all again, Senator Carr. I am sure that your intellectual command would have been sufficient to understand it the first time had you been listening. So by your interjection I am afraid that you reveal that you were not listening, which causes me to be very disappointed in you, Senator Carr. Never­theless that is the course we propose to take and once again I thank the Leader of the Government in the Senate for his customary courtesy.

I want to take up the debate where we left it last night and make the point that the addition of subsection (2) to the existing section 7A of the Sex Discrimination Act is entirely unnecessary in order to achieve the objectives of the act and is enormously burdensome in a regulatory sense. It is very bad legislative practice because it makes the obligations of an employer much less certain and much more vague than they are at the moment and, for that reason, creates very serious opportunities for abuse of the legislation in the form that the government would wish to see it for collateral purposes.


At the risk of going over some territory that was covered last night, let me remind the Senate of the structure of the legislation at the moment. Since 1992 the Sex Discrimination Act has prohibited discri­mination against people on the ground of family responsibilities. 'Family respons­ibilities' is a term defined by the act. It means:




in relation to an employee … responsibilities of the employee to care for or support:





   (a)  a dependent child of the employee; or





   (b)  any other immediate family member who is in need of care and support.



So any employee who has a dependent child, and I suspect that most employees in Australia have dependent children in their households, or who has the care of any other immediate family relatives—for example, a sick spouse, because it can be either temporary or permanent, or perhaps an elderly parent who might live with them or, whether they live with them or not, for whom they have the immediate respon­sibility of a carer—is within the scope of section 7A of the existing act. Let us be clear what we are talking about. I must confess I have not got out the statistics, but I think it would be uncontroversial to say that most employees in Australia have dependent family members, either children or other members of the household. Section 7A of the Sex Discrimination Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against an employee by reason of their family responsibilities. That has been the case since 1992, when section 7A was inserted into the act, and the coalition supports that provision. Indeed, the coalition supports the bill save for three matters, of which the matter we are debating at the moment is the most important. Section 7A, if I may remind the chamber of its terms, says:




For the purposes of this Act, an employer discriminates against an employee on the ground of the employee
'
s family responsibilities if:





(a) the employer treats the employee less favourably than the employer treats, or would treat, a person without family responsibilities in circumstances that are the same or not materially different; and





(b) the less favourable treatment is by reason of—



Remember those words, 'by reason of''—




(i) the family responsibilities of the employee; or





(ii) a characteristic that appertains generally to persons with family responsibilities; or





(iii) a characteristic that is generally imputed to persons with family responsibilities.



I am not quite sure how far (ii) and (iii) of subclause (b) of section 7A take the matter, but, be that as it may, that is a very good law. What it says is that, if you are an employer, you cannot discriminate against an employee because they have family responsibilities in the sense defined. That is a very good law—it has worked well in this country since it was introduced nearly 20 years ago—and it is in no need of reform.


This—called by some commentators 'legislative overreach' or 'legislative creep'—is where parliaments go wrong. It happens when governments take a perfectly good law which is not shown to be in any need of reform and then expand its function way beyond what is necessary to serve the public policy purpose of the relevant legislative instrument. In this case, what the government is proposing to do is to keep section 7A largely in the terms in which it is currently stated and then to add a new subsection—that is, proposed section 7A(2), which would say:




For the purposes of this Act, a person (the discriminator ) discriminates against another person (the aggrieved person) on the ground of the aggrieved person
'
s family responsibilities if the discriminator imposes, or proposes to impose, a condition, requirement or practice that has, or is likely to have, the effect of disadvantaging persons with family responsibilities.



This is what lawyers call an 'effects test'; in other words, whether or not an employer intends to discriminate against a person because of their family responsibilities, the employer would be caught if there was an effect upon people with family responsibilities. Note the difference between the nexus here: section 7A in its existing form, which would be section 7A(1) in the form that the bill proposes, uses the phrase 'by reason of'. This means that there must be a direct relationship between the discrimination and the fact that the victim of the discrimination has family respons­ibilities, and that is absolutely right in the opposition's view. But proposed subsection (2) artlessly—and I use that word with all due respect to the legislative draughtsmen—does not use the phrase 'by reason of'; it uses the preposition 'with'. There is a world of difference between conduct that is prohibited by reason of a fact, matter or circumstance and conduct which affects people who may be defined as having—that is, as being 'with'—that fact matter or circumstance. 'By reason of' establishes a direct nexus; but the preposition 'with' is no sort of nexus at all.


To repeat the example that was given by Parliamentary Secretary Feeney last night, let us take an employee who has school children. This employee takes their children to school each morning, as most parents do. Under the existing law, if that employee's boss was to discriminate—by, as in the example posited by the parliamentary secretary, changing the starting time so as to make it impossible for the employee to take their children to school—against that employee by reason of their family responsibilities, in this case transporting their children to school, that would be against the law and a clear case of discriminating against someone by reason of their family responsibilities. But, under this newly proposed and expanded legislation, if the employer, with no intention to discriminate against employees with school-age children, changed the commencement time at work for a reason entirely unrelated to the family responsibilities of their employees but for perfectly sensible business reasons, because it had an effect upon employees with family responsibilities, they would prima facie be in breach of the law.


I do not know what advice you are getting from the adviser's box, Senator Xenophon, but it will not be as good as the advice that you will be getting from me about the legal effect of an effects test on a provision of this kind. The parliamentary secretary said last night: 'That's all right, because there is a reasonableness test in the existing act. So as long as the employer acted reasonably—for example, for sensible business reasons and not in order to discriminate against empl­oyees with family responsibilities—there wouldn't be a problem.' But there are two flaws in that argument. The first flaw is that it is premised on the law in its existing form—'by reason of'. Secondly, as I pointed out last night, the onus of proving reasonableness lies upon the employer, and that argument only takes place in the court or tribunal or before the Human Rights Commission.


So a perfectly innocent employer—an employer who might be a paragon of egalitarianism, who might have a perfect track record when it comes to treating all of their employees with fairness, who would never dream of discriminating against an employee by reason of their family responsibilities—could, perhaps for a collateral reason, find themselves hauled up before a court or tribunal and the subject of a complaint because an innocent decision they made for perfectly sensible business reasons has an effect on an employee with family responsibilities, not by reason of their family responsibilities but merely because there were family responsibilities. The difference between the preposition 'with' and the phrase 'by reason of' makes all the difference in a court of law. This employer—probably a small business operator—would then find themselves having to spend tens of thousands of dollars on lawyers to try to establish that they behaved reasonably. Under section 7C of the existing act, the onus of proof lies upon the employer to prove that their conduct was reasonable.


This is not law reform; this is obfuscation. This is taking a perfectly good law—a law that has bipartisan support in this parliament—and, either through inadver­tence or for some more sinister reason, expanding its reach so far that it destroys the legislative intent of the existing act.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (12:48):  I begin on the point that my colleague Senator Brandis finished on. I have looked through the government's second reading speech on this bill, and I am struck by the fact that there is no case for change here. As Senator Brandis has outlined, this law functions well and it functions with cross-party support. I have read parts of the submissions from the committee but I have not read of a concern that it is not doing what it was intended, that it is not effectively protecting the rights of men and women around Australia, and particularly those with family respon­sibilities. No case has been established to do what Senator Brandis outlined—which was to dramatically widen the potential impact of the law.


Laws that have effects tests are quite dangerous. Senator Brandis outlined that it can be a case of legislative overreach. I would put to the chamber that a law that could see a great number of people—as Senator Brandis describes 'paragons of egalitarianism'—being drawn before a commission, a tribunal or a court completely unaware that what they may have done may now be in breach of the law is actually a reflection on the law itself, not necessarily the persons being drawn before it.


There is a particular concern that I have here, which is that I see this as yet another example of a law drafted by the Labor government that is fine for large businesses. It may be fine if you are BHP, Coles or Woolworths, with a large human resources department, processes in place that actually allow for staff to be moved around and a lot more capacity to move your staff around in order to take into account family responsibilities—to be a good employer. But, while we all support a law that prevents intentional discrimination—'by reason of', as Senator Brandis outlined—I have concerns about a law that dramatically limits the capacity of a small business with two or three employees to undertake what would otherwise be legitimate management of resources, where there was no allegation that someone was being discriminated against by reason of their family responsibilities. I think this is yet another example of the Labor Party's misunderstanding or, in this case, complete lack of understanding of the management burdens, the red tape burdens, that government imposes on smaller businesses.


I have worked in large businesses and I have worked in small businesses. It is very easy when you work for a company with thousands of employees for employers to accommodate the needs of staff—and they can be due to personal circumstance or family circumstance. The public sector is a classic example where flexible work arrange­ments are much easier to accommodate. It is much harder for a cafe employing two or three people to do so. It does not necessarily mean that, because a wish cannot be accommodated, that person is being discriminated against by reason of their family responsibilities. But to draw the law this broad and to potentially draw those people into the net because they do not have the means to comply is, I think, a step too far. Whether it is an unintended consequ­ence, I do not know. But I think it is a classic case of a complete lack of understanding of those resource constraints. I also have a concern that was expressed also during the debate on the Fair Work bills. That is: laws that are, by their nature, vague and difficult to comply with—even though it might be only a few words, even though it might seem like a fairly insignificant test to many in this place—impose a much more significant compliance burden than the words thems­elves would convey, because of the very vagueness of their terms. There could be a lack of certainty on the part of a business owner or a manager in the application of this new section proposed by the Labor government. If you do not know all the circumstances of an employee, how do you know the possible effects on their family circumstances of a decision you might make? I do not think it is reasonable. We have privacy laws. We do not necessarily want employers to be able to demand all the information about the family circumstances of their employees. But how can we judge them on the effect of their decisions if there is no allegation whatsoever that that person is being discriminated against because of their family responsibilities? I do not think these views are unreasonable, because I do not think that anyone in this parliament would say that there should be a capacity to discriminate because of family respon­sibilities. I do not, and I think that people of my generation, who went to school in the 1980s and finished university in the 1990s, come from a very different world. We cannot even contemplate a situation where women do not have the same opportunities as we do. 


Australia has undergone quite dramatic change, and this law—which, as Senator Brandis outlined, is working very effectively and is supported across the parliament—is one of the reflections of that change. We are not proposing anything that would water it down. But a law that creates this degree of vagueness, a law that could unintentionally drag a lot of people into a net that is not based on the intent of their conduct, that is not based on discriminating against someone because of their family responsibilities, is, in fact, not a good law.


There are other ways in which we can go about supporting families, and governments of both persuasions have done so. But I think there is a limit to what we can legitimately expect our small businesses to undertake. This reflects a number of the concerns with the Fair Work bills. Under the Fair Work Act there is a right to request to have considered legitimate work arrangements because of family responsibilities, but again the clause is so vague. Even industrial relations lawyers and barristers cannot tell me what it means, because everyone is waiting to find out what the various rulings of Fair Work Australia—and then probably the Federal Court after that—actually mean in practice. We know that those laws are going to be expanded and expounded as more cases are brought before the bench in both instances. This government cannot even set up a Fair Work assistance line for a small business to ring when they want to ask, 'How much do I have to pay my employee?' With the modernisation of awards happening mainly outside my home state of Victoria, and because of the unique situation Victoria was in with respect to industrial relations for many years, a small business cannot ring up and ask, 'How much do I actually pay the assistant in the pharmacy?' or, 'How much do I pay the waiter in the cafe?' Fair Work Australia does not give an answer or, if you wait on hold for a couple of hours, it will give you a vague answer. It will not give you an answer to which it is binding, and that answer cannot be relied upon if you are subsequently found, despite having acted in all good faith, to have acted incorrectly.



Senator Ludwig interjecting—




Senator RYAN:
  My point simply is, Senator Ludwig, that the creation of vague aspirational language in legislation, which happens more in the United States than it does here, is not something that has traditionally come out of the Australian parliament. We have tended to apply tests, as Senator Brandis outlined, that are more about purpose than effects. I do not necessarily like them in competition law, as I am sure some of my colleagues know after debates we have had over the last few weeks. But in this case, vague aspirational language does not do anything to advance the cause and could actually serve to undermine support if people who are acting in good faith and are virtuous employees in every sense are being inadvertently dragged in because of a vaguely drafted section inserted in the act.

Senator BARNETT,LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator BARNETT
 (Tasmania) (12:57):  I would like to speak in support of the amendments that have been put by Senator Brandis and that Senator Ryan has just spoken to. I wanted to note upfront that some of the points that have been expressed are consistent with and relate to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report, which was delivered in March—less than two months ago. That related to the dissenting report of the Liberal senators. In that report we referred to concerns we had about the overreach of the government's proposal with respect to family responsibilities. We said:


Liberal Senators do not support provisions of the Bill which would either expand the scope of the Sex Discrimination Act or broaden the definition of sexual harassment.


There was no evidence presented to the inquiry of any systemic or widespread discrimination on the grounds of responsibilities or circumstances of sexual harassment which are not currently adequately addressed by existing legislation. There was no evidence, that we could see, that was brought before the committee of inquiry that said that there were grounds of discrimination based on family respon­sibilities. The government clearly, in my view, have overreached in drafting the bill the way they have. The Liberal senators' dissenting report that was tabled in March does express concern about that. It also says, in 1.10, that we:


… are concerned that the combined effect of the recommendations relating to sexual harassment and family responsibilities would be to impose significant compliance costs on employers and would encourage and facilitate unfounded claims. 


Whether they are unfounded or not, there will be claims made, and if they are without foundation they will cost a lot of money. They will cost small businesses, medium businesses and larger businesses—but small businesses in particular—money. Not only that; it will be a red-tape hassle for them. There is the concern that they will have to respond to these claims, take time out of their busy schedules and respond to those. We say in our report:


In the absence of any clear basis for these changes, or evidence of systemic failure of the current legislative regime, any implementation of these recommendations is not supported.


I am thrilled and very thankful that Senator Brandis—after considering this, and no doubt after talking to business people and liaising with his colleagues—has put this amendment forward, consistent with our views made in the dissenting Liberal senators' report. We have made a number of other observations in our report. Of course we support much of the bill; but we do not agree to expanding the scope. 


Many witnesses appeared before our committee and many submissions were received. In fact, I have just noticed in this report that we actually received 21 submissions. There are the various groups who were very supportive, and others expressing different views. We had women's groups, Family Association of Australia, Office of the Anti-Discrimination Comm­issioner of Tasmania, Human Rights Law Resource Centre, Independent Education Union, Women's Legal Services New South Wales, Council on the Ageing, Uniting Church, Family Voice, Thomsons Lawyers, Equal Opportunity Commission Western Australia, National Seniors and a range of others. We thought long and hard about this, and I am disappointed that we have had to come to this juncture because our committee, the legal and constitutional affairs comm­ittee, commands a lot of respect and is held in high regard in this place and around the country. We get it right pretty much most of the time—and quite often we have unani­mous reports, and they are well received and well regarded. But on this occasion the Liberal senators provided a dissenting report, because we think that the government has just gone too far. 


The bill was brought in on 30 September 2010 and it was on 8 February this year that the Senate agreed to extend the reporting date to 22 March, which is when we delivered this committee report. So we have expressed our views. The report is quite comprehensive. Can I just note that there were some 50-odd pages in the report, including our dissenting report.


More specifically, with respect to the amendment before us, I think there is a real problem here. I think there is a real problem for small business in particular. I think there is a problem for microbusiness. About 82 per cent of small businesses in Australia are microbusinesses—that is, five or fewer people in the business. I was formerly a member of the federal government's micro­business consultative committee, appointed by Peter Reith, prior to my time in the Senate. I established, owned and oper­ated my own small business and employed some 15 people, based in Hobart and Canberra, so I know what it is like. I was also an advocate for various small businesses and various small business organisations, including the Tasmanian Independent Retailers, the National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia and a range of other business groups. In particular, I tried to advocate for small businesses. So, in this regard, let me just say: they are being dudded. If this bill goes ahead in its current form, you will find that small business will be impacted. The men, women and families behind those small businesses who have their necks on the line, will be impacted, because the bill in its current form has unintended consequences. 


I am afraid to say that the government has put forward no clear evidence or adequate arguments to the contrary, other than saying it should be 'reasonable'. That is not good enough, because of the way the bill is drafted; it is an effects test. It is quite clear that an employer or manager may not have any idea of the family responsibilities of an employee. The point is that, if they do know and are fully aware of the family respon­sibilities of the employee and if they treat that person differently, perhaps in a less favourable way than if they did not have those family responsibilities, clearly that is discrimination, and that is something the coalition and the parliament do not support. But if you have a situation where an employer has no idea of the particular family responsibilities and changes their work arrangements—the time to arrive at work, the lunchtime break, the time to depart and go home or make them work on a different day of the week—you cannot automatically say that they are being discriminatory. But they will be subject to the full force of the law. That means they will have to face an allegation and a claim. They will have to respond to that. That will take time and effort and resources. You have to remember that many of these small businesses—let's face it, most of them are microbusinesses—are in their businesses. We take our hats off to them for the time, effort and resources they do put in. They work long and hard. They are going to have to take time off to respond to those claims and prepare their own paperwork. They may employ a local solicitor or lawyer to act on their behalf, but whether or not they do, it will take time, effort and money—and, frankly, unfairly so.


As Senator Brandis noted, this bill first passed this parliament in 1992, so we are looking at nearly 20 years of success where the foundation legislation has been in force and effect and the parliament has had no issues or problems at all with family responsibilities being protected and people not being discriminated against based on their family responsibilities. That is what we are saying. What the government have done is go overboard. It is very disappointing that this has occurred. I am not sure whether it is a drafting error or oversight, or whether they got caught up by some of the submissions and claims made by some of the perhaps more left-oriented groups who are pushing for this type of legislation. I do not know, and I am not identifying any particular group or entity. Unless the way the bill is currently drafted is changed and these amendments are successful, clearly small business will be subject to the full force of the law, and the consequences will flow. That is really the problem and the effect of this legislation in its current form.


Having said all of that, I draw the attention of senators to this report, and in particular to the Liberal senators' dissenting report towards the end of the document. That is definitely worth reading because it gives you a little bit of background as to why Senator Brandis has chosen to move, on behalf of the coalition, these amendments to protect the interests of not only small business but the public. We are talking across-the-board here about providing good legislation that is transparent, accountable and properly drafted. I look forward in this committee stage to hearing the minister's response to the views expressed by Senator Brandis, Senator Ryan and me. I hope the minister sees reason and takes on board the concerns that have been expressed by coalition senators.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:10):  I want to go back to a number of issues that have caused the coalition very deep concern about this bill—that is what I have described as the bad legislative practice involved in imposing obligations of an uncertain, open-ended character upon citizens. It is fundamental to good law making—and we as the house of review ought to pride this as being one of our core values when we review bills that come from the House of Representatives, when we consider amendments and when we consider proposed bills—that we make the obligations and burdens that we impose upon citizens as narrow as possible but, even more importantly, as certain as possible. One of the deep concerns we in the opposition have is that this bill takes an obligation which is tolerably certain—existing section 7A of the Sex Discrimination Act has been part of the law of Australia since 1992 and there has been an accumulation of case law and precedent so that the concept of discriminating against employees by reason of their family responsibilities is tolerably well-known and clear—and, through either incompetence or indifference to the consequences that the bill would have, substitutes that tolerably certain obligation with a greatly uncertain obligation so that all it would take for a perfectly well-meaning, innocent, virtuous employer to find themselves in breach of the law is for a decision they make in the workplace to have a different effect upon people with family responsibilities than it has upon people without family responsibilities.


Examples of the vice of this are endless. For example, if an employer changed the hours of work for a perfectly sensible commercial reason, it may have a different bearing upon employees with kids than upon employees without kids. People who have children in their household, which as I said earlier I suspect are most people in the workforce in Australia these days, lead different lives. Because the nexus in proposed clause 7A(2) in the bill is so vague by the use of the preposition 'with' almost any commercial decision that any businessperson makes that has a bearing upon their employees could potentially be made unlawful by this foolish provision if the effects of that decision on people with children or other dependent relatives in the household were different from the effects on single people among that business's workforce. Let us take wages. We know that people with the responsibilities of children have less disposable income than people without children. The swinging single with the flamboyant lifestyle is a well-known subgroup of our population. People like that have great lives, lives free of responsibility to others. Because they do not have the responsibilities that a person in the workplace doing the same job but with kids has—who has to feed the kids, clothe the kids, pay school fees for the kids, outlay all of the other costs that having a child or children in the household involves—then of course their disposable income is much greater.


Let us say the employer decides to give a wage increase to his workers because he thinks: 'These are very good workers, these workers of mine. They're very industrious. My business has done very well because I've got a great workforce, so I'm going to give them all a wage increase.' And let us say the business employs two boilermakers at the same level and on the same salary. One of those boilermakers is a man with two kids and the other boilermaker who earns the same salary is a swinging single boilermaker who pockets most of his wage and spends it I hate to think how. And the employer says, 'I'm going to give you both a wage rise of 20 per cent.' What that means is that the swinging single's disposable income, as a percentage of his actual income, will increase by more than the disposable income of the boilermaker who is a parent. Now that would put that employer, as a result of that act of generosity towards his workforce, in breach of proposed section 7A(2) prima facie because that decision in the workplace of the employer would have a different effect upon the boilermaker who was a father than upon the boilermaker who kept most of his disposable income because he did not have children. How foolish is that?


And it is not as if the existing provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act are not good enough because section 7A of the act in its existing form completely covers the ground of conduct which ought to be made unlawful because it is an outright prohibition on discriminating against people by reason of their family responsibilities. That is the law. As people used to say some years ago during the famous republican referendum: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. This law is a good law. As a Liberal committed to antidiscrimination laws, I wholeheartedly support it and I do not want to see it ruined by legislative overreach by the legislature, in an artless and incompetent and gauche fashion, extending the law beyond its appropriate ambit.


Let us go back to my two boilermakers and their indulgent, generous employer. Were this legislation to be enacted, the employer may well be advised by his solicitor: 'I know you want to give your employees a raise, but I don't think you should do that because you've got employees with family responsibilities and employees without family responsibilities and, if you did, you'd be in breach of section 7A(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act, vouchsafed to us by the Gillard government and a negligent Senate.' And the employer would say to his lawyer: 'You've got to be kidding! No body of parliamentarians would be so stupid as to pass a law that in fact prevents me improving the conditions of my workforce merely because the effect on the lives of my staff might be different depending on whether they are single or have kids.' And yet that is what this would do. And then the government, which is being very badly advised I am bound to say—you need to get better lawyers, Senator Ludwig—comes back and says: 'No, that couldn't possibly happen because there's a reasonableness test. As long as it can be seen that the decision of the employer is reasonable then they're not in trouble.' That is all very well, but for the fact that there is a reverse onus. So the onus is cast upon the employer to show that their conduct is reasonable. It is absolutely bad and incompetent legislative practice to create a prima facie liability, a prima facie illegality, and say, 'That's all right, it doesn't matter that we've put you prima facie in breach of the laws of the Commonwealth because, if anybody takes you up on this, you'll have the opportunity to prove to the court that you acted reasonably.' That is not what parliament ought to be doing. That is not the way in which we make laws. We do not put people prima facie in breach of the law because they happen to run a business that employs both people with family responsibilities and people without. Of course, the biggest vice in this is that employers are going to think to themselves: 'My hands will be tied because any decision I make about wages and conditions or terms of employment, if it has a different bearing on people with or without family responsibilities, might land me in breach of the law. So I'm just not going to hire people with family responsibilities. I'm going to have an engineering shed composed entirely of swinging single boilermakers. How's that for discrimination!' Now, that would be discrimination. But, of course, it is very easy to mask discrimination in recruitment practices. As those of us who have practised in this area of the law would know—as I have done, albeit not very often but on occasions—it is much easier to mask discrimination in recruitment practices than it is in relation to conduct with existing employees.


This is the problem with legislative overreach: the law of unintended conseq­uences always applies. If you, my colleagues in the Senate, were to pass this law, what you would be doing is creating a disincentive for businesses, particularly for small businesses, to take on employees to whom this foolish proposed section 7A(2) might apply. For all of those reasons, the opposition opposes this amendment although we support the body of the bill.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:25):  I want to put some questions to the government in relation to this. I have been listening carefully to Senator Brandis and I have had an opportunity to discuss this matter further with him. And I am, of course, grateful to the government for the discussions I have had with them in relation to this. Let me make it clear, so that there is no misunderstanding for anyone who is listening or who reads the Hansard in relation to this, that proposed section 7A(1) is a reworking of the current section 7A of the Sex Discrimination Act and makes it very clear that, if a person discriminates against another person on the ground of the aggrieved person's family responsibilities, that is an offence, that is prohibited—as it should be. Also, it ought to be read in the context of section 7B in that, with indirect discrimination, there is a reasonableness test, and in section 7C of the act there is effectively a reverse onus of proof. Normally, a reverse onus of proof is something you would be quite cautious about, but I think it is appropriate to have a reverse onus of proof in the scheme of this legislation in order for the legislation to be effective. But here we have a situation, with subclause (2), where what is proposed is that, if a person discriminates against another person on the ground of the aggrieved person's family responsibilities, if the discriminator imposes or proposes to impose a condition, requirement or practice that has or is likely to have the effect of disadvan­taging persons with family responsibilities, there is a reverse onus of proof. The concern I have—and I would be very grateful if the minister could give his views in relation to this—is that, in the whole context of this particular subclause, there is no cause and effect. It would make it much easier for a claim without any particular substance to be brought against an employer, a small business person—a person who does not have the resources of a BHP Billiton or a Commonwealth Bank. That employer would have to be dragged through the courts and would then have to rely on section 7B of the act and also on section 7C, where there is a reverse onus of proof. So the onus is on the employer to show that what they did was reasonable—and there are considerable costs involved in that. That is my concern in relation to indirect discrimination. I do not support the opposition's other amendments, I want to make that clear, but I am concerned about unintended consequences in the context of the proposed section 7A(2) of this bill. By having the words 'with family responsibilities', there is no requirement for cause and effect, and that causes me real concern about whether there could be unintended consequences in relation to this bill.

 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (13:29):  Thank you, Senator Xenophon, for your question. If you read it through, it says that for the purposes of this act a person discriminates against another person on the ground of the aggrieved person's family responsibilities if the discriminator 'imposes, or proposes to impose, a condition, requirement or practice that has, or is likely to have, the effect of disadvantaging a person with family responsibilities'. That is true. You have to put it in the context of the whole section, which does have both a reasonableness test together with the reversal of the onus of proof. In other words, if you read 7A(1), it says:




For the purposes of this act … if
,
 by reason of—



and it goes through (a), (b) and (c) and then (2), because this section 7A is reflected in a range of pieces of state and territory legislation dealing with family responsibilities. But the broad issue around this section itself, which is an indirect discrimination provision which is also found in similar terms in other legislation, is about dealing with circumstances where there is indirect discrimination. If you removed 7A(1) and (2) completely—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator LUDWIG:
  If you removed the provision you would then leave a hole in the ability of the legislation to deal with indirect discrimination. That is the effect of what you would do. I know Senator Brandis interjects. I listened to him in silence, notwithstanding what I would have regarded as some pretty spurious straw-man reasoning together with some pretty wild Chicken Little arguments. Nonetheless, I will not be drawn. The provisions have been drafted very carefully by competent draftspersons to ensure that we do capture the issues around indirect discrimination, so not only those ones which are itemised in 7A through to 'if, by reason of: (a), (b) and (c)' but also those in (2) for the purposes of this act. Ultimately, the argument around this issue that employers will not be able to get on with their daily work is, I think, falsely premised.


This same argument that 'the sky will fall down' was articulated way back in 1984 when the legislation dealing with discrim­ination first came in, and of course the sky did not fall in and employers managed competently to address these issues. The Australian Human Rights Commission has managed quite competently over that long period to deal with areas where both can be right, or both can be wrong, or one is wrong and one is right, as between the employer and the employee in these issues. Yes, there are through the course of events circumstances which are thrown up where employees might feel discriminated against, either indirectly or directly, and they may find themselves pursuing an issue within the Australian Human Rights Commission. But common sense, I have found over the last 20 years, has prevailed in these arguments. Of course there are employers who quite rightly do believe that the actions they take are nondiscriminatory, that they are bastions of good employers and their actions, they believe wholeheartedly, are nondiscrim­inatory either in truth or in effect. But on a clear and close examination, objectively by another, they do discriminate, maybe indirectly, maybe directly. That is why we do have provisions in legislation like this for the purposes of dealing with both direct discrimination and indirect discrimination and why (2) deals with the effect of disadvantaging persons with family respon­sibilities.


These are sensible amendments. We have spent a considerable amount of time ventilating them, but I will take a couple more minutes on this. I have now had an opportunity this morning to go back and reapprise myself of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report. The committee ultimately recom­mended that this bill be passed and it made some suggestions. I do recognise that the coalition took a different course. The Liberal senators recommended that the bill be amended, and we are now dealing in part with some of their recommendations. So there is a genuine disagreement that is again being ventilated here. That is not to take away either of the arguments, but on balance the government believes firmly that the provisions that it has put up and that the Senate committee by a majority recom­mended, should be passed. The government continues to believe that the provisions are reasonable and will operate reasonably in the workplace and between employers and employees, and will not have the disastrous effects of causing a business to cease or that people will only employ male boilermakers in the workplace. With all of those things I think we are really getting beyond what I would call rational debate in the Senate. I think the arguments, although well pre­sented, miss the point of the whole piece. This is about ensuring that we do capture indirect discrimination in this area, and the drafters have achieved that in 7A(1) and 7A(2). We as adults can disagree. On this basis, Senator Brandis clearly disagrees that we have captured it accurately and correctly. I do not share his view and I have listened intently to the arguments he has put forward. They have not persuaded me, although I think Senator Brandis would have expected that they were not going to persuade me in any event. When I look at the provisions themselves, for my own sake I still remain unconvinced that his arguments have any merit.


To put it another way, it seems to be that these provisions would operate in a commonsense way in any event. That is how legislation has operated in this area for a very long time and it continues to operate that way. I would encourage the opposition to understand that pointing to unbelievable circumstances is a device that we all use occasionally in this place. It does provide colour and movement to use extreme examples, but the practicality of it is that these are sensible amendments, they will work and they will operate to ensure that family responsibilities will be taken into account and that employers will not discriminate, either indirectly or directly, against someone who has family responsibilities. It is a matter that is currently provided for in ensuring that we do have balanced rights for families to assist them to balance their work and family respon­sibilities. We do want to accommodate flexibility where it can be accommodated within the workforce. Employers should be able to flexibly meet those requirements.


Equally, we recognise the pressure on small businesses themselves, particularly small-business owners. The issues raised by Senator Barnett were apposite. We do have to ensure that small business can get on with the work that they do well and the bill does not require businesses to make unreasonable arrangements. In practical terms, it will not require employers to make themselves aware of all circumstances of their employees because an employee could hardly claim to have been refused flexible arrangements without first having discussed these with their employer.


I find from my interactions with small business that they regard their employees as part of the business, they talk to them daily, they discuss many of the issues we are talking about and they work around all these issues I have described. Small business generally knows their employees quite personally. Where you have one, two, three or four employees in the workplace, it would be unusual for employers not to know them personally or not to know their personal circumstances. But it may happen.


Many of the arguments that are being progressed today for some hour are misplaced. We do not support Senator Brandis's amendments. We will continue to press for the amendments which have been drafted. I have probably now provoked further discussion on this but, in answering your original question, we do not think it has the effect you have outlined. We think it will act reasonably.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:41):  I thank the minister for his response. I still have reservations about the potential operation of subclause (2), not subclause (1)—that is not an issue--which is largely a restatement of the existing section 7A of the act. My problem is with the third to last word in subclause (2), the word 'with', not 'because of', not 'due to' and not 'as a direct result of' family responsibilities. It is the word 'with' that I think extends it in a way that may not be reasonable, that will not enhance the operation of the act and that could well lead to the unintended consequence of litigation in the context of section 7B, which gives a reasonableness test. With section 7C there is a reverse onus of proof. I have reservations about this particular subclause. That is why I have difficulty in supporting it.


I make it clear that this is not about taking away the rights of those who have family responsibility. That is clearly in the legislation as it is now and it is restated in proposed subclause (1). I think there will be some very real issues here in litigation. I am not convinced that there will not be some adverse consequences for small businesses and I am concerned at the impact it may have in the way that small businesses regard the employment of those individuals with families. For Senator Ludwig—for whom I have enormous respect—to say that the sky did not fall in—no, it did not.


Anti-discrimination legislation is an essential feature of a civil society, but let us not have something that could well be contrary to the aims of that legislation, something that I think could lead to the legislation having consequences that were not intended and something that will cause damage all round, to those it is seeking to protect and to those that could be the subject of litigation.

If some embarrassed senator has to come in and explain, someone has had to do it before.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:54):  I thank the Leader of the Government in the Senate for his courtesy in this regard. That then is the way we will proceed. In view of the time there are two other amendments which are on the sheet circulated in my name—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (13:55):  I think perhaps you should postpone consideration of amendments (2), (3) and (5) before moving on to the next one.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I accept your guidance because the opposition wants to consider its position in relation to amendments (4) and (6). Amendments (2), (3) and (5) are, and I think it is uncontroversial, consequential upon amend­ment No. (1) which was the subject of the division which has just been held. I seek leave to speak to amendments (2), (3) and (5) together.


Leave granted.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am mindful of the time. Let me just say this: amendment (2) is essentially a renumbering amendment which would reflect the shape of the act in the event that the principal opposition amendment—that is, the deletion of item 18—were to have been carried. Amendment (3) is also essentially a renumbering amendment which again would reflect the shape of the act in the event that if opposition amendment (1) were to be carried out, item 18 would be deleted from the bill.


Once again, opposition amendment (5) which would omit from item 65, which itself is a series of amendments to section 41A(2) of the act, would take the form of taking from section 41A(2) those words which would only have been introduced if amendment (1) which is, if I may describe it as such, the 'head' amendment were to be carried. What I anticipate will happen is that the Senate, as indicated by the Leader of the Government after taking note, will recommit the vote. The coalition senator concerned will, I anticipate in conformity with the courtesies and protocols of this place, make a brief explanation for his unintended absence. I am sure there was a confusion of some kind and, in the event that the opposition's principal amendment were to succeed on an equality of votes, then I would not anticipate there to be any controversy about opposition amendments (2), (3) and (5) which I imagine would be allowed to go through on the voices. That is where it stands at the moment and I do not know that I can take the matter any further. I am mindful of the time and I am mindful in particular that question—




Senator Carr:
  You are obviously mindful of the time, you have said the same thing for the last five minutes.




Senator BRANDIS:

Senator Carr interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Carr, I am so often in your debt! What I in fact was doing in a slightly more painstaking fashion than is usual was explaining the textual changes to the act which would have been brought about by each of the three consequential amendments, which, as I pointed out—




Senator Carr:
  So why don't we say it all again?




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am not going to say it all again, Senator Carr. I am sure that your intellectual command would have been sufficient to understand it the first time had you been listening. So by your interjection I am afraid that you reveal that you were not listening, which causes me to be very disappointed in you, Senator Carr. Never­theless that is the course we propose to take and once again I thank the Leader of the Government in the Senate for his customary courtesy.

I seek leave to have additional information in response to the question incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.



The answer read as follows—



Change of name procedures are managed by the States and Territories.


The Federal Government is aware of the diverse approach by jurisdictions to change of name processes and the exchange of change of name information with law enforcement agencies.


The Government considers the development of a nationally consistent approach to change of name would strengthen law enforcement, service delivery and national security outcomes.


Attorneys General have agreed to develop best practice change of name processes.


A SCAG working group, led by NSW, is currently looking at options for reform.


We hope that this work will be finalised by the end of the year.


SCAG's deliberations will provide important input to revision of the National Identity Security Strategy, work being led by my Department in collaboration with Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies.


This work will establish policies and procedures that better protect the identities of Australians by strengthening the integrity of identity documents.


On the issue of privacy, the Government's privacy reforms, in the form of draft legislation, are currently being considered by the Senate Committee on Finance and Public Administration. The


proposed reforms include provisions that would assist the flow of information between law enforcement bodies in circumstances such as notification of change of names.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (15:51):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by Senators Evans, Wong, Ludwig and Carr to questions asked by coalition senators.


Mr Deputy President, you may be surprised, but I actually enjoyed the agony of Mr Swan's budget on Tuesday night. What surprised me was his behaviour. He behaved far more like a conjurer or a magician than he did a Treasurer—far more Harry Houdini than John Maynard Keynes. The aim of Mr Swan's budget was to divert attention from the issues that really concern the Australian people. What are they? One is the cost of living. He tried to divert attention from that. The carbon tax—he tried to divert attention from that. The mining tax and border security—he tried to divert attention from those. Instead he pulled up a white rabbit, including digital set-top boxes for pensioners. He said, 'Hey, look at that; don't worry about the issues that really concern and confront this country.' We now know this budget was framed not in the national interest, not in the interests of the Australian people, but drafted in the political interests of the Australian Labor Party. A story in Tuesday's Australian quotes an anonymous Labor source as saying:




The Prime Minister told a caucus meeting that the budget would be tough but would also provide an opportunity for Labor to broaden public debate from carbon tax and border security.



What does 'broaden public debate' mean? It means to not talk about the issues that really concern the Australian people. It is Labor spin for talking about anything except the things that worry them politically but do worry the Australian people—things like the cost of living. Remember that, Mr Deputy President?


Why have we not heard in months anything about working families? In the lead-up to the 2007 federal election Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard could not say one sentence without talking about the cost-of-living pressures and working families. We all remember that in this place. They could not say one sentence in the lead-up to the 2007 election that was not about cost-of-living pressures. Remember that? Remember the government put up Fuelwatch to watch the price of petrol? What happened to that?




Senator Boyce:
  What about GroceryWatch?




Senator MASON:
  That is right, Senator Boyce. What about GroceryWatch? This was all about cost-of-living pressures for working families. Guess what? Working families do not matter any more to the government. The government cannot even utter the words, words that will not speak their name, because they are embarrassed that cost-of-living pressures have gone through the roof. One of the worst is electricity, and what will happen when the carbon tax hits? According to the government, it does not matter. It is a tax on pollution. But pollution does not pay tax. Companies will pay tax in the end and their prices will go up. And who will pay that? The consumer. Working Australians. Working families will pay that money. That is what will happen.


We have a comparative advantage in cheap energy in this country. It is one of the great advantages of this nation, and this lot are going to give up that comparative advantage unilaterally to the rest of the world. Can you imagine that? Imagine the pressures on every single thing that is created in this country using energy, which is nearly everything. Everything in this country will go up, and this lot are going to give it to the Australian people without extracting anything from the rest of the world. It is an absolute disgrace.


This lot are such great negotiators that it will say 'We will take five refugees if you take one.' These are the sorts of people who are supposed to negotiate our future and look after the future of this country. It is absolutely pathetic. And there is the diversion of the digital set-top box. After the shambles of the pink batts and the school halls, the granddaddy of them all will be the NBN. As they said in the Age today, it will be likely to cause fires. That is what this new digital set-top box will do. It is a farce. In the end, this is not a budget; it is a bandage to stop the Labor Party bleeding.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2011-05-12,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:56):  I always enjoy Senator Mason's contributions, whether they be here in the chamber or on the walker in the gym. I find Senator Mason very amusing and entertaining. It is a tragic debate to be having in this country—and, sadly, it has been since the last election—that visitors to our land, this great country, have to listen to this commentary from the opposition. You would think: why the hell would anyone want to live in Australia? Fortunately, we are still the lucky country.


This budget is about one very clear thing, which is very important to not only me but also to every Australian and to future generations of Australians: the budget will be back in the black. The Treasurer, Mr Swan, has said very clearly that this is about getting more Australians in jobs and it is about spreading the opportunity of the mining boom. As one who is lucky enough to come from a state that has had a mining boom and is heading towards another mining boom, and as there is an opportunity for Australians to be put into employment and to enjoy the benefits of the mining boom mark 2, I think it is a travesty that we find the opposition carrying on like they are.


Senator Mason made a wild assertion that Mr Swan did not want to talk about the mining tax. I was listening to the presentation of the budget and I was at the budget dinner after it and Mr Swan made it very clear that the mining tax will give the opportunity to provide some very important infrastructure projects. In Western Australia, probably one of the most important infrastructure projects is the WA Gateway project. Those of us that travel through Perth Airport or that area would understand what a wonderful concept it is.


I also take note of Senator Mason's comment about the cost of living and electricity. In that fantastic state, Western Australians do know the cost of rising power prices. They know darn well that the Liberal Premier, Mr Barnett, has put up the cost of electricity by 49 per cent. So we do get it. It is just a travesty to listen to the nonsense coming out of the other side. We have just gone through some of the most devastating natural disasters that we have had the misfortune of witnessing in this country, certainly in my lifetime. To see the devastation and the destruction and the very sad loss of life in Queensland; to see the flooding in Victoria; in Western Australia, to see our banana and fruit and vegetable growing area, Carnarvon, some 950 kilo­metres north of Perth, devastated by flooding; to see those poor devils in the Perth suburb of Roleystone—72 homes burnt to the ground. We are endeavouring to do everything we can to bring this budget back to the black, but not by kicking the living daylights out of those people who desperately need assistance. I find it very offensive.


We also had the global financial crisis. The Labor government was condemned from pillar to post that we dared move and move quickly to avoid that terrible reality of some 200,000 full-time Australian jobs going. Mr Deputy President, and to those listening, I am so proud to be part of a government that not only saved 200,000 Australian jobs but created another 700,000. To hear the arguments from that side of the chamber, it does you no good at all. It is very, very poor. Through you, Mr Deputy President, you are very good at silly one-liners. It hurts me to say it, but it is Pauline Hanson politics: 'Let's grab a line. What is the last reactionary line I heard as I walked into a meeting?' This is Mr Abbott. 'I will use that.' For goodness sake, what is Mr Abbott going to do? Mr Abbott does not come forth with his projections to build this nation, to make this great nation an even greater nation. There is none of that. It is negatives. I spend a lot of time talking to Western Australians who have had a gutful of the negativity. We should be talking up this great country. We should be talking about jobs and endeavouring to create brilliant futures for our kids that are coming through, whether it is benefits through the mining boom or industries that will hang off the mining boom.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (15:59):  I am particularly interested in taking note of the answers given by Senator Carr and Senator Ludwig. Perhaps I should not be gracing Senator Ludwig's response to Senator Fierravanti-Wells' question by calling it an answer, because I do not think it was an answer. He was asked to outline how the Labor government got to $2.2 billion of new spending in mental health. There is no way, when you look through their figures, that this is the case. The only new spending in there appears to be about $583 million—a long, long way short of the $1.92 billion over four years that a coalition government would deliver. The coalition government began the move into a vast improvement in mental health spending with the policies brought by the then health minister, Mr Tony Abbott.


Prime Minister Gillard said in July last year, less than 12 months ago:


I want to be absolutely clear - mental health will be a second-term priority for this government.


That was probably about the same time that she was promising us that there would never be a carbon tax under a government she led. So yet again we have a broken promise—not just a broken promise but a cruel trick of smoke and mirrors with figures aimed at the mental health community and the people who desperately need the funding that they would get under practical, real programs under a coalition government and its $1.92 billion policy.


I would now like to turn to Senator Carr's extraordinary response to questions asked about what he is doing to improve the productivity of this nation. In case he has not noticed, productivity is what really sits underneath any good-quality living that this country has. Yet we have a former CSIRO chief saying that their cuts to the Cooperative Research Centres Program has knocked the stuffing out of one of Australia's most successful and cost-effective research ven­tures. It is about the only program that we actually have that encourages collaboration between industry and academia. We do pretty poorly in that field anyway. It looks as though programs that are aimed at all manner of research, in particular, rural research programs, will simply have to disappear because this government is not interested in innovation and productivity.


It has also cut the funding to the Inter­national Science Linkages program. This is a small amount of money but in fact puts at risk our whole joint project with New Zealand—the $2.5 billion square kilometre array telescope. I must admit that I have no idea what it is, but it is a $2.5 billion project that is probably not going to come here because of the short-sightedness of this government and because we are not seen to be internationally collaborating in areas of research, innovation and productivity. Austr­alian workers are now producing less per hour than they have since 1995. When is this government going to wake up and actually do something about this?

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (16:05):  I am just amazed at Senator Boyce's criticism of what the federal government is doing in the mental health area. If I were Senator Boyce I would be congratulating the Labor government and Wayne Swan on his budget, but more particularly a very good friend of mine from South Australia: Minister Butler, , the member for Port Adelaide. He has done all of the things that your government did not do in 11 or 12 years in government. He has made a commitment to mental health and to resolving an area that was left untouched by the 11 or 12 years of Liberal government. That is not the only thing that we have done in the area of health, and I would like to go through some of the things that our government have done. Obviously we want to get the budget back into the black, but there are other priority issues that we are dealing with, and health is one of those. I know, Mr Deputy President, you will be interested to know some of the very many good things that the Labor government are doing in the area of health and hospital funding, and I would like to go through some of those. South Australia will benefit through the investment in the Health and Hospitals Fund. The first area is $3.3 million to establish five surgery public dental clinics on the grounds of the Wallaroo Hospital and Health Services. You will be interested in that, I know, Mr Deputy President, because of your close connection with the Yorke Peninsula. There will be $6 million to establish a new oral health centre at the Berri Hospital campus in the Riverland. The Riverland, as you know, has suffered very badly during the period of the drought; it has even had some more bad news in recent times with a lot of the bad weather destroy­ing wine crops up there, so this will be good news for it. There will be $26.7 million to redevelop the health services in Mount Gambier—again, the south-east of South Australia getting a benefit out of our Health and Hospital Fund.


Another area that will benefit from our budget decisions to improve the health of Australians is that there will be $39.2 million for the redevelopment of the Port Lincoln Hospital and Health Service. Another area is $2.3 million to construct four new two-bedroom staff houses and visitor centres in the Pitjantjatjara areas for their communities. There will be $3.5 million for purchase of land and construction of the new purpose-built ambulance station at Mount Gambier. I know that today there are a number of people from the ambulance services in Canberra, so they will be very pleased with that, as will the people of Mount Gambier. There will be $1.3 million to establish a new medical clinic on the grounds of the Naracoorte Hospital. So all of these things are things that we are doing in addition to what we are doing in the area of mental health.


As I said, the budget is all about bringing the economy back into surplus, and that is the objective of the budget. We obviously want to spread the opportunities of the mining boom. One of the things that have not got that much attention in recent weeks, of course, is the visit by the Minister for Defence, Minister Smith, and the Minister for Resources and Energy, Minister Fer­guson, up to Woomera, where of course the federal government is opening significant portions of land which were previously restricted because of defence requirements. I know Senator Feeney has been very supportive of the proposal to allow mining to go on in those areas.

 (South Australia) (16:10):  I rise to take note of answers. What a joke, Senator Farrell. Despite the supposed aspirations of this government, forget about an embarrassment of riches; it is about to become an embarrassment of rags. Unlike the Howard-Costello government, which did the admirable progression from rags to riches in transitioning from past Labor governments to a very healthy Howard-Costello government, this government, the Gillard- Swan team, is intent on dragging this country from past coalition riches right back to Labor rags. Exhibit A: the $308 million set-top box scheme. Master Electricians Australia warns that this is shades of ghosts past, that installers are not being properly trained to install the set-top boxes and that it could result in the deaths of installers—shades of ghosts past. Remember the botched and bungled home insulation scheme. This government has not learnt a thing. The Australian people probably know that we should not bother crying over spilt milk, but they will come to rue the day that this government takes them from riches to rags, and they will indeed come to cry over Treasurer Swan's spilt water.

Economics References Committee – Interim report





Impacts of supermarket price decisions on the dairy industry



Pursuant to Senate Standing Order 38(7), I present to you an interim report of the Economics References Committee in relation to the Committee's inquiry into the impacts of supermarket price decisions on the dairy industry.


The matter was referred to the Committee on 10 February 2011 for report by 15 April 2011. To date, the Committee has received 151 subm­issions and has held public hearings in Melbourne (8 March 2011), Sydney (9 March 2011) and Canberra (10 and 29 March 2011). To enable the Committee to consider the significant amount of information received, the Committee sought an extension of its reporting date to 20 April 2011, which the Senate approved on 21 March 2011.


The Committee is aware that the inquiry has generated considerable interest and understands that many parties are awaiting the release of the report. It is also aware, however, of the need to balance timeliness with the quality of the analysis. Many of the issues which are the subject of this inquiry require ongoing scrutiny. There are complex interactions between farmers, processors and retailers; and short-term effects may differ significantly from medium-term effects. In particular, the Committee believes the impact of the reductions in retail milk prices depends crucially on how long they are in place, and the extent to which they are reflected in upcoming contract renegotiations with processors. 


Additionally, the Committee, and many individuals and organisations who participated in this inquiry, are aware that the Government has not provided a response to the report of its previous inquiry, Milking it for all it's worth—competition and pricing in the Australian dairy industry. This comprehensive report was tabled on 13 May 2010 and made 16 recommendations.


The Committee also only received Coles' responses to their questions on notice in the afternoon of 19 April 2011. This has meant that the Committee has not had sufficient opportunity to consider this new information.


Consequently, the Committee has decided to present a further interim report before 10 May 2011, which will analyse the evidence that the Committee has received and invite responses and/or further information to be provided. The Committee will then collect and assess further information and examine developments in the dairy industry as they occur to inform its final report, which will be tabled by 1 October 2011.




Recommendation 1



The Committee calls on the Government to table a formal response to the Committee's report Milking it for all it's worth—competition and pricing in the Australian dairy industry by 13 May 2011, which will be a year after it was tabled.


 




GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE ANTI) PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REPORT





ANNUAL REPORTS (No.1 of 2009)





INTRODUCTION



The Australian Government welcomes the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the committee's examination of annual reports for portfolios that it has oversight, which were tabled for the period between 1 May 2008 and 31 October 2008.


The Government recognises that the primary purpose of annual reports of departments is accountability, in particular to the Parliament Annual reports serve to inform the Parliament, other stakeholders, educational and research institutions, the media and the general public about the operation and performance of Commonwealth entities.




RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATION





The Committee made four recommendations.





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that Ministers ensure that annual reports are tabled in the Parliament as soon as is practicable after receipt of reports from agencies.




Response



The Government notes Recommendation 1.


While it is good practice for Ministers to table annual reports as soon as practicable after receipt of reports from agencies, unless it is otherwise specified in legislation, it remains the Government's policy that all annual reports should be tabled by 31 October.


The requirement for Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act) agencies to table annual reports by 31 October is specified in the Requirements for Annual Reports for Departments, Executive Agencies and FMA Act Bodies (""the Requirements for Annual Reports""). Agencies need to seek an extension under the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 should that timeframe not be met.


Current legislative arrangements for Common­wealth authorities and Commonwealth companies provide for the tabling of annual reports in Parliament as soon as practicable after the receipt of reports from agencies. Under the existing framework, paragraph 9(2)(a) of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act) provides that the annual report of a Commonwealth authority must be given to its responsible Minister by the 15th day of the fourth month after the end of the financial year.


Subsection 36(1A) of the CAC Act provides that the annual report of a Commonwealth company must be given to its responsible Minister if the company is required by the Corporations Act 2001 to hold an annual general meeting, 21 days before the next annual general meeting or four months after the end of the financial year, whichever is earlier. In any other case, the Commonwealth company must provide its responsible Minister with its annual report four months after the end of the financial year


Paragraph 9(2)(b) and subsection 36(1A) of the CAC Act also provide that an annual report for a Commonwealth authority and a Commonwealth company respectively, may be given to the responsible Minister at the end of such further period granted by the Minister under subsection 34C(5) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.


The time taken for a report to be tabled in Parliament, once it is received by the responsible Minister, is determined by subsection 34C(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. That is, the Minister must table the annual report in both Houses of Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving the report.




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that all departments and agencies include a compliance index in future reports.




Response



The Government supports recommendation 2 and has implemented the recommendation for agencies that are subject to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. Those agencies must prepare their annual report in accordance with the requirements set out in the Requirements for Annual Reports. Compliance indexes were listed as a mandatory




requirement when that document was reissued in June 2010.





The inclusion of a compliance index in the annual reports of Commonwealth authorities and wholly-owned Commonwealth companies under the CAC Act is also supported. The Department of Finance and Deregulation will consult departments of State and agencies on the issue of including an index of reporting requirements in future annual reports.





Recommendation 3





The committee recommends that agencies adhere to the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines by including a signed statement by the CEO or agency head certifying that they are satisfied that their agency is in compliance with the guidelines.





Response





The Government notes Recommendation 3.





This proposal is already covered by other arrangements for FMA Act agencies and for Commonwealth authorities or wholly-owned Commonwealth companies that may be subject to the requirements.





The Commonwealth Fraud and Control Guidelines apply to all agencies that are subject to the FMA Act and the reporting requirements of FMA Act agency heads, as specified in the Commonwealth Fraud and Control Guidelines, are noted in the Requirements for Annual Reports. Agencies are responsible for ensuring that they are compliant with those requirements.



Prior to 1 July 2008, where a Commonwealth authority or wholly-owned Commonwealth company received a notification under sections 28 or 43 of the CAC Act, respectively, to apply a policy such as the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines the body must comply with the reporting requirements in the policy. A Commonwealth authority that must comply with the policy must also, in accordance with the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Report of Operations) Orders 2008, report instances of non-compliance with the policy in their annual report. Since 1 July 2008, the process for applying Commonwealth policies to Commonwealth authorities or wholly-owned Commonwealth companies has changed and


Commonwealth policies are now applied through general policies orders. To date, no such orders have been issued, however the Department of Finance and Deregulation is in discussion with a number of agencies, including the Attorney-General's Department, to identify Commonwealth policies, such as the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines, to apply to CAC Act bodies a general policy order.




Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 bodies consider adhering to the Requirements for Annual Reports issued by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.




Response



The Government does not support Recommendation 4. There are separate annual reporting requirements for Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies.


Consistent with section 9 of the CAC Act, the annual reporting requirements for Commonwealth authorities are set out in Schedule 1 of the CAC Act, which includes preparing a report in accordance with the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Report of Operation Orders) 2008. These were issued by the Finance Minister and commenced on 30 June 2008 and therefore were compulsory for 2008-09 reports, due on 15 October 2009.


In accordance with section 36 of the CAC Act, the annual reporting requirements for Commonwealth companies are set out in two places. First, base requirements are set out in the Corporations Act 2001.


Second, as of 1 July 2008, the Finance Minister may make orders for wholly-owned Commonwealth companies. As explained in the explanatory memorandum to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Amendment Bill 2008, this allows for the Finance Minister to require the reporting of matters in addition to those required by the Corporations Act 2001 ""that are appropriate to be included in [Commonwealth companies] annual reports with a view to ensuring consistent reporting of public sector governance and accountability obligations"".


Orders relating to wholly-owned Common­wealth companies, similar to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Report of Operation Orders) 2008 for Commonwealth authorities, are being prepared for consideration by the Finance Minister.


 




Senate References Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade





Inquiry into matters relating to events on HMAS Success





Report on Parliamentary Privilege – possible interference in the work of the committee





Recommendation 1



In light of the committee's experience and its concerns with sections of the Guidelines dealing with witnesses appearing in their private capacity, the committee recommends that the Senate refer this matter, as it relates to the Guidelines, to the Standing Committee of Privileges for its consideration. 




Response:



Agreed. 


The Senate referred the Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees and Related Matters to the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges for inquiry on 21 March 2011.  The Government is willing to engage with the Privileges Committee in this activity.




Recommendation 2



All legal officers in Defence Legal and senior officers in the Ministerial and Executive Support Branch undertake a study of the principles governing the operations of Parliament and of the accountability of government departments and agencies to Parliament.  Further, that in future such a course of study be mandatory for newcomers to these branches.




Response:



Agreed in principle.  


The Government respects the basis for this recommendation and agrees that officers in Defence's Ministerial and Executive Support Branch and legal officers in the Defence Legal Division who support the department's involvement with the parliament should have a very sound grasp of the operations and responsibility of the parliament.


Indeed, the committee may be interested to note that for a number of years Defence has allocated significant resources to develop and conduct a range of tailored in-house training courses for personnel.  A number of these courses are focused on educating staff on the specific issues raised in this recommendation.  There is consistently high demand for these courses and 1,677 Defence personnel in 2009 received the benefit of this training.  


Additionally, in 2007 Defence introduced the mandatory Working with Government course for all Senior Executive Service officers and military equivalents which comprehensively educates the organisation's senior leadership group on their responsibilities in working with Government, as well as their public accountability obligations.


However, the Government does not consider mandating officials from the two specific areas of Defence highlighted in this recommendation to attend such courses to be necessary.  Since only a relatively small proportion of officials in these areas are engaged directly in supporting the organisation's interaction with the parliament, mandating such training for all staff would not be an appropriate allocation of resources.  But, opportunities will be examined to enhance the training and awareness on parliamentary processes and accountability, and the mechanisms to achieve this across all levels in these areas (both for public servants and military personnel).


The Government recognises that there is also a range of externally provided courses that address the issues identified in this recommendation, including the Senate's own comprehensive education and training program.  The Government encourages departments and agencies to consider these types of courses and provide opportunities for staff to attend if they meet their training needs.


 




Australian Government response





Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee 





Report into the Import Risk Analysis (IRA) for the importation of Cavendish bananas from the Philippines





Introduction



The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee (the Committee) announced its intention to hold an inquiry into the import risk analysis (IRA) for the importation of Cavendish bananas from the Philippines on 27 November 2008.


Australia's Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine made a policy determination in March 2009 in relation to the importation of bananas from the Philippines based on Biosecurity Australia's final IRA report conducted in accordance with the process contained in the 2003 IRA handbook.


The Committee held In-Camera hearings in Canberra 11–12 March 2009 with a range of witnesses including officers from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and a supplementary hearing, solely with Department officers, on 2 April 2009.




Responses to Recommendations





Recommendation 1 - ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE 



4.21 The IRA handbook should be reviewed to clarify the level of detail to be provided in relation to recommending parameters or conditions for import in a final Import Risk Analysis report. 


The Government accepts this recommendation in principle. The Government has agreed in principle to significant reforms of Australia's biosecurity system as detailed in 'The Independent Review of Australia's Quarantine and Biosecurity Arrangements' (the Beale Review). As part of this process, the Government is considering reviewing all the information contained in the IRA Handbook including the level of detail that should be provided in final IRA documents.


The IRA Handbook outlines the process that Biosecurity Australia follows to undertake an IRA. The IRA Handbook sets out an administrative process for the conduct of import risk analyses.




Recommendation 2   NOT ACCEPTED



4.24 The committee therefore recommends that the Senate order that, prior to the approval of any import permits for bananas from the Philippines into Australia, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), in consultation with Biosecurity Australia, shall provide the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee with a report on:


the phytosanitary risk management measures to be implemented by the Philippines together with the analysis undertaken to verify the efficacy of these measures under commercial conditions;


the administrative requirements upon which these phytosanitary risk management measures rely, including:


the operating manual, work plan and certification system;


the requirements for registration of plantations or blocks within plantations supplying bananas for export to Australia;


the pre-clearance arrangements to the administered by AQIS; and


the audit program to be administered by AQIS.


the plantation requirements for plantation/blocks registered for export to Australia;


the packing station requirements; and


the audits and compliance monitoring procedures to be implemented.




AND





Recommendation 3   NOT ACCEPTED



4.25 The committee recommends that in the event of an  import request by the Philippines government or a Philippines import proponent, a formal and structured process be established by the Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine to provide Australian banana growers with meaningful consultation in relation to the assessment of the efficacy of the possible risk management measures and, consequently, the determination of the risk management measures.


The Government does not accept Recommendations 2 and 3 as the information contained in any potential operational plan is government-to-government communication and is considered confidential and the release of such information without the consent of the other party may have an adverse impact on Australia's broad bilateral relationship with the Philippines. 


The Government also notes that considerable consultation occurred with all stakeholders on all aspects of the IRA, including the Australian banana industry, as part of the formal, broad-ranging stakeholder consultation process undertaken during the independent, science based, IRA process. The independent IRA process also includes an independent review mechanism of how stakeholder comments have been addressed and an independent appeal process. Information provided by industry and by other relevant stakeholders through this process forms part of the material that is available to AQIS in developing the potential operational plan. 


Australia's Minister for Agriculture established a policy framework in relation to the release of detailed operational plans in relation to the importation of material into Australia. The policy framework includes that negotiation of operational plans remains confidential, as they are government-to-government communications for the entire negotiation period and until the document is finalised in order to protect the interests of both parties and encourage open communication. Operational import plans are the property of the exporting country. Therefore, the agreement of the exporting country will need to be obtained before any information contained in the operational import plans is disclosed. This process is designed to respect the integrity of government-to-government communications and relationships, and to provide consistent treatment for trading partners. Furthermore, Australia is obliged to protect the confidentiality of information relating to the production and handling of an imported product under Annex C (1) (d) of the WTO SPS Agreement, as well as protect commercial-in-confidence information which may be included in an operational import plan.  


In addition, maintaining government-to-government confidentially during the entire period of the negotiation of operational import plans is important for demonstrating to trading partners that Australia's quarantine process is based on sound science and free from industry or political influence. 




Recommendation 4   ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE



4.26 The committee recommends that, in the event of the issue of an import permit, representatives of the Australian banana industry are promptly notified of that fact, excluding information which is commercial-in-confidence.


The Government accepts this recommendation in principle, taking into consideration the principles of both the privacy and freedom of information legislation. 


The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry undertakes to advise the Australian banana industry if an import permit were issued for the importation of mature hard green banana fruit from the Philippines taking into account the commercial confidentiality rights of the permit holder.




Recommendation 5   ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE



4.27 The committee recommends that the Senate order Biosecurity Australia and AQIS to undertake a review of the import requirements for bananas from the Philippines after the first year of trade and to provide a report of this review to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee.


The Government accepts this recommendation in principle, noting that this IRA report and all other IRA reports include a review mechanism.  A review of the import requirements will be undertaken if commercial trade occurs for at least twelve months.  The review would form the basis of a report for the Committee.


Following significant trade AQIS and Biosecurity Australia routinely undertake reviews of import requirements to ensure that agreed procedures and protocols are meeting Australia's requirements and achieving Australia's appropriate level of protection.


 




JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES





REPORT 107: REVIEW INTO TREATIES TABLED ON 20 AUGUST (2) AND 15 SEPTEMBER 2009





GOVERNMENT RESPONSE





IMF Voice and Participation Amendment





Recommendation 5





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government use the good will it has gained by agreeing to the IMF Voice and Participation Amendment prior to the G20 meeting to progress improvements in the balance of voting power and the confidence and legitimacy of the IMF
'
s decision making process.





Response:





The Government accepts this recommendation. The Government is a strong advocate of reform of IMF quotas and governance and notes that G20 Leaders agreed in September 2009 that the further modernisation of the IMF
'
s governance, including the balance of voting power, is a core element in the effort to improve the IMF
'
s credibility, legitimacy and effectiveness. The Government played an active role, including by co-chairing the relevant G20 Working Group, in the agreement on the third stage of IMF governance reform reached by G20 Finance Ministers and the IMF Board of Governors in late 2010. This agreement includes a doubling of IMF quotas and further shifts in voting power to dynamic emerging market and developing countries, and from over- to under-represented countries, both of almost 6 per cent. It also includes a more representative IMF Executive Board with advanced European countries agreeing to reduce their representation in favour of emerging market and developing countries.





Dissenting report: Recommendation 5





The Coalition is concerned that by agreeing to the IMF Voice and Participation Amendment the Government may act against the best interest of Australia by reducing our voting influence and that of other larger nations.



Australia's voting share is set to decline from 1.47 per cent of the votes to 1.31 per cent of the votes. Far from marginal, this decline in voting share of 0.16 per cent of votes signs away 11 percent of our current vote share.


While we support a greater engagement of developing nations within the IMF we are not convinced that this proposal will improve the quality of governance of the IMF.




Response to Dissenting report:



As noted in the National Interest Analysis provided to the Committee, IMF quota and voice reform — including the increase in basic votes provided for in the IMF Voice and Participation Amendment — results in a decline in Australia's relative voting share in the IMF. This reflects an increase in relative voting share provided to under-represented emerging market economies, including in our region, and the increase in basic votes benefitting small and low-income members. However, the 2010 agreement will moderate the decline in Australia's voting share, resulting in a share of 1.33 per cent of total votes compared with 1.31 per cent following the 2008 Voice and Participation Amendment.


Reform in this area has had bipartisan support in Australia. The first stage of reform was agreed by IMF Governors in September 2006 while the second stage was developed in 2007 and early 2008, and agreed by IMF Governors in April 2008.


The Government considers that the Amendment and related quota reforms are an important mechanism for enhancing the legitimacy of the IMF as an international financial institution with near-universal membership. A strong and effective IMF advances Australia's interests by supporting stability in the global economy.




IMF Investment Authority Amendment





Recommendation 6



The Committee recommends that, consistent with the IMF's goals of international economic stability and fostering growth and economic development, the Australian Government advocate that the IMF not invest in:


high risk investments;


the manufacture of arms or military equipment; and


environmentally damaging industries.




Response:



The Government notes that the IMF will adopt rules and regulations (for example, imposing restrictions on types of investments and setting risk tolerance levels) regarding investments of currencies held in its investment account. The IMF Executive Board is expected to consider rules and regulations in the first half of 2011.


The Government expects that the IMF would not involve itself in 'high risk' investments and the Government accepts this part of the Committee's recommendation.


The Government notes that, while the nature of the IMF's operations suggests that explicit


decisions to invest in arms or military equip­ment or environmentally damaging industries are highly unlikely, inadvertent investment may occur through the IMF's proposed use of a passive investment approach, involving the close tracking of widely used benchmark indices. Restrictions on such investments may need to await the further development of investment methodologies and market practice.


The Government will seek comments on the issue from IMF staff in the context of the forthcoming IMF work on rules and regulations governing IMF investments.




Dissenting report: Recommendation 6



The Coalition is concerned that recommendation 6 does not provide sufficient definition as to what constitutes 'high risk', 'arms or military equipment' or 'environmentally damaging'. Without clear definitions of these terms it is possible that legitimate investments could be thwarted by an overly wide or indiscriminate reading of these terms.


If the Australian Government were to advocate for the proscriptions outlined in recommendation 6 we risk creating an overly prescriptive regime for the IMF to operate within and may unnecessarily impede the IMF's ability to respond in the best interests of all countries concerned.




Response to Dissenting report:



The Government notes the concerns expressed in the Dissenting report – Coalition Members and Senators.


As has been the Australian Government's position on other IMF policy discussions in the past, the Government will approach upcoming discussions on the IMF's investment policies with a view to ensuring that the IMF's ability to respond in the best interests of its members is not impeded.




World Bank Voice and Participation Amendment





Recommendation 7



The Committee recommends that the Australian Government support the proposal of the Development Committee of the World Bank to increase the quota of votes allocated to developing countries to at least 47 per cent.




Response:



The Government accepts this recommendation. At the April 2010 World Bank Spring Meetings, the Development Committee endorsed a package of reforms which included greater voice for developing and transition countries within the World Bank. The reforms will increase the voting power of developing and transition countries in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) by 3.13 per cent, bringing their voting power to 47.19 per cent. This agreement includes a capital increase of US$86.2 billion. For the next shareholding review in 2015, the Development Committee agreed to develop a dynamic formula that reflects countries' evolving economic weight and the World Bank's development mission, moving over time towards equitable voting power and protecting the voting power of the smallest poor countries.


The Government actively worked towards the achievement of these voice reforms.




Dissenting report: Recommendation 7





The Coalition is concerned that by agreeing to the World Bank Voice and Participation Amendment the Government may act against the best interest of Australia by reducing our voting influence and that of other larger economies.



Australia's voting share is set to decline from 1.53 per cent of the vote to 1.49 per cent of the votes. This decline in vote share of 0.04 per cent of the vote signs away over 2.6 per cent of our current vote share.




Australian influence in the World Bank would be further diluted if Recommendation 7 is supported and eventuates as a later World Bank Amendment.





While we support a greater engagement of developing economies within the World Bank we are not convinced that this proposal will improve the quality of governance of the World Bank.





Response to Dissenting report:





The World Bank Voice and Participation Amendment will result in a marginal decline in Australia
'
s voting share. As noted in the National Interest Analysis, the decline in Australia
'
s relative voting share is not expected to significantly alter the dynamic within our World Bank constituency or our influence within the Bank.





Once the further reforms endorsed by the Development Committee in April 2010 have been implemented, Australia will hold 1.33 per cent of voting power at the IBRD. Again, this is not expected to significantly alter the dynamic within our World Bank constituency or Australia
'
s influence within the Bank.





These reforms have had bipartisan support in Australia.





Increasing the voting share of small developing and transition countries aims to improve the effectiveness and legitimacy of the World Bank as the leading global development institution and enhance the engagement of those countries with its governance, policies and decision-making.





Amended Chapeau Defence Agreement





Recommendation 8



The Committee recommends that the Australian Government explore mechanisms to ensure that Australian personnel convicted of crimes for which the penalty is death while serving in the United States are not subject to the death penalty.




Response:





Agree in principle.



Consideration of privileges and immunities is a normal part of the risk assessment process for any operational deployment, or non-operational posting of Defence personnel to a foreign country. Where, for example, the ADF is deployed for operational purposes such as peace enforcement, restoring law and order, or disaster relief at the invitation of a host government that has the death penalty, we seek immunity from the death penalty.


In the majority of cases where ADF personnel are on non-operational deployments, postings or overseas service, there are no agreements or arrangements specifying any immunities or privileges in respect of local law. Many of these countries have the death penalty; notable examples are the United States, Japan and Thailand. For non-operational deployments and postings, mainly the case with the United States, Defence personnel are likely to be engaged in activities which are considered to be lower risk than operational deployments.


The Government remains universally opposed to the death penalty. It is Australian Government policy to make representations on behalf of Australian citizens facing the death penalty when all appeal and other process have been exhausted. It is also Australian Government policy to encourage universal ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Protocol prohibits the States Parties from executing anyone within their jurisdiction.


 




GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES REPORT NO 111 ON THE AMENDMENTS TO APPENDICES I AND II OF THE CONVENTION ON THE CONSERVATION OF MIGRATORY SPECIES OF WILD ANIMALS





Recommendation 1




The Committee recommends that the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts review its consultation processes for environmental treaties to ensure

that more effective consultation is undertaken with a full range ofpotentially interested parties.




Government Response Noted.





The now Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities agrees that consultations 
undertaken in future, particularly for amendments to the Appendices of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, will encompass the full range of potentially interested parties. It is noted that past consultation practices may have led to some segments of the community not being consulted on matters that may have potentially affected them until after critical decisions had been made.





In future, the department will undertake extensive consultation with all potentially interested and affected parties prior to any formal government support, or otherwise, being provided on the issue in relation to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species. It will include consultations with relevant Commonwealth departments, State and Territory management agencies, environmental non-government organisations and other non-government organisations, as relevant.





The Committee will be pleased to note that the department has already implemented some of these practices in relation to another Convention — the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES). In the lead up to the recent Conference of Parties in March 2010 (CoP 15), the department formally invited interest in participating on the Australian delegation from Commonwealth, State and Territory government, environment non-government organisations and industry. Formal consultation inviting comments on the listing proposals and agenda items for CoP 15 was undertaken through letters to key stakeholders and an invitation for public comment posted on the department

Furthermore, Australia is obliged to protect the confidentiality of information relating to the production and handling of an imported product under Annex C (1) (d) of the WTO SPS Agreement, as well as protect commercial-in-confidence information which may be included in an operational import plan.  


In addition, maintaining government-to-government confidentially during the entire period of the negotiation of operational import plans is important for demonstrating to trading partners that Australia's quarantine process is based on sound science and free from industry or political influence. 




Recommendation 4   ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE



4.26 The committee recommends that, in the event of the issue of an import permit, representatives of the Australian banana industry are promptly notified of that fact, excluding information which is commercial-in-confidence.


The Government accepts this recommendation in principle, taking into consideration the principles of both the privacy and freedom of information legislation. 


The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry undertakes to advise the Australian banana industry if an import permit were issued for the importation of mature hard green banana fruit from the Philippines taking into account the commercial confidentiality rights of the permit holder.




Recommendation 5   ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE



4.27 The committee recommends that the Senate order Biosecurity Australia and AQIS to undertake a review of the import requirements for bananas from the Philippines after the first year of trade and to provide a report of this review to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee.


The Government accepts this recommendation in principle, noting that this IRA report and all other IRA reports include a review mechanism.  A review of the import requirements will be undertaken if commercial trade occurs for at least twelve months.  The review would form the basis of a report for the Committee.


Following significant trade AQIS and Biosecurity Australia routinely undertake reviews of import requirements to ensure that agreed procedures and protocols are meeting Australia's requirements and achieving Australia's appropriate level of protection.

Economics References Committee – Interim report





Impacts of supermarket price decisions on the dairy industry



Pursuant to Senate Standing Order 38(7), I present to you an interim report of the Economics References Committee in relation to the Committee's inquiry into the impacts of supermarket price decisions on the dairy industry.


The matter was referred to the Committee on 10 February 2011 for report by 15 April 2011. To date, the Committee has received 151 subm­issions and has held public hearings in Melbourne (8 March 2011), Sydney (9 March 2011) and Canberra (10 and 29 March 2011). To enable the Committee to consider the significant amount of information received, the Committee sought an extension of its reporting date to 20 April 2011, which the Senate approved on 21 March 2011.


The Committee is aware that the inquiry has generated considerable interest and understands that many parties are awaiting the release of the report. It is also aware, however, of the need to balance timeliness with the quality of the analysis. Many of the issues which are the subject of this inquiry require ongoing scrutiny. There are complex interactions between farmers, processors and retailers; and short-term effects may differ significantly from medium-term effects. In particular, the Committee believes the impact of the reductions in retail milk prices depends crucially on how long they are in place, and the extent to which they are reflected in upcoming contract renegotiations with processors. 


Additionally, the Committee, and many individuals and organisations who participated in this inquiry, are aware that the Government has not provided a response to the report of its previous inquiry, Milking it for all it's worth—competition and pricing in the Australian dairy industry. This comprehensive report was tabled on 13 May 2010 and made 16 recommendations.


The Committee also only received Coles' responses to their questions on notice in the afternoon of 19 April 2011. This has meant that the Committee has not had sufficient opportunity to consider this new information.


Consequently, the Committee has decided to present a further interim report before 10 May 2011, which will analyse the evidence that the Committee has received and invite responses and/or further information to be provided. The Committee will then collect and assess further information and examine developments in the dairy industry as they occur to inform its final report, which will be tabled by 1 October 2011.




Recommendation 1



The Committee calls on the Government to table a formal response to the Committee's report Milking it for all it's worth—competition and pricing in the Australian dairy industry by 13 May 2011, which will be a year after it was tabled.


 




GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE ANTI) PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REPORT





ANNUAL REPORTS (No.1 of 2009)





INTRODUCTION



The Australian Government welcomes the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the committee's examination of annual reports for portfolios that it has oversight, which were tabled for the period between 1 May 2008 and 31 October 2008.


The Government recognises that the primary purpose of annual reports of departments is accountability, in particular to the Parliament Annual reports serve to inform the Parliament, other stakeholders, educational and research institutions, the media and the general public about the operation and performance of Commonwealth entities.




RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATION





The Committee made four recommendations.





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that Ministers ensure that annual reports are tabled in the Parliament as soon as is practicable after receipt of reports from agencies.




Response



The Government notes Recommendation 1.


While it is good practice for Ministers to table annual reports as soon as practicable after receipt of reports from agencies, unless it is otherwise specified in legislation, it remains the Government's policy that all annual reports should be tabled by 31 October.


The requirement for Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act) agencies to table annual reports by 31 October is specified in the Requirements for Annual Reports for Departments, Executive Agencies and FMA Act Bodies (""the Requirements for Annual Reports""). Agencies need to seek an extension under the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 should that timeframe not be met.


Current legislative arrangements for Common­wealth authorities and Commonwealth companies provide for the tabling of annual reports in Parliament as soon as practicable after the receipt of reports from agencies. Under the existing framework, paragraph 9(2)(a) of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act) provides that the annual report of a Commonwealth authority must be given to its responsible Minister by the 15th day of the fourth month after the end of the financial year.


Subsection 36(1A) of the CAC Act provides that the annual report of a Commonwealth company must be given to its responsible Minister if the company is required by the Corporations Act 2001 to hold an annual general meeting, 21 days before the next annual general meeting or four months after the end of the financial year, whichever is earlier. In any other case, the Commonwealth company must provide its responsible Minister with its annual report four months after the end of the financial year


Paragraph 9(2)(b) and subsection 36(1A) of the CAC Act also provide that an annual report for a Commonwealth authority and a Commonwealth company respectively, may be given to the responsible Minister at the end of such further period granted by the Minister under subsection 34C(5) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.


The time taken for a report to be tabled in Parliament, once it is received by the responsible Minister, is determined by subsection 34C(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. That is, the Minister must table the annual report in both Houses of Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving the report.




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that all departments and agencies include a compliance index in future reports.




Response



The Government supports recommendation 2 and has implemented the recommendation for agencies that are subject to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. Those agencies must prepare their annual report in accordance with the requirements set out in the Requirements for Annual Reports. Compliance indexes were listed as a mandatory




requirement when that document was reissued in June 2010.





The inclusion of a compliance index in the annual reports of Commonwealth authorities and wholly-owned Commonwealth companies under the CAC Act is also supported. The Department of Finance and Deregulation will consult departments of State and agencies on the issue of including an index of reporting requirements in future annual reports.





Recommendation 3





The committee recommends that agencies adhere to the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines by including a signed statement by the CEO or agency head certifying that they are satisfied that their agency is in compliance with the guidelines.





Response





The Government notes Recommendation 3.





This proposal is already covered by other arrangements for FMA Act agencies and for Commonwealth authorities or wholly-owned Commonwealth companies that may be subject to the requirements.





The Commonwealth Fraud and Control Guidelines apply to all agencies that are subject to the FMA Act and the reporting requirements of FMA Act agency heads, as specified in the Commonwealth Fraud and Control Guidelines, are noted in the Requirements for Annual Reports. Agencies are responsible for ensuring that they are compliant with those requirements.



Prior to 1 July 2008, where a Commonwealth authority or wholly-owned Commonwealth company received a notification under sections 28 or 43 of the CAC Act, respectively, to apply a policy such as the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines the body must comply with the reporting requirements in the policy. A Commonwealth authority that must comply with the policy must also, in accordance with the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Report of Operations) Orders 2008, report instances of non-compliance with the policy in their annual report. Since 1 July 2008, the process for applying Commonwealth policies to Commonwealth authorities or wholly-owned Commonwealth companies has changed and


Commonwealth policies are now applied through general policies orders. To date, no such orders have been issued, however the Department of Finance and Deregulation is in discussion with a number of agencies, including the Attorney-General's Department, to identify Commonwealth policies, such as the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines, to apply to CAC Act bodies a general policy order.




Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 bodies consider adhering to the Requirements for Annual Reports issued by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.




Response



The Government does not support Recommendation 4. There are separate annual reporting requirements for Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies.


Consistent with section 9 of the CAC Act, the annual reporting requirements for Commonwealth authorities are set out in Schedule 1 of the CAC Act, which includes preparing a report in accordance with the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Report of Operation Orders) 2008. These were issued by the Finance Minister and commenced on 30 June 2008 and therefore were compulsory for 2008-09 reports, due on 15 October 2009.


In accordance with section 36 of the CAC Act, the annual reporting requirements for Commonwealth companies are set out in two places. First, base requirements are set out in the Corporations Act 2001.


Second, as of 1 July 2008, the Finance Minister may make orders for wholly-owned Commonwealth companies. As explained in the explanatory memorandum to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Amendment Bill 2008, this allows for the Finance Minister to require the reporting of matters in addition to those required by the Corporations Act 2001 ""that are appropriate to be included in [Commonwealth companies] annual reports with a view to ensuring consistent reporting of public sector governance and accountability obligations"".


Orders relating to wholly-owned Common­wealth companies, similar to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Report of Operation Orders) 2008 for Commonwealth authorities, are being prepared for consideration by the Finance Minister.


 




Senate References Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade





Inquiry into matters relating to events on HMAS Success





Report on Parliamentary Privilege – possible interference in the work of the committee





Recommendation 1



In light of the committee's experience and its concerns with sections of the Guidelines dealing with witnesses appearing in their private capacity, the committee recommends that the Senate refer this matter, as it relates to the Guidelines, to the Standing Committee of Privileges for its consideration. 




Response:



Agreed. 


The Senate referred the Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees and Related Matters to the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges for inquiry on 21 March 2011.  The Government is willing to engage with the Privileges Committee in this activity.




Recommendation 2



All legal officers in Defence Legal and senior officers in the Ministerial and Executive Support Branch undertake a study of the principles governing the operations of Parliament and of the accountability of government departments and agencies to Parliament.  Further, that in future such a course of study be mandatory for newcomers to these branches.




Response:



Agreed in principle.  


The Government respects the basis for this recommendation and agrees that officers in Defence's Ministerial and Executive Support Branch and legal officers in the Defence Legal Division who support the department's involvement with the parliament should have a very sound grasp of the operations and responsibility of the parliament.


Indeed, the committee may be interested to note that for a number of years Defence has allocated significant resources to develop and conduct a range of tailored in-house training courses for personnel.  A number of these courses are focused on educating staff on the specific issues raised in this recommendation.  There is consistently high demand for these courses and 1,677 Defence personnel in 2009 received the benefit of this training.  


Additionally, in 2007 Defence introduced the mandatory Working with Government course for all Senior Executive Service officers and military equivalents which comprehensively educates the organisation's senior leadership group on their responsibilities in working with Government, as well as their public accountability obligations.


However, the Government does not consider mandating officials from the two specific areas of Defence highlighted in this recommendation to attend such courses to be necessary.  Since only a relatively small proportion of officials in these areas are engaged directly in supporting the organisation's interaction with the parliament, mandating such training for all staff would not be an appropriate allocation of resources.  But, opportunities will be examined to enhance the training and awareness on parliamentary processes and accountability, and the mechanisms to achieve this across all levels in these areas (both for public servants and military personnel).


The Government recognises that there is also a range of externally provided courses that address the issues identified in this recommendation, including the Senate's own comprehensive education and training program.  The Government encourages departments and agencies to consider these types of courses and provide opportunities for staff to attend if they meet their training needs.


 




Australian Government response





Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee 





Report into the Import Risk Analysis (IRA) for the importation of Cavendish bananas from the Philippines





Introduction



The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee (the Committee) announced its intention to hold an inquiry into the import risk analysis (IRA) for the importation of Cavendish bananas from the Philippines on 27 November 2008.


Australia's Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine made a policy determination in March 2009 in relation to the importation of bananas from the Philippines based on Biosecurity Australia's final IRA report conducted in accordance with the process contained in the 2003 IRA handbook.


The Committee held In-Camera hearings in Canberra 11–12 March 2009 with a range of witnesses including officers from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and a supplementary hearing, solely with Department officers, on 2 April 2009.




Responses to Recommendations





Recommendation 1 - ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE 



4.21 The IRA handbook should be reviewed to clarify the level of detail to be provided in relation to recommending parameters or conditions for import in a final Import Risk Analysis report. 


The Government accepts this recommendation in principle. The Government has agreed in principle to significant reforms of Australia's biosecurity system as detailed in 'The Independent Review of Australia's Quarantine and Biosecurity Arrangements' (the Beale Review). As part of this process, the Government is considering reviewing all the information contained in the IRA Handbook including the level of detail that should be provided in final IRA documents.


The IRA Handbook outlines the process that Biosecurity Australia follows to undertake an IRA. The IRA Handbook sets out an administrative process for the conduct of import risk analyses.




Recommendation 2   NOT ACCEPTED



4.24 The committee therefore recommends that the Senate order that, prior to the approval of any import permits for bananas from the Philippines into Australia, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), in consultation with Biosecurity Australia, shall provide the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee with a report on:


the phytosanitary risk management measures to be implemented by the Philippines together with the analysis undertaken to verify the efficacy of these measures under commercial conditions;


the administrative requirements upon which these phytosanitary risk management measures rely, including:


the operating manual, work plan and certification system;


the requirements for registration of plantations or blocks within plantations supplying bananas for export to Australia;


the pre-clearance arrangements to the administered by AQIS; and


the audit program to be administered by AQIS.


the plantation requirements for plantation/blocks registered for export to Australia;


the packing station requirements; and


the audits and compliance monitoring procedures to be implemented.




AND





Recommendation 3   NOT ACCEPTED



4.25 The committee recommends that in the event of an  import request by the Philippines government or a Philippines import proponent, a formal and structured process be established by the Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine to provide Australian banana growers with meaningful consultation in relation to the assessment of the efficacy of the possible risk management measures and, consequently, the determination of the risk management measures.


The Government does not accept Recommendations 2 and 3 as the information contained in any potential operational plan is government-to-government communication and is considered confidential and the release of such information without the consent of the other party may have an adverse impact on Australia's broad bilateral relationship with the Philippines. 


The Government also notes that considerable consultation occurred with all stakeholders on all aspects of the IRA, including the Australian banana industry, as part of the formal, broad-ranging stakeholder consultation process undertaken during the independent, science based, IRA process. The independent IRA process also includes an independent review mechanism of how stakeholder comments have been addressed and an independent appeal process. Information provided by industry and by other relevant stakeholders through this process forms part of the material that is available to AQIS in developing the potential operational plan. 


Australia's Minister for Agriculture established a policy framework in relation to the release of detailed operational plans in relation to the importation of material into Australia. The policy framework includes that negotiation of operational plans remains confidential, as they are government-to-government communications for the entire negotiation period and until the document is finalised in order to protect the interests of both parties and encourage open communication. Operational import plans are the property of the exporting country. Therefore, the agreement of the exporting country will need to be obtained before any information contained in the operational import plans is disclosed. This process is designed to respect the integrity of government-to-government communications and relationships, and to provide consistent treatment for trading partners. Furthermore, Australia is obliged to protect the confidentiality of information relating to the production and handling of an imported product under Annex C (1) (d) of the WTO SPS Agreement, as well as protect commercial-in-confidence information which may be included in an operational import plan.  


In addition, maintaining government-to-government confidentially during the entire period of the negotiation of operational import plans is important for demonstrating to trading partners that Australia's quarantine process is based on sound science and free from industry or political influence. 




Recommendation 4   ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE



4.26 The committee recommends that, in the event of the issue of an import permit, representatives of the Australian banana industry are promptly notified of that fact, excluding information which is commercial-in-confidence.


The Government accepts this recommendation in principle, taking into consideration the principles of both the privacy and freedom of information legislation. 


The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry undertakes to advise the Australian banana industry if an import permit were issued for the importation of mature hard green banana fruit from the Philippines taking into account the commercial confidentiality rights of the permit holder.




Recommendation 5   ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE



4.27 The committee recommends that the Senate order Biosecurity Australia and AQIS to undertake a review of the import requirements for bananas from the Philippines after the first year of trade and to provide a report of this review to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee.


The Government accepts this recommendation in principle, noting that this IRA report and all other IRA reports include a review mechanism.  A review of the import requirements will be undertaken if commercial trade occurs for at least twelve months.  The review would form the basis of a report for the Committee.


Following significant trade AQIS and Biosecurity Australia routinely undertake reviews of import requirements to ensure that agreed procedures and protocols are meeting Australia's requirements and achieving Australia's appropriate level of protection.


 




JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES





REPORT 107: REVIEW INTO TREATIES TABLED ON 20 AUGUST (2) AND 15 SEPTEMBER 2009





GOVERNMENT RESPONSE





IMF Voice and Participation Amendment





Recommendation 5





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government use the good will it has gained by agreeing to the IMF Voice and Participation Amendment prior to the G20 meeting to progress improvements in the balance of voting power and the confidence and legitimacy of the IMF
'
s decision making process.





Response:





The Government accepts this recommendation. The Government is a strong advocate of reform of IMF quotas and governance and notes that G20 Leaders agreed in September 2009 that the further modernisation of the IMF
'
s governance, including the balance of voting power, is a core element in the effort to improve the IMF
'
s credibility, legitimacy and effectiveness. The Government played an active role, including by co-chairing the relevant G20 Working Group, in the agreement on the third stage of IMF governance reform reached by G20 Finance Ministers and the IMF Board of Governors in late 2010. This agreement includes a doubling of IMF quotas and further shifts in voting power to dynamic emerging market and developing countries, and from over- to under-represented countries, both of almost 6 per cent. It also includes a more representative IMF Executive Board with advanced European countries agreeing to reduce their representation in favour of emerging market and developing countries.





Dissenting report: Recommendation 5





The Coalition is concerned that by agreeing to the IMF Voice and Participation Amendment the Government may act against the best interest of Australia by reducing our voting influence and that of other larger nations.



Australia's voting share is set to decline from 1.47 per cent of the votes to 1.31 per cent of the votes. Far from marginal, this decline in voting share of 0.16 per cent of votes signs away 11 percent of our current vote share.


While we support a greater engagement of developing nations within the IMF we are not convinced that this proposal will improve the quality of governance of the IMF.




Response to Dissenting report:



As noted in the National Interest Analysis provided to the Committee, IMF quota and voice reform — including the increase in basic votes provided for in the IMF Voice and Participation Amendment — results in a decline in Australia's relative voting share in the IMF. This reflects an increase in relative voting share provided to under-represented emerging market economies, including in our region, and the increase in basic votes benefitting small and low-income members. However, the 2010 agreement will moderate the decline in Australia's voting share, resulting in a share of 1.33 per cent of total votes compared with 1.31 per cent following the 2008 Voice and Participation Amendment.


Reform in this area has had bipartisan support in Australia. The first stage of reform was agreed by IMF Governors in September 2006 while the second stage was developed in 2007 and early 2008, and agreed by IMF Governors in April 2008.


The Government considers that the Amendment and related quota reforms are an important mechanism for enhancing the legitimacy of the IMF as an international financial institution with near-universal membership. A strong and effective IMF advances Australia's interests by supporting stability in the global economy.




IMF Investment Authority Amendment





Recommendation 6



The Committee recommends that, consistent with the IMF's goals of international economic stability and fostering growth and economic development, the Australian Government advocate that the IMF not invest in:


high risk investments;


the manufacture of arms or military equipment; and


environmentally damaging industries.




Response:



The Government notes that the IMF will adopt rules and regulations (for example, imposing restrictions on types of investments and setting risk tolerance levels) regarding investments of currencies held in its investment account. The IMF Executive Board is expected to consider rules and regulations in the first half of 2011.


The Government expects that the IMF would not involve itself in 'high risk' investments and the Government accepts this part of the Committee's recommendation.


The Government notes that, while the nature of the IMF's operations suggests that explicit


decisions to invest in arms or military equip­ment or environmentally damaging industries are highly unlikely, inadvertent investment may occur through the IMF's proposed use of a passive investment approach, involving the close tracking of widely used benchmark indices. Restrictions on such investments may need to await the further development of investment methodologies and market practice.


The Government will seek comments on the issue from IMF staff in the context of the forthcoming IMF work on rules and regulations governing IMF investments.




Dissenting report: Recommendation 6



The Coalition is concerned that recommendation 6 does not provide sufficient definition as to what constitutes 'high risk', 'arms or military equipment' or 'environmentally damaging'. Without clear definitions of these terms it is possible that legitimate investments could be thwarted by an overly wide or indiscriminate reading of these terms.


If the Australian Government were to advocate for the proscriptions outlined in recommendation 6 we risk creating an overly prescriptive regime for the IMF to operate within and may unnecessarily impede the IMF's ability to respond in the best interests of all countries concerned.




Response to Dissenting report:



The Government notes the concerns expressed in the Dissenting report – Coalition Members and Senators.


As has been the Australian Government's position on other IMF policy discussions in the past, the Government will approach upcoming discussions on the IMF's investment policies with a view to ensuring that the IMF's ability to respond in the best interests of its members is not impeded.




World Bank Voice and Participation Amendment





Recommendation 7



The Committee recommends that the Australian Government support the proposal of the Development Committee of the World Bank to increase the quota of votes allocated to developing countries to at least 47 per cent.




Response:



The Government accepts this recommendation. At the April 2010 World Bank Spring Meetings, the Development Committee endorsed a package of reforms which included greater voice for developing and transition countries within the World Bank. The reforms will increase the voting power of developing and transition countries in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) by 3.13 per cent, bringing their voting power to 47.19 per cent. This agreement includes a capital increase of US$86.2 billion. For the next shareholding review in 2015, the Development Committee agreed to develop a dynamic formula that reflects countries' evolving economic weight and the World Bank's development mission, moving over time towards equitable voting power and protecting the voting power of the smallest poor countries.


The Government actively worked towards the achievement of these voice reforms.




Dissenting report: Recommendation 7





The Coalition is concerned that by agreeing to the World Bank Voice and Participation Amendment the Government may act against the best interest of Australia by reducing our voting influence and that of other larger economies.



Australia's voting share is set to decline from 1.53 per cent of the vote to 1.49 per cent of the votes. This decline in vote share of 0.04 per cent of the vote signs away over 2.6 per cent of our current vote share.




Australian influence in the World Bank would be further diluted if Recommendation 7 is supported and eventuates as a later World Bank Amendment.





While we support a greater engagement of developing economies within the World Bank we are not convinced that this proposal will improve the quality of governance of the World Bank.





Response to Dissenting report:





The World Bank Voice and Participation Amendment will result in a marginal decline in Australia
'
s voting share. As noted in the National Interest Analysis, the decline in Australia
'
s relative voting share is not expected to significantly alter the dynamic within our World Bank constituency or our influence within the Bank.





Once the further reforms endorsed by the Development Committee in April 2010 have been implemented, Australia will hold 1.33 per cent of voting power at the IBRD. Again, this is not expected to significantly alter the dynamic within our World Bank constituency or Australia
'
s influence within the Bank.





These reforms have had bipartisan support in Australia.





Increasing the voting share of small developing and transition countries aims to improve the effectiveness and legitimacy of the World Bank as the leading global development institution and enhance the engagement of those countries with its governance, policies and decision-making.





Amended Chapeau Defence Agreement





Recommendation 8



The Committee recommends that the Australian Government explore mechanisms to ensure that Australian personnel convicted of crimes for which the penalty is death while serving in the United States are not subject to the death penalty.




Response:





Agree in principle.



Consideration of privileges and immunities is a normal part of the risk assessment process for any operational deployment, or non-operational posting of Defence personnel to a foreign country. Where, for example, the ADF is deployed for operational purposes such as peace enforcement, restoring law and order, or disaster relief at the invitation of a host government that has the death penalty, we seek immunity from the death penalty.


In the majority of cases where ADF personnel are on non-operational deployments, postings or overseas service, there are no agreements or arrangements specifying any immunities or privileges in respect of local law. Many of these countries have the death penalty; notable examples are the United States, Japan and Thailand. For non-operational deployments and postings, mainly the case with the United States, Defence personnel are likely to be engaged in activities which are considered to be lower risk than operational deployments.


The Government remains universally opposed to the death penalty. It is Australian Government policy to make representations on behalf of Australian citizens facing the death penalty when all appeal and other process have been exhausted. It is also Australian Government policy to encourage universal ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Protocol prohibits the States Parties from executing anyone within their jurisdiction.


 




GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES REPORT NO 111 ON THE AMENDMENTS TO APPENDICES I AND II OF THE CONVENTION ON THE CONSERVATION OF MIGRATORY SPECIES OF WILD ANIMALS





Recommendation 1




The Committee recommends that the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts review its consultation processes for environmental treaties to ensure

that more effective consultation is undertaken with a full range ofpotentially interested parties.




Government Response Noted.





The now Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities agrees that consultations 
undertaken in future, particularly for amendments to the Appendices of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, will encompass the full range of potentially interested parties. It is noted that past consultation practices may have led to some segments of the community not being consulted on matters that may have potentially affected them until after critical decisions had been made.





In future, the department will undertake extensive consultation with all potentially interested and affected parties prior to any formal government support, or otherwise, being provided on the issue in relation to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species. It will include consultations with relevant Commonwealth departments, State and Territory management agencies, environmental non-government organisations and other non-government organisations, as relevant.





The Committee will be pleased to note that the department has already implemented some of these practices in relation to another Convention — the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES). In the lead up to the recent Conference of Parties in March 2010 (CoP 15), the department formally invited interest in participating on the Australian delegation from Commonwealth, State and Territory government, environment non-government organisations and industry. Formal consultation inviting comments on the listing proposals and agenda items for CoP 15 was undertaken through letters to key stakeholders and an invitation for public comment posted on the department

Recommendation 3   NOT ACCEPTED



4.25 The committee recommends that in the event of an  import request by the Philippines government or a Philippines import proponent, a formal and structured process be established by the Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine to provide Australian banana growers with meaningful consultation in relation to the assessment of the efficacy of the possible risk management measures and, consequently, the determination of the risk management measures.


The Government does not accept Recommendations 2 and 3 as the information contained in any potential operational plan is government-to-government communication and is considered confidential and the release of such information without the consent of the other party may have an adverse impact on Australia's broad bilateral relationship with the Philippines. 


The Government also notes that considerable consultation occurred with all stakeholders on all aspects of the IRA, including the Australian banana industry, as part of the formal, broad-ranging stakeholder consultation process undertaken during the independent, science based, IRA process. The independent IRA process also includes an independent review mechanism of how stakeholder comments have been addressed and an independent appeal process. Information provided by industry and by other relevant stakeholders through this process forms part of the material that is available to AQIS in developing the potential operational plan. 


Australia's Minister for Agriculture established a policy framework in relation to the release of detailed operational plans in relation to the importation of material into Australia. The policy framework includes that negotiation of operational plans remains confidential, as they are government-to-government communications for the entire negotiation period and until the document is finalised in order to protect the interests of both parties and encourage open communication. Operational import plans are the property of the exporting country. Therefore, the agreement of the exporting country will need to be obtained before any information contained in the operational import plans is disclosed. This process is designed to respect the integrity of government-to-government communications and relationships, and to provide consistent treatment for trading partners. Furthermore, Australia is obliged to protect the confidentiality of information relating to the production and handling of an imported product under Annex C (1) (d) of the WTO SPS Agreement, as well as protect commercial-in-confidence information which may be included in an operational import plan.  


In addition, maintaining government-to-government confidentially during the entire period of the negotiation of operational import plans is important for demonstrating to trading partners that Australia's quarantine process is based on sound science and free from industry or political influence. 




Recommendation 4   ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE



4.26 The committee recommends that, in the event of the issue of an import permit, representatives of the Australian banana industry are promptly notified of that fact, excluding information which is commercial-in-confidence.


The Government accepts this recommendation in principle, taking into consideration the principles of both the privacy and freedom of information legislation. 


The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry undertakes to advise the Australian banana industry if an import permit were issued for the importation of mature hard green banana fruit from the Philippines taking into account the commercial confidentiality rights of the permit holder.




Recommendation 5   ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE



4.27 The committee recommends that the Senate order Biosecurity Australia and AQIS to undertake a review of the import requirements for bananas from the Philippines after the first year of trade and to provide a report of this review to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee.


The Government accepts this recommendation in principle, noting that this IRA report and all other IRA reports include a review mechanism.  A review of the import requirements will be undertaken if commercial trade occurs for at least twelve months.  The review would form the basis of a report for the Committee.


Following significant trade AQIS and Biosecurity Australia routinely undertake reviews of import requirements to ensure that agreed procedures and protocols are meeting Australia's requirements and achieving Australia's appropriate level of protection.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (16:30):  On behalf of Senator Fifield, I move:


That the Senate notes the Labor Government's ceaseless and ongoing commitment to debt and to deficit budgeting, which is putting upward pressure on interest rates and further pressure on household budgets.


Earlier this week Senator Wong, our Minister for Finance and Deregulation, made a very insightful remark to the Sydney Morning Herald. She said that this budget would be 'a Labor budget'. Of course, that was quite at odds with all of the things that we had been led to believe before. We were led to believe that this would be a tough budget, but here she is, the day before the budget, letting the cat out of the bag by saying it would be a Labor budget. And a Labor budget it was: a budget with more waste, more taxes, more deficits, more debt, more class warfare; targeting those Australians who are aspirational, who want to get ahead; trying to penalise success. And, of course, we have had more spin, trying to mislead the Australian people over what was truly happening.


This government wants to make us believe that this is a tough budget. This government wants to make us believe that it has have saved money in this budget. This govern­ment wants to make us believe that it has made tough decisions to cut spending. The Treasurer in his budget speech on Tuesday night said that he had made tough decisions to cut spending to the tune of $22 billion. You know what? The biggest single indi­vidual so-called spending cut in the list of $22 billion worth of spending cuts is the $1.725 billion flood tax. I am sure that people across Australia would agree with us that a tax is not a spending cut.


Let us look at the detail in this budget. Spending over the forward estimates is up by $19 billion. That is on the basis of decisions made over the last six months, since we had MYEFO back in November. So in the last six months this government has made decisions that have increased spending by $19 billion. The government tell us that that has been offset by $22 billion worth of spending cuts. The government tries to make us believe we are still ahead. Well, if it was not for new taxes like the flood tax, if it was not for other tax increases, if it was not for other revenue measures to the tune of $6.2 billion, this government is actually increas­ing net spending over the forward estimates, not reducing it. So that is the first big lie by the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, on Tuesday in relation to the budget.


This government wants to make us believe that somehow the budget is going to be back in the black in 2012-13. That is just completely unbelievable. This year the budget position has deteriorated by about $8 billion, to take us to the second largest deficit in the history of the Commonwealth—a deficit of $50 billion this year. The budget position for next year has deteriorated to the tune of $10.3 billion, to take us to another deficit, of $22.6 billion. Yet, miraculously, in the year 2012-13 where the Treasurer has put his political capital on the line, not only is there not going to be any deterioration at all, there is going to be a significant turnaround.


We actually have the strongest terms of trade in 140 years of Australian history now. The budget should be in a much stronger position now. The budget should be in surplus now. If it had not been for Labor's waste and mismanagement, for their incom­petence across many areas in government, there would be no need for us to be in this deficit position. And in no area is this more obvious than in Labor's failed approach to border protection.


I remember well when, back in August 2008, they came into this chamber, as sanctimonious as anything, telling us how offshore processing did not work, how temporary protection visas did not work: 'We can do away with all this. We're going to have a compassionate response. We think that what you guys did was totally inapp­ropriate.' What did they do? They dismantled a system that worked. They dismantled a strong border protection system, a system that had stopped the boats, and the results are there for all to see. In the last year of the Howard government we spent $100 million a year on managing illegal arrivals. You know what the government is spending next year? More than $1 billion. That is more than a tenfold increase in less than four years. Over the forward estimates, the budget to manage illegal boat arrivals at our borders is increasing by $1.75 billion. If you put that against the $2 billion assault on working families across Australia then you really get a sense of the wrong priorities of this government. This government does not care about the cost-of-living pressures faced by families across Australia. This government needs to make those families pay for the incompetence across so many areas in government, in particular its failure and its bad decision to dismantle our strong border protection policies back in August 2008.


This government is borrowing right now $135 million a day. This government is spending about $20 million a day every day of every week of every month of every year over the next four years. That is $26 billion in interest payments over the forward estimates because of the incredible blow-out in the level of debt.


Wayne Swan and Penny Wong, on Tuesday night, could not bring themselves to mention the debt figure. They were too embarrassed. They were too ashamed. They could not spell out the words '$107 billion worth of net debt'—up from $94 billion net debt only last year.


After the Treasurer had finished his speech, everybody was out there patting him on the back—not everyone but some Labor members, while others got out of the chamber very quickly—and what happened that night? Bill Shorten snuck in quietly, introduced the appropriations bill and, on the sly, came in and asked the parliament to increase the debt ceiling—the approved level of debt the government is allowed to take out—by another $50 billion.


Madam Acting Deputy President, you may well remember, as all of this on this side of the chamber do, that two years ago the government asked the parliament to more than double the debt ceiling. It went up from $75 billion to $200 billion. Actually, there was a little proviso attached to it that this would be for special circumstances, that the Treasurer would have to make a declaration, which had to be gazetted and tabled in both houses of parliament, and that there would have to be a statement explaining the reasons as to why the additional debt was justified.


You know what the government now wants to do? They want this parliament to give the government a blank cheque to put another $50 billion worth of debt on the Labor government's credit card. They want to repeal the requirement to table the statement of reasons in both houses of parlia­ment. They want to repeal the requirement to have the special circumstances declared in the government's Gazette. Madam Acting Deputy President, you tell me why that would be justified.


The Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong, today was certainly not able to explain it. She sneers at us, she abuses us, but she does not provide any explanation. When she refuses to provide explanations to us, she refuses to provide explanations to the Australian people. Minister Wong was not prepared to tell us today when the government expects to reach its current debt ceiling of $200 billion. This is important because we have two figures in the budget papers. We have got the figure of the face value of the government securities that are out there, which is expected to be about $192 billion by 30 June. In the balance sheet, the same government securities are presented on the basis of market value. The market value of government securities right now is expected to be $200.6 billion by the end of June. That is less than six weeks away.


There is no information at all as to when the government expects to reach the $200 billion limit. The government must have known for a long time that it was borrowing so much money and spending so much that it would need to come back to this parliament to ask for approval to borrow more money. Why has it left it so late? It is just another example of this government's absolute incompetence in managing the budget. This government is so out of control when it comes to spending that it cannot keep up with the need to organise the process to get hold of some more money so that it can spend and waste some more of it.


This government has to provide a proper explanation as to why it needs another $50 billion dollars worth of debt and why the parliament should approve another $50 billion worth of debt. The reason the parliament needs that explanation is that the Australian people deserve that explanation. It is quite extraordinary that Minister Wong today was either unable or unwilling to come clean with when the government, based on its projections, expects to run out of money unless the parliament agrees to this additional $50 billion for the Labor govern­ment's credit card.


This is a budget which will hurt Austral­ian families much more than this government is prepared to let people know, because there is a big hole at the heart of this budget. This government has told us that there will be a carbon tax come 1 July 2012. The Prime Minister told us before the last election, looking down the barrel of the camera, 'There will be no carbon tax under the gov­ernment I lead.' Given that she had to come to some understanding with Senator Bob Brown and the Greens so she could scrape back into government, of course we now know there will be a carbon tax from 1 July 2012 if this parliament happens to agree to it.


If there is going to be a carbon tax from 1 July 2012, we know that the revenue figures, the expenditure figures, the inflation figures, the growth figures and the employment figures are all wrong from 2012-13. That just happens to be the year that the government tells us it is going to be back in surplus. But it has left a $12 billion-a-year tax out of the budget. It has left the economic impact of a $12 billion-a-year tax out of the budget. It has left the cost-of-living impacts on Austra­lian families from the carbon tax out of the budget. It has left the impact of a carbon tax on jobs and our international competitiveness out of the budget. This is very different from the way the government has been going about the mining tax. The mining tax has been in the budget for 12 months. It is supposed to come into effect on the same day, 1 July 2012.Madam Acting Deputy President Boyce, do you know why the Labor Party treats the mining tax differently from the carbon tax? Because the govern­ment needs the cash from the mining tax in its budget now so it can create the illusion of an early surplus. 


One of the many fundamental flaws of the mining tax is that it will worsen the structural deficit of Australia because the revenue is high now when we have record terms of trade. It is expected to go down over time as a supply response in commodities will necessarily see a reduction in current record commodity prices, but the related budget expenditures that the government has put out will go up significantly over the next decade. There is hardly any expense at all in the budget related to the mining tax right now, but there is a lot of revenue in the early years. The revenue is going to go down over the years and the expenses that are related to it are going to go up and the expenses are going to be more than the revenue that will be collected from the mining tax. This mining tax is worsening the long-term structural deficit of this government. 


But that was not the Treasurer's worry. The Treasurer was only worried about one thing. He was worried about 2012-13. As long as he could get enough cash out of the mining tax to create the illusion of an early surplus based on record terms of trade then he was not worried about the long-term impact on our public finances. This is how this government does business.


The Treasurer's hollow men, the Treasurer's spin doctors and the Prime Minister's spin doctors have been working the press gallery overtime over the last week, saying this is what the Howard government used to do, that when the Howard govern­ment announced the GST they did not put it in the budget. That is completely false, that is completely incorrect. The GST was announced by the then Howard government, by John Howard and Peter Costello, in August 1998. We went to an election in October 1998, and that is my first very im­portant point. Not only did we not introduce the GST without taking it to the Australian people, but we put it into the next budget. The announcement was made, we went to an election, we put it in the budget.




Senator Humphries:
  We got a mandate.




Senator CORMANN:
  As Senator Humphries said, we got a mandate from the Australian people. The GST was announced in August 1998, we had an election in October 1998 and the next budget, in May 1999, contained all of the budget information about the GST. These are the sorts of misleading statements that the spin doctors of this deceitful government go out and spread in the press gallery. I could go through a whole list of other examples, but I will not bore you with it today.


This is a government that does not care about the cost-of-living pressures faced by Australian families. This is a government that has Australian families squarely in its sights. Do you know which families it has in its sights in particular? Families that aspire to get ahead, families that want to do the best for their family. They want to get a better job, they want to earn some more money, and what is going to happen if they do so under this government? They will be hit with more penalising taxes or with variations of tax, taking tax breaks away from them. This is what the Labor Party does. There is a range of examples. For sometime now we have had on the government's book the proposal to abolish the private health insurance rebate for millions of Australians. This is an absolutely ridiculous proposal.


I was on Richo last night and I will share my experience with the chamber. Former Senator Graham Richardson was the federal Minister for Health back in 1993. He inherited that portfolio after 10 years of Labor government attacks on the private health system. The private health system was collapsing when Senator Graham Richardson became the federal Minister for Health. Private health insurance membership was in freefall and former Senator Richardson was desperately trying to do something to halt the decline. Do you know what he came up with as a proposal at the time? He proposed to have a Medicare levy surcharge. He proposed to have a surcharge applied to those Australians without private health insurance that earned above certain thresholds. Of course, Paul Keating and the unions stopped him from doing it. They stopped him from getting away with it. 


John Howard and the Howard government introduced a package of measures that restored balance to our health system, that actually provided incentive for Australians to take additional responsibility for their healthcare needs, that encouraged them to take out private health insurance to take the burden off our public hospitals. This was a very, very successful package of initiatives. What has this government done? They have not learnt from history; they want to go back to the failures of the Hawke-Keating government; they want to again attack and pursue those Australians who are prepared to take additional responsibility for their healthcare needs by taking the private health insurance rebate away from them.


This budget is full of class warfare. It is full of more taxes, it is full of more waste. The debt and deficit are blowing out and this a very sad situation for Australia. It is time that we return to good government. It is time that we return to a coalition government which can restore strength and resilience to our budget and which can restore strength and resilience to our economy.

Senator HURLEY,ALP,2011-05-12,"



Senator HURLEY
 (South Australia) (16:50):  Senator Cormann was certainly very loyal to the coalition in that he did not give away any of Mr Abbott's budget reply speech. Certainly he presented nothing new to us. He ran along the same old tracks of trying to make a case that the coalition are better economic managers than the Labor Party. But in fact this budget is quite solid proof that the opposite is true. Labor has presented a budget that is a solid foundation for the future, as have been the last couple of budgets. This makes a nonsense of the motion that we have before us. As Senator Cormann did, I will read it out:


The Senate notes the Labor government's ceaseless and ongoing commitment to debt and to deficit budgeting …'A ceaseless and ongoing commitment to debt and deficit budgeting' which will cease next year—


So much for the veracity of that part of the statement. This is a solid commitment which has been a commitment of the Labor government for some years now. The Labor government is committed to a surplus in 2012-13 and this budget shows that the Labor Party is able to and will deliver a surplus next year and that those surpluses will continue. That is completely reflected in this budget and upholds the Labor government's commitment.


Once again we have heard 20 minutes of debate from members of the coalition government where they conveniently overlook that the world has experienced one of the greatest financial crises in 70 years, that the GFC was real, that quick action was required and that the Labor Party took that action. The Labor Party took necessary measures to ensure that our country was not plunged into a recession. Australia was one of the only countries that got out of the crisis relatively unscathed, but that does not mean it was not affected. What is horrifying is that had we taken the coalition's approach Australia would have been probably in greater deficit because we would have coped with falling economic revenue from the effect of being in recession and we would have had major unemployment with the depressing effect that has on the economy and on revenue and the resultant increase in welfare expenditure. 


The Labor government tackled that issue in the teeth of opposition from the coalition parties and introduced stimulus spending. Stimulus spending was targeted to have longer term benefits in the way of infrastructure. Having spent the last few weeks going to a number of country areas in the Yorke and Eyre peninsulas and opening much-needed infrastructure in those schools in the form of libraries, outdoor areas and classrooms, I at least saw very clearly and practically the effect of this stimulus spending. The government committed that stimulus spending and Australia came out of the GFC relatively well. At the time the Labor government promised that we would, at the right time, reduce that stimulus spending and put the economy back on an even keel, and that is what we have delivered in this budget. Thankfully, the Labor government did have that vision and foresight, because over 700,000 jobs have been created since Labor was elected in 2007.


What are the economic credentials of the coalition government? Again, we hear time after time, and one understands this, the coalition spruik their economic credentials. In fact the evidence shows the opposite—first of all in their response to what was happening with the GFC and, second, in the economic outlook that they took to the last election—the $11 billion black hole. If the coalition government had been put into office at the last election, they would have started off with another $11 billion of expenditure that they had to take over. They tell us that they would have returned the budget to surplus earlier—that they would have returned this year. It is laughable really, quite laughable.


To go back to the budget, not only did the Labor government have to cope with the effects of the GFC, which we are now overcoming, but of course we had the effects of terrible floods and natural disasters which have softened the revenue side of the budget. That has affected the first two years of the budget. However, the surplus is still there and it is still on track. Another significant problem which the government have had to face is that, yes, our terms of trade are very good at the moment but there is the well-canvassed matter of the patchwork economy, of trying to get into our economy a system which will spread the benefits of the increase in mining revenue to all Australians and to have a more even growth. I think that the government are doing a very good job in this budget to ensure that that happens.


It is a tough budget in some senses. There has been cutting in expenditure to make sure that we are not adding to the inflation and cost-of-living pressures in the years ahead. The Labor government understand those pressures very well, unlike, one might say, the Howard government in the final years of its government when Australians were faced with one interest rate rise after another caused by heavy spending from the Howard government. Middle-class welfare, regional rorts and the proverbial spending like drunken sailors happened under the Howard government and that at a time when it was already taking in strong tax receipts from an already burgeoning mining and resources sector. The government are not ignoring those issues at all. This has been a budget that combines good restraint in spending, substantial savings measures, with responsible measures to spread the benefits of the resources income around Australia. Let us go back and look at where we stand at the moment. We can highlight some of the actions that the government has taken up till now that have benefitted Australia. First of all, and pre-eminently, there is unemployment. Australia has an unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent and it is expected to go down. This is in comparison to nine per cent unemployment in the United States. The European Union has a combined statistic of 9.5 per cent unemployment. So Australia is a world leader when it comes to jobs. Those are jobs that the Labor government has saved and jobs that the Labor government has created. In just this last year 300,000 jobs were created. The real GDP growth is forecast to remain at a strong 4.4 per cent in 2011-12. This year's GDP growth was of course affected by natural disasters, but the forecast shows that real growth is strong and that we are heading in the right direction.


Regarding the deficit, we can compare the forecast deficit to the two major comparable nations in the world—the United States and the United Kingdom. While Australia's deficit will reach 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2011-12, the United States will have a deficit of 10.8 per cent of GDP and the United Kingdom will have a deficit of 8.6 per cent of GDP. That is a very stark comparison: 1.5 per cent for Australia compared to 10.8 per cent for the United States and 8.6 per cent for the United Kingdom. I doubt very much that the United States or the United Kingdom will be looking at a surplus any time soon.


Another key fact is that the real government spending growth of 0.5 per cent in 2011-12 is the smallest increase since the 1980s. The Howard government never delivered a cut to real spending. Under this government, spending is projected to decline in 2012-13 in real terms. Senator Fifield was a staffer when former Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello were delivering increases in interest rates and inflation. They never delivered a real spending cut. Where was Senator Fifield then to make the case for real spending cuts? If he was there it was certainly not in evidence in the actions of the former Howard government.


What future benefits are we looking at from this budget? The budget delivers cuts and savings but it also creates opportunities for employment and provides necessary services to the community that will drive our economy. Delivering productivity is the sort of thing that this side of the chamber has been talking about for many years, because it will position our economy to be strong in the future. The Labor government will create an extra 500,000 jobs over the next two years; however, we recognise that there are 320,000 young Australians not currently employed and 230,000 long-term unemployed. Labor is firm in its belief in the dignity of work and is putting in place measures to get people back into work.


The government will phase out the dependent spouse tax which gives spouses no incentive to get back to work. Of course we recognise that it provides important benefits to families but it is one of the tough cuts that was deemed necessary to make. There is also an incentive for young people to go back to work. The incentive to leave study and go straight onto the dole is to be removed by extending the 'earn or learn' requirements and by creating pathways to full-time employment. The same goes for the long-term unemployed, with $233 million to be invested in new support programs to encourage employers to hire those who have not worked for more than two years.


The growth of the disability support pension in Australia is of concern to the government. That is why the government will be bringing in strict new work tests, updating the definition of incapacity and introducing new requirements for younger recipients. It will provide more wage subsidies and will allow more hours to be worked before payments are suspended. So the government is introducing measures to increase participation in the community and provide incentives for people to go out to work, but it is also giving essential support to people on disability pensions.


Skills levels are always an important issue for the Labor government because it understands the benefit of skills in increasing productivity in our economy and ensuring that the resources boom keeps on going and that other areas of the economy can be stimulated. There is a $100 million invest­ment in a national apprenticeship mentoring program, another $100 million to develop new apprenticeship models and a $281 million support package for additional tax-free payments. Skills and jobs are not separate; they are linked to each other. That is why the government is providing $550 million for a new workforce development fund. That is a fantastic outcome for industry.


There are also benefits for working fam­ilies. Health services in regional Australia will benefit considerably. In my state it was a great joy for me to hear that there will be health benefits in my duty electorate of Grey. The Wallaroo Hospital and Health Service will have $3.3 million to establish a five-surgery public dental clinic. Also, $39.2 million was made available for the redevelopment of the Port Lincoln Hospital and Health Service. It is an area I know well and I am extremely pleased that the Labor government facilitated this investment. Furthermore, the Mimili, Pipalyatjara, Pukatja and Amata communities will be receiving $2.3 million for the construction of four new two-bedroom staff and visitor houses. Those are all very welcome pieces of infrastructure for a regional area. Finally, the area of mental health, which has been neglected for far too long, will benefit greatly from this budget. This is a necessary amount for a very deserving issue, and it is the largest mental health package ever delivered by a Commonwealth government.


We look forward to hearing the opposition's reaction to the budget; we look forward to hearing Mr Abbott's reply. The opposition told us that they would bring the budget back into surplus in the current year, so we look forward to hearing about the ways in which the coalition say they will do this. At the last election, the opposition's mental health package was mainly based on cuts in other areas of the health sector. What other cuts will the coalition be suggesting now? The coalition need to provide substan­tial input on this budget in their reply, because Senator Cormann and other senators in this chamber have tried again and again to reinforce the coalition's economic credentials but that has not been our experience on this side of the parliament. Mr Hockey has been making reckless promises about a return to surplus without indicating where it will come from. There was the $11 billion budget blowout at the last election. Last year, the suggested cuts not only were publicly derided but even embarrassed people in their own party. The coalition need to come clean, not make vague statements like 'the govern­ment should have cut more', 'they should have spent less', 'it should've been a tougher budget' or 'they should have spent more in other areas'. It is important that tonight we see Mr Abbott back up the commitments that the coalition have made. I suspect that the budget reply will be deficient in that respect, because the budget produced by the Prime Minister and by the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, is a solid budget that delivers on the promis­es made by this government and will provide a solid foundation for the future.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2011-05-12,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:10):  You must admit that, generally, out there—look at the chamber now—people's interest in the budget is pretty dead. No-one is staying up late at night worrying about the Labor budget. Even the fourth estate, when they are asked, 'What's it like?' say, 'It's pretty boring; there's not much there.' People have switched off. It is just another day in the office. And it is not because it is not important; it is just that they do not believe the Labor Party anymore. It is like a new pair of socks on the town drunk: who cares? You have a look, have a think about it, but it does not really change them. It does not make them more charismatic, it does not make me want to invite them round for dinner; they have just got themselves a new pair of socks.


You might have missed this, but I have got this thing about gross debt; I have been talking about it for a couple of years. So during the budget lock-up—one of my staff members, Matt, was in there—I said, 'We'd better have a look around for the debt position. Obviously, they are about to max out the credit card, so we'd better have a bit of a hunt around.' Sure enough, there it was: they have maxed out the credit card and they are looking for an extension. There it was. 


So what does this mean? You have to go back into the history of this whole national credit card thing—how we ended up with it, where it came from and what it is all about. Basically, in 2009 a wondrous gentleman, a luminary, Wayne Maxwell Swan, Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, stated in the budget papers:


The … emerging economies of China and India are now expected to slow markedly—


Therefore, 'We have to extend the credit card.'


He also said, on 10 March 2009:


As a result of the deteriorating global economy and consequent falling tax revenues, it will be necessary to increase government borrowing.


Therefore, under the Commonwealth Inscri­bed Stock Act 1911, they decided to up the credit card by $125 billion. What's $125 billion between friends? That is from $75 billion to $200 billion. I remember going to the Senate estimates. They sat down and I said, 'That's a remarkable amount of money.' They said, 'But you don't have to worry too much about it; we'll never get there.' It will be in 2013-14. If things are at their worst, 2013-14 is when they will get there—unless we have a major turnaround.


But a couple of things happened, you see. China never missed a beat, nor did India. And, because China never missed a beat and there was never negative growth in India, the demand for our resources kept going and we did not have a recession. It was nothing to do with ceiling insulation, school halls, $900 cheques or the NBN. It was due to the fact that we had these black rocks over on our east coast and these red rocks over on our west coast—one is called iron ore, the other is called coal—and these wonderful people over in South-East Asia who want to keep buying them. They buy as much of them as they can get, at a pretty remarkable price. Naturally enough, that drove our economy forward.


Mr Swan would like to make you think that it had something to do with $900 cheques—that a splurge in retail spending and gambling revenue at the local pub somehow kept Australia from a recession. It is the same sort of logic, I suppose, as saying that buying a new PlayStation will get you a wage rise at work. I do not know how they came to that logic, but that is apparently what it was. However, the result of their squandering was that our credit card charges kept going up and up and up and up. I remember doing the debt graphs—here is Keating; here is us paying Keating off; here is Rudd; here is Gillard. Now we are going up here, right off the graph, because the Labor Party just cannot handle money. They have no idea. The Labor Party just cannot handle money. They have no idea.


Let's look at what would happen if Australia was a business, a shop. With record sales for the produce that that shop produced, we would end up with a $54 billion loss in the shop, followed by a $49 billion loss in the shop. Then they say things get better because we end up in the following year with a $22 billion loss in the shop. We all know what happens to a shop that trades like that. We all know what happens to the people who rely on that shop for an income. We all know how fearful people get. We know how the people who are relying on that to support their hospitals and defence force and to build roads feel when that is how the shop is run. We all know what is going to happen to the shop: the shop is going to close its doors. What is important is that, if we did not allow you to increase your credit card limit, the shop would close, and it would close in the next month or so. That is startling. That scares me.


Maybe it scares Mr Swan as well, because just this morning I watched him and saw a terrified man with a shake in his voice tip and then smash a glass on a table up at the ABC studios. I see a person out of his depth, a person who is really struggling. He is really struggling because he just does not have the competency to manage, and this is an issue. If he was a heart surgeon you would have a bit of a problem, a quandary. If he was about to operate on that sacred vessel, your head, you would have a bit of a problem seeing a man obviously under the pump. Mr Swan is the nation's accountant; he is supposed to bring it all back under control. He is supposed to be the cool, level-headed and competent architect bringing it all back under control.


The best we have been able to get from him thus far is, 'Coalition, you have to explain to us what you would do.' It is all about what Tony Abbott announces tonight. I will translate that for the Australian people. It is like this: if you were a complete and utter stuff-up like the Labor Party and had completely and utterly botched the books, what would you do next? I do not know—drown yourself? I do not know what you would do next if you were that bad. What does one do? What a peculiar question: 'If you were as bad as us, what would you do about it?' I would remove myself from the building—that is what I would do about it, and I think that is what the Australian people are going to do about it.


When you say, 'Hang on, we're selling all this produce. Our soft and hard commodities are going out the door at record prices, but we can't balance the books, we can't make it work, we can't make it stack up,' the problem is not ours; the problem is yours. And the way to solve it is to get rid of you. That is step number 1. That will start making things better.


The Labor Party always comes up with, 'When in doubt, talk about net debt'—this magical, mythical money that is going to appear from somewhere. They always say: 'You don't worry about the gross debt. You don't worry about going to the Australian Office of Financial Management website and looking at Australian government securities outstanding and seeing exactly where we are'—that is their actual overdraft state­ment—'You just make up a number and you call it net debt.' If this magical, mythical money exists, let's test you. Grab some of that magical, mythical money and drop it in your bank account and bring the debt down. Grab some of it and drop it in the bank account so you do not have to extend your credit card.


In the place where I and many others grew up, the bank manager says to you: 'I don't think I should extend your credit card because you seem to be out of control. I've been looking at what you've been buying and I notice you bought about $2½ billion worth of fluffy stuff which you stuck in the ceiling and then ripped out again. I don't know what the purpose of that was. Then you went on this manic episode of building school halls all around the countryside. Then you spent $22 billion on $900 cheques. I've got a bit of a concern about you as a client, a customer, of this bank. I think we'd better pull your horns in a bit, so we're not going to extend your credit card. But you've told us that you have this magical, mythical money, $100 billion; we want you to go find some of that magical, mythical money and drop it in the account.' Mr Swan cannot do that because he cannot find it. He does not know where he put it. It is somewhere out there, though!


We had a search for it and we found some of his magical, mythical money. About $68 billion of it is in the Future Fund. The Future Fund is, of course, the money that is put aside for public servants' superannuation. So what Mr Swan is saying when he talks about net debt is that he is going to pay off the nation's debt with public servants' savings, their retirement fund. I want to know if the public servants know about this. They must be happy to know, especially the people in Canberra, that the government might be going to use their money to pay the debt off! They are going to their savings to pay Wayne's debt. I suppose that is the way it works. My suggestion is that the public servants will not accept that. Maybe that is another reason why we are extending our credit card.


The Labor Party stand back and say: 'Australia's not that bad. Australia's fine. Everything's fine.' Well, there is another bloke who has a different opinion, and his name is Professor Ken Rogoff. He is from Harvard University, in Massachusetts, in the United States of America. He has a different view. He did an analysis on cumulative public debt throughout the world from 2007 to now. 2007 is very interesting because that is when that crowd, the Green-Labor Party Independent alliance, got elected to govern­ment. From when the Green-Labor Party Independent alliance got elected to government to now, in an assessment of the cumulative increase in real public debt, the worst in the world is Iceland, and then comes Ireland. We have heard a bit about Ireland and Iceland. Iceland has basically completely fallen off the ledge. Ireland—well, that is hopeless.


Guess who No. 3 is. Is it Portugal? No. Is it Spain? No. Is it the United States? No. Is it Australia? Australia is the third worst. With our trajectory to disaster, we are right up there with the best of them. We are worse than Mexico, Chile, Belgium, Greece, Portugal and Spain. And the government say it is not a problem. They do not think this is an issue. I am starting to have concerns about this client.


In the old days, I had a great old boss, Philip Mawby, a chartered accountant and an auditor with Price Waterhouse. When people were coming unstuck, he would say to us, 'Go get a dump on all their drawings and bring it into the office.' You would go through their drawings one by one and then you would find all this rubbish: a new boat, new stereo, new trip, new this and new that—nothing to do with business. He would hand it to them and say, 'That is why you are about to go live in your son's or daughter's caravan at the back of their house—because you're going to lose your own.' That is what happens when you lose track. You have to really shake people to try to break them out of their false sense of security. Australia is on that trajectory. I think it was a clarion call this morning when Wayne Swan dropped the glass. It was a sign. He understands and that is why they are sneaking these things in now. With $250 billion we have finally got ourselves into the realm where we can start talking about things in portions of a trillion. We are heading to having a quarter of a trillion dollars in credit card debt. We are borrowing this money from the Chinese, from trusts in the Middle East and from superannuants in Japan, who probably want it back because they have a few problems over there. These people have not given us the money; they want us to repay it. We actually have to repay them. We have to send them back their dough. There is not a skerrick of a sign that the Green-Labor-Independent alliance and Mr Wayne Swan can do that. So where do we go from here?


That is why the Australian people have switched off. Mr Swan could have done cartwheels with a wig on, been whistling Dixie or been quoting poetry. No-one cares anymore. No-one listens to him anymore. What he says is irrelevant. He has never been able to hit a target and he cannot deliver the goods. The ramifications for Australia are shocking.


I have had a look at some of the things we are spending money on. Regional develop­ment always fascinates me. I have seen some of the accounting tricks. They must think we are all simpletons with the way they are dealing with it. First of all, to create the Green-Labor Party Independent alliance they got a couple of blokes and said, 'We'll give you $1.4 billion,' and that sounded great. As soon as they did that they had two major disasters they had to cover. One major disaster was Cyclone Yasi, and they ripped $350 million out of the budget to repair things in North Queensland, and the other disaster was the member for Lyne, and they had to pull another $50 million out for him. So these two disasters cost them $400 million. One is finished and one is still going.


Then we were down to about $1 billion, so we thought they were going to spend $1 billion on regional Australia. But when you look at the figures, you see they are cunning and shrewd people. Of the $1 billion, they are spending $300 million and then the rest sits out in never-never land. We will get to that later on. Only $300 million is in the forward estimates. Unfortunately, Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor have been touched, and either they do not acknowledge it or they are stupid, because it is not going to be spent, it is not going to happen.


I was fascinated to see the regional development document put out by Simon Crean. It was to be the saviour of regional Australia. I was very interested in the Flying Fruit Fly Circus. I can see that pulling us out of the position we are in. The Flying Fruit Fly Circus is highly recommended. It made its way into the regional development doc­ument. We also have research into crazy ants, which is important—I was thinking more of the crazy ants in the western suburbs of Brisbane, but why not?


Then we had the biggest appropriation of money for regional development—in excess of $400 million—for a poor little regional town. It was not Bollen, Kununurra, Temora or Bellingen. What was the regional town's name? Perth. They are building a new road in the regional town of Perth and they have banged it under regional development. I have nothing against building a road in Perth—it is a great idea—but do not call it regional, not unless you are building it all the way to Kalgoorlie. I suppose it would become regional once it got outside the city limits. This is just being mischievous with the terminology to try to cover your tracks. If Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor are stupid enough to swallow that, then explains why they were stupid enough to put in a Labor-Green-Independent alliance.


They are spending money on a whole range of things in regional Australia. This will be of great interest to the people of New England, especially those in northern New England. In the regional development document is investment in the Australian Antarctic Division. I know it is getting chilly at this time of year and there is a bit of snow about—maybe that is having an effect—but I think it is a bit of a stretch to say the Australian Antarctic Division has something to do with part of regional Australia. If it is, what part? Mawson and Davis? 


This is how absurd our nation has become. This is where we have got to. If you did not laugh, you would cry. Underneath it all it is the same old story. The debt just keeps marching ahead, racing ahead. You see they are borrowing roughly $1.6 billion every week. There are a couple of new public hospitals in that every time, major road improvements or the Toowoomba range crossing. Those are the sorts of things we could do with that money. But we have arrived in this twilight zone of Labor Party economics, of 'Swan-onomics'. We would have built dams, railways and ports to create wealth, but they just squander it and cannot work out where it has gone, and borrow it from overseas.


I heard Mr Albanese the other day announcing the inland rail again. This thing has more entrances than Nellie Melba had exits. It gets announced every second day by Mr Albanese. It is never going to be built. They will never build it. It is just another one of those mythical beings, like their mythical money.


What depresses me is that the Australian people have switched off from you. They really have. They have stopped listening and they do not care anymore. You can do anything and say anything. All you are doing now is annoying them. You annoy them more and more every day. Every day they see Julia Gillard overseas the whole set-up annoys them. The whole process annoys them. Mr Swan annoys them. The Australian people are becoming gradually more and more angry. On top of that you have these other mad policies. The Malaysian refugee expedition is the most recent one. To conclude on a sombre note, wherever you people got the idea to send 800 people to a country that still believes in caning and still believes in capital punishment and where there are huge question marks over its humanitarian values is beyond me.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2011-05-12,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:30):  Whilst those opposite have again chosen to launch attacks on the federal budget, on this side of the chamber we intend to pursue and achieve our plan to bring the budget back into the black, to get more Australians in jobs and to spread the opportunities of the mining boom to more Australians. We have imposed the strictest spending limits, delivering $22 billion in savings to make room for our key priorities, ensuring our country lives within its means. Australia emerged strongly from the global recession, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs while our peers shed millions of jobs. Our public debt is a tiny fraction of that carried by comparable countries, our fiscal position is the envy of the developed world and the investment boom is gathering pace.


On budget night, Mr Swan detailed a course that has us back in surplus in 2012-13—on track, on time and as promised. This budget is tough but it is fair and it helps those most in need in our community. It is responsible, it balances opportunities for all Australians and it gets the fundamental economics right. The budget delivers for Australians in health and education; it delivers for families, for our regions and for businesses. I note that in his contribution Senator Joyce talked about investment in regions. He forgot to say that one of the first actions of the Howard government when it came to power in 1996 was to abolish the Department of Regional Development. Senator Joyce obviously has a very selective memory.


We are, as promised, on track to build a stronger economy for all Australians whilst delivering more jobs and more opportunities. The reality is that, as we move from the challenges of the global financial crisis and the natural disasters into a resources boom and economic growth, we are cutting spending to make sure we are not adding to inflation and cost-of-living pressures in the years ahead. As far as reducing upward pressure on interest rates is concerned, let us be clear: interest rates are set by the independent Reserve Bank of Australia. Our job is to be fiscally responsible and return the budget to surplus—which is exactly what we are doing. This motion is just an attempt to undermine the government's responsible fiscal management and to block the savings that we are making to curb inflation and to reduce cost-of-living pressures in the years ahead.


What will Mr Abbott do to reduce upward pressure on interest rates and further pressure on household budgets? What is Mr Abbott's plan to cut spending? Where will he find savings? Let's face it: the fiscal incom­petence demonstrated in the last series of coalition costings does not paint a pretty picture of what we are likely to hear tonight in the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply speech. Last year, Mr Abbott failed in the budget reply—a failure that left an $11 billion black hole in the budget costings. He also failed in his response to the flood levy and the National Broadband Network. Whilst Mr Hockey claims that he can get the budget back into surplus in 2011-12, the fiscal ineptitude that has been shown in the coalition's earlier costings still haunts those opposite. Mr Abbott has failed time and again to produce a detailed plan on how he will deliver a surplus—a year earlier, no less. Given his track record and the scale of his fiscal mistakes to date, it is obvious Mr Abbott represents a $1.3 trillion risk to the Australian economy and to the budget. If Mr Abbott refuses to back the government's savings tonight, he risks the budget surplus, which would put pressure on interest rates and damage the economy.


The motion we are debating now should be about those opposite with their ceaseless attempts to wreck the government's budget and to try to add spending to the budget bottom line through their private members' bills. It is this ceaseless and ongoing commitment by those opposite to derail the budget which is putting upward pressure on interest rates and further pressure on household budgets.


This budget provides more opportunities to help more Australians to get ahead, no matter where they live. This budget will enable us to deliver more than half a million more jobs over the next couple of years, which builds on the 750,000 we have already created. To help deliver this jobs target, we are investing $3 billion over six years to help skill Australia's workforce as part of our Building Australia's Future Workforce plan. As part of this plan, we will be helping industries get the skilled workers they need to drive future productivity and increase growth. This plan will begin by appropriately training the workforce that Australian businesses require. To help achieve this, we have announced a $558 million National Workforce Development Fund, which will help deliver 130,000 new training places over four years. We will help industries and regions get the workers they need by committing $101 million for a national mentoring program to help 40,000 apprentices finish their apprenticeships. Apprentices will also be supported through the government's $100 million investment to deliver more flexible training models. They will allow apprentices to progress through their training as they acquire the skills they require, allowing them to gain their qualifications sooner.


We are also making an additional $1.7 billion investment in vocational education and training over five years. This builds upon our existing $7 billion investment and will help deliver our reforms to the vocational education and training system. We will do this through our national partnership with the state and territory governments, which will help make the VET system more transparent and productive. The budget will provide $143 million to deliver 30,000 additional places in the Language, Literacy and Numeracy Program to give people the basic skills which are essential for any job. In addition, for the first time we will allocate 16,000 skilled migrant places to the regions, also reducing skills shortages in regional Australia, through our regional migration agreements. The budget will also deliver major investments in health, particularly through our historic mental health reforms. This budget delivers $2.2 billion over five years for mental health. The government's package will provide more intensive support services and better coordination of those services for people with severe and persistent mental illness who have complex care needs. The package will target support to the areas and communities that need it most, such as Indigenous communities and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas that are underserviced by the current system. It will also help to detect potential mental health problems in the early years and support young people who struggle with mental illness.


We have heard Professor Patrick McGorry and Adjunct Associate Professor John Mendoza speak of the debilitating impact mental illness has on individuals, their families and communities. They have spoken particularly of their belief that the focus should be directed towards youth mental health services. I am pleased to say that this mental health package delivers targeted services across the board. As part of the mental health package, we will deliver $571 million over five years for more and better coordinated services for the severely mentally ill. This will include the expansion of successful mental health programs such as Support for Day to Day Living in the Community, and Personal Helpers and Mentors, PHaMs.


We have delivered $220 million to strengthen primary care and to better target services to those in need, including an expansion of the Access to Allied Psychological Services program. We will also deliver $491 million to boost services for children and young people. This will be used to expand mental health services for teenagers and young adults by providing more funding for the successful headspace centres and Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre programs. Our mental health package will deliver an extra 30 headspace centres, taking the number around Australia to 90. We will also provide extra funding to existing headspace centres to help them better service existing demand. When up and running, at full operation, the 90 centres will have the capacity to assist approximately 72,000 young people. The government will also provide funding and seek matching contributions from the states and territories to provide more early psychosis prevention and intervention centres.


The budget also contains provisions for providing $16.4 billion in extra growth funding for public hospitals as part of the new health deal signed between the states and territories. We will have a regional priority round of the Health and Hospitals Fund to deliver new investment in hospitals and health care for regional Australia. We are providing $717 million in new funding over five years to expand access to diagnostic imaging services by subsidising MRI scans through Medicare, particularly for those living in regional areas.


This budget reflects the government's commitment to empowering Australians through education and training. We are delivering over half a billion dollars in funding to improve schools and reward quality teaching. We are also delivering $200 million to support students with a disability.


This year's budget has new measures to help with cost-of-living pressures, with a renewed emphasis on low-income earners and families with kids at school. We have increased the family tax benefit part A for older teenagers by up to $4,208 a year—that is, around $161 a fortnight. The result of this is that families with a teenager will now be eligible for up to $4,000 more a year if their child stays in education or training. The education tax refund will be increased by $460 million to extend to school uniforms, which will be a great bonus for families. We are also providing payment advances of up to $1,000 for family tax benefit part A recipients at any time to ensure they can meet unexpected family expenses. These changes also give parents more flexibility in when they receive childcare support.


We will provide more tax assistance to 6.5 million Australian taxpayers on lower incomes. This will help encourage work and provide some modest help with cost-of-living pressures. The government will increase the low-income tax offset from 50 per cent to 70 per cent. This will put an extra bit in the weekly pay packet and, while the amount is modest, we know that every little bit helps. The increase to the low-income tax offset will mean that someone with an annual income of $30,000 will get an extra $300 during the year in their regular pay. It is also worth pointing out that, as part of our historic pension reforms which began in September 2009, maximum pension rates are no2 $128 per fortnight higher for singles and $116 per fortnight higher for couples. We have introduced these measures because we are committed to helping those most in need. As the Treasurer said on budget night:


We know too many Australians are squeezed by rising costs of living and we help where we responsibly can.


That is why we cut income taxes substantially in each of our first three budgets, so that an average income earner now pays around $1,000 a year less tax and why we have ensured pensions are now … higher for singles and higher for couples since … our historic boost two years ago.


We will see the benefit of unprecedented investment in regional Australia through our record $4.5 billion package for hospitals, health care, universities and roads. As the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the Hon. Anthony Albanese, has outlined, compared to the last full year of the former Howard government, 2006-07, we will be providing more than twice as much regional infrastructure funding. This package includes $1.8 billion for critical health infrastructure, $500 million for the regional priorities round of the Education Investment Fund, $916 million for projects under the Regional Infrastructure Fund and $1 billion through the Regional Development Australia Fund.


As well as the measures I have outlined in the budget that relieve the pressure on households, it is also worth noting the additional taxation benefits included in the budget that will flow to small businesses. The government will reduce pay-as-you-go instalments for 2011-12 for the majority of small businesses, providing a $700 million cash flow benefit. These measures will reduce the amount of tax payable or improve cash flow for up to 2.7 million small businesses. The investments in regional Australia will flow directly to my home state of Tasmania. For example, in Tasmania, up to 12,603 apprentices may benefit from the investments aimed at modernising the apprentice system. The long-term unem­ployed in Tasmania will benefit from new funding to assist training and work exper­ience. Over 19,000 local families and over 23,000 teenagers in Tasmania may be eligible for the extra $4,200 per child between 16 and 19 years of age under changes to the family tax benefit. Of course, there are benefits that will flow from the extension of the education tax refund to school uniforms. And this year Tasmania will benefit from $121 million in rail and road infrastructure as well as the additional $46.4 million to assist Tasmania's councils to maintain and upgrade their local roads. This is on top of the funding that will continue to make highways and roads safer.


As we know, Tasmania will benefit from new investments in health, mental health and dental care. We have the $240 million Royal Hobart Hospital redevelopment, a new medical centre in Cygnet and a new health precinct in Sheffield. We will also receive assistance to reduce community dental waiting lists. The University of Tasmania, as a regional university, will benefit from the EIF—the education infrastructure funding—increased regional loading payments and the Higher Education Participation and Partner­ship Program. This list is by no means exhaustive.


As I said in the beginning, this budget is responsible. It balances opportunities for all Australians and gets the fundamental economics right. That is because we, in the government, are making the investments we need, through the budget, to position Austr­alia to take full advantage of the mining boom. Australia's high terms of trade, strong growth outlook and tightened macroecon­omic policy settings have seen the Australian dollar appreciate to post-float highs. As the government has outlined in the budget papers, in the current macroeconomic context, the high exchange rate and the with­drawal of fiscal and monetary policy stim­ulus are helping to moderate inflationary pressures as the economy returns to full employment.


We have also delivered on our promise to set out a strict fiscal strategy through identifying significant savings so that we can fund new priorities whilst balancing the costs of the recent natural disasters and returning the budget to surplus. To that end, the government has also held growth in real spending to two per cent and has placed significant restraint on government expen­diture. With fiscally responsible policies and approaches such as these, it becomes obvious that the criticisms being levelled by those opposite lack a true depth of analysis and have no substance.


This afternoon, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong, highligh­ted that Australia's position is amongst the best in the world in terms of net debt compared to other advanced economies. Australia's net debt is expected to peak at less than one-tenth that of major advanced economies, and the government is on track to bring the budget into the black in 2012-13. With that in mind, whilst others in the developed world seemed to envy the finan­cial position of Australia after the GFC, it is difficult for me to comprehend why those opposite cannot offer their support for the fiscally responsible approach this govern­ment has taken in this budget. This budget is tough, but it is fair and it helps those most in need in our community. It is responsible, it balances opportunity for all Australians and it gets the fundamental economics right.


During the Howard government's term in office, the only thing that they seemed intent on doing was stripping the rights and conditions off workers—and, of course, that was through Work Choices. What we saw during their Work Choices time was an attempt, through AWAs, to have workers forced to sign new AWAs. We saw many examples where they were asked to sign an agreement for the job they were doing for a lot less money. Those opposite who come in here with this ridiculous motion to suggest that this government is not being fiscally responsible and not having a mind to care for less fortunate Australians really need to look back on their record—because all Australian working families got during the Howard government years was Work Choices, lower wages, fewer entitlements and less job security.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,MOTIONS,22,1
"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2011-05-12,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:50):  The government's budget handed down this week is a prime example of Labor's ceaseless and ongoing commitment to debt and deficit budgeting. I would contend that the figures speak for themselves. A soaring budget deficit of $49.4 billion this financial year and an expected deficit for 2011-12 that has blown out by a whopping $16 billion—from $9.6 billion to $22.6 billion.


This government are addicted to spending and they are asking Australian families to fund it. This budget fails to ease the rising costs of living for families, who face higher prices every day. In fact, under this Labor government, electricity prices have risen by 51 per cent since 2007, grocery prices are up by 14 per cent, education and health costs are up by about 20 per cent, the price of petrol has soared and there have been seven interest rate rises in a row under this government, placing pressure on Australian families struggling with their mortgages—those very families that the Australian Labor Party went to the election in 2007 saying that they were going to help. The Labor Party said that they were going to address the cost-of-living pressures that those families were facing under that 'evil Howard government'. They said that they were going to fix it, but just look at those figures. Those figures speak for themselves.



Government senators interjecting—





The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Forshaw
):
Order! Previous senators have been listened to in almost complete silence. I think the same courtesy should be extended to Senator Bushby by both sides of the chamber.






Senator BUSHBY:

Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President. This 
government plan
s
 to means test the private health insurance rebate, which will further hurt Australians trying to provide for their families. And if that 
is
 not bad enough, they have now announced in the budget that they will strip $2 billion from Australian families by freezing the indexation of key family tax payments and income thresholds for the next three years. I will talk a little bit more about that later.





This government claims to want to
 get more Australians into work
 but at the same time 
it 
is hellbent on punishing the hard


workers who are already out there having a go and trying to get ahead. This Labor go
vernment has spent
 recklessly and is now forcing middle-class Australian families and small businesses to pay it back. Australians are being forced to pay for a multitude of the Gillard Labor government
'
s policy failures. Labor
'
s failure to control our borders has increased the cost of offshore asylum seeker management by a whopping $1.7 billion. And now Australian taxpayers are being asked to pay a further $292.3 million for the Malaysian solution. So ridiculously out of control is asylum seeker management
 under this government
 that they now need to build a detention centre in my home state of Tasmania, at a cost to taxpayers of $15 million, to house illegal entrants coming through Far North Australia.





Then of course there are all the other costly policy failures. There was the Building the Education Revolution, which delivered buildings that schools in many cases neither needed nor
,
 in some cases
,
 could even use. 





Senator Polley interjecting
—






Senator BUSHBY:

An example from your home state and my home state, Senator Polley, is Port Sorell School. The Wesley Vale Primary School is due to be closed down upon the building of the Port Sorell 
School, which the state Labor government says it is going to build
—but 
we have not seen a lot of proof that it is going to happen. Nonetheless, it has committed to build a new school at Port Sorell, less than 
10 kilometres away from the Wes
ley Vale Primary School. 
This will leave 
four students at Wesley Vale
.
 Basically the school will be closed down when the Port Sorell School is built. 
So they got a million-dollar new building at the
 Wesley Vale Primary School—a school that is due to close in the next couple of years. What an absolute waste of money!



But there is more. The computers in schools program has blown out by a further $200 million, taking its total cost so far to $1.4 billion—more than double what was originally budgeted. There have been the numerous green schemes that have failed, such as the cash-for-clunkers scheme that was in itself a clunker, and the tragic and grossly wasteful pink batt scheme that has seen hundreds of millions of dollars having to be spent to fix the problems that it created. And let us not forget that this is the government whose solution to the GFC was to send $900 cheques to people living overseas.




To add insult to injury, Australian families 
are not only 
paying for these failed schemes but also funding the advertising campaigns

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
Order! You should ensure that you correctly refer to members of this chamber and the other chamber by their correct titles.






Senator BUSHBY:

Duly noted, Mr Acting Deputy President. There was $13 million wasted on advertising the then Prime Minister Mr Rudd
'
s now obsolete health reforms. And they cannot rule out a $30 million ad campaign to try to justify their carbon tax. 




The Gillard Labor government have squandered the financial prosperity that the coalition left them. They have exceeded Prime Minister Keating's debt record of $96 billion and, for the first time in eight years, they have delivered a budget that has not delivered tax cuts for everyday Australians. However, even in the face of such appalling circumstances, they have not learnt their lesson. In their ongoing commitment to debt and deficit budgeting, they have hit Australian families and businesses with $6 billion in new and higher taxes. Along with the Greens, they have committed to intro­ducing a carbon tax from 1 July 2012. However, they have not included any of the detail in the budget. They do not want to tell Australian families and businesses how much it will cost them, but they do expect them to pay for it.But this in itself is amazing: given the proposed starting date of 1 July 2012—right in the middle of the figures contained in this week's budget—it is impossible to take anything the budget includes beyond that as at all relevant or accurate. This is the case even if you accept the Labor government's argument that it is not possible or appropriate to include forecasts of the effect of the carbon tax in these figures—and I do not accept that. What is undeniable is that the carbon tax will have a massive impact on those figures, both directly and in second- and third-round effects and so on once it is implemented. Those figures are not worth the paper they are written on. 




So as ordinary Australians continue to face real challenges to meet the cost of their household bills, Labor continue to waste money and to present their accounts in ways and with exclusions that mask the true state of where we are heading. The fact remains that this Labor government are tough on families and tough on household budgets but fail to be tough on their own wasteful 
spending. Treasurer Wayne Swan has told us that he will have balanced the budget by the 2012-13 budget year.






Senator Mason:

Do you believe that?





Senator BUSHBY:
  No, I do not. This is as unlikely to happen as him bringing about the enormous surpluses that will be required to repay the more than $250 billion in gross debt that will have accumulated by then. The reality of the combination of events being as fortuitous as predicted in order to achieve this result is highly unlikely given the vagaries of events that we have witnessed in recent years. It is even acknowledged in the government's own budget papers that only a small fall in the terms of trade from their current record and totally unprecedented levels would completely eliminate the projected surplus for 2012-13 and probably for years after, not to mention the potential impact of further international economic shocks, the fragile debt situation of some European countries, a fall in commodity prices, inflation uncertainty and other economic threats to China's growth and so on—any of which would overturn the assumptions upon which the government's claims of returning to surplus in 2012-13 are based.


The other challenge that defies belief is this Labor government actually delivering real cuts in spending. I am not talking about the government's tricky use of accounting methods and highfalutin economic terms and sophistry to include new taxes as savings; I am talking about real belt-tightening: actual decreases in government outlays and the slashing of spending by the government on programs not otherwise due to end—savings that actually result in falls in the amount of taxpayers' funds spent by the government. This challenge remains, because it would be a standout first for any Labor government in Australia's history to deliver real cuts in spending. With respect to the members of the Labor caucus who valiantly defend the toughness of this budget, it is not reflected in the far less than tough budget measures that are delivered in the other place this week. The problem is, and always has been, that when Labor is in government, they spend big. Under Whitlam, spending increased to such an extent that the Commonwealth share of GDP went from 19 to 24 per cent. Thirteen years of Hawke and Keating saw that figure increase to 26 per cent—a figure that was much reduced under John Howard. The Howard years saw the rolling back of the Commonwealth share of GDP as Costello fought to balance the budget after Labor left us $96 billion in the red in 1996 dollars. But since November 2007 the Rudd Labor government, and continuing under the Gillard Labor-Green government, all of that work has been undone.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (20:30):  Tonight I want to speak briefly about women's work and the contribution that women's paid work has made to their own empowerment, to the financial security of their families and to the productive capacity of this nation. I also want to touch on the barriers that remain to women's full participation in the workforce. These are barriers that constrain women's personal development, limit their capacity to provide a secure economic future for themselves and their families, and restrict their contribution to Australia's productivity. They are barriers that see Australian women with significantly lower incomes than men throughout their working lives—and with woefully inadequate retirement incomes.


The women's budget statement this week highlights that, even in times of economic strength, Australia has a high proportion of long-term jobless families compared to other OECD countries. Around 70 per cent of these families with children under 15 are single parent families and the majority of these are headed by single mothers. We know that extended periods on income support can lead to significant barriers to workforce participation and entrench the disadvantage that these families experience.


There is no doubt that access to paid work and the benefits that flow from it are central to the empowerment of women. This is a fact that has long been recognised by labour feminists. Access to work under reasonable conditions and for fair reward is vital to women's economic and social wellbeing, and it is equally important to women's dependants, especially their children. As the OECD has recognised, increasing maternal employment is one of the most effective means of raising family incomes and reducing the risk of child poverty. It is certainly pleasing to see this as an emphasis within this week's budget.


On average across the OECD, children in households without an adult in work are three times more likely to grow up in poverty than children in one-earner households. And children in one-earner households are three times more likely to grow up in poverty than children in dual-earner households. In short, women who go back to work are helping protect their children from poverty, just as surely as they are advancing their own economic and social wellbeing.


We know that increasing women's employment has also contributed a great deal to Australia's economic growth in recent decades. One recent study by Goldman Sachs estimates that progress in closing the gender gap in the employment rate has already added 22 per cent to Australia's GDP since 1974. And increasing women's workforce participation has become more urgent as our population ages and as Australia confronts looming skills shortages as a result of the current resources boom.


There is now a positive correlation between employment rates and fertility rates in developed countries. Women in Scandinavia, for example, are both more likely to work and more likely to have children than their sisters in Italy or Japan. So it seems that when women are not forced to choose between child rearing and paid work, most women will in fact choose to do both. In other words, we can have both more children and more working mothers—a double benefit in terms of our ageing population—if we get the policy settings right.


Given how important access to paid work is for women and their children and for the Australian economy, it is concerning that Australia has fallen behind many other developed nations on this front. While women's workforce participation rates in Australia have continued to rise over the past 20 years, they have risen slowly, much more slowly than in other comparable countries. So it is pleasing that in this week's budget we have seen significant measures to lift women's workforce participation.


I think it really does matter that women with young children are less likely to work in Australia than in many other comparable countries. When women disengage from the workforce because of child-rearing responsibilities, either by not working or by working part time, they are less likely and less likely to work full time in the future. They are also more likely to earn less later in life and more likely to retire on an inadequate income. Taking a career break to have children will in all probability affect a woman's financial security not just at the time but, indeed, for the rest of her life.


We know that much of the gender pay gap can be explained by the impact of parental and marital status on men's and women's earnings. So if we care about equal employ­ment opportunity, if we care about pay equity, if we care about women's retirement incomes, if we care about child poverty and family income inequality and if we care about Australia's future productivity and prosperity, we need to confront the fact that parenthood is exacerbating gender inequality in our workforce. We need work that works for women in this country, including women with children, so that fewer women have to choose between children and a rewarding career and more women can choose to have both.


The question is: how do we do this? We have met many of the required policy milestones, which include: early childhood education for preschoolers, three- to five-year-olds; publicly funded child care for very young children; universal, moderate length, job protected, unpaid parental leave; short-term paid maternity and paternity leave; ensuring that work benefits that help parents manage work and family responsibilities, such as flex time, are readily available and that employees are not penalised for using them; and, importantly, reducing disincent­ives to work for second earners within the tax/welfare system. I am pleased that within this budget and with many of our previous achievements we have done things like roll out early childhood education, in the years prior to school, of 15 hours per week for 40 weeks per year for four-year-olds. We have boosted public support for child care by increasing the childcare tax rebate substan­tially as well as by increasing the quality of care children in this nation receive. We have also introduced the nation's first national paid parental leave.


In this budget, we are investing $7.1 million over four years to provide support to help jobless parents living in 10 disad­vantaged locations—parents who have been on income support for at least two years or who are under 23 years of age and who are not currently working or studying. We will also help more parents with the costs of child care with the Jobs, Education, Training and Childcare Fee Assistance, JETCCFA, package being extended from 26 to 52 weeks for employment related activities. We are focused on helping single parents enter the workforce with career advisory services and investments to help single parents improve their skills and plan for their transition into the workforce.


Most importantly, we have provided incentives to single parents through parent­ing payment reforms. We are rewarding people, most of whom are women, who are earning an income while on Newstart and establishing their connection to the labour force. To achieve this, we are adjusting the taper rate. I am not going to explain the technical details of that tonight, but it means that many recipients will be able to earn almost $400 extra per fortnight, to a total of $1,346 per fortnight, before they lose any eligibility for at least some form of income support. You can see that that is a significant incentive to help single parents, most of whom are women, back into the workforce. We have also increased the low-income tax offset, but I do not have time to go into that this evening.


Clearly, there is much to be done to ensure that all women in Australia can choose to have children and a rewarding career. We have taken important steps since we have been elected, and indeed in this budget, to ensure that this is the case. As our Prime Minister has highlighted, Australians should not be denied the benefits and dignity of work. These benefits are vital not only to women but also to their dependent children. As I have highlighted, Labor has taken many steps since first being elected but there is much more to do in the future still to advance this agenda.
