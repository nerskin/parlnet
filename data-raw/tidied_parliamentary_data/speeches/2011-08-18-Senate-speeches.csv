Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (09:31):  I am pleased that Labor will be supporting this private member's bill to strengthen the rights of territories. The Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Common­wealth) Bill 2010 has been referred to a committee. That committee has reported back to the Senate. I would like to warmly welcome their recommendation that this bill be passed.


At the outset, before I talk to some amendments, I would like to make it very clear that there are fundamental differences between this bill and another private member's bill that has also been introduced to the Senate, the Restoring Territory Rights (Voluntary Euthanasia Legislation) Bill 2010. It is fair to say that there is often some confusion about this, because they both relate to the way in which the territories are treated under Commonwealth law and their capacity to make legislation. But very clearly the purpose of the Restoring Territory Rights (Voluntary Euthanasia Legislation) Bill 2010—not the one we are debating today—is to repeal the euthanasia laws of 1997 and to repeal the provisions that preclude the ACT and NT from legislating on euthanasia. We will have an opportunity to speak about that another time. My own view is that it is about restoring territory rights.


But the purpose of this bill is to remove the power of the executive to overturn territory legislation behind closed doors without a parliamentary process. This has become known as the power of veto, if you like, over territory legislation. It is an executive mechanism that we in the Labor Party agree does not accurately reflect the status, the capability and the maturity of either the ACT assembly or the Northern Territory parliament. This bill will not stop the federal parliament acting in the national interest in an open and transparent way—in other words, from dealing with issues through both houses of parliament—should there be a conflict between Commonwealth and territory legislation.


I would like to foreshadow government amendments to the bill that were recom­mended by the Senate committee. These amendments will remove some words in clause 4 of this bill, which at the moment says, 'providing relevant territory legislatures with exclusive legislative authority and responsibility for making laws'. Our amend­ment would remove that reference because it does not accurately reflect the current power of the Governor-General to recommend amendments to territory laws. As such, it cannot be achieved by the bill. And this parliament can use a legislative process to override territory laws. To reflect in this private member's bill that this did create exclusive legislative authority and responsi­bility for making laws was indeed inaccurate. Nonetheless, this bill is an important change, because it does remove that executive veto, as I mentioned.


The other government amendment that I wish to foreshadow reflects the recommend­ation of the Senate committee and removes the reference to Norfolk Island. Norfolk Island is currently undergoing an extensive reform process. That reform process has bipartisan support and the support of the Norfolk Island assembly. That process is underway and we need to give due regard to that reform process, which involves govern­ance and various accountability and transpar­ency measures. It would be appropriate to consider the status of Norfolk Island's governance arrangements through that reform process.


Through the course of the inquiry into this bill many comments were made, particularly by the opposition, recognising that it was time for a broad update of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act. That recognition was across the board. In speaking to this bill as an ACT senator, I tend to agree. In fact the ACT government and Chief Minister have for some time been saying that it is probably time for an update of and a closer look at the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act, given that it came into force back in 1989. There are so many things one could say about the progress of the Australian Capital Territory. We can reflect positively on the maturity, stability and functioning of the ACT assembly in its governance role. All of these things stand up to scrutiny and support the general bipartisan view that an update of that act is due.


However, it was disappointing that through the course of the inquiry it became clear that the opposition's position on this bill was to oppose it and that they were hiding behind a call for a broader review of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act and using that as a reason not to support this bill. I will be very inter­ested to hear what the opposition have to say, because there is nothing in the context of a more comprehensive review or consideration of an update of the ACT (Self-Government) Act that would preclude their support for this bill right now. I know Senator Humphries is very tuned in to this issue. He has spoken many times on the right of the territories to create their own legislation. Indeed, we exchange words fairly regularly about this very issue. I would like to take this opportunity to remind Senator Humphries, the other ACT senator, of his past expressed avid resentment of federal interference in territory affairs and remind him that this is a significant opportunity for him and, indeed, for the opposition to respect the capacity and power of the legislature and remove this feature of an executive veto that is not shared by any of the states. It is something which applies only to the territories and, therefore, supporting this bill and the foreshadowed amendments by the government to remove that executive veto would bring the ACT and the Northern Territory into line with the states.


The final point I would like to make about this bill is that it really is about respecting those democratic rights. That is the basis upon which this bill has been proposed and the basis upon which we have debated similar issues in the past. The way in which we have seen this measure used by the former Howard government reminds us all that when we provide for self-government it is about trust, it is about respect and it is about the democratic authority of the government that has been put in place by an act of this parliament.


This is an opportunity to bring ACT democratic rights in line with those of the states and to stand up for the ACT assembly and, through it, all the people of Canberra. If the opposition turn their backs on this issue now, it will provide evidence that that is not a core principle which informs their view on these matters and will enlighten everybody that there is a strong thread of opportunism in the opposition's stance on the issue of territories' rights.


In closing, I would like to remind people that this does not prevent the federal govern­ment from engaging in a parliamentary debate in order to challenge state or territory legislation that is inconsistent with the Com­monwealth. Any fear campaign to purport that it will is misleading.


Finally, I would like to take this oppor­tunity, because I think it is directly relevant to the subject matter today, to congratulate the new—not so new any more actually—Chief Minister, Katy Gallagher. She is the new Chief Minister following the retirement of former Chief Minister Jon Stanhope. I would like to acknowledge that the transition was a smooth one and that I am extremely proud to work very closely, as I always have, with an ACT assembly, a Chief Minister and an ACT Labor government so focused on the best interests of the people of Canberra. I know they are committed to their ongoing campaign to ensure that they have the democratic right that reflects that of the states and that is commensurate with the status, maturity and broad rights of the people of the ACT.


I commend the bill to the Senate. I was very pleased to speak to it today. I look forward to the government moving the amendments, as they reflect the recommend­ations of the Senate committee, and I will watch with interest what is happening on the other side of the chamber.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-08-18,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:42):  The opposition has always been a strong proponent of the rights of people who live in the territories and, in particular, the rights of people who live in the three territories affected by this bill—the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island. We note in particular that the Northern Territory has resumed a movement towards statehood. That was a movement which, in the 1990s, although ultimately defeated, was strongly supported by the then coalition government led by John Howard. I recently met with a bipartisan delegation of parliamentarians from the Northern Territory to discuss the movement towards statehood for the Northern Territory with them.


Equally, the coalition has always been represented in this place by ACT senators—my distinguished friend Senator Gary Humphries, a former Chief Minister of the ACT, and his predecessor, Senator Margaret Reid—who have been very, very ardent advocates for the rights and interests of citizens of the ACT. The issue of statehood for the ACT does not generally arise in these discussions because of the peculiarity of the ACT's constitutional position.


So respecting the rights of citizens who live in Australia's territories, particularly the two territories represented in the Common­wealth parliament, is core business for us in the coalition. What this bill purports to do is to bring about a fundamental constitutional change to the status of those territories and the relationship of those territories to this parliament. Those of us who take the interests of territorians seriously have grave concerns that, because of the piecemeal, haphazard and sloppy manner in which this is presented to the Senate by the Greens, by Senator Brown, passage of the bill in this form will in fact retard and set back the recognition of the rights of territorians. In particular, having regard to the fact that the process in the Northern Territory is pro­ceeding towards statehood in a methodical and careful way, those who would like to see statehood for the Northern Territory do not want this bill in this form. This is by no means easy. I know Senator Brown enjoys the luxury of pontificating about issues without having the responsibility to put those views into effect. But if Senator Brown had met with voters who are seeking to prosecute the case for Northern Territory statehood—



Senator Crossin interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  I know you have, Senator Crossin. I do not doubt your interest in and commitment to this issue. If Senator Brown had met with those people, he would understand better than he does how constitutionally and politically difficult this is. Those who seek to advance the cause of Northern Territory statehood need a gratuitous intervention like this from the Senate like they need a hole in the head. So we will not be supporting this bill. We support the wisdom of the observation made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee when it reviewed the legislation and cautioned against a piecemeal approach to issues of self-government. My distinguished colleague Senator Humphries will shortly be moving a second reading amendment and addressing this issue and elaborating further upon what the Senate committee report found. 


There is another reason why the coalition opposes this legislation. We look with a very sceptical eye on anything that comes from Senator Bob Brown and the Greens. With a deeply sceptical eye, we have followed through the media the debate about gay marriage that has riven the Australian Labor Party and the concerns expressed, in particular by former Senator Mike Forshaw and former Senator Steve Hutchins—reflected, by the way, in their dissenting comments in the committee report—that this bill, although on its face a constitutional bill, is in fact being sought to be used as a vehicle for gay marriage to be introduced in the Australian Capital Territory. In forming that sceptical, dare I say somewhat cynical, view of Senator Bob Brown's purposes here, we are emboldened by comments that the former ACT Chief Minister Mr Jon Stanhope made in the context of this debate when Mr Stanhope belled the cat and made it perfectly clear that he would like to use this legislation, were it to be passed, as a vehicle to introduce gay marriage in the ACT. Mr Stanhope—who was a dreadful Chief Minister, a real no-hoper and one of the worst heads of government I have ever come across, on either side of politics, in any state or territory—revealed the purpose and the thinking behind this bill. Whether that purpose is continued by the current ACT Chief Minister I do not know, but at the time this bill was being shaped in the mind of Senator Brown we know what Mr Stanhope thought it would lead to and what he wanted it to lead to.


We know, as I said a moment ago, that on the issue of gay marriage the Labor Party is riven between those who are proponents of that issue and those—particularly the more conservative elements in the Labor Party—who are trenchantly opposed to it. We have no such division on our side of politics. We in the Liberal Party and the National Party support the Howard government's amend­ments to the Marriage Act; we do not support gay marriage. We are not having the argument among ourselves about gay marriage that is tearing the Labor Party to shreds at the moment. We are perfectly prepared to watch from the sidelines as the Labor Party tears itself apart. But anybody who thinks that there are not some in the Labor Party who see this bill as a step towards the enactment of gay marriage within the ACT is either deluded or dishonest. There are many—not all, perhaps not most—in the Australian Labor Party who do see this bill as a pathway to that outcome.


We do not accept the good faith of Senator Brown's public assurances that this bill is purely about the rights of territorians. On its face, as I said before, it is a constitutional bill. On its face, it is a bill of general application, but we know that it is also part of this move to achieve an outcome in relation to the Marriage Act to which we in the coalition are resolutely opposed. For that reason as well, we will be opposing this bill and we will be supporting the second reading amendment which I foreshadowed and which Senator Humphries will outline in his contribution.

Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (09:53):  I rise to provide a contribution to the debate on the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2010. I do that in two respects: firstly, of course, as one of the two senators from the Northern Territory and, secondly, as Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee that inquired into this bill earlier this year. 


I want to begin by saying that there are some aspects of Senator Brandis's remarks that I tend to agree with and there are some aspects of his remarks that I totally disagree with, and I think that what is happening in the Northern Territory and the views of people who are supporting statehood were a little misconstrued in his contribution. Can I say in providing some input into this debate that I often feel that, representing the Northern Territory, I am a bit like the youngest child in a family of 250 here. Sometimes when you are representing the Northern Territory in this chamber, you feel like you are at the bottom of the pecking order. You feel like you have to fight for every piece of recognition and acknowledge­ment you can get for the Northern Territory. 


For the last 13 years it has always eluded me as to why we are constantly coming into this chamber for debates such as this when we would not have these debates if we were a state or if people somehow did not feel that they could pick on the Northern Territory all the time. They do that by using some sort of hook rather than letting the legally competent, elected governments of the Northern Territory—whether they be under the Country Liberal Party or under the Labor Party—just get on and do the job they are elected to do. They enact euthanasia legislation, but for some reason here in Canberra, if we do not like it, we think we can overturn it. They enact mandatory sentencing legislation, but for some reason here in Canberra, if we do not like it, we will overturn it. People fought to keep euthanasia laws; people here overturned them. People wanted to keep mandatory sentencing laws; people here wanted to overturn them. It is always about an issue when you come to the Territory. It is never about the competency of the governments. 


I have lived in the Northern Territory for 30 years. Let me tell you: there are some laws that the CLP enacted that I did not particularly like at all, but I did not think that that was a key for me to open the door to Canberra and say, 'Overturn the legislation.' I think people down here have got to get out of that mind-set and totally get off picking on the Northern Territory and its government, no matter which party leads that government. Just leave us alone. Just let us get on with governing in our own right. 


We inquired into this piece of legislation. It is not a comprehensive review of the self-governing aspects of the ACT and the Northern Territory, and we make those strong recommendations here. I look at the amendment that Senator Humphries wants to make, and in some respects perhaps that does need to happen, but at least I am saying, 'Pass this piece of legislation,' because this piece of legislation could become law while a review of the self-governing acts is occur­ring. I will get on to why I would not support that for the Territory in a minute. 


What this bill simply does is remove the power of the executive government to veto legislation that has been enacted in the territories. That is all it simply does. It stops somebody in the executive arm of the federal government deciding they do not like a piece of legislation that has been enacted in the Northern Territory or the ACT. But it still leaves in place the provision for this federal parliament to overturn a piece of legislation. To me, that is not good enough either. I think the Territory government should be allowed to just get on with what it is competently elected to do. But for me at least this is a first point of call. At least we could be assured in the Northern Territory that one particular minister or one particular Prime Minister of any governing party in this country could not go off to the Governor-General or the Administrator and seek to overturn a piece of legislation. 


So is this a perfect piece of legislation? It is not a comprehensive piece of legislation in terms of the self- governing act of the territories, but at least it is one start. You could argue: 'Let's not do it at all. Let's do a comprehensive review.' But I think at least it gives the people of the Northern Territory some confidence to know that not one single person or one part of the executive govern­ment will be overturning legislation. Unfor­tunately, it does leave the door open, as I said, for this federal parliament to overturn legislation. Can I go to some of the remarks that Senator Brandis had to make on behalf of the opposition. You cannot step away from the fact that both the Chief Minister of the ACT at the time, Jon Stanhope, and the current Chief Minister of the Northern Terri­tory, Paul Henderson, flew specifically to Canberra. Jon Stanhope made himself specifically available to appear before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee to support this legislation. That in itself showed me that both those governments and parliaments supported this legislation.


Another thing that impressed me, not only as a Territorian but as chair of that commit­tee, was that members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs flew here, including the Hon. Jane Aagaard and Kezia Purick. Members of that committee were in person at the committee hearings here in Canberra. I want to impress on people here that that was a bipartisan committee. That was a bipartisan attempt, to come down here and say, 'This legislation is okay; we support it.' But really what we in the Northern Territory are trying to do is get support for statehood. That is the endgame here. A 10-year process has been put in place by the Northern Territory government, which has been supported by the opposition. I am very impressed by the way in which both political parties have worked towards achieving this outcome. There has been a five-year consultation period and there will now be a five-year period of actually drafting a constitution and working out exactly the questions we will be asking Territorians.


This is where I differ from the comments that Senator Brandis put on record. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory did come down here and, in endorsing the bill's proposals as they pertain to the Northern Territory, said:


It is a very basic principle that we are arguing for here. The 25 members of the Territory parliament, who make laws for the good governance of the people of the Northern Territory, are elected by Territorians and they are accountable through fixed-term elections … For the Commonwealth executive arm of government to have the power, essentially at the stroke of a pen, to make a recommendation to the Governor-General to disallow a law in the Territory undermines democracy in the Northern Territory.


So, yes, he was supportive of this legislation. However, both he and the members of the Northern Territory legal and constitutional committee fervently put to us that the endgame for them is a move to statehood. That is what they really want. In your pro­posed amendment, Senator Humphries, you seek not to consider this bill but only to consider the interests of the ACT, in examining the self-government act for the ACT. I say to myself again: the Northern Territory would miss out on both counts here. We would not get this legislation through and support the wishes of the Northern Territory parliament, the submitters and the representatives of the Northern Territory. This amendment does not suggest that we would look at a move to statehood in the Northern Territory. We do not want the self-government act in the Northern Territory reviewed. We actually want an endgame where, essentially, that act is repealed. So this amendment is not a win for the Territory either.


But I think we need to clearly understand that this piece of legislation 'ought to be about votes, not about vetoes'. That is a phrase that was written yesterday by a journalist in the Age. It ought to be about democracy, not about particular issues. It ought to be about, at least, taking a first step in recognising that the Northern Territory has competent governments. Those govern­ments are elected by the people of the Northern Territory, just like the New South Wales and the Victorian parliaments are elected by the people of New South Wales and Victoria. They put legislation in from time to time that people do not like, and that also happens in every other state in this country. But what this bill seeks to do is ensure that those laws are not overturned by the executive government of the federal ruling party. That is all we are asking for in this legislation.


It is a first step. It is not the best step and it is not the step that we want to achieve at the end of the day. We want to see legisla­tion go through this parliament that grants the Northern Territory statehood in our own right. This is another example of where you have to come in here time and time again and keep flying the flag for the Northern Territory. It somehow eludes me why it is always the case that people here in this building believe that they can continually interfere in what is happening in the Northern Territory. This is one piece of legislation where, for a change, we would get some positive interference. Yet it seems it will not be supported unanimously in this chamber.


I am speaking in support of this legislation, but I am speaking more in support of the view that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee expressed in section 3.6.1 of this report:


The committee places on record its strong support for statehood in the NT …


The committee would also welcome any opportunity to work cooperatively with the NT Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs towards achieving that goal.


I can say that, as Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, it is an issue that we will pick up and write to that committee about. Perhaps for the first time in the history of this coun­try, we might see a standing committee at a federal level and a state level come together to hold an inquiry or do some work together to achieve that outcome. 


But let us be very clear here: what we want in the Northern Territory is statehood. We want to get to it in a measured way and in a bipartisan way where people of the Northern Territory are comfortable and confident about that on the day they vote yes. This legislation is just one step on the journey. It removes the power of the exec­utive arm to overturn our laws. Unfortunate­ly, it still leaves provision for the federal parliament to overturn our laws, and that is still not good enough. But, at the end of the day, this bill is certainly worthy of support. Unfortunately, Senator Humphries, I think that your amendment, again, really ignores the wishes and the wills of the Northern Territory and that there would be no benefit for us if your amendment actually succeeded.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2011-08-18,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (10:07):  I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:


Omit all words after ""That"", substitute:


   ""the Senate declines to consider the bill further, and:   (a)   notes the comments of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on the bill that ""an approach which fails to look at the broad range of issues affecting the autonomy of the ACT and the NT may not be the most appropriate way of addressing outstanding self-determination matters in those territories, and may not ultimately represent the most considered solution. The committee believes that a system­atic and holistic review of self-government arrangements in the ACT and the NT holds merit, and would help to address some of the specific issues raised during this inquiry."";   (b)   affirms that the process by which the Australian territories move towards greater legislative independence, consistent with the overall framework of the Australian Federation, should continue, but that a more systematic and comprehensive approach is to be preferred; and   (c)   calls for a full review of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 in lieu of piecemeal amendments to that Act"".


I will come back to speak about that a little more later. The question that I ask today in looking at the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallow­ance and Amendment Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2010 that Senator Bob Brown has put before the chamber is: what garments does that ultimate populist, Senator Brown, parade around in the Senate today? He appears to be wearing the clothes of the friend of the territories—the man who cares deeply about territorians and their rights to make decisions for themselves, the man who is the champion of regional autonomy, the man who stands up for Canberra against the federal government. This disallowance bill is brought forward to prevent the ACT, the Northern Territory or Norfolk Island being pushed around by ministers in a federal government. This bill gives expression, presumably, to ideals of self-determination which were inherent in the self-government acts of the 1970s and 1980s.


There is something about that image of Senator Bob Brown today which does not seem quite right. Something does not quite gel about Senator Brown as the champion of the second tier of government in this country. Something is more akin to a masquerade than to reality, because I recall a very differently attired Bob Brown not all that long ago. I recall that Dr Bob Brown, as he then was, came to national attention in the 1980s as the scourge of the Tasmanian government that wanted to build a certain dam, and Dr Brown argued that the conflict over the dam to be built in Tasmania should be resolved in a certain way. How did he want that resolved? He wanted it resolved by the federal government interfering and inter­vening in the affairs of the self-governing Tasmanian polity to stop the building of that dam. Where were the rights of territory or state governments at that stage of Senator Brown's career?


People might say that perhaps Senator Brown today feels differently about the territories than he felt about Tasmania back in the 1980s. He is now a member of parliament; perhaps he has a different view. I am not sure that that is the case either. Senator Brown's record with respect to the territories is not a lot better. I look at Senator Brown's bill, the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999, which was introduced by Senator Brown to override the rights of the self-governing Northern Territory to legislate in favour of mandatory sentences for certain people committing crimes. Senator Brown was unhappy with that and was quite comfortable in 1999 to introduce legislation to override the rights of the Northern Territory to legislate in that way. I have had this debate with Senator Brown before and I know what he is going to say. He is going to say, 'We were justified in intervening in the affairs of the Northern Territory at that time because we were dealing with a fundamental human rights matter which cut across Australia's international obligations under treaties; therefore, despite the principle which I strongly adhere to being violated, it was okay to intervene in the Northern Territory on that occasion.' 


Unfortunately, Senator Brown's record of intervention in the affairs of self-governing states or territories does not end there, because in 2003 Senator Brown returned to this issue with a motion of disallowance. Bear in mind that he is now moving a bill in the Senate to stop disallowance of territory legislation. Back in 2003 Senator Brown was quite happy to move a motion of disallow­ance in this place to prevent a certain road project proceeding in the Australian Capital Territory, the widening of the Gungahlin Drive extension, despite the fact that it was supported by the then territory government, because Senator Brown did not approve of the building of that road. He did not like the idea of that road being built and did he want the territory to make its own decision about that at that stage? No, he did not. He knew better. He would bring the might of the federal parliament down on the ACT and prevent the building of that road.


Senator Brown has no credibility on such issues. Senator Brown is no friend of territory autonomy. He is in this respect an opportunist, happy to champion the rights of territorians to legislate when he agrees with what they propose to do with that power and equally happy to trash territory rights when he believes that his interests are not being served. You may say that today he is not talking about the right to interfere or not; he is talking about the way that you interfere. At the end of the day, Senator Brown, it does not really make much difference. If you are going to do somebody over, the way in which you do it does not have as much bearing on the matter as the fact that you are doing them over in the first place.


The coalition is not going to play along with the cynical game that Senator Brown is playing here today. There are serious issues about the form and the effectiveness of self-government, certainly in the ACT, and I suspect my colleague Senator Scullion—and we have heard from Senator Crossin already—will flag questions about the effectiveness of self-government arrange­ments in the Northern Territory. Those are real issues which deserve systematic, careful examination by the federal parliament, not piecemeal legislation designed more for political purposes than to advance a system­atic examination of what is wrong and what needs to be fixed about the institution of self-government in those places. This bill does not address those fundamental issues, issues that Senator Crossin talked about that I know vex Senator Scullion. This bill is an oppor­tunistic intervention to clothe the Greens in the most favourable electoral light, not an attempt to fix what I think we all know needs to be addressed.


I have moved a second reading amendment which first of all acknowledges the findings of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee that there are issues which simply have to be addressed and which this legislation does not address. The second reading amendment affirms the process by which the states and territories move towards greater legislative independence consistent with the framework of Australian Federation. In the case of the Northern Territory, that may well include statehood within a few years. That is probably not the case for the ACT, but certainly the ACT's need to overhaul the institution of self-government, which is now more than 22 years old, is a real and urgent need and, again, the piecemeal approach taken by this legislation is not a satisfactory solution to that problem. The amendment calls for a full review of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act. If a colleague, particularly Senator Scullion, supports the view that the Northern Territory should also be included in such a review, I am very happy for that to occur. Indeed I would foreshadow that in the next few sitting days Senator Scullion and I will put forward a matter for the Senate to consider with respect to the question of the structure and future of self-government in the Northern Territory and the ACT.


I hear the support of the Labor Party for this bill and I note that there is a pretty large measure of cynicism in that position as well. I recall it was only three years ago that the Labor Party was perfectly content to support the decision of then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to intervene, through the disallowance power, to overrule the then-proposed resurgence of civil unions legislation in the ACT—legislation which had been proposed during the Howard government and which the ACT government came back to propose again when the Rudd government was elected. Of course, the Rudd government at that stage rebuffed that suggestion very clearly, and the senators who today rise to tell us what a wonderful idea this bill is were perfectly happy to use that power back in 2008.




Senator McLucas:
  Not true, Gary.




Senator Humphries:
  It is true.




Senator McLucas:
  No, it's not true.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  If you want, Senator McLucas, I will table the press statement that was made at that stage. You did not use the power because the ACT government backed down. You did not carry it through but you threatened to use it.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senator, through the chair, please.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  Yes, Mr Deputy President. Let us not be holier than thou. When it suited your purposes you were quite prepared to use this power in this way. This is a process bill. It is about how decisions are made affecting the powers of territories. It is not a substantive bill about those powers, and those issues do need to be addressed and in other ways they will be addressed. I would prefer that they were addressed through a comprehensive review of the status of self-government, not through some piecemeal approach. That is the appropriate way to deal with this. I represent the ACT. I understand what I think the people of this territory aspire to and want. I do not think they want the institution of self-government to be toyed with by federal politicians. They want these issues to be dealt with systematically and comprehensively. I believe the citizens of this territory would welcome an opportunity to engage in a full, comprehensive consult­ative process to examine the status of self-government here. That is the better approach, not the approach inherent in this very piecemeal piece of legislation.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (10:17):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Common­wealth) Bill 2010. Obviously, I rise as a senator from what is clearly Australia's smallest state, but a state that has had responsible government for over 150 years and one that is fiercely attached to its democratic institutions. Tasmania is also a place with a profound sense of identity—an island which has a particular tradition, a unique history and strong sense of commun­ity. Tasmania is a special place, a place with which I am deeply connected, and a place to which as a citizen—as a Tasmanian—I feel a sense of belonging. I belong to Tasmania. And Tasmania belongs to those communities who have had the honour of calling themselves Tasmanians.


We have the oft-remarked right of being well represented in this place, a right that allows our members of parliament to connect with our constituents at a very close level. At a state level, we have a particular electoral system, one which I know the other Tasmanian senators in this place know very well. It is the Hare-Clark system—shared with one of the territories with which this bill is concerned—which gives people the oppor­tunity to choose from amongst a wide range of candidates to find the one who best reflects their views and by whom they want to be represented. If those views are not carried to the parliament and reflected in the laws of the state, then the representative will be held to account at the next election. This is a very basic expectation of a democracy. And it is a very basic conclusion of the kind of belonging about which I spoke a moment ago. When one of those elements is not present in a system of governance, then it is difficult to call that system fully democratic. It is difficult to say that connection between a people and their place has been respected.


The way the law operates at the moment does not respect the important principle that people should be able to elect people to represent them, and that those represent­atives should have the capacity to deliver on the promises that they make and the values they espouse. This bill is about enabling the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to shape their own futures in a more democratic way. Both territories have proven themselves over a long period of time to be more than capable of governing them­selves in a responsible way, in the same web of interdependency between the levels of government in which the states participate. In fact, the ACT especially has led the way on a number of issues, and I want to take a moment to reflect on the very positive legacy left by Jon Stanhope and, in doing that, reject the characterisation of him made earlier in this place by Senator Brandis. Under Jon Stanhope's leadership, and importantly reflecting the values of the people of the ACT, his government led the nation on issues of rights, an important example of which is the Human Rights Charter.


This bill does not remove the interdepend­ency and the checks and balances we expect in a federal and a national democracy. Under this bill, there remains parliamentary over­sight of the territories, and I am sure that is an issue about which future debates will rage. But it is notable that this bill is relative­ly conservative in that sense. It is not a wide-ranging constitutional reform. It is about honouring the principles of democracy that we have already declared in this place, some time ago, and the will of territorians as reflected in their legislative assemblies. And when there is a conflict between those wills, or if there is a need to act separately to territorial legislators, we will have a debate in this place, as we should. We should have to put our case in detail on particular issues. We should have to respect that the destiny of the territory should be up to the territories unless we can justify intervention.


No doubt governance in this country is a complex matter and the issues involved are complex. We have international obligations and we have national priorities. We have differing levels of capacity in our different institutions. But what should underpin all of that is an understanding that the will of the people should be respected wherever it is most clearly expressed. I believe, in this case, that this means we should respect the laws enacted by our territorial assemblies. As we are aware, these territories were created by acts of this parliament. Their legislatures are rightly subject to the deliberations of this parliament, not executive government. It is important that the Commonwealth parlia­ment enable the ACT and Northern Territory legislative assemblies to be independent, to be responsible and to be accountable to their citizens. That is what I believe this parlia­ment is for and what Australians expect. Australians do not expect people elected for a different role to be able to override the will of the territories lightly.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (10:24):  This bill is another example of the Green tail wagging the Labor dog. It has nothing to do with wanting to improve the self-governing arrangements that apply in the territories. This started in 2006 when the Howard government decided to exercise section 35 of the ACT act to disallow the ACT Civil Unions Bill. That is what got this process underway. If you look at this bill as it was originally introduced by the Greens, it did not then mention anybody other than the ACT. This had nothing to do with wanting to improve self-governing arrangements for the territories in Australia; it was entirely and exclusively driven by the Greens' desire to stop the then Howard government and subsequent governments preventing the ACT government legislating for civil unions in the Australian Capital Territory. In 2006 the Howard government made that decision and, as Senator Humphries indicated, Kevin Rudd as the then Prime Minister in 2009 took a very similar view. Because he had good relations with the then ACT Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope, no doubt they were able to organise these things behind closed doors and did not have to run through the whole process. But the effect was the same.


I want to correct something that Senator Lundy said. Senator Lundy suggested this is somehow about restoring territory rights, as if it were going to take things back to somewhere they had been before. The capacity for Commonwealth governments to make the sorts of decisions that the Howard government did in 2006 has been in this relevant legislation as part of the self-government arrangements since the word go. This is not new; this is not just something that came out of nowhere in 2006. The Howard government exercised an existing section in the existing act. As Senator Brandis and Senator Humphries have said, and as I am sure Senator Scullion will say, the coalition is very supportive of having a comprehensive look at how self-government arrangements can be improved. But this is not what is driving the Greens. The Greens are being driven by their social agenda in relation to same-sex marriage, euthanasia and other bits and pieces for which they cannot get support, despite repeated attempts, in any of the state parliaments. 


As Senator Humphries indicated, it is not as if the Greens are consistent on this. There have been times when Senator Brown has wanted the federal government to overturn the state government of Tasmania on some­thing happening in that state. And when it came to mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory Senator Brown was quite happy to see the Commonwealth override the Northern Territory legislation at that point in time. This has got nothing to do with a genuine commitment to improving the rights of territorians; this is entirely and exclusively driven by Senator Brown's desire to see legislation on civil unions and same-sex marriage and euthanasia become more achievable in the sorts of parliaments where he thinks that this sort of legislation has a chance to get up. 


I just reflect on the fact that in 1997 this parliament voted to overturn the Northern Territory euthanasia laws. Whatever any­body's views on the substance of that matter, it was no doubt at the time a divisive debate. I was not involved as it was before my time. However, the Commonwealth parliament voted to overturn the Northern Territory euthanasia laws. No doubt that would have been a time when there would have been some robust debate inside the Northern Territory, among the good people of the Northern Territory, about how it could be that the Commonwealth parliament could do this. It was the year after the Commonwealth parliament here in Canberra made a decision about laws enacted by the Northern Territory in relation to euthanasia that the proposition of the Northern Territory becoming a state was put to a referendum. History shows that the people of the Northern Territory decided that they did not want to become a state at that point. I hear what Senator Crossin is saying and no doubt Senator Scullion will have similar views, and I know there is a bipartisan effort in the Northern Territory to continue the path towards statehood. I wish them very good luck with it. But right now the situation is that it is the Northern 'Territory'. The reason that is still the situation is because the people of the Northern Territory in 1998 voted against statehood. I was drawn to the additional comments that were made by former Labor Senators Forshaw and Hutchins, who were part of the inquiry into this legislation. I have to observe here that the fact the Australian Labor Party has decided to support this legislation is a very sad reflection on the current state of the Labor Party. The Labor Party once had courageous senators, like former Senators Hutchins and Forshaw, who were able to assess legislation as they saw it. I will just read from their comments:


This Bill should not be passed in its current form. It is flawed.


I could not have put it better. The quote goes on:


It will not achieve its stated objects. If enacted, this Bill will produce disparities between the legislation governing each of the territories and with the Commonwealth and the States.


Towards the end of their comments. Senators Hutchins and Forshaw observed:


It is not surprising that this Bill is technically flawed. Both this bill, and a previous bill proposed by Senator Brown in 2006, originally applied only to the ACT. They are clearly a reaction to the Howard Government's decision to use Section 35 of the ACT Act to disallow the ACT Civil Union's Bill. The proposed amendments to include the NT and Norfolk Island appear to have been an afterthought without any consideration of the consequences detailed above.


They recommend:


The Bill should be either withdrawn or not passed by the Senate.


Their final recommendation is:


We recommend that the Bill not be passed.


Former Labor Senators Forshaw and Hutchins do make the observation that the territories are not states. During the inquiry, the Northern Territory Chief Minister expressed support for the bill as it would be a 'small but significant step towards statehood.' As they observe:


This is not the expressed intention of the Bill. Any move toward statehood should be approach­ed in a serious and considered manner not piecemeal nor as a reaction to a particular decision.


That is exactly what Senator Humphries mentioned and what he is trying to address through the second reading amendment that he has moved.


I read in the media earlier this week that the Labor caucus—I should say the Austra­lian Labor Party caucus because we now have a true Labor senator among us in Senator John Madigan representing the Democratic Labor Party—decided to back the territories' autonomy because Australian Labor Party MPs, and I quote from an article in the Age on 16 August:


… received assurances that the bill would not lead to legalisation of same-sex marriage in the nation's capital.


A bit further on it says:


Caucus yesterday adopted the bill ''without controversy'' with members assured it was not about same-sex marriage.


But then:


A spokeswoman for ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher said it welcomed the decision of federal Labor but declined to comment on whether the territory would pursue same-sex marriage.


Why is that? If it is not about that, if they have got no intention of pursuing it, why wouldn't she just say so? I think that Senator Farrell has been sold a pup. I think that Senator Farrell should try and show a little bit of courage like former Senators Hutchins and Forshaw did. He is now part of an Australian Labor Party that will facilitate either civil unions legislation or same-sex marriage legislation in the Australian Capital Territory. If Senator Farrell's intention is not to see that happen then he should support an amendment to rule it out in the legislation here today. I can see that he is distracted and is not prepared to listen to the debate that is going on, even though he is here represent­ing the government. Hopefully somebody back in his office is taking clear note.


This bill is about the Greens tail wagging the Labor dog. This Australian Labor Party is totally captive to the Greens. The Greens are driving their agenda. This has not been initiated by the Australian Labor Party government. This has been initiated by the Greens and the Labor Party is just hopping in and backing it up. Why? If you are serious about improving self-government arrange­ments for the ACT and the Northern Territory, go about it in a serious way. Go about it in a strategic way, support a proper review, support a proper approach that does not sort out these things in a piecemeal fashion just because Senator Brown was upset that the Howard government exercised section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act to disallow civil unions in the Australian Capital Territory. Senator Farrell, you might have been given assurances in the ALP caucus that this would not lead to legalisation of same-sex marriage, but the Chief Minister's office refused to rule it out when they were asked about it:


A spokeswoman for Chief Minister Katy Gallagher said it welcomed the decision of federal Labor but declined to comment on whether the territory would pursue same-sex marriage.


We used to have a Prime Minister in Kevin Rudd who was prepared to stand up to the ACT government in relation to this issue. Now we have a Prime Minister who is too weak. She is captive to the Greens. The Greens have bullied her into supporting this bill. Senator Mark Bishop, Senator Collins, Senator Farrell, Senator Stephens—where are they? At least former Senators Hutchins and Forshaw were prepared to stand up and be counted and call this legislation for what it is—a flawed bill that should not be passed.


If people like Senator Farrell on the Labor side were serious about representing true hardworking Labor voters, they would seriously reflect on what they are doing with this because there is now an alternative in the marketplace called the Democratic Labor Party. There are going to be people across Australia who are going to reflect very seriously on whether they should support the Greens-wagged Australian Labor Party or whether they should go to a true Labor party. I suspect you will find that people will turn away from the Australian Labor Party because of their support for bad pieces of legislation like this.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (10:37):  It is very rare for me to rise in this place and feel sorry for those on the other side, particularly for my colleague from the Northern Territory, but I think it is reasonable to put on the public record why they are taking this position. The reason my heart goes out to them is I am actually quite sure the leather is softer on that side. It is a long time since I sat over there, but it was certainly a lot more comfortable. There are a lot of benefits that go with government which make you want to stay on that side.


The sad thing about Labor's position is that it has had a very light spray of green over all of its motives. It is really important to have a look at the motive today. Senator Crossin stood in this place today, as she always does on any issues in regard to the Northern Territory, and said that we are moving along towards statehood. I have been very pleased to stand in this place on the most recent issue, legislating for euthanasia, and I support her in that regard. If you look at the motive for all of this behaviour, it is simply to stay in government. That is the rawest deal. Of course the Greens have a great deal of influence, as they should in those circumstances, to ensure that this government does what it is told. Today we see the Labor government being pretty compliant and the Greens should be very pleased with that—it seems to be behaving appropriately and it is not being too naughty or doing things that the Greens do not require.


If we are looking to motive, perhaps we should examine the Greens' motives. Motive is very important in life. Why is it that we are moving along with this? Why is it that, suddenly, Bob Brown has a terrific love affair with the territories? He is very keen on the territories and on the people who live in the territories, but he is particularly keen on the legislation in the Northern Territory. As has been indicated today, Bob Brown hardly seems to have a consistent approach. He is, today, basically saying that the Common­wealth should not interfere with the Northern Territory or with the Australian Capital Territory—'The poor devils, we should allow them exactly the same rights as a state.' It sure seems odd. I do not know whether it was a different bloke, but whoever it was, Senator Brown, I recall him standing in here saying: 'Let's overturn the mandatory sentencing laws in the Territory. How dare they take their own stand in the Northern Territory and have their own rights to determine how they deal with the criminal justice system. Let's use the Common­wealth's powers in this place, in this Senate, to overturn them.' You can understand why I am a little bit confused in that regard.


I wonder what the motive is. You cannot accuse the Greens of not being organised or of not having a motive. They do have a motive. There is a very clear motive here and it has been indicated earlier. The cat has already been belled. If Katy Gallagher was not happy to stand up and say that this is all about introducing same-sex marriages in the Australian Capital Territory, the previous Chief Minister, Mr Stanhope, certainly was. He said: 'Absolutely. Looking forward to introducing same-sex marriages in the Australian Capital Territory.' In regard to this piece of legislation that those on the other side have been forced to accept, they have been given foolish assurances and have been foolish to accept those assurances. Those on the other side have accepted that that is the case.




Senator Cormann:
  She is not ruling it out.




Senator SCULLION:
  Of course Gallagher did not rule it out because that is exactly what is going to happen. As sure as night follows day this will happen. Perhaps I can just briefly paint the picture of how it will occur. This legislation does, in effect, say that instead of using an executive arm of government to deal with issues that are not within a state's capacity to legislate on—things like marriage, starting your own navy, having your own currency, taxation and immigration—if the territories play with that area, we are going to have to come back and have a full debate in parliament. That takes a bit of time. The scenario is that, if the Australian Capital Territory passes a law on Monday, we might have a bit of a think about recalling parliament, if that is the will of the government, and maybe we will have an emergency session a week later. If, during that period of time, people are lawfully married, for example, in the Australian Capital Territory, what happens to them? They were lawfully married. Does the Commonwealth then come back and say, 'We've got some weird retrospectivity in all of this about how we unwind this mess.'


That is what I believe the motive for this is. If you wish to have same-sex marriages, there is a process to do that. I argued strongly in this place during the debate on one of the previous contributions from Senator Brown in the Restoring Territory Rights (Voluntary Euthanasia Legislation) Bill 2010. I know that Senator Brown is a strong proponent of introducing euthanasia. I supported that bill not on the basis of whether I thought euthanasia legislation was being supported but because it is entirely the right of a state to make that decision. I also would expect, if the Northern Territory decided to start its own navy and its own currency or decided to start its own immigration system, that there would be an immediate action from the executive to deal with that. That is just a little about motive. Without a doubt that is what is going to happen.


Those people on the other side who think they are not part of something that will lead to what I have just described are, at best, fools. I know the comfort, vaguely recalled in my distant past, of being on that side. But remember: when this happens, your constituents will remember those who led them to that circumstance. If you want to introduce same-sex marriage, there is a way to go about that: you come to this place—because it is the Commonwealth which should legislate on those matters. Do not use some sort of a backdoor agenda to deal with these issues. Sadly, in the Northern Territory a few people are quite excited. They have rung me and said that they are really excited that this is going to give them more rights in the Territory. Once they have all the infor­mation they then understand that this is not another step forward in moving towards statehood.


I would just like to speak briefly about the foreshadowed amendment from Senator Humphries. Senator Crossin said: 'This is something we can't possibly support because it doesn't do anything for the Northern Territory.' I agree with that. She said, 'We don't want the self-government act revised.' Of course I agree: we want it abolished; we want to move to statehood. The Australian Capital Territory and the legislative framework are in an entirely different place to where we are in the Northern Territory, so I agree completely with her.


I would like Senator Crossin and people in the Territory to reflect on another contri­bution from Senator Humphries. In the next week of parliament we will be jointly submitting a process that will start a fair dinkum look at self-government in the Aust­ralian Capital Territory and the movement to statehood in the Northern Territory. It is not just a process on a couple of very small squeaky wheels. This will be a fair dinkum process with the motive of moving to strengthen self-government in the Australian Capital Territory and moving to statehood in the Northern Territory. That is the motive. That is what it will be about.


For those Territorians who think that this will somehow advance statehood, I can promise you that being astride a green horse with squeaky wheels is not the way to move forward. Look to the motive. This is an insult to those people who are actually striving for statehood in the Northern Territory and looking for stronger self-government in the Australian Capital Territory because it is about none of those things. On this side, we are clear-eyed and bright and we can see through the motive for this legislation. We do not accept that this is about strengthening issues for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. That is why we will not be supporting this legislation.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (10:46):  I rise as the responsible minister, representing the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Crean, to contribute to the debate on behalf of the government. On 4 May 2011, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee reported back to the Senate on its inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government) Amendment (Disallow­ance and Amendment Power of the Comm­onwealth) Bill 2010, together with proposed amendments applying to the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island. 


The bill and amendments circulated by the Greens sought to abolish the power of the Governor-General to disallow or recommend amendments to territory legislation by repealing section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, section 9 of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 and section 23 of the Norfolk Island Act 1979. That is what this bill is about. It is moved by the Greens to abolish the power of the Governor-General to disallow or recommend amendments to territory legislation. It is not about a whole range of other issues, some of which have been touched on. 


The committee report contained two recommendations. The first recommendation of the committee is that the Senate pass the disallowance bill subject to the following amendments: firstly, the disallowance bill apply only to the ACT and the Northern Territory; secondly, the removal of referen­ces in clause 4 of the bill that purport to provide relevant territory legislatures with exclusive legislative authority and responsi­bility for making laws; and, thirdly, clause 4 be further amended to more accurately reflect the current power of the Governor-General to recommend amendments to territory laws. The second recommendation is that Norfolk Island be excluded from the operation of the disallowance bill until further evidence is provided on the need for change in that jurisdiction.


The government agrees with the object­ives of this bill in removing the power of the federal executive to override legislation in the ACT and the Northern Territory. However, given the technical amendments required, the government has circulated its own amendments to this bill. Again, I emphasise that this bill is about removing the power of the federal executive to override legislation in the ACT and the Northern Territory. The issues that have been referred to—whether it is euthanasia or same sex marriage—are determined and governed by other legislation of the Commonwealth. Those issues are not what this legislation is about.


The amendments will support the repeal of section 35 of the Commonwealth Austra­lian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and section 9 of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 and incorporate the committee's suggested amendments. The government agrees with recommendation 2 of the committee that Norfolk Island should be excluded from the operation of the disallowance bill, given the differences between Norfolk Island and other self-governing territories. The recent passage of the Territories Law Reform Act 2010 also provides the Commonwealth with increased oversight and scrutiny of Norfolk Island legislation to ensure it is consistent with the national interest. It would therefore be inconsistent for the disallowance bill to apply to Norfolk Island.


The bill before the Senate today, with amendments that I have outlined, will remove the ability of the executive govern­ment to veto legislation enacted by the ACT and the Northern Territory legislatures. As these acts stand, the executive has the power to override the decision of the democratically elected legislatures of the ACT and the Northern Territory. This bill goes to the rights of those in the territories to determine the good governance of the communities in which they live. The architects of the Constitution predicted that there may be times when the national interest must be considered when looking at territory laws. That is why they drafted section 122 that allows the parliament, not exclusively the executive, to make laws for the government of any territory. As I have already said, this parliament still will have a right to determine laws in respect to the territories. This legislation that we are considering is about removing the power of the executive but not this parliament. For all these reasons, the government will support the passage of the bill with these amendments.


A second reading amendment has been moved by Senator Humphries. The govern­ment will not be supporting the amendment. I will make a couple of brief remarks as to why we will not be supporting it. Firstly, the issues raised in the amendment have been canvassed in the Senate inquiry into the bill. The committee concluded—in its majority report, at least—that the bill would improve the democratic rights of the people of the ACT and the Northern Territory and the passage of the bill would provide just recognition of the maturity and capacity of the ACT and Northern Territory legislative assemblies since they attained self-government.


The Australian government has already indicated to the ACT government that it would welcome a review of the ACT (Self-Government) Act. Such a review should be driven by the ACT government and its citizens, and the Australian government would welcome considering such a review. The timing of a comprehensive review should not delay the implementation of the practical democratic benefits provided by this bill.


I note that both the ACT and Northern Territory Chief Ministers are on the record—or at least, in the case of the ACT, the previous Chief Minister; I am not aware of anything on the record from the current Chief Minister—as supporting the bill. For those reasons, the government will not support the second reading amendment.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2011-08-18,"



Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:53):  I thank all contributors to the debate on this very important piece of legislation to foster improved democratic rights for the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. I will not go over in detail the reasons for the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2010 because it has already been before the parliament and indeed through a thorough committee process, with the committee having endorsed the bill as it comes before the Senate today.


I note that there will be a number of amendments from the government. These reflect amendments that the Greens also had drawn up, and we will simply support the government amendments, which have the effect of extending this legislation to give the advantages of it to the voters of the Northern Territory and which cover some other related matters.


The Constitution says in section 122, with the headline 'Government of territories':


The Parliament—


it refers to this parliament, of course—


may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth—


and that is what is in process here today. A couple of decades ago this same parliament legislated to transfer its power under the Constitution to make laws for the territories to the executive—that is, the minister of the day. As has been noted in public debate, that means that with the stroke of a pen a minister can override the outcome of a deliberated vote following a debate of the elected representatives of the assemblies either in Canberra, in relation to the ACT, or in Darwin, in relation to the Northern Territory. This bill simply goes back to where the Constitution would have it—that is, the territories will effectively legislate unless or until a vote of both houses of parliament overrules legislation or passes legislation for either of the territories. We cannot change that provision of section 122 or section 123, which also deals with limitations on the powers of the states, unless we go to a referendum.


There is the prospect that the Northern Territory, which I think is moving in that direction again, will eventually end up subject to a referendum. I would not discount the possibility, as others have, that in some future time Australians might want to give the growing population of the Australian Capital Territory the ability to have self-determination through a form of statehood which will provide for all the amenities of this being the national capital but will provide for enhanced powers for the people of the Australian Capital Territory. That is a matter for a future debate.


This legislation today simply restores at least the right of the assemblies to pass legislation for their citizens without being overridden by a minister without reference to this parliament. It is as simple as that. I take on board the issues of equal marriage and euthanasia that have been raised in here by the opposition today, but they know full well—Senator Humphries knows very well—that this legislation does not alter that. In fact, it enhances the powers of the Australian Capital Territory to legislate at least in the matter of equal marriage, if it wants to, but that is entirely a matter for the territory, as it is a matter for New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania.




Senator Cormann:
  Equal marriage—so here we go; here we have it.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Senator Cormann interrupts. If he does not think that is a right that the people of the Northern Territory or the ACT should have and if the opposition in this place wants to have that right withheld from the people of the territories, it is flying in the face of its own history, because it was Mr Kevin Andrews who brought in the legislation that overrode the ability of the territories to legislate in the matter of euthanasia back in 1996, and it was passed by both these houses. That is a prohibition which is not altered by this legislation today. That prohibition, which was supported by a free vote of both chambers—I voted against it, but it was still supported by a free vote of both chambers, with a majority of three, as I recollect, in the Senate—will remain on the Northern Territory assembly and on the ACT assembly unless or until some future vote of this parliament changes it. In that sense, this does not restore or give the measure of equality of the territories with the states that you might think at the outset.


I notice that Senator Brandis has said this morning that the opposition does not have the problem with equal marriage that the government has because it is unified—it is en bloc opposed to it. I had not heard that before. That is news, and I am surprised—




Senator Brandis:
  It's always been our policy.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Senator Brandis repeats that it is the case that within the Liberal Party—note the name—members do not have the ability to have a free vote on what should be a matter of conscience. But that is up to that party and its several members to determine; it is not a matter which relates to this vote today. This legisla­tion is important in enhancing democracy. It is one of the four pillars of the Greens party's established philosophy that we do enhance democracy where we can. I notice some criticism that I have moved in the past to have the parliament—never to have a minister but to have the parliament—use these powers to, for example, override the locking up of Aboriginal children in jail in the Northern Territory because they stole biscuits. We will remember the outcome of that, which was that the legislation did pass the Senate. It went to the House and then Prime Minister Howard contacted the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and offered the funding which ceased that practice of locking up Indigenous children, which had led to a horrible outcome regarding one child. It has not occurred since then, so it was an outcome which was worth while at that time. The ability of the parlia­ment to legislate or to put pressure upon the territories remains under this legislation. There is nothing inconsistent with my behaviour in wanting good outcomes and the proposal that is before the Senate today.


That said, we will oppose Senator Humphries's effort to not have this bill considered. I would have thought voting it down is one thing; to try and put it on the never-never and come to no conclusion, as Senator Humphries wants to do, to leave the voters of the ACT and the Northern Territory in limbo, would be the worst outcome possible. It is bucking the need for there to be a determination. Finally, I thank the chief ministers of both territories for their support, and most recently Katy Gallagher, the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory. She has written to all members saying:


The Committee—


she is referring to the Senate committee—


has recognised that our Assembly and its Members have ""demonstrated a high level of maturity and competence over many years"". I believe, as you do, that it is time the ACT's self-government arrangements reflected this and it is my sincere hope that you will support the passage of this Bill to allow the citizens of the ACT to have their views represented in a legitimate, democratic parliament—the birthright of all Australians.


I could not put it better myself. I look forward to this legislation passing this place and hopefully passing the House of Repre­sentatives so that it will soon pass into law. Question put:

As Senator Brown has referred to, and as I referred to in passing in my second reading speech, we have had the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report and the amendments reflect the issues raised in the report. We note that the private senator's bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Com­mittee for consideration on 2 March 2011. While the Senate committee strongly suppor­ted the removal of the Commonwealth's power to disallow ACT amendments and Northern Territory laws, the committee suggested amendments to the bills and consistent with the recommendations of that report of 4 May the government moved the amendments that have been circulated to the Senate. 


The main purpose of the government's amendments are to include a schedule amending the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 to remove the Governor-General's power to disallow laws of the Northern Territory Legislative Assem­bly. There is an amendment to exclude Norfolk Island from the operation of the bill. The government amendments to the dis­allowance bill will exclude application of the bill to Norfolk Island. As the committee noted, Norfolk Island's population is on a very different scale to that of the ACT and the Northern Territory. The passage of the Territories Law Reform Act 2010 provides the Commonwealth with increased oversight of Norfolk Island legislation to ensure it is consistent with the national interest. It would therefore be inconsistent for the disallowance bill to apply to Norfolk Island. The amend­ment to the disallowance bill would also remove from clause 4 words that purport to confer 'exclusive legislative authority and responsibility for making laws' on the ACT. As noted by the Senate committee, that is a significant misstatement of the law, apparently, as the Commonwealth's plenary power under section 122 of the Constitution to make laws 'for the government of any territory' will remain unchanged. The government's amendments would change clause 4 to more accurately reflect the current power of the Governor-General to recommend amendments to ACT enactments and Northern Territory laws. Those are the reasons for the government's amendments that we are considering in committee.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:15):  On behalf of the opposition, I indicate that the opposition agrees with the amendment to exclude Norfolk Island from the operation of the bill for reasons that I outlined in my speech on the second reading. We do not agree with the extension of the operation of the bill to the Northern Territory because we do not agree with the principle of the bill at all for the reasons I explained.


Question agreed to.




Senator BRANDIS:
  We have opposition amendments that are about to be circulated, and I apologise that they have not been circulated already, but I will just foreshadow what they are. The effect of the amendments would be to add the words, at the end of the principal operative provision of the bill, 'if the enactment is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth' and to add the further sentence, 'Without limiting the application of this subsection, the Assembly may not enact any law that is inconsistent with the Marriage Act 1961.'


The purpose of the opposition's committee stage amendments is to do two things. First of all, it corrects an anomaly that would appear in the bill were it to be carried in its current form—that is, as honourable senators should know, under the combined effects of sections 51 and 109 of the Constitution the states may not legislate in areas reserved for the legislative power of the Commonwealth if there is an inconsistency between a Commonwealth law passed under one of the section 51 heads of power and a state law. That inconsistency can arise in one of two principal ways. There may be a direct incon­sistency—for example, if there were to be a Commonwealth law passed under a section 51 head of power which provided to a certain effect and a state law on the same topic which provided to the opposite effect. As honourable senators should know, that is the plainest case of inconsistency under section 109 of the Constitution, and as a result of the operation of that provision the state law would be struck down.


But very commonly a state law is found to be inconsistent with a Commonwealth law not because of a direct inconsistency but because the Commonwealth law—to use the phrase that the High Court uses—covers the field. So if, for example, the Commonwealth were to pass a law under a section 51 head of power which was intended to be comprehen­sive in relation to that particular topic, then an inconsistent state law, or a state law which sought to regulate the same topic in a manner at variance from the manner in which the Commonwealth law sought to regulate the topic, would also be struck down under section 109 because the Common­wealth law would be considered to cover the field. We in the coalition consider that the Marriage Act is such a law, although I acknowledge that that proposition is contro­versial and that some, including Professor George Williams, have opined that that is not the case, particularly in relation to same-sex marriage.


If this bill were to be passed in its existing form, without the qualification the opposition seeks to introduce, we would have the unusual situation that the territories would have broader legislative powers than the states because section 109 of the Constitution applies to state laws, not to territory laws. So the device of this amendment is to apply the same test to territory laws as section 109 of the Constitution imposes upon state laws. There is a controversy about the reach of the Marriage Act 1961 and, in particular, the reach of the 2004 amendments to the Marriage Act introduced by the Howard government—with the support at the time of the Labor Party, I might say—which introduced section 88EA into the Marriage Act which prohibited same-sex marriage. The qualifying words of the opposition's amendments, which are really inserted out of abundant caution, are to make it perfectly clear that an inconsistency between a territory law in relation to marriage and the Marriage Act will result in the Marriage Act prevailing. The better view, in my respectful opinion, is, as I said earlier, that the Commonwealth Marriage Act covers the field in relation to marriage, and that is the view of most constitutional lawyers. There is a minority view that it does not. In order to deal with the possibility—argued for, for example, by Professor George Williams—that the Marriage Act does not effectively prohibit same-sex marriage, these additional words are introduced to ensure that no territory law may be inconsistent with any provision of the Marriage Act, including in particular, though it is not set out specifically, section 88EA. That is the reason for the opposition amendments.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2011-08-18,"



Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:23):  The Greens will not be supporting these amendments. You can see from the process in committee that this is not an eleventh-hour amendment; this is a twelfth-hour amend­ment after a process was put in place that a week's notice be available for private members' time legislation so that parties could get their act into gear. Not only that; it has been known for many months, in fact since last year, that this legislation was coming down the line. Here we have the opposition, through Senator Brandis, bringing in amendments which were not circulated, have not been notified and which are an afterthought. They are so important to the opposition that they are an afterthought in the wake of huge publicity and a committee investigation into this matter!


Let us look at Senator Brandis's amendments, which have now been circu­lated in the wake of his submission, and see what they do. They run totally contrary to the spirit of the legislation that is before the chamber. Senator Humphries may agree with them, but again they cut down the effort—talk of equal rights here!—to give equal rights to the voters of the territories, as against those of the states, in all matters as far as possible. I have explained that euthan­asia is prohibited by legislation through this parliament, but the matter of marriage is not. What Senator Brandis is arguing is that we should, on the very day we are trying to enhance and make more equal the rights of the voters of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, bring in a provision that cuts down those rights in the matter of marriage—because it will be a prohibition that is not there in state law.


The whole thrust of this legislation is to give the territory assemblies, as far as is practicable, the same rights to pass laws for their citizens as the state assemblies have. It is as simple as that. So this is a last-minute effort to pre-empt that principle of democracy. I am surprised that Senator Humphries—and presumably Mr Sezelja, the Leader of the Opposition in the Australian Capital Territory is in very direct commun­ion with Senator Humphries on this matter—wants to cut down the rights of the people of the ACT to deal with marriage laws in ways that are not any different from those of the states. This cuts across the whole principle of the legislation. The Greens will not be supporting it.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-08-18,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (11:26):  Senator Bob Brown has just exposed, for all of us to see, what this is all about. The Labor Party caucus has been deceived. The Labor Party caucus agreed to support this legislation on the basis that it would not lead to legalisation of same-sex marriage in the nation's capital. The Labor Party caucus adopted support for this bill—and without controversy, it was reported—because members were assured it was not about same-sex marriage.


In his contribution just now Senator Brown indicated that the Greens would not support the very sensible amendments that are being put forward by Senator Brandis, amendments which would ensure that the assurances given to Labor Party members and senators would be enshrined in this legislation. Here it is; we can see very well what this is about. The Labor Party has been deceived. Of course we are not surprised that the Greens will not support these amend­ments. But if the Labor Party is true to the assurances that were given to members and senators in the ALP caucus then the Labor Party should support the amendments that will be moved by Senator Brandis on behalf of the coalition.


At the end of the day, we always knew that this bill was not about improving self-governance arrangements for the ACT or the Northern Territory. This bill is about promoting the cause of same-sex marriage, because Senator Brown knows that the best chance of getting this passed in any jurisdiction is by facilitating it, enabling it to happen, in a territory parliament. We heard: 'No, no, no—this is about improving the democratic rights of territorians. It has nothing to do with same-sex marriage. You want a guarantee that this is not about same-sex marriage? We are going to give it to you.' Katy Gallagher, the ACT Chief Minister, was not prepared to give that guarantee. She declined to comment when she was asked whether the territory would use this bill to pursue same-sex marriage. But Senator Brown has let the cat out of the bag. Senator Brown, in his contribution to the motion foreshadowed by Senator Brandis, has made it very clear what this bill is all about. All this amendment does is enshrine in legislation the guarantees that were given to the Labor Party caucus so that the Labor Party caucus became comfortable to support a Greens initiated bill.


I say again: this is all about the Green tail wagging the Labor Party dog. This all about a Prime Minister who is too weak to stand up to Senator Brown. This is about a Labor Party caucus that is too weak to stand up to the Greens agenda, which many of them do not support. This is all about hanging on to government by the fingernails at any cost. This is a government that is prepared to compromise anything they stand for if it helps them to stay in government.


If the Labor Party wants to keep any semblance of political integrity in this debate, it will support this amendment because all this amendment does is enshrine in this bill the promise that was made to the Labor Party caucus about what this legislation would do and what it would not do. Labor Party members and senators were told that what it would not do is lead to same-sex marriage in the nation's capital. Senator Brown has just said that he does not want this bill to be amended such that same-sex marriage in the nation's capital would be prevented from going ahead.


It was the coalition that included the definition of marriage in the Marriage Act 1961 in 2004, the definition being that marriage is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life. That is the definition which the Prime Minister tells us publicly she supports, but then she is too weak in the context of this legislation to stand up for the principle she supposedly supports. If the Labor Party is serious about complying with the promise that was made to its members and senators in order to get this bill through its caucus, then the Labor Party will support this very sensible and very important amendment.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:32):  To add to Senator Cormann's words, Senator Brown has now been found out. He has been smoked out. He said throughout the course of this debate that this was only about giving territorians equal rights. He now rises to object to an amend­ment, the purpose of which was to say that the same principles that apply to the citizens of states by operation of section 109 of the Constitution should apply to citizens of territories.


If Senator Brown's claims to believe in the equality of citizens were true, he would support this amendment. The fact that he objects to it reveals all. Senator Brown and others in the Labor Party have also said this is not about gay marriage, which is why we have included those words specifically, insisting that the territory may not pass a law inconsistent with the Marriage Act 1961. Senator Brown objects to that, too. Why would you object to that, Senator Brown, if gay marriage were not what this bill is all about?

My amendments gave the Labor Party the opportunity at the last minute to back off and to protect the definition of marriage in the 1961 Marriage Act. By the Labor Party voting with Senator Brown and the Greens to oppose the coalition's amendments, they removed the capacity to protect the definition of marriage in the 1961 Marriage Act applying to the ACT. They have in effect, whether they realise it or not, given their sanction to gay marriage in the ACT.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (11:44):  The critique from Senator Brandis is wrong. What we have seen this morning is a stunt from Senator Mathias Cormann and Senator Brandis. If the situation was so serious and of such concern, why did they come into the chamber at the 12th hour, almost literally the 12th hour, and circulate an amendment that no-one had seen? I did not even have a chance to have a copy of it in front of me. I did not even have the amendment in front of me in order to examine what its intent was. We had to rely on Senator Brandis's explanation, such as it was. It was nothing more than a stunt. This legislation is about removing executive power. It is not about gay marriage. It is not about euthanasia.




Senator Brandis:
  That is not what Senator Brown thinks. That is not what Senator Brown thinks, and it is his bill.




Senator SHERRY:
  It is not about those issues and you well know it. To conclude, having seen the amendment I can say to the chamber we have been advised by the Attorney-General—so we have received advice—that the opposition amendment is unnecessary. It is not necessary. The amendment is unnecessary to maintain the status quo in section 122 of the Constitution.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (11:46):  The Labor Party members of this chamber voted against an amendment which would have protected the definition of marriage in the context of this bill, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2010. The Labor Party voted against it. We are led to believe the only reason that the Labor Party ended up deciding to support this bill is assurances they were given that this would not lead to the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the nation's capital. So here we have it. Senator Bob Brown was so keen to shut up the Labor Party on this that he moved that the motion be put before the minister at the table was able to say anything about it. Not only is this the Green tail wagging the Labor dog; they do not even want this dog to bark. When there was a chance that Minister Sherry was about to jump up to express a view on behalf of the Labor Party on this bill, Senator Brown jumped to his feet and said, 'I move the motion be put.' He did not want Minister Sherry to be in a position where he had to formally say on the record, 'What we said to our Labor members and senators in caucus this week was a lie'. This is very simple. I saw our President, Senator Hogg, walk in, being very, very uncomfortable about what he has been forced to do in this chamber. Our President is a very honourable man, and I can tell you now that President Hogg was very, very uncomfortable about being forced by this Green alliance with Labor members and senators to vote against the definition of marriage through this legislation—as was Senator Furner and as was Senator Stephens. Incidentally, Senator Farrell sat here with a big smile. He does not seem to mind that this could well lead to the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the ACT.


I am mindful of the time, so I will not keep going on this except to say that this is a hypocritical Labor Party. They deceived their caucus. If they were truly committed that this legislation should not lead to the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the territory, they would have supported the very sensible amendment that was moved by Senator Brandis on behalf of the coalition.

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (09:31):  I am pleased that Labor will be supporting this private member's bill to strengthen the rights of territories. The Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Common­wealth) Bill 2010 has been referred to a committee. That committee has reported back to the Senate. I would like to warmly welcome their recommendation that this bill be passed.


At the outset, before I talk to some amendments, I would like to make it very clear that there are fundamental differences between this bill and another private member's bill that has also been introduced to the Senate, the Restoring Territory Rights (Voluntary Euthanasia Legislation) Bill 2010. It is fair to say that there is often some confusion about this, because they both relate to the way in which the territories are treated under Commonwealth law and their capacity to make legislation. But very clearly the purpose of the Restoring Territory Rights (Voluntary Euthanasia Legislation) Bill 2010—not the one we are debating today—is to repeal the euthanasia laws of 1997 and to repeal the provisions that preclude the ACT and NT from legislating on euthanasia. We will have an opportunity to speak about that another time. My own view is that it is about restoring territory rights.


But the purpose of this bill is to remove the power of the executive to overturn territory legislation behind closed doors without a parliamentary process. This has become known as the power of veto, if you like, over territory legislation. It is an executive mechanism that we in the Labor Party agree does not accurately reflect the status, the capability and the maturity of either the ACT assembly or the Northern Territory parliament. This bill will not stop the federal parliament acting in the national interest in an open and transparent way—in other words, from dealing with issues through both houses of parliament—should there be a conflict between Commonwealth and territory legislation.


I would like to foreshadow government amendments to the bill that were recom­mended by the Senate committee. These amendments will remove some words in clause 4 of this bill, which at the moment says, 'providing relevant territory legislatures with exclusive legislative authority and responsibility for making laws'. Our amend­ment would remove that reference because it does not accurately reflect the current power of the Governor-General to recommend amendments to territory laws. As such, it cannot be achieved by the bill. And this parliament can use a legislative process to override territory laws. To reflect in this private member's bill that this did create exclusive legislative authority and responsi­bility for making laws was indeed inaccurate. Nonetheless, this bill is an important change, because it does remove that executive veto, as I mentioned.


The other government amendment that I wish to foreshadow reflects the recommend­ation of the Senate committee and removes the reference to Norfolk Island. Norfolk Island is currently undergoing an extensive reform process. That reform process has bipartisan support and the support of the Norfolk Island assembly. That process is underway and we need to give due regard to that reform process, which involves govern­ance and various accountability and transpar­ency measures. It would be appropriate to consider the status of Norfolk Island's governance arrangements through that reform process.


Through the course of the inquiry into this bill many comments were made, particularly by the opposition, recognising that it was time for a broad update of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act. That recognition was across the board. In speaking to this bill as an ACT senator, I tend to agree. In fact the ACT government and Chief Minister have for some time been saying that it is probably time for an update of and a closer look at the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act, given that it came into force back in 1989. There are so many things one could say about the progress of the Australian Capital Territory. We can reflect positively on the maturity, stability and functioning of the ACT assembly in its governance role. All of these things stand up to scrutiny and support the general bipartisan view that an update of that act is due.


However, it was disappointing that through the course of the inquiry it became clear that the opposition's position on this bill was to oppose it and that they were hiding behind a call for a broader review of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act and using that as a reason not to support this bill. I will be very inter­ested to hear what the opposition have to say, because there is nothing in the context of a more comprehensive review or consideration of an update of the ACT (Self-Government) Act that would preclude their support for this bill right now. I know Senator Humphries is very tuned in to this issue. He has spoken many times on the right of the territories to create their own legislation. Indeed, we exchange words fairly regularly about this very issue. I would like to take this opportunity to remind Senator Humphries, the other ACT senator, of his past expressed avid resentment of federal interference in territory affairs and remind him that this is a significant opportunity for him and, indeed, for the opposition to respect the capacity and power of the legislature and remove this feature of an executive veto that is not shared by any of the states. It is something which applies only to the territories and, therefore, supporting this bill and the foreshadowed amendments by the government to remove that executive veto would bring the ACT and the Northern Territory into line with the states.


The final point I would like to make about this bill is that it really is about respecting those democratic rights. That is the basis upon which this bill has been proposed and the basis upon which we have debated similar issues in the past. The way in which we have seen this measure used by the former Howard government reminds us all that when we provide for self-government it is about trust, it is about respect and it is about the democratic authority of the government that has been put in place by an act of this parliament.


This is an opportunity to bring ACT democratic rights in line with those of the states and to stand up for the ACT assembly and, through it, all the people of Canberra. If the opposition turn their backs on this issue now, it will provide evidence that that is not a core principle which informs their view on these matters and will enlighten everybody that there is a strong thread of opportunism in the opposition's stance on the issue of territories' rights.


In closing, I would like to remind people that this does not prevent the federal govern­ment from engaging in a parliamentary debate in order to challenge state or territory legislation that is inconsistent with the Com­monwealth. Any fear campaign to purport that it will is misleading.


Finally, I would like to take this oppor­tunity, because I think it is directly relevant to the subject matter today, to congratulate the new—not so new any more actually—Chief Minister, Katy Gallagher. She is the new Chief Minister following the retirement of former Chief Minister Jon Stanhope. I would like to acknowledge that the transition was a smooth one and that I am extremely proud to work very closely, as I always have, with an ACT assembly, a Chief Minister and an ACT Labor government so focused on the best interests of the people of Canberra. I know they are committed to their ongoing campaign to ensure that they have the democratic right that reflects that of the states and that is commensurate with the status, maturity and broad rights of the people of the ACT.


I commend the bill to the Senate. I was very pleased to speak to it today. I look forward to the government moving the amendments, as they reflect the recommend­ations of the Senate committee, and I will watch with interest what is happening on the other side of the chamber.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-08-18,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:42):  The opposition has always been a strong proponent of the rights of people who live in the territories and, in particular, the rights of people who live in the three territories affected by this bill—the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island. We note in particular that the Northern Territory has resumed a movement towards statehood. That was a movement which, in the 1990s, although ultimately defeated, was strongly supported by the then coalition government led by John Howard. I recently met with a bipartisan delegation of parliamentarians from the Northern Territory to discuss the movement towards statehood for the Northern Territory with them.


Equally, the coalition has always been represented in this place by ACT senators—my distinguished friend Senator Gary Humphries, a former Chief Minister of the ACT, and his predecessor, Senator Margaret Reid—who have been very, very ardent advocates for the rights and interests of citizens of the ACT. The issue of statehood for the ACT does not generally arise in these discussions because of the peculiarity of the ACT's constitutional position.


So respecting the rights of citizens who live in Australia's territories, particularly the two territories represented in the Common­wealth parliament, is core business for us in the coalition. What this bill purports to do is to bring about a fundamental constitutional change to the status of those territories and the relationship of those territories to this parliament. Those of us who take the interests of territorians seriously have grave concerns that, because of the piecemeal, haphazard and sloppy manner in which this is presented to the Senate by the Greens, by Senator Brown, passage of the bill in this form will in fact retard and set back the recognition of the rights of territorians. In particular, having regard to the fact that the process in the Northern Territory is pro­ceeding towards statehood in a methodical and careful way, those who would like to see statehood for the Northern Territory do not want this bill in this form. This is by no means easy. I know Senator Brown enjoys the luxury of pontificating about issues without having the responsibility to put those views into effect. But if Senator Brown had met with voters who are seeking to prosecute the case for Northern Territory statehood—



Senator Crossin interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  I know you have, Senator Crossin. I do not doubt your interest in and commitment to this issue. If Senator Brown had met with those people, he would understand better than he does how constitutionally and politically difficult this is. Those who seek to advance the cause of Northern Territory statehood need a gratuitous intervention like this from the Senate like they need a hole in the head. So we will not be supporting this bill. We support the wisdom of the observation made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee when it reviewed the legislation and cautioned against a piecemeal approach to issues of self-government. My distinguished colleague Senator Humphries will shortly be moving a second reading amendment and addressing this issue and elaborating further upon what the Senate committee report found. 


There is another reason why the coalition opposes this legislation. We look with a very sceptical eye on anything that comes from Senator Bob Brown and the Greens. With a deeply sceptical eye, we have followed through the media the debate about gay marriage that has riven the Australian Labor Party and the concerns expressed, in particular by former Senator Mike Forshaw and former Senator Steve Hutchins—reflected, by the way, in their dissenting comments in the committee report—that this bill, although on its face a constitutional bill, is in fact being sought to be used as a vehicle for gay marriage to be introduced in the Australian Capital Territory. In forming that sceptical, dare I say somewhat cynical, view of Senator Bob Brown's purposes here, we are emboldened by comments that the former ACT Chief Minister Mr Jon Stanhope made in the context of this debate when Mr Stanhope belled the cat and made it perfectly clear that he would like to use this legislation, were it to be passed, as a vehicle to introduce gay marriage in the ACT. Mr Stanhope—who was a dreadful Chief Minister, a real no-hoper and one of the worst heads of government I have ever come across, on either side of politics, in any state or territory—revealed the purpose and the thinking behind this bill. Whether that purpose is continued by the current ACT Chief Minister I do not know, but at the time this bill was being shaped in the mind of Senator Brown we know what Mr Stanhope thought it would lead to and what he wanted it to lead to.


We know, as I said a moment ago, that on the issue of gay marriage the Labor Party is riven between those who are proponents of that issue and those—particularly the more conservative elements in the Labor Party—who are trenchantly opposed to it. We have no such division on our side of politics. We in the Liberal Party and the National Party support the Howard government's amend­ments to the Marriage Act; we do not support gay marriage. We are not having the argument among ourselves about gay marriage that is tearing the Labor Party to shreds at the moment. We are perfectly prepared to watch from the sidelines as the Labor Party tears itself apart. But anybody who thinks that there are not some in the Labor Party who see this bill as a step towards the enactment of gay marriage within the ACT is either deluded or dishonest. There are many—not all, perhaps not most—in the Australian Labor Party who do see this bill as a pathway to that outcome.


We do not accept the good faith of Senator Brown's public assurances that this bill is purely about the rights of territorians. On its face, as I said before, it is a constitutional bill. On its face, it is a bill of general application, but we know that it is also part of this move to achieve an outcome in relation to the Marriage Act to which we in the coalition are resolutely opposed. For that reason as well, we will be opposing this bill and we will be supporting the second reading amendment which I foreshadowed and which Senator Humphries will outline in his contribution.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2011-08-18,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (09:53):  I rise to provide a contribution to the debate on the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2010. I do that in two respects: firstly, of course, as one of the two senators from the Northern Territory and, secondly, as Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee that inquired into this bill earlier this year. 


I want to begin by saying that there are some aspects of Senator Brandis's remarks that I tend to agree with and there are some aspects of his remarks that I totally disagree with, and I think that what is happening in the Northern Territory and the views of people who are supporting statehood were a little misconstrued in his contribution. Can I say in providing some input into this debate that I often feel that, representing the Northern Territory, I am a bit like the youngest child in a family of 250 here. Sometimes when you are representing the Northern Territory in this chamber, you feel like you are at the bottom of the pecking order. You feel like you have to fight for every piece of recognition and acknowledge­ment you can get for the Northern Territory. 


For the last 13 years it has always eluded me as to why we are constantly coming into this chamber for debates such as this when we would not have these debates if we were a state or if people somehow did not feel that they could pick on the Northern Territory all the time. They do that by using some sort of hook rather than letting the legally competent, elected governments of the Northern Territory—whether they be under the Country Liberal Party or under the Labor Party—just get on and do the job they are elected to do. They enact euthanasia legislation, but for some reason here in Canberra, if we do not like it, we think we can overturn it. They enact mandatory sentencing legislation, but for some reason here in Canberra, if we do not like it, we will overturn it. People fought to keep euthanasia laws; people here overturned them. People wanted to keep mandatory sentencing laws; people here wanted to overturn them. It is always about an issue when you come to the Territory. It is never about the competency of the governments. 


I have lived in the Northern Territory for 30 years. Let me tell you: there are some laws that the CLP enacted that I did not particularly like at all, but I did not think that that was a key for me to open the door to Canberra and say, 'Overturn the legislation.' I think people down here have got to get out of that mind-set and totally get off picking on the Northern Territory and its government, no matter which party leads that government. Just leave us alone. Just let us get on with governing in our own right. 


We inquired into this piece of legislation. It is not a comprehensive review of the self-governing aspects of the ACT and the Northern Territory, and we make those strong recommendations here. I look at the amendment that Senator Humphries wants to make, and in some respects perhaps that does need to happen, but at least I am saying, 'Pass this piece of legislation,' because this piece of legislation could become law while a review of the self-governing acts is occur­ring. I will get on to why I would not support that for the Territory in a minute. 


What this bill simply does is remove the power of the executive government to veto legislation that has been enacted in the territories. That is all it simply does. It stops somebody in the executive arm of the federal government deciding they do not like a piece of legislation that has been enacted in the Northern Territory or the ACT. But it still leaves in place the provision for this federal parliament to overturn a piece of legislation. To me, that is not good enough either. I think the Territory government should be allowed to just get on with what it is competently elected to do. But for me at least this is a first point of call. At least we could be assured in the Northern Territory that one particular minister or one particular Prime Minister of any governing party in this country could not go off to the Governor-General or the Administrator and seek to overturn a piece of legislation. 


So is this a perfect piece of legislation? It is not a comprehensive piece of legislation in terms of the self- governing act of the territories, but at least it is one start. You could argue: 'Let's not do it at all. Let's do a comprehensive review.' But I think at least it gives the people of the Northern Territory some confidence to know that not one single person or one part of the executive govern­ment will be overturning legislation. Unfor­tunately, it does leave the door open, as I said, for this federal parliament to overturn legislation. Can I go to some of the remarks that Senator Brandis had to make on behalf of the opposition. You cannot step away from the fact that both the Chief Minister of the ACT at the time, Jon Stanhope, and the current Chief Minister of the Northern Terri­tory, Paul Henderson, flew specifically to Canberra. Jon Stanhope made himself specifically available to appear before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee to support this legislation. That in itself showed me that both those governments and parliaments supported this legislation.


Another thing that impressed me, not only as a Territorian but as chair of that commit­tee, was that members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs flew here, including the Hon. Jane Aagaard and Kezia Purick. Members of that committee were in person at the committee hearings here in Canberra. I want to impress on people here that that was a bipartisan committee. That was a bipartisan attempt, to come down here and say, 'This legislation is okay; we support it.' But really what we in the Northern Territory are trying to do is get support for statehood. That is the endgame here. A 10-year process has been put in place by the Northern Territory government, which has been supported by the opposition. I am very impressed by the way in which both political parties have worked towards achieving this outcome. There has been a five-year consultation period and there will now be a five-year period of actually drafting a constitution and working out exactly the questions we will be asking Territorians.


This is where I differ from the comments that Senator Brandis put on record. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory did come down here and, in endorsing the bill's proposals as they pertain to the Northern Territory, said:


It is a very basic principle that we are arguing for here. The 25 members of the Territory parliament, who make laws for the good governance of the people of the Northern Territory, are elected by Territorians and they are accountable through fixed-term elections … For the Commonwealth executive arm of government to have the power, essentially at the stroke of a pen, to make a recommendation to the Governor-General to disallow a law in the Territory undermines democracy in the Northern Territory.


So, yes, he was supportive of this legislation. However, both he and the members of the Northern Territory legal and constitutional committee fervently put to us that the endgame for them is a move to statehood. That is what they really want. In your pro­posed amendment, Senator Humphries, you seek not to consider this bill but only to consider the interests of the ACT, in examining the self-government act for the ACT. I say to myself again: the Northern Territory would miss out on both counts here. We would not get this legislation through and support the wishes of the Northern Territory parliament, the submitters and the representatives of the Northern Territory. This amendment does not suggest that we would look at a move to statehood in the Northern Territory. We do not want the self-government act in the Northern Territory reviewed. We actually want an endgame where, essentially, that act is repealed. So this amendment is not a win for the Territory either.


But I think we need to clearly understand that this piece of legislation 'ought to be about votes, not about vetoes'. That is a phrase that was written yesterday by a journalist in the Age. It ought to be about democracy, not about particular issues. It ought to be about, at least, taking a first step in recognising that the Northern Territory has competent governments. Those govern­ments are elected by the people of the Northern Territory, just like the New South Wales and the Victorian parliaments are elected by the people of New South Wales and Victoria. They put legislation in from time to time that people do not like, and that also happens in every other state in this country. But what this bill seeks to do is ensure that those laws are not overturned by the executive government of the federal ruling party. That is all we are asking for in this legislation.


It is a first step. It is not the best step and it is not the step that we want to achieve at the end of the day. We want to see legisla­tion go through this parliament that grants the Northern Territory statehood in our own right. This is another example of where you have to come in here time and time again and keep flying the flag for the Northern Territory. It somehow eludes me why it is always the case that people here in this building believe that they can continually interfere in what is happening in the Northern Territory. This is one piece of legislation where, for a change, we would get some positive interference. Yet it seems it will not be supported unanimously in this chamber.


I am speaking in support of this legislation, but I am speaking more in support of the view that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee expressed in section 3.6.1 of this report:


The committee places on record its strong support for statehood in the NT …


The committee would also welcome any opportunity to work cooperatively with the NT Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs towards achieving that goal.


I can say that, as Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, it is an issue that we will pick up and write to that committee about. Perhaps for the first time in the history of this coun­try, we might see a standing committee at a federal level and a state level come together to hold an inquiry or do some work together to achieve that outcome. 


But let us be very clear here: what we want in the Northern Territory is statehood. We want to get to it in a measured way and in a bipartisan way where people of the Northern Territory are comfortable and confident about that on the day they vote yes. This legislation is just one step on the journey. It removes the power of the exec­utive arm to overturn our laws. Unfortunate­ly, it still leaves provision for the federal parliament to overturn our laws, and that is still not good enough. But, at the end of the day, this bill is certainly worthy of support. Unfortunately, Senator Humphries, I think that your amendment, again, really ignores the wishes and the wills of the Northern Territory and that there would be no benefit for us if your amendment actually succeeded.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2011-08-18,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (10:07):  I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:


Omit all words after ""That"", substitute:


   ""the Senate declines to consider the bill further, and:   (a)   notes the comments of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on the bill that ""an approach which fails to look at the broad range of issues affecting the autonomy of the ACT and the NT may not be the most appropriate way of addressing outstanding self-determination matters in those territories, and may not ultimately represent the most considered solution. The committee believes that a system­atic and holistic review of self-government arrangements in the ACT and the NT holds merit, and would help to address some of the specific issues raised during this inquiry."";   (b)   affirms that the process by which the Australian territories move towards greater legislative independence, consistent with the overall framework of the Australian Federation, should continue, but that a more systematic and comprehensive approach is to be preferred; and   (c)   calls for a full review of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 in lieu of piecemeal amendments to that Act"".


I will come back to speak about that a little more later. The question that I ask today in looking at the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallow­ance and Amendment Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2010 that Senator Bob Brown has put before the chamber is: what garments does that ultimate populist, Senator Brown, parade around in the Senate today? He appears to be wearing the clothes of the friend of the territories—the man who cares deeply about territorians and their rights to make decisions for themselves, the man who is the champion of regional autonomy, the man who stands up for Canberra against the federal government. This disallowance bill is brought forward to prevent the ACT, the Northern Territory or Norfolk Island being pushed around by ministers in a federal government. This bill gives expression, presumably, to ideals of self-determination which were inherent in the self-government acts of the 1970s and 1980s.


There is something about that image of Senator Bob Brown today which does not seem quite right. Something does not quite gel about Senator Brown as the champion of the second tier of government in this country. Something is more akin to a masquerade than to reality, because I recall a very differently attired Bob Brown not all that long ago. I recall that Dr Bob Brown, as he then was, came to national attention in the 1980s as the scourge of the Tasmanian government that wanted to build a certain dam, and Dr Brown argued that the conflict over the dam to be built in Tasmania should be resolved in a certain way. How did he want that resolved? He wanted it resolved by the federal government interfering and inter­vening in the affairs of the self-governing Tasmanian polity to stop the building of that dam. Where were the rights of territory or state governments at that stage of Senator Brown's career?


People might say that perhaps Senator Brown today feels differently about the territories than he felt about Tasmania back in the 1980s. He is now a member of parliament; perhaps he has a different view. I am not sure that that is the case either. Senator Brown's record with respect to the territories is not a lot better. I look at Senator Brown's bill, the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999, which was introduced by Senator Brown to override the rights of the self-governing Northern Territory to legislate in favour of mandatory sentences for certain people committing crimes. Senator Brown was unhappy with that and was quite comfortable in 1999 to introduce legislation to override the rights of the Northern Territory to legislate in that way. I have had this debate with Senator Brown before and I know what he is going to say. He is going to say, 'We were justified in intervening in the affairs of the Northern Territory at that time because we were dealing with a fundamental human rights matter which cut across Australia's international obligations under treaties; therefore, despite the principle which I strongly adhere to being violated, it was okay to intervene in the Northern Territory on that occasion.' 


Unfortunately, Senator Brown's record of intervention in the affairs of self-governing states or territories does not end there, because in 2003 Senator Brown returned to this issue with a motion of disallowance. Bear in mind that he is now moving a bill in the Senate to stop disallowance of territory legislation. Back in 2003 Senator Brown was quite happy to move a motion of disallow­ance in this place to prevent a certain road project proceeding in the Australian Capital Territory, the widening of the Gungahlin Drive extension, despite the fact that it was supported by the then territory government, because Senator Brown did not approve of the building of that road. He did not like the idea of that road being built and did he want the territory to make its own decision about that at that stage? No, he did not. He knew better. He would bring the might of the federal parliament down on the ACT and prevent the building of that road.


Senator Brown has no credibility on such issues. Senator Brown is no friend of territory autonomy. He is in this respect an opportunist, happy to champion the rights of territorians to legislate when he agrees with what they propose to do with that power and equally happy to trash territory rights when he believes that his interests are not being served. You may say that today he is not talking about the right to interfere or not; he is talking about the way that you interfere. At the end of the day, Senator Brown, it does not really make much difference. If you are going to do somebody over, the way in which you do it does not have as much bearing on the matter as the fact that you are doing them over in the first place.


The coalition is not going to play along with the cynical game that Senator Brown is playing here today. There are serious issues about the form and the effectiveness of self-government, certainly in the ACT, and I suspect my colleague Senator Scullion—and we have heard from Senator Crossin already—will flag questions about the effectiveness of self-government arrange­ments in the Northern Territory. Those are real issues which deserve systematic, careful examination by the federal parliament, not piecemeal legislation designed more for political purposes than to advance a system­atic examination of what is wrong and what needs to be fixed about the institution of self-government in those places. This bill does not address those fundamental issues, issues that Senator Crossin talked about that I know vex Senator Scullion. This bill is an oppor­tunistic intervention to clothe the Greens in the most favourable electoral light, not an attempt to fix what I think we all know needs to be addressed.


I have moved a second reading amendment which first of all acknowledges the findings of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee that there are issues which simply have to be addressed and which this legislation does not address. The second reading amendment affirms the process by which the states and territories move towards greater legislative independence consistent with the framework of Australian Federation. In the case of the Northern Territory, that may well include statehood within a few years. That is probably not the case for the ACT, but certainly the ACT's need to overhaul the institution of self-government, which is now more than 22 years old, is a real and urgent need and, again, the piecemeal approach taken by this legislation is not a satisfactory solution to that problem. The amendment calls for a full review of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act. If a colleague, particularly Senator Scullion, supports the view that the Northern Territory should also be included in such a review, I am very happy for that to occur. Indeed I would foreshadow that in the next few sitting days Senator Scullion and I will put forward a matter for the Senate to consider with respect to the question of the structure and future of self-government in the Northern Territory and the ACT.


I hear the support of the Labor Party for this bill and I note that there is a pretty large measure of cynicism in that position as well. I recall it was only three years ago that the Labor Party was perfectly content to support the decision of then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to intervene, through the disallowance power, to overrule the then-proposed resurgence of civil unions legislation in the ACT—legislation which had been proposed during the Howard government and which the ACT government came back to propose again when the Rudd government was elected. Of course, the Rudd government at that stage rebuffed that suggestion very clearly, and the senators who today rise to tell us what a wonderful idea this bill is were perfectly happy to use that power back in 2008.




Senator McLucas:
  Not true, Gary.




Senator Humphries:
  It is true.




Senator McLucas:
  No, it's not true.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  If you want, Senator McLucas, I will table the press statement that was made at that stage. You did not use the power because the ACT government backed down. You did not carry it through but you threatened to use it.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senator, through the chair, please.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  Yes, Mr Deputy President. Let us not be holier than thou. When it suited your purposes you were quite prepared to use this power in this way. This is a process bill. It is about how decisions are made affecting the powers of territories. It is not a substantive bill about those powers, and those issues do need to be addressed and in other ways they will be addressed. I would prefer that they were addressed through a comprehensive review of the status of self-government, not through some piecemeal approach. That is the appropriate way to deal with this. I represent the ACT. I understand what I think the people of this territory aspire to and want. I do not think they want the institution of self-government to be toyed with by federal politicians. They want these issues to be dealt with systematically and comprehensively. I believe the citizens of this territory would welcome an opportunity to engage in a full, comprehensive consult­ative process to examine the status of self-government here. That is the better approach, not the approach inherent in this very piecemeal piece of legislation.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2011-08-18,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (10:17):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Common­wealth) Bill 2010. Obviously, I rise as a senator from what is clearly Australia's smallest state, but a state that has had responsible government for over 150 years and one that is fiercely attached to its democratic institutions. Tasmania is also a place with a profound sense of identity—an island which has a particular tradition, a unique history and strong sense of commun­ity. Tasmania is a special place, a place with which I am deeply connected, and a place to which as a citizen—as a Tasmanian—I feel a sense of belonging. I belong to Tasmania. And Tasmania belongs to those communities who have had the honour of calling themselves Tasmanians.


We have the oft-remarked right of being well represented in this place, a right that allows our members of parliament to connect with our constituents at a very close level. At a state level, we have a particular electoral system, one which I know the other Tasmanian senators in this place know very well. It is the Hare-Clark system—shared with one of the territories with which this bill is concerned—which gives people the oppor­tunity to choose from amongst a wide range of candidates to find the one who best reflects their views and by whom they want to be represented. If those views are not carried to the parliament and reflected in the laws of the state, then the representative will be held to account at the next election. This is a very basic expectation of a democracy. And it is a very basic conclusion of the kind of belonging about which I spoke a moment ago. When one of those elements is not present in a system of governance, then it is difficult to call that system fully democratic. It is difficult to say that connection between a people and their place has been respected.


The way the law operates at the moment does not respect the important principle that people should be able to elect people to represent them, and that those represent­atives should have the capacity to deliver on the promises that they make and the values they espouse. This bill is about enabling the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to shape their own futures in a more democratic way. Both territories have proven themselves over a long period of time to be more than capable of governing them­selves in a responsible way, in the same web of interdependency between the levels of government in which the states participate. In fact, the ACT especially has led the way on a number of issues, and I want to take a moment to reflect on the very positive legacy left by Jon Stanhope and, in doing that, reject the characterisation of him made earlier in this place by Senator Brandis. Under Jon Stanhope's leadership, and importantly reflecting the values of the people of the ACT, his government led the nation on issues of rights, an important example of which is the Human Rights Charter.


This bill does not remove the interdepend­ency and the checks and balances we expect in a federal and a national democracy. Under this bill, there remains parliamentary over­sight of the territories, and I am sure that is an issue about which future debates will rage. But it is notable that this bill is relative­ly conservative in that sense. It is not a wide-ranging constitutional reform. It is about honouring the principles of democracy that we have already declared in this place, some time ago, and the will of territorians as reflected in their legislative assemblies. And when there is a conflict between those wills, or if there is a need to act separately to territorial legislators, we will have a debate in this place, as we should. We should have to put our case in detail on particular issues. We should have to respect that the destiny of the territory should be up to the territories unless we can justify intervention.


No doubt governance in this country is a complex matter and the issues involved are complex. We have international obligations and we have national priorities. We have differing levels of capacity in our different institutions. But what should underpin all of that is an understanding that the will of the people should be respected wherever it is most clearly expressed. I believe, in this case, that this means we should respect the laws enacted by our territorial assemblies. As we are aware, these territories were created by acts of this parliament. Their legislatures are rightly subject to the deliberations of this parliament, not executive government. It is important that the Commonwealth parlia­ment enable the ACT and Northern Territory legislative assemblies to be independent, to be responsible and to be accountable to their citizens. That is what I believe this parlia­ment is for and what Australians expect. Australians do not expect people elected for a different role to be able to override the will of the territories lightly.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-08-18,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (10:24):  This bill is another example of the Green tail wagging the Labor dog. It has nothing to do with wanting to improve the self-governing arrangements that apply in the territories. This started in 2006 when the Howard government decided to exercise section 35 of the ACT act to disallow the ACT Civil Unions Bill. That is what got this process underway. If you look at this bill as it was originally introduced by the Greens, it did not then mention anybody other than the ACT. This had nothing to do with wanting to improve self-governing arrangements for the territories in Australia; it was entirely and exclusively driven by the Greens' desire to stop the then Howard government and subsequent governments preventing the ACT government legislating for civil unions in the Australian Capital Territory. In 2006 the Howard government made that decision and, as Senator Humphries indicated, Kevin Rudd as the then Prime Minister in 2009 took a very similar view. Because he had good relations with the then ACT Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope, no doubt they were able to organise these things behind closed doors and did not have to run through the whole process. But the effect was the same.


I want to correct something that Senator Lundy said. Senator Lundy suggested this is somehow about restoring territory rights, as if it were going to take things back to somewhere they had been before. The capacity for Commonwealth governments to make the sorts of decisions that the Howard government did in 2006 has been in this relevant legislation as part of the self-government arrangements since the word go. This is not new; this is not just something that came out of nowhere in 2006. The Howard government exercised an existing section in the existing act. As Senator Brandis and Senator Humphries have said, and as I am sure Senator Scullion will say, the coalition is very supportive of having a comprehensive look at how self-government arrangements can be improved. But this is not what is driving the Greens. The Greens are being driven by their social agenda in relation to same-sex marriage, euthanasia and other bits and pieces for which they cannot get support, despite repeated attempts, in any of the state parliaments. 


As Senator Humphries indicated, it is not as if the Greens are consistent on this. There have been times when Senator Brown has wanted the federal government to overturn the state government of Tasmania on some­thing happening in that state. And when it came to mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory Senator Brown was quite happy to see the Commonwealth override the Northern Territory legislation at that point in time. This has got nothing to do with a genuine commitment to improving the rights of territorians; this is entirely and exclusively driven by Senator Brown's desire to see legislation on civil unions and same-sex marriage and euthanasia become more achievable in the sorts of parliaments where he thinks that this sort of legislation has a chance to get up. 


I just reflect on the fact that in 1997 this parliament voted to overturn the Northern Territory euthanasia laws. Whatever any­body's views on the substance of that matter, it was no doubt at the time a divisive debate. I was not involved as it was before my time. However, the Commonwealth parliament voted to overturn the Northern Territory euthanasia laws. No doubt that would have been a time when there would have been some robust debate inside the Northern Territory, among the good people of the Northern Territory, about how it could be that the Commonwealth parliament could do this. It was the year after the Commonwealth parliament here in Canberra made a decision about laws enacted by the Northern Territory in relation to euthanasia that the proposition of the Northern Territory becoming a state was put to a referendum. History shows that the people of the Northern Territory decided that they did not want to become a state at that point. I hear what Senator Crossin is saying and no doubt Senator Scullion will have similar views, and I know there is a bipartisan effort in the Northern Territory to continue the path towards statehood. I wish them very good luck with it. But right now the situation is that it is the Northern 'Territory'. The reason that is still the situation is because the people of the Northern Territory in 1998 voted against statehood. I was drawn to the additional comments that were made by former Labor Senators Forshaw and Hutchins, who were part of the inquiry into this legislation. I have to observe here that the fact the Australian Labor Party has decided to support this legislation is a very sad reflection on the current state of the Labor Party. The Labor Party once had courageous senators, like former Senators Hutchins and Forshaw, who were able to assess legislation as they saw it. I will just read from their comments:


This Bill should not be passed in its current form. It is flawed.


I could not have put it better. The quote goes on:


It will not achieve its stated objects. If enacted, this Bill will produce disparities between the legislation governing each of the territories and with the Commonwealth and the States.


Towards the end of their comments. Senators Hutchins and Forshaw observed:


It is not surprising that this Bill is technically flawed. Both this bill, and a previous bill proposed by Senator Brown in 2006, originally applied only to the ACT. They are clearly a reaction to the Howard Government's decision to use Section 35 of the ACT Act to disallow the ACT Civil Union's Bill. The proposed amendments to include the NT and Norfolk Island appear to have been an afterthought without any consideration of the consequences detailed above.


They recommend:


The Bill should be either withdrawn or not passed by the Senate.


Their final recommendation is:


We recommend that the Bill not be passed.


Former Labor Senators Forshaw and Hutchins do make the observation that the territories are not states. During the inquiry, the Northern Territory Chief Minister expressed support for the bill as it would be a 'small but significant step towards statehood.' As they observe:


This is not the expressed intention of the Bill. Any move toward statehood should be approach­ed in a serious and considered manner not piecemeal nor as a reaction to a particular decision.


That is exactly what Senator Humphries mentioned and what he is trying to address through the second reading amendment that he has moved.


I read in the media earlier this week that the Labor caucus—I should say the Austra­lian Labor Party caucus because we now have a true Labor senator among us in Senator John Madigan representing the Democratic Labor Party—decided to back the territories' autonomy because Australian Labor Party MPs, and I quote from an article in the Age on 16 August:


… received assurances that the bill would not lead to legalisation of same-sex marriage in the nation's capital.


A bit further on it says:


Caucus yesterday adopted the bill ''without controversy'' with members assured it was not about same-sex marriage.


But then:


A spokeswoman for ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher said it welcomed the decision of federal Labor but declined to comment on whether the territory would pursue same-sex marriage.


Why is that? If it is not about that, if they have got no intention of pursuing it, why wouldn't she just say so? I think that Senator Farrell has been sold a pup. I think that Senator Farrell should try and show a little bit of courage like former Senators Hutchins and Forshaw did. He is now part of an Australian Labor Party that will facilitate either civil unions legislation or same-sex marriage legislation in the Australian Capital Territory. If Senator Farrell's intention is not to see that happen then he should support an amendment to rule it out in the legislation here today. I can see that he is distracted and is not prepared to listen to the debate that is going on, even though he is here represent­ing the government. Hopefully somebody back in his office is taking clear note.


This bill is about the Greens tail wagging the Labor dog. This Australian Labor Party is totally captive to the Greens. The Greens are driving their agenda. This has not been initiated by the Australian Labor Party government. This has been initiated by the Greens and the Labor Party is just hopping in and backing it up. Why? If you are serious about improving self-government arrange­ments for the ACT and the Northern Territory, go about it in a serious way. Go about it in a strategic way, support a proper review, support a proper approach that does not sort out these things in a piecemeal fashion just because Senator Brown was upset that the Howard government exercised section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act to disallow civil unions in the Australian Capital Territory. Senator Farrell, you might have been given assurances in the ALP caucus that this would not lead to legalisation of same-sex marriage, but the Chief Minister's office refused to rule it out when they were asked about it:


A spokeswoman for Chief Minister Katy Gallagher said it welcomed the decision of federal Labor but declined to comment on whether the territory would pursue same-sex marriage.


We used to have a Prime Minister in Kevin Rudd who was prepared to stand up to the ACT government in relation to this issue. Now we have a Prime Minister who is too weak. She is captive to the Greens. The Greens have bullied her into supporting this bill. Senator Mark Bishop, Senator Collins, Senator Farrell, Senator Stephens—where are they? At least former Senators Hutchins and Forshaw were prepared to stand up and be counted and call this legislation for what it is—a flawed bill that should not be passed.


If people like Senator Farrell on the Labor side were serious about representing true hardworking Labor voters, they would seriously reflect on what they are doing with this because there is now an alternative in the marketplace called the Democratic Labor Party. There are going to be people across Australia who are going to reflect very seriously on whether they should support the Greens-wagged Australian Labor Party or whether they should go to a true Labor party. I suspect you will find that people will turn away from the Australian Labor Party because of their support for bad pieces of legislation like this.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (10:37):  It is very rare for me to rise in this place and feel sorry for those on the other side, particularly for my colleague from the Northern Territory, but I think it is reasonable to put on the public record why they are taking this position. The reason my heart goes out to them is I am actually quite sure the leather is softer on that side. It is a long time since I sat over there, but it was certainly a lot more comfortable. There are a lot of benefits that go with government which make you want to stay on that side.


The sad thing about Labor's position is that it has had a very light spray of green over all of its motives. It is really important to have a look at the motive today. Senator Crossin stood in this place today, as she always does on any issues in regard to the Northern Territory, and said that we are moving along towards statehood. I have been very pleased to stand in this place on the most recent issue, legislating for euthanasia, and I support her in that regard. If you look at the motive for all of this behaviour, it is simply to stay in government. That is the rawest deal. Of course the Greens have a great deal of influence, as they should in those circumstances, to ensure that this government does what it is told. Today we see the Labor government being pretty compliant and the Greens should be very pleased with that—it seems to be behaving appropriately and it is not being too naughty or doing things that the Greens do not require.


If we are looking to motive, perhaps we should examine the Greens' motives. Motive is very important in life. Why is it that we are moving along with this? Why is it that, suddenly, Bob Brown has a terrific love affair with the territories? He is very keen on the territories and on the people who live in the territories, but he is particularly keen on the legislation in the Northern Territory. As has been indicated today, Bob Brown hardly seems to have a consistent approach. He is, today, basically saying that the Common­wealth should not interfere with the Northern Territory or with the Australian Capital Territory—'The poor devils, we should allow them exactly the same rights as a state.' It sure seems odd. I do not know whether it was a different bloke, but whoever it was, Senator Brown, I recall him standing in here saying: 'Let's overturn the mandatory sentencing laws in the Territory. How dare they take their own stand in the Northern Territory and have their own rights to determine how they deal with the criminal justice system. Let's use the Common­wealth's powers in this place, in this Senate, to overturn them.' You can understand why I am a little bit confused in that regard.


I wonder what the motive is. You cannot accuse the Greens of not being organised or of not having a motive. They do have a motive. There is a very clear motive here and it has been indicated earlier. The cat has already been belled. If Katy Gallagher was not happy to stand up and say that this is all about introducing same-sex marriages in the Australian Capital Territory, the previous Chief Minister, Mr Stanhope, certainly was. He said: 'Absolutely. Looking forward to introducing same-sex marriages in the Australian Capital Territory.' In regard to this piece of legislation that those on the other side have been forced to accept, they have been given foolish assurances and have been foolish to accept those assurances. Those on the other side have accepted that that is the case.




Senator Cormann:
  She is not ruling it out.




Senator SCULLION:
  Of course Gallagher did not rule it out because that is exactly what is going to happen. As sure as night follows day this will happen. Perhaps I can just briefly paint the picture of how it will occur. This legislation does, in effect, say that instead of using an executive arm of government to deal with issues that are not within a state's capacity to legislate on—things like marriage, starting your own navy, having your own currency, taxation and immigration—if the territories play with that area, we are going to have to come back and have a full debate in parliament. That takes a bit of time. The scenario is that, if the Australian Capital Territory passes a law on Monday, we might have a bit of a think about recalling parliament, if that is the will of the government, and maybe we will have an emergency session a week later. If, during that period of time, people are lawfully married, for example, in the Australian Capital Territory, what happens to them? They were lawfully married. Does the Commonwealth then come back and say, 'We've got some weird retrospectivity in all of this about how we unwind this mess.'


That is what I believe the motive for this is. If you wish to have same-sex marriages, there is a process to do that. I argued strongly in this place during the debate on one of the previous contributions from Senator Brown in the Restoring Territory Rights (Voluntary Euthanasia Legislation) Bill 2010. I know that Senator Brown is a strong proponent of introducing euthanasia. I supported that bill not on the basis of whether I thought euthanasia legislation was being supported but because it is entirely the right of a state to make that decision. I also would expect, if the Northern Territory decided to start its own navy and its own currency or decided to start its own immigration system, that there would be an immediate action from the executive to deal with that. That is just a little about motive. Without a doubt that is what is going to happen.


Those people on the other side who think they are not part of something that will lead to what I have just described are, at best, fools. I know the comfort, vaguely recalled in my distant past, of being on that side. But remember: when this happens, your constituents will remember those who led them to that circumstance. If you want to introduce same-sex marriage, there is a way to go about that: you come to this place—because it is the Commonwealth which should legislate on those matters. Do not use some sort of a backdoor agenda to deal with these issues. Sadly, in the Northern Territory a few people are quite excited. They have rung me and said that they are really excited that this is going to give them more rights in the Territory. Once they have all the infor­mation they then understand that this is not another step forward in moving towards statehood.


I would just like to speak briefly about the foreshadowed amendment from Senator Humphries. Senator Crossin said: 'This is something we can't possibly support because it doesn't do anything for the Northern Territory.' I agree with that. She said, 'We don't want the self-government act revised.' Of course I agree: we want it abolished; we want to move to statehood. The Australian Capital Territory and the legislative framework are in an entirely different place to where we are in the Northern Territory, so I agree completely with her.


I would like Senator Crossin and people in the Territory to reflect on another contri­bution from Senator Humphries. In the next week of parliament we will be jointly submitting a process that will start a fair dinkum look at self-government in the Aust­ralian Capital Territory and the movement to statehood in the Northern Territory. It is not just a process on a couple of very small squeaky wheels. This will be a fair dinkum process with the motive of moving to strengthen self-government in the Australian Capital Territory and moving to statehood in the Northern Territory. That is the motive. That is what it will be about.


For those Territorians who think that this will somehow advance statehood, I can promise you that being astride a green horse with squeaky wheels is not the way to move forward. Look to the motive. This is an insult to those people who are actually striving for statehood in the Northern Territory and looking for stronger self-government in the Australian Capital Territory because it is about none of those things. On this side, we are clear-eyed and bright and we can see through the motive for this legislation. We do not accept that this is about strengthening issues for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. That is why we will not be supporting this legislation.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-08-18,"



Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (10:46):  I rise as the responsible minister, representing the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Crean, to contribute to the debate on behalf of the government. On 4 May 2011, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee reported back to the Senate on its inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government) Amendment (Disallow­ance and Amendment Power of the Comm­onwealth) Bill 2010, together with proposed amendments applying to the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island. 


The bill and amendments circulated by the Greens sought to abolish the power of the Governor-General to disallow or recommend amendments to territory legislation by repealing section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, section 9 of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 and section 23 of the Norfolk Island Act 1979. That is what this bill is about. It is moved by the Greens to abolish the power of the Governor-General to disallow or recommend amendments to territory legislation. It is not about a whole range of other issues, some of which have been touched on. 


The committee report contained two recommendations. The first recommendation of the committee is that the Senate pass the disallowance bill subject to the following amendments: firstly, the disallowance bill apply only to the ACT and the Northern Territory; secondly, the removal of referen­ces in clause 4 of the bill that purport to provide relevant territory legislatures with exclusive legislative authority and responsi­bility for making laws; and, thirdly, clause 4 be further amended to more accurately reflect the current power of the Governor-General to recommend amendments to territory laws. The second recommendation is that Norfolk Island be excluded from the operation of the disallowance bill until further evidence is provided on the need for change in that jurisdiction.


The government agrees with the object­ives of this bill in removing the power of the federal executive to override legislation in the ACT and the Northern Territory. However, given the technical amendments required, the government has circulated its own amendments to this bill. Again, I emphasise that this bill is about removing the power of the federal executive to override legislation in the ACT and the Northern Territory. The issues that have been referred to—whether it is euthanasia or same sex marriage—are determined and governed by other legislation of the Commonwealth. Those issues are not what this legislation is about.


The amendments will support the repeal of section 35 of the Commonwealth Austra­lian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and section 9 of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 and incorporate the committee's suggested amendments. The government agrees with recommendation 2 of the committee that Norfolk Island should be excluded from the operation of the disallowance bill, given the differences between Norfolk Island and other self-governing territories. The recent passage of the Territories Law Reform Act 2010 also provides the Commonwealth with increased oversight and scrutiny of Norfolk Island legislation to ensure it is consistent with the national interest. It would therefore be inconsistent for the disallowance bill to apply to Norfolk Island.


The bill before the Senate today, with amendments that I have outlined, will remove the ability of the executive govern­ment to veto legislation enacted by the ACT and the Northern Territory legislatures. As these acts stand, the executive has the power to override the decision of the democratically elected legislatures of the ACT and the Northern Territory. This bill goes to the rights of those in the territories to determine the good governance of the communities in which they live. The architects of the Constitution predicted that there may be times when the national interest must be considered when looking at territory laws. That is why they drafted section 122 that allows the parliament, not exclusively the executive, to make laws for the government of any territory. As I have already said, this parliament still will have a right to determine laws in respect to the territories. This legislation that we are considering is about removing the power of the executive but not this parliament. For all these reasons, the government will support the passage of the bill with these amendments.


A second reading amendment has been moved by Senator Humphries. The govern­ment will not be supporting the amendment. I will make a couple of brief remarks as to why we will not be supporting it. Firstly, the issues raised in the amendment have been canvassed in the Senate inquiry into the bill. The committee concluded—in its majority report, at least—that the bill would improve the democratic rights of the people of the ACT and the Northern Territory and the passage of the bill would provide just recognition of the maturity and capacity of the ACT and Northern Territory legislative assemblies since they attained self-government.


The Australian government has already indicated to the ACT government that it would welcome a review of the ACT (Self-Government) Act. Such a review should be driven by the ACT government and its citizens, and the Australian government would welcome considering such a review. The timing of a comprehensive review should not delay the implementation of the practical democratic benefits provided by this bill.


I note that both the ACT and Northern Territory Chief Ministers are on the record—or at least, in the case of the ACT, the previous Chief Minister; I am not aware of anything on the record from the current Chief Minister—as supporting the bill. For those reasons, the government will not support the second reading amendment.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2011-08-18,"



Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:53):  I thank all contributors to the debate on this very important piece of legislation to foster improved democratic rights for the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. I will not go over in detail the reasons for the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2010 because it has already been before the parliament and indeed through a thorough committee process, with the committee having endorsed the bill as it comes before the Senate today.


I note that there will be a number of amendments from the government. These reflect amendments that the Greens also had drawn up, and we will simply support the government amendments, which have the effect of extending this legislation to give the advantages of it to the voters of the Northern Territory and which cover some other related matters.


The Constitution says in section 122, with the headline 'Government of territories':


The Parliament—


it refers to this parliament, of course—


may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth—


and that is what is in process here today. A couple of decades ago this same parliament legislated to transfer its power under the Constitution to make laws for the territories to the executive—that is, the minister of the day. As has been noted in public debate, that means that with the stroke of a pen a minister can override the outcome of a deliberated vote following a debate of the elected representatives of the assemblies either in Canberra, in relation to the ACT, or in Darwin, in relation to the Northern Territory. This bill simply goes back to where the Constitution would have it—that is, the territories will effectively legislate unless or until a vote of both houses of parliament overrules legislation or passes legislation for either of the territories. We cannot change that provision of section 122 or section 123, which also deals with limitations on the powers of the states, unless we go to a referendum.


There is the prospect that the Northern Territory, which I think is moving in that direction again, will eventually end up subject to a referendum. I would not discount the possibility, as others have, that in some future time Australians might want to give the growing population of the Australian Capital Territory the ability to have self-determination through a form of statehood which will provide for all the amenities of this being the national capital but will provide for enhanced powers for the people of the Australian Capital Territory. That is a matter for a future debate.


This legislation today simply restores at least the right of the assemblies to pass legislation for their citizens without being overridden by a minister without reference to this parliament. It is as simple as that. I take on board the issues of equal marriage and euthanasia that have been raised in here by the opposition today, but they know full well—Senator Humphries knows very well—that this legislation does not alter that. In fact, it enhances the powers of the Australian Capital Territory to legislate at least in the matter of equal marriage, if it wants to, but that is entirely a matter for the territory, as it is a matter for New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania.




Senator Cormann:
  Equal marriage—so here we go; here we have it.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Senator Cormann interrupts. If he does not think that is a right that the people of the Northern Territory or the ACT should have and if the opposition in this place wants to have that right withheld from the people of the territories, it is flying in the face of its own history, because it was Mr Kevin Andrews who brought in the legislation that overrode the ability of the territories to legislate in the matter of euthanasia back in 1996, and it was passed by both these houses. That is a prohibition which is not altered by this legislation today. That prohibition, which was supported by a free vote of both chambers—I voted against it, but it was still supported by a free vote of both chambers, with a majority of three, as I recollect, in the Senate—will remain on the Northern Territory assembly and on the ACT assembly unless or until some future vote of this parliament changes it. In that sense, this does not restore or give the measure of equality of the territories with the states that you might think at the outset.


I notice that Senator Brandis has said this morning that the opposition does not have the problem with equal marriage that the government has because it is unified—it is en bloc opposed to it. I had not heard that before. That is news, and I am surprised—




Senator Brandis:
  It's always been our policy.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Senator Brandis repeats that it is the case that within the Liberal Party—note the name—members do not have the ability to have a free vote on what should be a matter of conscience. But that is up to that party and its several members to determine; it is not a matter which relates to this vote today. This legisla­tion is important in enhancing democracy. It is one of the four pillars of the Greens party's established philosophy that we do enhance democracy where we can. I notice some criticism that I have moved in the past to have the parliament—never to have a minister but to have the parliament—use these powers to, for example, override the locking up of Aboriginal children in jail in the Northern Territory because they stole biscuits. We will remember the outcome of that, which was that the legislation did pass the Senate. It went to the House and then Prime Minister Howard contacted the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and offered the funding which ceased that practice of locking up Indigenous children, which had led to a horrible outcome regarding one child. It has not occurred since then, so it was an outcome which was worth while at that time. The ability of the parlia­ment to legislate or to put pressure upon the territories remains under this legislation. There is nothing inconsistent with my behaviour in wanting good outcomes and the proposal that is before the Senate today.


That said, we will oppose Senator Humphries's effort to not have this bill considered. I would have thought voting it down is one thing; to try and put it on the never-never and come to no conclusion, as Senator Humphries wants to do, to leave the voters of the ACT and the Northern Territory in limbo, would be the worst outcome possible. It is bucking the need for there to be a determination. Finally, I thank the chief ministers of both territories for their support, and most recently Katy Gallagher, the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory. She has written to all members saying:


The Committee—


she is referring to the Senate committee—


has recognised that our Assembly and its Members have ""demonstrated a high level of maturity and competence over many years"". I believe, as you do, that it is time the ACT's self-government arrangements reflected this and it is my sincere hope that you will support the passage of this Bill to allow the citizens of the ACT to have their views represented in a legitimate, democratic parliament—the birthright of all Australians.


I could not put it better myself. I look forward to this legislation passing this place and hopefully passing the House of Repre­sentatives so that it will soon pass into law. Question put:


That the amendment (Senator Humphries's) be agreed to.


The Senate divided. [11:07]

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (12:31):  by leave—Senator Siewert's motion, as I understand it, claims that the Australian government intends to stop providing funding for Western Desert Dialysis, regarded as Purple House, which is untrue. The government has allocated $1.6 million annually to support the work it does in Alice Springs, Ntaria, Kintore and Yuen­dumu. Regardless of any future administrat­ive arrangements, it is our objective to secure this annual funding into the future, and Western Desert Dialysis have been assured of this both verbally and in writing. More recently, the government approved funding of $2.3 million to support the delivery of nurse assisted dialysis to Lajamanu and Kalkarindji.


In addition, the government has allocated $147,000 to the end of May 2013 for Western Desert Dialysis to provide chronic disease management and health promotion. Furthermore, the government recently announced the allocation of $13 million for accommodation in Alice Springs and Tennant Creek to house renal dialysis patients and their families. The government remains committed to working on these issues, although treatment for renal patients is primarily a state and territory responsi­bility. On that basis, we do not support the motion. We think it is not factually correct.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (12:34):  I present the report of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety on the Cyber­crime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 and move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


Today I table the report of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety on the provi­sions of the Cybercrime Legislation Amend­ment Bill 2011. All members of the committee were in agreement, including the Greens, who have complimented the quality of the report. There are some additional comments by the Greens, who would obviously have liked us to go further, but I will leave those matters to Senator Ludlam.


The bill deals with the subject of cybercrime, a subject that has increasingly occupied the attention of all Australian governments and this parliament. The globalisation of communication technology has brought many benefits but it has also enabled transnational crime to flourish. Hacking, the spread of malware, denial of service attacks on private corporations and the institutions of government is the modern face of cybercrime. Large-scale online fraud can net organised crime vast profits. We are no longer dealing the nuisance hacker who gets his kicks from showing off his hacking prowess. 


The bill amends the Telecommunications (Intercep­tion and Access) Act, and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, to enable Australia to accede to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. The convention and the bill are intended to enable law enforcement agencies to keep up with criminal networks that attack computers and computer systems or use the internet to facilitate their criminal enterprise. Before speaking about the report, I would like to outline what the bill does and correct some of the misinformation that is circulating.




What the bill does



There are four main aspects to the bill. First, it introduces a new mechanism for the preservation of communications to prevent the destruction of potential evidence until a warrant for access is obtained. This new preservation mechanism will be available to law enforcement agencies and to ASIO.


Second, the bill also allows the AFP to apply on behalf of a foreign country for a stored com­munications warrant. So, while the AFP must issue a preservation notice at the request of a foreign country, there is no access to this material without a warrant. The AFP can only apply for the warrant once the Attorney-General has agreed to a formal request for mutual assistance from the foreign country.


Thirdly, the bill allows the AFP to share telecommunications data—that is, non-content data—with a foreign country without the need for a formal mutual assistance request. This may occur only where that data has already been obtained for a domestic investigation. This is intended to speed up international cooperation.


Fourthly, the Ombudsman will have oversight of the preservation regime and stored communications warrants obtained for a foreign country. The Inspector General of Security and Intelligence will have oversight of ASIO's use of the preservation regime for intelligence purposes.




What the 
b
ill does not do



It is important to be clear that neither the convention nor the bill seeks to implement a general data retention scheme. It does not, as has been claimed by Crikey this week, 'open the door to mass surveillance of internet usage'. No country can demand the transfer of any data—the content of communication or the 'traffic data'. It simply is not true, as Crikey has claimed, that a country like China will be able to obtain volumes of communi­cations data about dissidents in Australia.


The powers available under the bill, and indeed the powers that already exist under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, can only be activated where there are legitimate law enforcement require­ments or, in the case of ASIO, legitimate security purposes. Access to the content of communications is provided under warrant and only after a mutual assistance request has been agreed to by the Attorney-General. 


The bill makes no change to the range of countries to which police can provide police-to-police assistance. The bill does not allow ASIO to share communications with foreign counterparts.


The committee received 23 submissions and heard from several witness on Monday, 1 August. We also carried out an inspection of the Australian Federal Police high-tech crime operations facilities in Barton. We were conscious of the sensitivity that goes with any expansion of covert police powers, especially powers that involve access to private communications. We are mindful of the importance of subjecting these powers to proper standards and safeguards.


It is with this in mind that we have proposed a range of realistic, modest and practical changes. If adopted, we believe these changes will go a long way toward allaying any fears of unwarranted intrusions into privacy or unjustified sharing of data with foreign countries.


The time for presentation of this report is short. I will forgo a detailed explanation of each recom­mendation. The general approach of the committee was to ensure that thresh­olds that apply to domestic investigation are equally applied to foreign countries seeking access to communications material.


We have proposed that the AFP guidelines on police-to-police cooperation in possible death penalty scenarios be tightened and should only occur in exceptional circum­stances and with the consent of the relevant ministers. This means that telecommuni­cation data cannot be shared even at an early investigative stage in such matters without the minister's consent.


We also proposed that the general privacy safeguard in proposed clause 180F be elaborated in more detail to provide greater guidance to the AFP. That guidance is already in the explanatory memorandum, but putting it in the statute will provide better visibility to the police and the public.


Finally, the committee proposed that the government consider in more detail what privacy obligations might apply to carriers and carriage service providers. Of course, the Privacy Act already applies. But better visibility and clarity can be achieved if there are clear obligations to destroy material held by a carrier.


Law enforcement agencies already have an obligation to destroy this material when it is no longer relevant to an investigation. The recommendation is that this obligation be replicated for the industry, unless there are other legitimate business purposes for keep­ing the information such as billing.


The intention of the committee is to improve public confidence in the scheme and we are sure that public confidence is equally important to the industry.


In conclusion, I wish to thank the committee members and the secretariat for their work in this inquiry. I commend the report to the Senate.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:40):  I am very pleased to follow the remarks of Senator Bilyk, the chair of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety. I will be fairly brief. First of all, I would like to thank the chair, the deputy chair and the rest of the committee for putting together what I think is a very important and very focused report in a very, very short time frame. As usual when bills such as these come through from the Attorney-General's Department, they are always in an inordinate hurry and they are always on fire for the parliament to urgently to dispose of the bills. I thank the efforts of the chair, the deputy chair and the secretariat for getting a coher­ent report into this bill.


I think the chair, Senator Bilyk, has perhaps undersold the efforts of the commit­tee to the extent that the committee majority report made some very strong recommend­ations for changes to the Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. I hope that the Attorney-General does not simply give the report of the cyber-safety committee a once-over and present the bill unamended to the chamber next week. I strongly advise the government against pursuing that course of action and advise it to read the report and to read the unanimous recommendations that the committee put forward because they actually recommend major surgery to this bill both in terms of amendments and in terms of clarifications.


The Senate is used to dealing with instan­ces of expansions of surveillance powers and expansions of law enforcement agencies in Australia. In my experience, it seems we get amendments to the Telecom­munications (Interception and Access) Act every couple of weeks. This is something a little different because this bill does not just relate to Australian security and law enforce­ment agencies; this bill relates to how data is shared with overseas law enforcement agencies, principally of course because the convention relates to Europe. But obviously if Australia is signing on, other countries around the world are signing on as well. This will allow data to be stored not just about serious crimes but about any offence at all.


If a foreign law enforcement agency wishes to prosecute or pursue an investi­gation, it will now be able to access data stored on Australian servers or in the hands of Australian service providers and that will be able to be used for law enforcement purposes overseas. 


Senators may remember the polarised debate on the net filter that occurred over the last couple of years. Everybody who partici­pated in that debate advocated better coord­ination between Australian law enforcement agencies and international agencies, for the obvious reasons—for example, if you are chasing child pornography offences on servers in Eastern Europe or in South-East Asia, or places where it is very difficult for the AFP to execute warrants and so on, you need tighter cooperation to prosecute those offences. I think everybody was unanimous on that. 


The underlying intent of the bill to enable that kind of collaboration in a globally networked media is entirely sound. The problem, as often happens with bills from the Attorney-General's Department, is that there is a colossal overreach; there are all sorts of agendas being advanced behind the cover of the ostensibly sensible objectives of allowing law enforcement agencies to collaborate and to cooperate better. This does not just pertain to acts of terrorism, child pornography or child abuse material being stored on overseas servers, or indeed on Australian servers; this relates to everything—any offence and any form of data that is being stored. Keep in mind of course that there are various kinds of data now that did not even exist 10 years ago. Now, as our lives move online, we leave digital footprints everywhere we go, as do other citizens in highly industrialised count­ries. All this material is now up for grabs. For example, the Attorney-General's Depart­ment floated a bit of a thought bubble, and perhaps the public got onto it a bit sooner than they were intending, about data reten­tion. This is about forcing internet service providers to hold not only material from people suspected of major crimes but also all digital material: records of emails; phone calls; GPS records of your tele­phone—in other words, everywhere you have been; anybody you have communicated with; ever­ything you have done online and every eBay purchase. Why don't we retain all of that in case one of us turns out to be a criminal? That agenda was very strongly rebuffed and we did not hear a great deal about it, but then here it comes again, sneaking in under the cover of an otherwise sensible bill about signing onto this European convention.


Do not forget that these police powers in many European countries occur against the backdrop of very strong human rights protections that do not exist in Australia. The Australian Constitution is silent on human rights. Things like free speech, the protection of privacy and so on are implied rights. In Europe and in North America that is not so; those rights are very firmly stated. In Australia we do not have that safety net.


Having to fast-track this bill, the commit­tee was forced onto a very tight timetable and it forced witnesses, who are largely vol­unteer organisations, to pull together submis­sions at very short notice. To the committee's credit, many of those concerns have been picked up. In this instance, I have chosen to draft and submit additional comments. It is not a dissenting report, but material in addition to the work of the committee. For example, regarding recom­mendation six that deals with the death penalty, we had a very interesting discussion in the committee over a couple of days. How do we feel about the potential for Australian law enforcement agencies sharing informat­ion to aid an over­seas law enforcement agen­cy that would then lead to a prosecution and then an execution? I think there is unanimous opposition in this chamber to the death penalty here in Australia, but if you look at the international instruments that we have signed up to they are also about not enabling judicial murder to occur in other jurisdictions either. We have left the door open for that. Read recommend­ation six—we have enabled that. We have allowed the door to remain open for that information to be transferred and then for people to be executed by their states. I think that is completely unacceptable.


The Ombudsman asked that his powers to inspect and audit compliance with the preservation and data retention regime be clarified to ensure that he can check compli­ance with the act and not mere record keep­ing. That is another very important point. Try to imagine the grey areas that we stumble into when a foreign law enforcement agency comes after a warrant or data retention order for something that is not even a crime in Australia or something of which there is no easy equivalent. Some of the language in the bill regarding those ambiguities is gobbledy­gook and will be extraordinarily difficult to interpret.


'Traffic data' is not the words that you spoke on the phone or the content of your email but the metadata about who it was sent to, when it was sent, where you might have been at the time that it was sent and so on. Traffic data is quite well defined in the European convention but it is not defined in this bill. It does not use the same termin­ology as the convention and there are going to be really serious mismatches in the inter­pretation of that. A number of witnesses brought that up. It means that we can accede to the convention, but I think we are going to stumble into a swamp of interpretation when citizens or law enforcement officials wish to know what their obligations are under the law. The Privacy Foundation argued along similar lines. Keep in mind that the actual status of the traffic data or metadata that surrounds communications is not about serious and organised crime, terrorism, child prostitution or anything like that; this is about all of the records of all of the moves that we make, and their imprints in cyber­space, now being accessible to foreign law enforcement agencies.


There are very serious grey areas in this bill. My real plea is that the government read not only the minority report put up by the Greens, which talks about the overreach and goes into some of the specifics that we think should be improved in the bill, but also the majority report that was signed off by all members of the committee this morning. Do not simply serve up the bill unamended just because you imagine that you are always right and that the bill is perfect. This one needs a second thought. Some of these things are probably a bit unusual at the moment—there is not a great deal of this sort of activity occurring—but as we move into the online age, as we move our lives online and as the National Broadband Network rolls out, these things will become routine and we need to get the settings right at the outset. I thank the chamber and I thank the chair, and I look forward to a debate on an amended bill. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

The time for presentation of this report is short. I will forgo a detailed explanation of each recom­mendation. The general approach of the committee was to ensure that thresh­olds that apply to domestic investigation are equally applied to foreign countries seeking access to communications material.


We have proposed that the AFP guidelines on police-to-police cooperation in possible death penalty scenarios be tightened and should only occur in exceptional circum­stances and with the consent of the relevant ministers. This means that telecommuni­cation data cannot be shared even at an early investigative stage in such matters without the minister's consent.


We also proposed that the general privacy safeguard in proposed clause 180F be elaborated in more detail to provide greater guidance to the AFP. That guidance is already in the explanatory memorandum, but putting it in the statute will provide better visibility to the police and the public.


Finally, the committee proposed that the government consider in more detail what privacy obligations might apply to carriers and carriage service providers. Of course, the Privacy Act already applies. But better visibility and clarity can be achieved if there are clear obligations to destroy material held by a carrier.


Law enforcement agencies already have an obligation to destroy this material when it is no longer relevant to an investigation. The recommendation is that this obligation be replicated for the industry, unless there are other legitimate business purposes for keep­ing the information such as billing.


The intention of the committee is to improve public confidence in the scheme and we are sure that public confidence is equally important to the industry.


In conclusion, I wish to thank the committee members and the secretariat for their work in this inquiry. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-08-18,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:40):  I am very pleased to follow the remarks of Senator Bilyk, the chair of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety. I will be fairly brief. First of all, I would like to thank the chair, the deputy chair and the rest of the committee for putting together what I think is a very important and very focused report in a very, very short time frame. As usual when bills such as these come through from the Attorney-General's Department, they are always in an inordinate hurry and they are always on fire for the parliament to urgently to dispose of the bills. I thank the efforts of the chair, the deputy chair and the secretariat for getting a coher­ent report into this bill.


I think the chair, Senator Bilyk, has perhaps undersold the efforts of the commit­tee to the extent that the committee majority report made some very strong recommend­ations for changes to the Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. I hope that the Attorney-General does not simply give the report of the cyber-safety committee a once-over and present the bill unamended to the chamber next week. I strongly advise the government against pursuing that course of action and advise it to read the report and to read the unanimous recommendations that the committee put forward because they actually recommend major surgery to this bill both in terms of amendments and in terms of clarifications.


The Senate is used to dealing with instan­ces of expansions of surveillance powers and expansions of law enforcement agencies in Australia. In my experience, it seems we get amendments to the Telecom­munications (Interception and Access) Act every couple of weeks. This is something a little different because this bill does not just relate to Australian security and law enforce­ment agencies; this bill relates to how data is shared with overseas law enforcement agencies, principally of course because the convention relates to Europe. But obviously if Australia is signing on, other countries around the world are signing on as well. This will allow data to be stored not just about serious crimes but about any offence at all.


If a foreign law enforcement agency wishes to prosecute or pursue an investi­gation, it will now be able to access data stored on Australian servers or in the hands of Australian service providers and that will be able to be used for law enforcement purposes overseas. 


Senators may remember the polarised debate on the net filter that occurred over the last couple of years. Everybody who partici­pated in that debate advocated better coord­ination between Australian law enforcement agencies and international agencies, for the obvious reasons—for example, if you are chasing child pornography offences on servers in Eastern Europe or in South-East Asia, or places where it is very difficult for the AFP to execute warrants and so on, you need tighter cooperation to prosecute those offences. I think everybody was unanimous on that. 


The underlying intent of the bill to enable that kind of collaboration in a globally networked media is entirely sound. The problem, as often happens with bills from the Attorney-General's Department, is that there is a colossal overreach; there are all sorts of agendas being advanced behind the cover of the ostensibly sensible objectives of allowing law enforcement agencies to collaborate and to cooperate better. This does not just pertain to acts of terrorism, child pornography or child abuse material being stored on overseas servers, or indeed on Australian servers; this relates to everything—any offence and any form of data that is being stored. Keep in mind of course that there are various kinds of data now that did not even exist 10 years ago. Now, as our lives move online, we leave digital footprints everywhere we go, as do other citizens in highly industrialised count­ries. All this material is now up for grabs. For example, the Attorney-General's Depart­ment floated a bit of a thought bubble, and perhaps the public got onto it a bit sooner than they were intending, about data reten­tion. This is about forcing internet service providers to hold not only material from people suspected of major crimes but also all digital material: records of emails; phone calls; GPS records of your tele­phone—in other words, everywhere you have been; anybody you have communicated with; ever­ything you have done online and every eBay purchase. Why don't we retain all of that in case one of us turns out to be a criminal? That agenda was very strongly rebuffed and we did not hear a great deal about it, but then here it comes again, sneaking in under the cover of an otherwise sensible bill about signing onto this European convention.


Do not forget that these police powers in many European countries occur against the backdrop of very strong human rights protections that do not exist in Australia. The Australian Constitution is silent on human rights. Things like free speech, the protection of privacy and so on are implied rights. In Europe and in North America that is not so; those rights are very firmly stated. In Australia we do not have that safety net.


Having to fast-track this bill, the commit­tee was forced onto a very tight timetable and it forced witnesses, who are largely vol­unteer organisations, to pull together submis­sions at very short notice. To the committee's credit, many of those concerns have been picked up. In this instance, I have chosen to draft and submit additional comments. It is not a dissenting report, but material in addition to the work of the committee. For example, regarding recom­mendation six that deals with the death penalty, we had a very interesting discussion in the committee over a couple of days. How do we feel about the potential for Australian law enforcement agencies sharing informat­ion to aid an over­seas law enforcement agen­cy that would then lead to a prosecution and then an execution? I think there is unanimous opposition in this chamber to the death penalty here in Australia, but if you look at the international instruments that we have signed up to they are also about not enabling judicial murder to occur in other jurisdictions either. We have left the door open for that. Read recommend­ation six—we have enabled that. We have allowed the door to remain open for that information to be transferred and then for people to be executed by their states. I think that is completely unacceptable.


The Ombudsman asked that his powers to inspect and audit compliance with the preservation and data retention regime be clarified to ensure that he can check compli­ance with the act and not mere record keep­ing. That is another very important point. Try to imagine the grey areas that we stumble into when a foreign law enforcement agency comes after a warrant or data retention order for something that is not even a crime in Australia or something of which there is no easy equivalent. Some of the language in the bill regarding those ambiguities is gobbledy­gook and will be extraordinarily difficult to interpret.


'Traffic data' is not the words that you spoke on the phone or the content of your email but the metadata about who it was sent to, when it was sent, where you might have been at the time that it was sent and so on. Traffic data is quite well defined in the European convention but it is not defined in this bill. It does not use the same termin­ology as the convention and there are going to be really serious mismatches in the inter­pretation of that. A number of witnesses brought that up. It means that we can accede to the convention, but I think we are going to stumble into a swamp of interpretation when citizens or law enforcement officials wish to know what their obligations are under the law. The Privacy Foundation argued along similar lines. Keep in mind that the actual status of the traffic data or metadata that surrounds communications is not about serious and organised crime, terrorism, child prostitution or anything like that; this is about all of the records of all of the moves that we make, and their imprints in cyber­space, now being accessible to foreign law enforcement agencies.


There are very serious grey areas in this bill. My real plea is that the government read not only the minority report put up by the Greens, which talks about the overreach and goes into some of the specifics that we think should be improved in the bill, but also the majority report that was signed off by all members of the committee this morning. Do not simply serve up the bill unamended just because you imagine that you are always right and that the bill is perfect. This one needs a second thought. Some of these things are probably a bit unusual at the moment—there is not a great deal of this sort of activity occurring—but as we move into the online age, as we move our lives online and as the National Broadband Network rolls out, these things will become routine and we need to get the settings right at the outset. I thank the chamber and I thank the chair, and I look forward to a debate on an amended bill. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

AUSTRALIAN ENERGY MARKET AMENDMENT (NATIONAL ENERGY RETAIL LAW) BILL 2011


Under the oversight of the Council of Australian Governments, Australia has made significant progress over the last decade towards an efficient and effective national energy market, in particular in the development of uniform national energy laws for electricity and gas.


This Bill I am introducing today is part of the current Council of Australian Governments’ reform program under which non-economic regulation of the distribution and retail of gas and electricity will also be subject to the national energy institutions and regulatory arrangements.


The Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011 sees the Commonwealth take an important role in implementing the cooperative legislative regime for regulating retailers and distributors who sell and supply electricity and gas to retail customers.  It is the final major component of the national energy market reform program agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in response to their 2002 Energy Market Review, ‘Towards a Truly National and Efficient Energy Market’ and set out in the Australian Energy Market Agreement.


The South Australian Parliament passed the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Bill 2010 (SA) on 9 March 2011.  That Bill received Royal Assent on 17 March 2011.  The National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 (SA) includes as its Schedule the National Energy Retail Law, which provides for rules and regulations to be made under that Law, called the National Energy Retail Rules and the National Energy Retail Regulations.


The National Energy Retail Law set out in the Schedule to the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 (SA), and the Rules and Regulations to be made under it, are supported by amendments to the National Electricity Law and the National Gas Law included in the Statutes Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Act 2011 (SA).


The South Australian Minister will also make rules which amend the National Electricity Rules and the National Gas Rules on two related matters.  The first set of amendments are national rules which enable retail customers and property developers to seek new (or significant modifi­cations to existing) connections to electricity and gas distribution networks.  The second set of amendments are new rules to set out the rights and obligations between distributors and retailers which are necessary to support the retail supply of energy to customers and include a credit support regime.


Together the National Energy Retail Law set out in the Schedule to the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 (SA), the Rules and Regulations made under it and the consequential amendments to the national electricity and national gas regimes are known as the National Energy Customer Framework (the Customer Framework).


The Customer Framework will be applied in all jurisdictions which are part of the National Electricity Market, namely South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and Queensland as well as the Commonwealth, by application Acts.  The Ministerial Council on Energy has agreed that jurisdictions will aim for a target uniform commencement date for the Customer Frame­work of 1 July 2012, noting that transitional legislative arrangements will be required to appropriately manage the transition process.


This Bill will amend the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 (Cth) to apply the National Energy Retail Law set out in the Schedule to the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 (SA), and the Rules and Regulations made under it, as a law of the Commonwealth in Australia's offshore area (essentially, the area from three nautical miles offshore to the edge of the continental shelf).  This Bill will therefore make the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 (Cth) the Commonwealth's 'application Act' for the new national energy retail regime.


The National Energy Retail Law will be under the jurisdiction of the Australian Energy Regulator as regulator and enforcement body and the Australian Energy Market Commission as rule maker.  Its primary aims are to streamline regula­tory requirements, increase efficiency through regulatory harmonisation and maintain best practice consumer protection.  As a result, the National Energy Retail Law is expected to facilitate an increase in retail competition by reducing regulatory complexity and lowering barriers to entry, as well as by encouraging consumers to participate in this competitive market by providing strong and equitable consu­mer protections across participating jurisdictions.  Other key benefits of the National Energy Retail Law include an increase in efficiency and competition obtained through having national regulatory arrangements, a comprehensive suite of robust energy-specific consumer protections, and the establishment of a national Retailer of Last Resort framework.


The National Energy Retail Law incorporates an objective which mirrors the objectives in the National Electricity Law and the National Gas Law.  The national energy retail objective is ""to promote efficient investment in, and efficient operation and use of, energy services for the long term interests of consumers of energy with respect to price, quality, safety, reliability and security of supply of energy.""  The alignment between the objectives of the laws governing the various sectors of the energy markets is an important foundation for the regime.


Currently each jurisdictional regime has a different regulator that makes decisions and determinations for that jurisdiction.  Under the new National Energy Retail Law, the regulation of all energy retail businesses will be undertaken by a single national regulator, the Australian Energy Regulator - a Commonwealth body.  This Bill provides for the extension of the Australian Energy Regulator’s powers to regulate the retail energy market.  The National Energy Retail Law therefore brings the whole energy supply chain – wholesale markets, transmission networks, distribution networks and now retail markets – under national regulation with the Australian Energy Regulator overseeing a robust compliance and enforcement regime across all participating jurisdictions.  This crucial reform will lead to a more efficient and consistent regulatory decision-making process.


Under the National Energy Retail Law, the Australian Energy Regulator will exercise a range of regulatory functions and powers.  These functions include administering a targeted compliance monitoring and enforcement regime.  The enforcement regime in the National Energy Retail Law reflects and enhances the current enforcement regimes in the National Electricity Law and the National Gas Law to create a harmonised enforcement regime across the national legislative frameworks.


The National Energy Retail Law will give the Australian Energy Regulator a range of new functions and powers, suitable for the regulation of the energy retail regime.  These include the power to accept enforceable undertakings from energy market participants for the first time.  The national regulator will also have certain new approval functions and undertake performance monitoring and reporting functions specifically targeted to the retail energy market.


The proposed amendments to Commonwealth legislation provided for in this Bill will ensure that the Commonwealth bodies that are conferred with functions, powers and duties under the National Energy Retail Law (the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal) are able to perform those functions and duties and exercise those powers from the commencement date.  Our role in this Parliament is to facilitate this.


To this end, this Bill amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) to explicitly allow the National Energy Retail Law, when applied as a law of a State or Territory, to confer functions and powers, and impose duties on these two Commonwealth bodies.  This includes, in relation to the Australian Energy Regulator, functions, powers or duties conferred or imposed under 'local energy instruments'.  These are subordinate instruments made under a State or Territory law that applies the National Energy Retail Law, the National Electricity Law or the National Gas Law in its own jurisdiction.


The Bill will also provide that decisions and instruments made by the Australian Energy Regulator for the purposes of the National Energy Retail Law before it commences, such as guidelines made in accordance with the retail consultation procedure set out in the National Energy Retail Rules, will be valid and effective from the commencement of the National Energy Retail Law in this jurisdiction.  The amendment Acts of other jurisdictions will contain similar provisions.  It is important to provide the Australian Energy Regulator with this legislative support, so that it can undertake essential activities necessary for the commencement of the new regulatory regime.


The involvement of the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal is therefore an essential part of this cooperative scheme, and the Commonwealth must take the lead by legislating to provide for these functions and powers to be exercised.  The South Australian parliament, and indeed parlia­ments in all participating jurisdictions, must see that the Commonwealth is committed to this cooperative scheme.


The amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) contained in this Bill will ensure that decisions made by Commonwealth bodies, such as the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal, under the National Energy Retail Law, when applied as State or Territory law are subject to judicial review by the Federal Court and Federal Magistrates Court.


In summary, the amendments I am introducing today represent a significant legislative step towards a truly national energy retail regime under a national energy regulator.  This cooperative scheme will ensure that Australia enjoys strong energy customer protections and the benefits of competitive and efficient energy retail markets – both electricity and gas – whilst minimising the regulatory burden on industry.  This Bill has the full support of my State and Territory colleagues on the Ministerial Council on Energy.


COMPETITION AND CONSUMER AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2011


The Gillard Government has been working since day one to build up competition in the banking system and get a better deal for consumers.


In December, the Government announced a comprehensive package of new reforms to empower families, support smaller lenders and secure the flow of credit to our economy.


These build on the decisive actions we took during the global financial crisis to preserve the competitive foundations of the banking system.


Our bank guarantees supported deposit funding for smaller lenders and enabled non-major banks to raise some $65 billion in wholesale funding.


Our $20 billion investment in Triple-A rated RMBS (Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities) continues to support this critical funding market which many smaller lenders rely heavily on.


All of this means loans are there when families need to buy a home, and credit is available when a small business wants to grow.


Competition means getting these loans at a fair price – that’s our objective.


Today I introduce amendments to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to crack down on anti-competitive price signalling and get a better deal for consumers in the banking system.


These laws will be initially targeted at the banking sector, because the ACCC has told us there is strong evidence of banks signalling their pricing intentions to each other in a bid to undermine competition.


We’ve been very clear all along that we would only extend these laws to other sectors of the economy after further detailed consideration, with a process to be followed, outlined in the regulations.


The ACCC advised me last year that it was concerned about the behaviour of ‘some of the banks in signalling in advance what their response will be to a change in interest rates by the Reserve Bank’.


In the Senate Economics References Committee’s banking competition inquiry, which reported in May 2011, the ACCC gave testimony that:




‘The problem with that sort of comment – the evil of it, if you like – is that it says to the competitors, “If you increase your interest rates I will follow”, which means you are signalling to the competitor that if they increase their interest rates they would not need to worry about being stuck out there on their own and losing market share’.



This type of anti-competitive price signalling can be just as harmful to Australian consumers as an explicit price fixing cartel.


However, there’s a gap in our competition law which has allowed the banks to escape the full force and discipline of competition.


The ACCC provided strong advice that banks were giving each other a ‘nod and a wink’ that they would raise their rates together.


However, because they weren’t actually writing it all down and signing in blood, or even agreeing verbally how they’d act – they’d get away with it.


This kind of conduct by the big end of town should never be allowed to continue when designed to dud Australian families.


That’s why we’re closing this gap in our competition law which is already dealt with in other major jurisdictions like the US, the UK and the EU.


That’s why we’re building on our 2009 reforms to strengthen Australia’s cartel laws, by banning signalling designed to keep interest rates higher.


Our tough new laws will give the ACCC the power to take action against banks who signal their prices to competitors to undermine competition.




Policy development process



The Government has been carefully developing competition policy in this area for some time, and monitoring global comparisons.


The OECD’s Roundtables on Facilitating Practices and Information Exchanges, in 2007 and 2010, have clearly highlighted the harm to consumers that can arise from anti-competitive price signalling. 


Many stakeholders in Australia strongly agree that anti-competitive price signalling is not prevented by our existing competition law.


They’ve told us that this conduct is best targeted by providing new, specific prohibitions which prevent price signalling occurring.


This is precisely the approach we have taken to provide certainty to the business community whilst ensuring robust protection for consumers.




Amendments to Competition and Consumer Act 2010



This Bill is fundamentally about stamping out conspiratorial behaviour by the big banks which isn’t caught by our competition laws.


These tough new laws have two limbs.


First, the Bill gives the ACCC the power to take action against any bank which signals its pricing intentions to a competitor for the purpose of substantially lessening competition.


We’re cracking down on banks who purposefully signal to their competitors that they should all raise their mortgage rates together.


It’s inherently damaging to consumers for any bank to essentially say to its competitors “don’t worry – if you raise your mortgage rates then I won’t undercut you and take your customers”.


It allows banks to move their interest rates higher without the full discipline of competition – and at the expense of the consumer.


This anti-competitive behaviour is an unambiguously bad result for Australian families and small businesses.


The Bill allows a court to infer the real purpose a bank has in making such a statement — so there is no need for a 'smoking gun'.


Of course, we are not talking here about ordinary commercial communications.


Every Australian bank will be able to communicate with its customers, shareholders, market analysts, employees and other stakeholders in the ordinary course of business – just like they have always been able to.


What we are doing here is cracking down on the insidious practice of signalling between banks which is designed to undermine competition and which inevitably hurts consumers.


The second limb of the law will prevent banks from discussing their prices with each other behind closed doors, where doing so is not in the ordinary course of business.


I note that ‘ordinary course of business’ is a wide term, found elsewhere in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 and in other laws.  For the information of Parliament, it is not necessary that the person or company has engaged in the relevant conduct in the past, or for the conduct to have been regularly or routinely undertaken by that business, or other participants in the industry.


This prohibition is targeted at those disclosures which are the most clearly anti-competitive and which are most damaging to consumers.


For example, the ACCC could take action if one bank phones another bank privately to tell them about a planned mortgage interest rate rise.


Of course, the Bill recognises there will be situations where banks need to discuss pricing with their competitors in a private context.




Exceptions and defences



We recognise that businesses need certainty and appropriate guidance so that they can conduct legitimate activities on commercial timeframes – and keep providing services to customers.


That’s why we have worked closely with the ACCC since mid-2010 to carefully design these amendments, and have consulted extensively on draft legislation with the industry, legal experts and other stakeholders.


The Bill introduced in the House in March had a number of specific exceptions, for example in relation to, continuous disclosure obligations, joint ventures, and disclosures to acquirers or suppliers of goods or services.  


In the House, the Government moved amendments so that further exceptions are provided that give clear guidance to business about what conduct is, and is not, subject to the prohibitions.


More specifically, an additional exception will provide banks with certainty that certain disclosures made in the context of corporate workout arrangements will not be subject to the private disclosure of pricing information prohibition. 


The Government recognises that it is important that banks assist financially distressed businesses in avoiding insolvency.  A new, explicit exception will be provided for banks that make certain private disclosures of price related information to a competitor if the purpose of the disclosure is for considering whether or not to take measures to return a borrower to solvency, or to avoid or reduce the risk of the borrower becoming insolvent. 


Also, an exception from the outright prohibition has been provided for in relation to syndicated lending arrangements, which may not otherwise have been exempt from this prohibition through the application of the joint venture exception.  This exception provides lenders surety that they can continue to engage in discussions for the purposes of syndicated loan arrangements.


In addition, the Government has provided an exception for distribution arrangements related to consumer credit arrangements.  To provide businesses with certainty, this exception draws upon existing, defined terms in the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009.


This means that banks will be able to go ahead and get on with the business of lending provided they aren’t being anti-competitive.


The Bill contains arrangements for banks to seek immunity where their conduct provides a net public benefit to the community.


This allows legitimate conduct to occur where it’s not covered by one of the other explicit exemptions - some of which I’ve just mentioned.


Following consultation with the business community, the Bill now includes a ‘notification’ regime to meet shorter commercial timeframes.


Where a bank can demonstrate a net public benefit, they can obtain immunity by describing the conduct to the ACCC in a notice. 


The ACCC then has a limited period of 14 days to respond if it has any concerns about the proposed behaviour.


This is significantly faster and more cost effective than the ‘authorisation’ process that we had originally discussed with the business community.




Conclusion



The Bill I introduce today strikes an appro­priate balance between allowing legitimate or pro-competitive conduct, and cracking down on anti-competitive price signalling which harms consumers.


This important reform will help to ensure that banks can no longer avoid the full forces of competition in the marketplace.


The Gillard Government is absolutely committed to getting a better deal for Australian families and small businesses in the banking system.


The laws I introduce today are an important part of that.


COMPETITION AND CONSUMER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2011




Introduction



The Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 will give effect to two important reforms to strengthen and clarify our competition and consumer laws.


First, the Bill will enact laws to deal with creeping acquisitions by amending section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (CCA).  


The amendments will give greater clarity to the provisions regulating mergers and acquisi­tions.  They will ensure the Australian Compe­tition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the courts have the power to reject mergers and acquisitions that would substantially lessen competition in any local, regional or national market.


The Bill also enhances and simplifies the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Austra­lian Consumer Law and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001.


The unconscionable conduct amendments are central to the implementation of uniform consumer laws throughout Australia.  They were agreed by the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs (now the COAG Legislative and Governance Forum on Consumer Affairs) at its meeting in Perth on 30 April 2010.  


These amendments clarify the Parliament’s intention as to how the unconscionable conduct law should apply.  They will place the ACCC and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in a better position to take more effective enforcement action.


I would like to recognise the valuable work of my predecessor, the former Minister for Competi­tion and Consumer Affairs, the Hon Dr Craig Emerson MP, in developing this Bill prior to its previous introduction.  


The Government previously introduced this Bill into the Parliament on 27 May 2010.  The Bill was referred to the Senate Economics Committee, which recommended that the Bill be passed.  


The Bill passed the House of Representatives on 24 June 2010 and was awaiting introduction into the Senate when the 2010 Election was called, causing the Bill to lapse.  




Creeping Acquisitions



Creeping acquisitions are a series of small-scale acquisitions that, individually, do not substantially lessen competition in a market, but collectively may do so over time.


Concerns about creeping acquisitions were raised in the context of the ACCC’s report of the inquiry into the competitiveness of retail prices for standard groceries.  In its report, while noting that such acquisitions do not appear to be a significant current concern in the supermarket retail sector, the ACCC expressed its support for the introduction of a general creeping acquisitions law.


Subsequently the Government undertook extensive public consultations in 2008 and 2009 to seek the community’s views on possible reform options.  Through its consultations, the government identified two amendments which would clarify the operation of section 50 as applying in the way it is currently interpreted by the ACCC, as set out in its November 2008 publication, Merger Guidelines.


The first amendment in the Bill will amend subsections 50(1) and (2) of the Competition and Consumer Act to replace references to ‘a market’ with references to ‘any market’.   This amendment will clarify the ability of the ACCC or a court to consider multiple markets when assessing mergers and acquisitions.


The amendment will clarify that businesses cannot challenge a decision to block a proposed acquisition on the grounds that the substantial lessening of competition identified was in one or more markets other than the primary market relevant to the merger or acquisition.


The ACCC and the courts will be able to consider the totality of the competitive effects resulting from an acquisition, including impacts in upstream and downstream markets, not just impacts in ‘a market’.


The Bill also amends subsection 50(6) of the Competition and Consumer Act.  That subsection has the effect of limiting the scope of section 50 to acquisitions in markets that are ‘substantial’ in a state or territory or region of Australia.


The amendment to this subsection will provide greater certainty regarding the current practice of the ACCC of considering acquisitions in local markets.  The Merger Guidelines state that the ‘substantiality criterion’ can be satisfied in many ways, including by the number of customers, total sales or the geographical size of the market.


The Merger Guidelines do not have the force of law.  While the interpretation of the ACCC of subsection 50(6) has not been tested by the courts, it was considered by Justice French in his 2003 decision in the Federal Court in the case of Australian Gas Lighting Company v ACCC.


While expressing no conclusive view, his Honour left open the possibility that whether a market is considered ‘substantial’ under subsect­ion 50(6) may be determined with reference to Australia as a whole.  If this view were to become established in law through the accumulated weight of legal precedent over time, then it could well preclude acquisitions in geographically confined markets from being considered under section 50.  This would prevent the application of section 50 to local markets where creeping acquisitions have been identified as a concern.


The Bill deletes the word ‘substantial’ from subsection 50(6).  This removes the risk highlighted by Justice French that a court could in the future adopt the view that acquisitions in geographically confined markets may not be considered substantial and therefore not fall within the scope of section 50.


The government’s amendment to section 50 will remove that possibility, allowing the ACCC or a court to continue to examine acquisitions in all markets, including in relatively small, local markets.


Together, these amendments will strengthen the acquisitions provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act under section 50 by clarifying the scope of the law and increasing certainty around its application to markets where creeping acquisitions have been a concern.


In addition to these amendments, when announcing the way it would respond to concerns about creeping acquisitions, the government also confirmed the power of the ACCC to act in relation to the acquisition of greenfield sites.  


The ACCC already considers it has the power to review acquisitions of greenfield sites whether through purchase or lease.  However, if the ACCC is challenged on this in the future, the government has stated it will not hesitate to confirm this power.


These amendments were agreed with the States and Territories under the intergovern­mental Conduct Code Agreement 1995.  




Unconscionable conduct



The amendments the Bill will make to the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Australian Consumer Law are the product of a recommendation of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which inquired into the statutory definition of unconscionable conduct in 2009.


The Senate Economics Committee recommended that the government set up an inquiry process to determine whether examples or a statement of principles would enhance the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Australian Consumer Law.


On 5 November 2009, Minister Emerson convened an expert panel to consider the issues raised in the Senate Economics Committee inquiry.  Professor Bryan Horrigan, Mr Ray Steinwall and Mr David Lieberman—all of them experts in competition and consumer law and distinguished in their professional fields—agreed to serve on the panel.


The government is grateful for the work of the panel—which included many hours on top of their already busy schedules.  In its work, the panel was assisted by officials from the Treasury and the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research.


The government is also grateful to those who made submissions to both the Senate committee and to the expert panel.  This helped to ensure the range of perspectives that exist in relation to this issue were understood.


The expert panel found that the unconscion­able conduct provisions have been regularly enforced since their inception, and that the case law is still developing.


Having said that, the panel also noted that the provisions are not easily understood and could be clearer for businesses, consumers, enforcement agencies and the courts.  However, the panel found that a list of examples of unconscionable conduct would not be helpful.  Indeed, the panel said such a list might give rise to misguided expectations about the scope and application of the law to specific factual scenarios.


Instead, it recommended the inclusion of some interpretative principles in the unconscionable conduct provisions.  The government has adopted all of the panel’s recommendations concerning unconscionable conduct, including the intro­duction of interpretative principles.


The first principle will deal with concerns that the practical application of the equitable concept of unconscionable conduct is too narrow when applied to business and consumer relationships.  Courts have tended to stick closely to the traditional equitable concept when applying the statutory prohibitions that were sections 51AB and 51AC of the former Trade Practices Act (now sections 21 and 22 of the Australian Consumer Law) and sections 12CB and 12CC of the ASIC Act.


For example, the common law required victims of unconscionable conduct to establish that they were at a ‘special disadvantage’ through factors like infirmity, age or a difficulty understanding English, before a court would recognise that unconscionable conduct had occurred.  The present statutory prohibitions on unconscionable conduct sought to remove limitations such as these on the ability of people to seek redress when subjected to unconscionable conduct.


The Bill amends the law to make it clear that the prohibition is not limited to the equitable or common law doctrines of unconscionable conduct.  The courts should not limit the appli­cation of the provisions by reference to ancient common-law doctrines that are not part of the statute.


The second interpretative principle will clarify that courts can examine the terms and the manner and extent to which the contract is carried out.  This principle makes it clear that unconscionable conduct is not limited to the bargaining practices leading to the formation of a contract.  


Unconscionable conduct can also be apparent in the way in which a party exercises its rights under a contract or in the way in which a party behaves once a contract is made.  It can also apply to the way in which contracts are renewed, renegotiated or terminated.


This interpretative principle will ensure that any unconscionable conduct—not just that occurring before contracts are made—is subject to the full force of the law.


The final interpretative principle to be intro­duced by the Bill is that the prohibition on unconscionable conduct applies to systemic conduct or patterns of behaviour and that there is no need to identify a person at a disadvantage in order to attract the prohibition.


Unconscionable conduct is not limited to individual transactions or events.  A pattern of systematic conduct or patterns of behaviour occurring over a period of time—which might include an accumulation of minor incidents—can also amount to unconscionable conduct.


This interpretative principle ensures that conduct, rather than individual transactions or events, is the focus of the provisions.


Further, as the focus is on the conduct rather than the victim, this principle reinforces the point being made in the first interpretative principle that there is no need to identify a person who is at a disadvantage in order to enforce the prohibition.




Other amendments



The Bill will also remove the distinction in the existing provisions between unconscionable conduct that affects businesses and that which affects consumers.


It combines the existing sections 21 and 22 of the Australian Consumer Law and sections 12CB and 12CC of the ASIC Act, respectively, into one section and rationalises their drafting to apply a single set of specific factors which the court may consider.


This amendment will eliminate the potential that the concept of unconscionable conduct in the two existing provisions could diverge, through a false assumption that the existence of two provisions signals a distinction in policy.  Any divergence has the potential to lead to confusion, and the distinction should be removed before any such notion develops.


The amendments will also ensure that a single, cogent body of legal precedent can develop around the statutory concept of unconscionable conduct as it applies to both consumers and businesses. 


The application of the Australian Consumer Law as a law of the Commonwealth and of the states and the territories has many advantages, one of which is that it can be enforced by courts at all levels in a consistent fashion.


In some states and territories the courts, including lower courts and tribunals, will be applying the prohibition on unconscionable conduct for the first time.  Providing clarity in the interpretation of these provisions will do much to ensure the consistent application of our new, national consumer law across Australia.


I can also inform the chamber that the Ministerial Council for Corporations was consulted in relation to the amendments to the laws in the national corporate regulation scheme, namely the amendments to the ASIC Act, and they have been approved as required under the Corporations Agreement.


I should also note that the Bill corrects a small number of drafting errors in the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No. 2) 2010.




Conclusion



Together the amendments contained in this Bill will bring greater clarity and certainty to the application of key provisions of our competition and consumer laws.


The amendments to section 50 will ensure that the ACCC and the courts can assess the totality of the competitive effects associated with acquisi­tions which occur in geographically confined, local markets. 


The amendments to the unconscionable conduct provisions will ensure there is a much clearer understanding of the conduct that these provisions have always been intended to address.  The amendments will protect Australian small businesses, but without creating market distortions which would only reduce their competitiveness and their resilience.


The amendments will protect consumers by ensuring that competition is protected and fostered. They will strengthen the prohibition against conduct that is designed to stifle competition through the imperceptible development of market dominance or through unconscionable business conduct.


SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2011


This Bill contains a range of measures relating to income support and veterans' affairs payments, and disability advocacy services, including two Budget 2011-2012 measures, and one Budget 2009-2010 measure.




Disability Support Pension – Impairment Tables



The Disability Support Pension is an essential element of Australia's safety net but it is vital that it supports the people who need it—those Australians who, through disability, are unable to work to fully support themselves.


It is essential that the level of someone's impairment is assessed using the most up to date medical information.


The current Impairment Tables used in Disability Support Pension assessments were last comprehensively reviewed in 1993 and are no longer consistent with contemporary medical and rehabilitation practices.


Over the years this has led to anomalies and inconsistencies which have distorted the assessment process.


For example, when hearing impairment is assessed, a person with a hearing aid is not required to wear it but someone who is having their sight impairment assessed must wear their glasses.




In the 2009-10 Budget the Government committed to updating the Impairment Tables
. 
This is an important element of the Government
'
s reforms to the Disability Support Pension to make it simpler, fairer and sustainable for those who need it.





An Advisory Committee of medical, allied health and rehabilitation experts, disability advocates, mental health advocates and relevant Government agencies was established in 2010 to provide advice on updating the Impairment Tables
. 
Following a rigorous process, the Advisory Committee has provided a final report and draft revised tables to the Government. 





The Bill removes the current outdated Impairment Tables from 1January2012, and enables new Impairment Tables to be introduced through a legislative instrument. 




The draft legislative instrument that contains the revised tables, based on the advisory committee
'
s report, will be released shortly for public comment. 





Putting the Impairment Tables in a legislative instrument allows them to be updated regularly in response to developments in medical or rehabilitation practice.




These revised tables have been developed following extensive consultation, and ongoing consultation will occur as they are implemented. 





Disability advocacy services




The Bill also introduces a stronger quality assurance system for disability advocacy services to ensure people with disabilities receive the best possible advocacy support.




The current quality assurance system has not changed since 1997, and the need for improved 
quality assurance for disability advocacy services has been highlighted in a number of reviews.





The Bill introduces mechanisms independent from government to assess the compliance of disability advocacy services against Disability Advocacy Standards.





Development of a robust, quality assured disability advocacy sector will help meet the objectives of the National Disability Strategy, and will also help meet Australia
'
s obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 





The third-party certification quality assurance system this Bill introduces has been successfully in place for disability employment services since 2002
. 
It

involves people with disability at all levels in the system, including as members of audit teams.



The new quality assurance system has been successfully trialled and independently evaluated in consultation with the disability advocacy services sector
. 
The evaluation recommended formal implementation.





Changes to income support payments



This Bill also makes a number of changes to the social security law, and veterans' affairs legislation, in relation to Bereavement Allowance and Special Benefit, and the income and assets tests.


The Bill gives effect to a Budget 2011-2012 measure to enable Parenting Payment recipients to access Bereavement Allowance following the death of a partner. Historically, there was no financial advantage in transferring between these payment types. However, the introduction of the Government's Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform package in September 2009 saw a substantial increase to the rate of some pensions, including Bereavement Allowance. Allowing a Parenting Payment recipient to transfer to Bereavement Allowance for a 14-week period, on the death of their partner, will provide additional financial assistance during a difficult time.


The Bill also gives effect to another Budget 2011-2012 measure, to more closely align the rules for accessing Special Benefit for Provisional Partner Visa holders with the rules for other newly arrived migrants.


From 1 January 2012, a class of visa holders determined by legislative instrument will be required to wait two years to be eligible for Special Benefit. This rule will not apply if the visa holder is able to demonstrate that there has been a substantial change in their circumstances after their arrival in Australia and they are in hardship.


Under current policy, Provisional Partner Visa holders are able to access Special Benefit from when they are granted the visa and are in Australia if they can demonstrate they are suffering from 'financial hardship'. 


This is not consistent with other newly arrived migrants subject to the Newly Arrived Residence Waiting Period, who need to demonstrate both 'financial hardship' and 'change in circumstance outside of their control' in order to access Special Benefit. 


Under these changes from 1 January 2012, Provisional Partner Visa Holders will need to demonstrate they have experienced a 'substantial change of circumstances beyond their control' in addition to financial hardship in order to access Special Benefit. 


These changes reflect the community's expectation that new migrants to Australia should be able to support themselves, or be supported by their families and partners unless they are impacted by circumstances outside of their control.


The new arrangements continue however, to ensure adequate protection for vulnerable migrants on Provisional Partner Visas, for example where there is domestic violence, death of a partner or an injury or accident after their arrival in Australia. 


The Bill also makes changes to the social security law and veterans' entitlements legislation to enhance the integrity of certain asset-test exempt income streams. These amendments strengthen the existing rules that require lifetime and life expectancy income streams to provide an annual actuarial certificate, in order to gain the benefit of concessional treatment under the social security law. 


Currently, in order for holders of lifetime and life expectancy income streams to benefit from concessional treatment under the social security assets test and the Veterans' Entitlements Act, it is required that an actuary certifies that there is a high probability that the provider of the income stream will be able to pay the income stream for its full term. 


Currently, some social security customers, after submitting an actuarial certificate that fails to meet the high probability test, later seek to replace this initial certificate with a more favourable certificate that meets the high probability test, a number of times within a financial year. 


This Bill clarifies that customers can only give the Secretary (or the Repatriation Commission) one actuarial certificate for each financial year to show that the fund has sufficient resources to pay an income stream for its term.


In the event that a person submits more than one certificate for a particular financial year, only the first certificate given will have effect, not any of the subsequent certificates. 


The amendments in this Bill also address inconsistencies in the treatment of these income streams that have arisen over time.



Finally, the Bill also makes amendments to the social security lawto clarify that payments made by an employer to an employee in lieu of notice of the termination of his or her employment are 'redundancy payments' for the purposes of social security law. This ensures that, in calculating income maintenance periods under the Act, people who receive these payments are treated the same as people who receive other types of redundancy payments.


TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2011 MEASURES NO. 6) BILL 2011


This Bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia’s tax laws.


Schedule 1 exempts the outer regional and remote payments made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative from income tax. 


This amendment is important for families with disabled children in regional Australia.  The Better Start for Children with Disability initiative provides funding for early treatment of disabled children.  This is important because treating disabled children early in their lives is shown to be more effective than later treatment.  Children with disabilities such as sight and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome or Fragile X syndrome will now have a better start to life under this initiative. 


The outer regional and remote payments, made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative, are payments of $2,000 available to families in rural Australia. This will support these families who often have to travel long distances and spend extra money to access services for their disabled children. 


One-off payments, like the outer regional and remote payments, are often considered income for taxation purposes.  The outer regional and remote payments provide important help to regional families.  These payments should not be taxed. This amendment ensures that the payments will not be taxable income.


Schedule 2 provides an exemption from fringe benefits tax for transport, from an employee’s usual place of residence to their usual place of employment, where the employee is an Australian resident employed in a remote area overseas. This arrangement is commonly known as a fly-in fly-out arrangement.


This exemption will ensure that Australian residents working for Australian employers in remote areas on fly-in fly-out arrangements are taxed consistently, regardless of whether they are working in Australia or overseas, as well as eliminating any possibility of double taxation on such benefits.


The measure will apply to fringe benefits provided after 1 July 2009, when Australian residents working in remote areas overseas potentially became assessable on their foreign employment income.  


Schedule 3 amends the list of deductible gift recipients (DGRs) in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.  Taxpayers can claim income tax deductions for certain gifts to organisations with DGR status.  DGR status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities.  


Schedule 3 primarily adds two new organisations to the 1997 Income Tax Assessment Act, namely, the New Zealand Government’s Christchurch Earthquake Appeal and the Cancer Australia Gift Fund.  The New Zealand Government established the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal to help the communities, families and people of Christchurch and the Canterbury region in the wake of the devastating earthquake which hit Christchurch on 22 February 2011.  Listing the fund allows Australians to donate directly to the fund and claim a tax deduction.


The Government announced the amalgamation of the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre with Cancer Australia on 15 June 2010.  The listing of the Cancer Australia Gift Fund is to allow funds to be used to work directly with stakeholders to improve breast cancer outcomes for women, reduce mortalities from breast cancer, and improve the wellbeing of women diagnosed with the disease.


Full details of the measures in this Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (12:56):  I rise today to make a contribution to the debate on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011. This is non-controversial legislation in the sense that we support the bill. The bill fundamentally deals with two programs: one is the Sporting Chance Program and the other is the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program. These programs have done a very good job in reconnecting Aboriginal people with their schools and their sport. They have certainly increased not only their partici­pation but their success rates in their chosen endeavours. Like many issues in this area, the sad thing is that the bill provides only a further 12 months of funding.


The reason we support these two programs is that fundamentally they are legacy programs from the previous govern­ment, and I commend the government for recognising and maintaining those. But the budget is only for an extra 12 months, which beggars belief when this is such good work. Of course, work comes from people. Policy does not just roll out of a machine and these programs end up getting run. You have to make an investment in staff to run these programs. And of course those staff, again, are not machines. They have mortgages; they have to have some security of tenure. We have now been issued another 12 months—well, jolly good. Times are pretty tough out there and it is very important that the individuals who are part of these programs, particularly the staff of the Sporting Chance and the Indigenous Youth Mobility pro­grams, have a much longer tenure than the 12 months that have been indicated here.


This appears to be symptomatic. Just last week I was speaking to some individuals who run a dialysis service in the Western Desert. They have eight dialysis machines without which those in the Western Desert with renal failure simply could not cope. They have a funding extension of six months.


I am not quite sure why the government is taking this course, but it is taking away people's security in thinking: 'I can stay in this job. It is a career. It's not just a casual job where I have six months tenure.' In areas like dialysis and working with young people we need the people who are delivering these very important programs to know that they have a sustainable future in those programs. Sadly, whilst we support the bill, this is just another example of the lack of recognition of that issue.

We believe that the passage of this bill will provide important support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. I would ask Senator Scullion to refer to the explanatory memorandum, which explains quite clearly that the government's intention is to align these programs with the review of school funding that is occurring. There is no deliberate attempt to provide difficulty with the tenure of these programs and I am sure Senator Scullion is aware that we are conducting a comprehensive review of school funding initiatives. I also cannot help but note that he comes from the coalition that supported Work Choices, which had perhaps the most profound impacts on employment tenure.

By its own admission, it has said there may be some implications. So, to stand in this place and say, 'This is a review; it's all part of the process,' and to bang on hopelessly about Work Choices reminds me of those people who desperately reach for the Work Choices lever. This is the panic button of politics. 'Some implications' is no excuse not to provide longer term funding and future planning for successful programs. That is what we need and that is not what the government has provided.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (14:00):  My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Senator Wong. I refer to today's Deloitte's modelling commissioned by the Victorian state government which reveals that in 2015 the carbon tax will cost 23,000 jobs in Victoria. As the Treasury has not modelled the impact of carbon tax on employment in individual states and, in fact, assumes the carbon tax will have no impact on jobs in the long run, how can you dispute these figures?

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:01):  I thank the senator for his question and for the opportunity to talk about the way in which the Premier of Victoria has quite clearly jumped aboard Mr Tony Abbott's scare campaign when it comes to climate change. This is the Premier who is on the public record in October 2008 saying 'we support an emissions capping and trading scheme as the least costly way of responding to global warming'. Yet another in the conga line of hypocrites in the Liberal Party on this issue—



Honourable senators interjecting—




The PRESIDENT:
  Order! When we have silence on both sides we will proceed.




Senator WONG:
  The extent to which this was a politically motivated exercise is really demonstrated by the fact that the report does not actually include the assistance packages within the government's Clean Energy Future package. It does not actually include the crucial assistance measures that the government has put in place. What an extraordinary proposition: you throw together some modelling, a month after the release of the carbon package, the Clean Energy Future package, to enable you to jump aboard Mr Abbott's scare campaign in order to be able to make false claims ahead of the COAG meeting—all this from a Premier who once supported a price on carbon! It is the case also that not only did the Victorian government fail to include the totality of the assistance measures to support industry and to support jobs in the context of pricing carbon; there is also quite a deliberate attempt to mislead in terms of the outcomes, which was repeated in the senator's question. I look forward to responding to that. (Time expired)

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:04):  In relation to the assertion about jobs to be lost, I would make the point that, in fact, the modelling shows employment in Victoria actually growing over the period. The reference to 23,000 jobs is a change from the reference case figure, not an actual change in employment, which is clearly not what the senator put in his question. Mr President, if the senator wants to get into an argument about modelling, I tell you what: I would back the Australian Treasury, who used to advise Mr Costello, who is one of the good senator's great heroes, in relation to the budget, in relation to the budget forecasts and in relation to the Intergenerational report, all of which show employment continues to grow under a carbon price—

That is why so many nations of the world are putting so much investment into clean energy, into generating energy more efficiently and more cleanly and into industrial and other processes becoming more energy efficient. The reality is the world is increasingly paying a higher premium for low-carbon goods and services, for clean-energy goods and services, and we on this side want to make sure Australians are positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. The difference is those on this side are prepared to look to the future and those on that side simply want to run a scare campaign today.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (15:00):  On 16 August Senator Milne asked me some questions in the context of my role representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. I have some additional information in relation to that question which I seek leave to incorporate into Hansard.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—



The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency commissioned George Wilkenfeld and Associates to conduct an independent analysis of data obtained under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System to produce upstream (scope 3) emission factors for natural gas by state and territory. The natural gas scope 3 emission factor includes both coal seam methane and other natural gas.


These factors incorporate the indirect emissions attributable to fuel combustion and fugitive emissions associated with the extraction, production, processing and transport of natural gas and coal seam methane.


These factors are published in the National Greenhouse Accounts Factors workbook on the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency website.


In relation to Senator Milne's second question, the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has not commissioned any research into the life-cycle emissions from coal seam gas (CSG) projects from external sources.


In the context of assessing the potential impacts of the Jobs and Competitiveness Program on liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, the Department has undertaken research internally based on a range of data sources to assess the magnitude of emissions associated with CSG versus other LNG projects as well as the material sources of these emissions.


These sources of information included the forecasted total project emissions estimated by LNG proponents in their Environment Impact Statements and in their estimates submitted to the Department.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (14:51):  I move:



That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


The non-answers given by those on the other side today to what were very, very basic questions from this side in relation to the impact of the carbon tax on the Australian people shows just how scared those on the other side are of the impact of the carbon tax. In fact Minister Wong, when asked directly by Senator Fierravanti-Wells exactly what the impact would be on self-funded retirees and whether or not any self-funded retiree would be worse off, was unable to confirm the comment from her own colleague, Senator Feeney, who said, 'None.' 


It was put directly to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation whether or not the comment made by Senator Feeney was actually true and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation would not confirm that no self-funded retiree would be worse off under the Labor Party's carbon tax. So every self-funded retiree out there needs to ask themselves: 'Is it me? Am I the self-funded retiree that is going to be left worse off under the Labor Party's carbon tax?' I think Minister Wong was actually very brave to disagree with Senator Feeney, because we all know what happens to those senior members of the Labor Party who disagree with Senator Feeney: they soon find themselves on the political execution hit list. So let us just watch this space very carefully.


I see Senator Farrell sitting there with a wide grin on his face. Senator Farrell, I think your little paws are just as dirty as Senator Feeney's when it comes to the political execution hit list. Remember, the political execution hit list was in relation to Mr Rudd. Mr Rudd was taken out—why? Because the Labor Party's ETS was going to have a devastating impact on the Australian people. It was the wrong policy at the wrong time. Mr Rudd was politically executed by the Labor Party because his policy was the wrong policy at the wrong time.


It is one thing for the coalition senators to stand here and to properly criticise and scrutinise the government's carbon tax policy but, with headlines like 'Gillard Govern­ment's carbon tax to cost 23,000 jobs in Victoria' in the Herald Sun, no wonder the Prime Minister will not take this policy to an election. She knows that if she did those opposite would be on their side and we would be in government. Then, of course, you have New South Wales modelling that shows in New South Wales electricity prices will rise overnight by 15 per cent. Why? Because of the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax policy. 


Paul Howes should be very pleased with this statement by BlueScope Steel. They, one of the fiercest critics of the carbon tax, have formally announced a $900 million write-down of their asset values and signalled a review of their domestic steelmaking cap­acity. This is the Paul Howes who publicly said if one job was lost because of the Gillard government's carbon tax policy he would withdraw all support for the carbon tax. Well, Mr Howes, where are you now?


Again, it is not just the coalition who are actively criticising the impact of this tax on the Australian people. Let us have a look at what New South Wales leader John Robinson told his party and the shadow cabinet. He said that he would never, ever publicly support a carbon tax. Then what happened? He crumbled under the pressure. There was also state Labor MP Bob Harrison. Mr Harrison is someone who would know the impact that this tax would have on jobs, because he was a former steelworker. He has publicly stated:


How can we believe our prime minister, unfortunately, who promised us there would be no carbon tax before the election and who just managed to scrape in?


But it does not end there. What about Mr John Della Bosca? He said:




... I think the carbon tax is a mistake. It's the craziest thing she [Gillard] could have done ...



Tony Sheldon from the Transport Workers Union describes the carbon tax as 'a death tax'. In the seat of Brand, I think that is exactly what Mr Gary Gray thinks of the tax, because the people in the electorate of Brand do not want the carbon tax. I see Senator Bishop smiling, because, Senator Bishop, you know that that is true. The current Prime Minister has failed in the task of national leadership. This week is a shameful week in this place, because it is the one-year anniversary of the greatest lie ever perpetrated on the Australian people. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-08-18,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (15:06):  We have just listened to Senator Cash for five minutes. Not once did she go beyond the utterance of cliche or homily—all screeched out there for five minutes without taking a breath and without saying one word of sense. Let us consider a little bit of history. Let us go back in history a little to when the first Howard government was elected in 1996. Since that time, from 1996 until now, there have been three significant packages of legislation introduced into this parliament. Two were introduced by the Howard government and one is about to be introduced by this government. The three packages are the GST legislation, the Work Choices legislation and the government's proposed carbon tax legislation. Each of those packages of legislation goes to one critical factor: it seeks to alter behaviour. In the case of the GST, it sought to alter spending behaviour. In the case of Work Choices, it sought to radically change the use of labour to make it cheaper. In the case of the clean air package, outlined by the government and shortly to be introduced, it goes to changing the behaviour of energy producers and users in this country.


In the case of the GST, any compensation that was offered by the government of the day had to be dragged out bit by bit. House­holds and families were significantly worse off, as the then government acknowledged, but it had to be done for the good of the country. Of course with the Work Choices legislation it was just about removing protections and benefits. Untold people were harmed, and their retribution was visited in the election of 2007. With the clean air package we acknowledged at the outset that there is going to be some impact on prices. It is going to affect those who are employed, it is going to affect families and it is going to affect those most in need. So what have we done from the outset? We have acknow­ledged that—we have been saying it for 12 months—and we have designed and will implement a comprehensive package of household assistance measures—




Senator Bernardi:
  Twelve months ago you said you didn't want a carbon tax.




Senator Cash:
  How will that change their behaviour?




Senator MARK BISHOP:
  that go to helping those most in need, as Senator Cash and Senator Bernardi well know. They have been out there for the last month or six weeks speaking to pensioner groups, speak­ing to community groups, speaking to those affected, and they have received the same message that every Labor senator across this chamber has, which is that the package of compensation offered by the government to households in need—those earning under $80,000—to self-funded retirees and to pensioners and others in receipt of welfare assistance is much sought after, much appreciated and, when explained in a calm, rational fashion, not only appreciated but desired.


What does it do? It gives more than adequate compensation to those household units that are going to be affected. As Senator Wong and others said in response to questions during question time, nine out of 10 households in Australia will receive some form of assistance. Almost every household in Australia is going to receive assistance in terms of the implementation of the carbon price package.




Senator Nash:
  You're admitting they're going to get slugged with costs.




Senator MARK BISHOP:
  Of those households, almost six million—and a lot of them in rural areas with well below average incomes, Senator Nash—will get assistance that meets or exceeds the expected average price impact.




Senator Nash:
  How are you going to do it when we get to an ETS?




Senator MARK BISHOP:
  So all those lower house seats that the National Party holds up there in New South Wales and people like you, Senator Nash, who are elected by people in those electorates, low-income electorates almost without exception, will be protected. The economic interests of the people in those electorates are going to be advanced because this government is going to give some of those six million households—some of those that elect you—assistance that meets or exceeds the expected average price impact.


But it gets better than that. Over four million households, almost half of all households across Australia, will get assistance that provides a 20 per cent buffer over and above their expected average price impact. In terms of change and the impact it is going to have, you could not ask for a more beneficial approach by a government, across Australia. It is a package of benefits designed to assist and advance the interests of those most in need.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:11):  Thank goodness Senator Bishop has run out of time, because the reinvention of history that we heard from him was simply extraordinary. May I take this opportunity to remind Senator Bishop that 12 months ago the Labor Party were not out there talking about the 'clean air' policy—and that is in inverted commas, I say for Hansard's benefit. Twelve months ago the Prime Minister was out there promising there would be no tax on carbon under a govern­ment that she leads. Clearly, the plausible excuse is that she is not leading this govern­ment and it is Senator Bob Brown who is actually leading it. But to all intents and purposes the Prime Minister of Australia is meant to be Julia Gillard, and she made a catastrophic deception of the Australian people a key element of her re-election.


Senator Bishop also, through his historical revisionism, went through key economic reforms and was unable to name one single key economic reform that this Labor govern­ment have actually introduced. They have been in power for nearly four years. In those four years we have seen the Australian economy incur enormous levels of debt. We are now starting to see inflation rise. We are starting to see unemployment rise. We are starting to see a rudderless and directionless government imperil the Australian people. That is why the Australian people are up in arms.


Contrary to Senator Bishop's assertions that the Australian people are saying, 'Yes, we want this economic reform, this clean air tax, this carbon dioxide tax that you are trying to impose upon us,' we know that is not the case. That is why thousands of Australians, the regular mums and dads, the mainstream of Australia—not the extremists captured by the kooky Greens, not the extreme left who want to see the dismantling of industrialisation in this country—pick themselves up and come to Canberra to say, 'We're not happy with the deception of Julia Gillard and the Labor Party.' We know that is the case, and whatever Senator Bishop tries to assert to the contrary in this chamber beggars belief. We know that there are convoys of hundreds, if not thousands, of Australians making their way to Canberra as we speak in a convoy of no-confidence in this government.


One thing is very clear: partisan politics in this country has taken a break for a while. It is no longer the Liberal Party versus the Labor Party, it is no longer Liberal supporters versus Labor supporters; it is us as Australians against the government. All Australians feel betrayed by this govern­ment. They feel that this government is not serving the national interest. It has taken a dose of that New South Wales disease and it is all about serving Labor's political interests. It is government clinging to government and power at all or any cost.


We have established very clearly that this policy, this erroneously named and misleading carbon tax, is a tax on an odourless and colourless gas called carbon dioxide, which is an essential element for plant food. We know that. It is not a great moral issue of our time, as that deposed former prime minister professed. It is not a key plank of this government's policy because they ditched it under Senator Wong when she was the Minister for Climate Change and Water in the last government and they promised not to introduce it here.


It is a monumental deception and they are trying to get it through by masquerading it as an environmental measure. I challenge Senator Farrell, who is speaking next, to describe very succinctly exactly what difference this carbon tax is going to make to global temperature or to the environment. They are words that you will never hear uttered. The answer to that—I am not sure Senator Farrell will have the courage to say it—is zero; it is zilch; it is absolutely nothing. It will make no cracker of differ­ence to the temperature or the environment.


The only thing it will affect will be the economy. It will put all Australian industry at a disadvantage. It will put Australian mums, dads, families and pensioners at a disadvantage because the sweetener will come but once. It will come but once and the tax will go on and on and on and it will get bigger and bigger and bigger until a coalition government is elected and this tax is removed. This is the great hoax that this government is putting forward. They say they are going to have a clean air policy, according to Senator Mark Bishop. We have a clean energy revolution going on. It is going to be every bit as fraudulent and every bit as false and every bit as misleading as all their other revolutions. (Time expired)

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (15:16):  We know all about Senator Bernardi and his approach to clean energy and carbon pricing. We know it because he is a well-known denier and sceptic on this issue. We know the role that he played in the Liberal Party with his mentor, former Senator Minchin who has now left the parliament, in the removal of Malcolm Turnbull, the former leader of the Liberal Party. We know why Senator Bernardi got involved in that. We know that it was the policy of the former leader Malcolm Turnbull—




Senator Bernardi:
  Kevin Rudd!




Senator FARRELL:
  No, we are talking about the Liberal Party now, Senator Bernardi. Don't get it confused; we are talking about the Liberal Party. We are talking about the policies of the former leader of the Liberal Party Malcolm Turnbull who was very clear on this issue. He was not a sceptic, like yourself. He was not a denier, like yourself. He understood the importance of clean energy and a clean environment.




Senator Cash:
  What about your role with Kevin Rudd?




Senator FARRELL:
  He understood why Australians needed to take some leadership on this issue, and it cost him his leadership because he was prepared to stick his neck out and say, 'We have to do something about this important issue.' When he did, Senator Bernardi had the knives out. And we have Senator Cash over there—I am not entirely sure how she voted in that ballot, but I think I can guess.

Senator FARRELL:

Senator Cash:
  What about you?




Senator FARRELL:
  I know the outcomes though, Senator Cash, and I know what the outcome was when Malcolm Turnbull, to his great credit, understood why Australia needs a clean carbon future. I have children and I hope one of these days to have grandchildren, and I want to give those children and those grandchildren the oppor­tunity of a clean energy future.




Senator Cash:
  I would like to give them a job!




Senator FARRELL:
  Well, let us talk about jobs. Senator Cash said, 'What economic achievements have we had in the last three years?' I will give you one, Senator Cash. What about when the rest of the world fell into recession? What did the Australian government do under the Labor Party? We kept Australians in jobs and our clean energy future is going to provide lots of young Australians with jobs. I can see Senator McEwen agreeing with me. I know she knows what I know about what is going on in South Australia. Let us look at just one area—geothermal.




Senator Bernardi:

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (15:28):  The Australian Labor Party does not know how to manage money. Even when the budget was bleeding with red ink back in May the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation were walking into television studio after television studio to talk about this surplus that we are going to have in 2012-13. The budget position has deteriorated dramatically since the mid-year economic and fiscal overview in November last year. The deficit, already one of the highest deficits on record, had deteriorated by another $8.5 billion in the couple of months between the mid-year economic and fiscal overview and the budget being delivered in May. The deficit had gone further down by $8½ billion. The deficit worsened by another $10 billion for the 2011-2012 financial year, to take us all the way up to $22.6 billion. So here was this government that wanted everyone to believe that 2012-13 was going to be the year that the Labor Party would finally achieve what they had not achieved since 1989-90, a surplus budget. But we have always been sceptical because this Australian Labor Party spends too much and borrows too much, and, of course, that is why they have to tax too much. This is a government which, in four out of four budgets, has delivered deficits. The last Labor Party surplus in government, here at the federal level, was, as I have mentioned, back in 1989-90.


The reason that this government ends up in this much of a mess is that they just do not know how to live within their means. When the minister for finance was under pressure because of this disastrous fiscal record under the Labor administration, she piped up and said, and this was in the lead-up to the last election, 'Hang on, we have made $83 billion worth of savings.'



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator CORMANN:
  Minister, I am happy to show you the transcript. You said it after the election and the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, said it just before the election and, of course, the Prime Minister has said it at various times as well. So '$83 billion worth of savings'—they were trying to make it look as if they had made some tough decisions. Given that '$83 billion worth of savings', everybody across Australia would think that the government had made some difficult decisions to cut spending. Guess what? Half of the money that was supposed to be in spending cuts was in fact new multibillion-dollar taxes or tax increases. This is a government that thinks that when they rack up a new tax they are actually saving money.


Let us take a step back. In the lead-up to the 2007 election the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, said that he was going to be an economic and fiscal conservative; he was going to be a mini John Howard. He was saying to the people of Australia, 'Don't you worry. I am going to look after the public finances. I am going to look after the economy in the same way that John Howard and Peter Costello did.' Then, in the first budget, taxes went up by $20 billion and spending went up by $15 billion. In that first budget, the 2008-09 budget, they still delivered a $27 billion deficit, followed by a $55 billion deficit, followed by a $50 billion deficit—and now we are on track for a $22.6 billion deficit this year. That is if we believe the budget papers, but the budget had a very significant omission.


When the government knew that they were going to introduce a carbon tax, they delivered a budget without including any information in relation to the carbon tax, a carbon tax which we were promised would not happen, a carbon tax which the govern­ment now says will start on 1 July 2012, a carbon tax which will raise about $25 billion over the forward estimates, a carbon tax which starts on the same day as the mining tax, a carbon tax which Minister Wong said, in media interviews at the time of the budget, would be broadly budget neutral. When we said, 'This budget isn't worth the paper it is written on as the revenue figures are wrong, the expenditure figures are wrong, the growth figures are wrong, the CPI figures are wrong and the jobs figures are wrong,' the minister said, 'Well, the carbon tax is going to be broadly budget neutral, so don't you worry.' Now we know what 'broadly budget neutral' means. We now know that, even after they introduce a multibillion-dollar new tax, even after they introduce a tax which will take $25 billion out of the Australian economy, the government's budget is going to be at least $4.3 billion worse off. But there is more, because Treasury officials admitted during the Senate carbon tax inquiry that the money to buy back the so-called dirty, coal-fired power stations was hidden in the contingency reserve—not over the forward estimates, but beyond the current forward estimates. So here we have a multibillion-dollar new tax which is going to leave our budget worse off over the forward estimates to the tune of $4.3 billion and beyond. And there is more.


The mining tax, according to Treasury modelling, will raise about $38½ billion over the next decade but, true to the form of this wasteful, high-spending, high-taxing, high-debt government, before they have even passed the tax laws through the parliament, before they have even started to collect the tax, they have already spent it. Not only have they already spent it; they have spent more.  So here they are wanting to collect $38.5 billion in mining tax revenue and they have made commitments which are conservatively estimated to cost about $57½ billion over the next decade. On its own the proposal by the government to increase compulsory superannuation to 12 per cent will cost $3.6 billion when it reaches that 12 per cent in 2019-20. That is a figure that was included in the government's own budget papers last year: $3.6 billion it will cost in 2019-20 and, of course, it is increasing from there. According to Treasury, in that same year the mining tax is expected to raise about $3 billion. Incidentally, 65 per cent of that mining tax revenue is to be collected in one single state, Western Australia. So here you have a government that comes in with one new ad hoc multibillion-dollar tax after the other and each one of them is leaving the budget in a worse position. You would think that, when you come in with a tax measure that increases the amount of revenue you collect, the purpose would be to get yourself out of the financial mess that you got yourself into by spending too much. But, no, instead of spending less and instead of taking advantage of all these taxes that they want to bring in to get themselves back into a surplus position, they actually end up in a worse position. In a paper they published in November last year, Treasury said that the budget was going to be in structural deficit until 2019-20. Since then, we have had the carbon tax, which is going to put the budget in a worse position, and we have had the mining tax, which is going to put the budget in a worse position. We also have this dodgy mining tax deal that the government negotiated exclusively and in secret with the three big mining companies, where, under pressure in the lead-up to the election, they promised them, without even having a conversation with state and territory governments about it, that they would credit all state and territory royalties. So now, every time state governments do what they are completely entitled to do under the Constitution—that is, make decisions about their royalty revenues, removing royalty concessions or increasing royalties as they see fit—it will be a hit on the federal budget, courtesy of a dodgy deal negotiated by this government.


The point of the argument here today is that this is a government that, very clearly, is already laying the foundations for preparing the Australian people for the fact that it will not be delivering a surplus budget in 2012-13. The government know that they have a bad track record when it comes to managing money. They know that the Australian people know that they have a bad track record when it comes to managing money. Labor keep talking about surpluses, but it is coalition governments that deliver surplus budgets. Ten out of 11 budgets under the last coalition government were surplus budgets. People across Australia know that after a couple of years of Labor in government it is time to get the coalition back into government to sort out the mess that Labor have created with their complete fiscal recklessness.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2011-08-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:38):  I rise to also contribute to the matter of public importance before the Senate today. Contrary to what Senator Cormann would have Australians believe from his contribution—a contribution, I might add, that was full of factually incorrect statements—the Labor govern­ment has a strong track record of proven economic management.


We have delivered strong economic management by shielding Australia from the worst impacts of the global financial crisis. We have been prudent in implementing a cap on new expenditure in our budgets. Our policies are fully costed, with appropriate savings delivered to offset any new expenditure and, despite the difficult economic circumstances we have faced as a nation, we remain on track to bring the budget back into surplus in 2012-13. It is clear we remain committed to fiscal responsibility, which I must say is in stark contrast to what we get from those opposite. Those opposite, led by Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey, have made blunder after blunder in opposition costings, from the black hole in their election commitments to their latest economic debacle, which centres on their $70 billion budget black hole. Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey have been running around announcing policies without maintaining fiscal responsibility, and now they find themselves in a situation where they need to find $70 billion of savings. What will Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey cut? Well might you ask. Where will they deliver their savings? Will they cut age, disability and veteran pensions? Will they cut Medicare? Will they cut education funding? Will they claw back tax cuts? I challenge the Liberals to tell us where these savings are going to come from. It is time for Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey to come clean with the Australian people about what services they plan on cutting.


While both Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey are looking at cutting services and perhaps pensions, they are split on the size of the black hole, even though Mr Robb seems to be able to count and has indicated on ABC AM that the figure is $70 billion. Mr Hockey says that the coalition need to identify $50 billion, $60 billion, $70 billion of savings that they will make. He is happily going from $50 billion to $70 billion as if we were talking about hundreds of dollars. Then we have Mr Abbott, who refutes that the figure is $70 billion, but we know that it is. We know that Mr Abbott is not interested in economics; he is not interested in balancing the budget. We know that because of the comments that he has made publicly. He continues to have thought bubbles as he roams the country on a massive scare campaign against the government's carbon tax. He is not interested in backing up what he says with any facts or substance.


So, while those opposite continue to make countless economic blunders, we on this side have had to deal with continuous conjecture and negativity surrounding the Australian economy, which is neither helpful nor accurate, to say the least. Senators in this place are aware of the wild swings in international finance markets. This has no doubt made people anxious about the state of the global economy. As the Treasurer, Mr Swan, rightly pointed out, cautioning against reading too much into short-term movements in the share market:


Just as a big gain in trading over a day or a couple of days doesn't mean the challenges faced by Europe and the United States have been solved, a big fall doesn't mean they're insurmountable either.


As the government have highlighted, it will take time for the European and United States economies to get their houses in order. They will have to make tough decisions to reduce their debt and ensure their budgets are sustainable. This will have an impact on the global economic outlook for some time. However, we should remember that in Australia the fundamentals of our economy remains strong in comparison to the rest of the world. Recently, the International Monetary Fund highlighted the fact that in Australia we have very low public debt, low unemployment and a massive pipeline of investment, and we expect to bring the budget back to surplus—although, as the Treasurer has highlighted, this task has been made much tougher by current global events. This government has a strong track record of economic management of the Australian economy. We can also look to our record during the global financial crisis. In a period when advanced economies around the world have been suffering from the largest global recession in over 70 years, the Australian economy has performed remarkably well. This is no coincidence. The strong performance of the Australian economy can be put down to the early decisive action taken by the Labor government. We injected short-term cash stimulus as well as medium- and long-term infrastructure spending to keep the Australian economy in strong shape. What did those opposite want us to do in those times of global financial crisis? They advocated the sit-on-your-hands and the wait-and-see approaches. They wanted to send the Australian economy down the gurgler, essentially abrogating their responsibility to protect and support the Australian economy. But the Labor government's decisive action, stimulus measures and sound fiscal management helped to cushion the Australian economy from the worst impacts of the global recession.


Whilst our economy has remained relatively strong during the GFC, this sum­mer's natural disasters have also impacted on our economy. Recently the full effects of the natural disasters were felt with the release of the national accounts for the March quarter. GDP fell 1.2 per cent in the quarter to be one per cent higher throughout the year. As the Treasurer outlined after the release of the negative GDP result, a period of weak growth was broadly expected after the devastating natural disasters. He said:


This weakness is likely to be followed by a strong rebound in the June quarter as the economic impacts of the disasters ease and reconstruction picks up.


However, the Treasurer has outlined that we remain on track to restoring the budget to surplus in 2012-13. Treasury has estimated the floods and cyclones will cost the econ­omy about $12 billion, with lost commodity production likely to be around $9 billion and crop damage more than $2 billion.


The Treasurer has also said that we expect to create another 500,000 jobs in the next couple of years. This is on top of 750,000 jobs we have already created since coming to office in 2007, including 189,000 in the last year alone. Whilst there was a slight increase in July to 5.1 per cent, fundamentally the strength of our labour force participation rate remains strong, especially in comparison to the rest of the world. The unemployment rate is 9.1 per cent in the United States, 7.2 per cent in Canada, 7.7 per cent in the United Kingdom, 9.7 per cent in France and 20.9 per cent in Spain. When we entered the global financial crisis, Australia's unemployment rate was the same as that of the United States. If that were still the case and we had the same unemployment levels as the US, around 9 per cent, then an extra 486,000 Australians would be out of work. Our swift action during the GFC has ensured that Australians have remained in work and that our economy is the envy of the rest of the developed world.


Let us look at some figures. Official interest rates are two full percentage points lower than when the Liberals lost office, currently 4.75 per cent compared to 6.75 per cent in November 2007. Our national government debt is low, currently 7.2 per cent of GDP or 10 times less than the United Kingdom at 75 per cent of GDP and the United states at 72 per cent of GDP. Wages are rising faster— (Time expired)

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2011-08-18,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:48):  Where do you start when you are talking about the Labor Party's track record on economic management? I think there is no better place than with Dr Kenneth Rogoff from Harvard University, who did an analysis of the increase in public sector debt since these luminaries attained government. The country that had the greatest increase in public sector debt was unsurprisingly Iceland. They have basically sunk into the North Atlantic. Ireland was No.2 and No.3 on the list of countries with the greatest proportional increases in public sector debt was Australia. Below us were other countries that we do not like to mention—Greece, Portugal, Spain and the United States. They were all below us on their proportional increase in public sector debt.


They tell us that they saved us from the recession. I will tell you why we did not go into recession. There are five main reasons. Let us go through them seriatim. There is a red rock called iron ore. We were getting an awful lot of money for it and selling a lot of it. Iron ore was the No.1 reason we did not go into recession. Then there is this black rock from our east coast called coal. We sold a lot that—record amount at a record price. That was the second reason we did not go into recession. Then there were the 31 March shipping figures for wheat. We do not like to talk about agriculture anymore, but the drought ended and record sales of wheat went through. There were two other reasons: a proportionally lower interest rate and a proportionally lower dollar. That is what saved Australia from recession.


Unless Mr Swan can convince the Australian people that buying a flat screen television somehow managed to dig up a tonne of iron ore and put it on a boat, or plant an acre of wheat, or export a tonne of coal, then their argument does not stand. What they did instead was burn down 194 houses with ceiling insulation. Maybe that was a slight stimulus to the building industry. They went on a manic spree of building school halls. I thought that after these school halls were built my daughters would come home speaking French or Latin—Je ne sais pas; pardon monsieur; je ne comprends pas—but they are still speaking the same language I sent them to school with. It did not really stimulate their thinking much; it just gave a whole range of people, such as Reed Constructions, a great ability to rip the Australian people off.


The Labor Party believe in catastrophic climate change, but they do not seem to take into account catastrophic economic change, which is far more predictable. In fact, we were talking about this before the first financial crisis. We had clarion calls from William White of the Bank for International Settlements saying, 'Watch out guys; we are starting to have a few problems with interbank liquidity.' He was saying that prior to the first so-called GFC. We had Dr Paul Woolley talking about financial market dysfunctionality because of the overexten­sion in derivatives. The luminaries of the time, the Tanners and the Swans, were just completely ignoring it. Then it is always a surprise and a wonder when something happens. If you want to understand Mr Swan, it is very simple: half of Wayne Maxwell Swan's life is a promise and the other half of Wayne Maxwell Swan's life is an excuse. You just have to work out which day it is: is it a promise or is it an excuse. It is always one of them.


Let us go through some of his promises. I remember back in the election campaign of 2010 when Mr Speers from Sky was talking to the Prime Minister about what happens if a surplus does not happen. This was what the Prime Minister said: 'Well, failure is not an option here and we won't fail.' The host said: 'But in the event it is not achieved, perhaps it is not achieved, what will you do?' The Prime Minister replied: 'Failure is not an option here. The budget will be in surplus in 2013.' Lately it has been turned into an objective. I wonder how I would say that to my children: 'I was going to feed you tonight—that was a promise, now it's an objective,' or 'I was going to go to work tomorrow—that was a promise, now it's a target as I'm thinking about going to work.' This is the sort of position we have. The Prime Minister, post the 2010 election, said: 


I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. I agree with him that Australians do deserve a Treasurer with a steady hand, and they have one. They have a Treasurer who has delivered a budget that will return the budget to surplus in 2012-13 exactly as promised.


Promises, promises, promises—don't you love it. And now we have excuses, excuses, excuses.


Now to give the backdown. Last Friday, Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister of Australia said:


It makes the challenge of bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13 more difficult. But it is certainly our objective to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13 and we expect to achieve that.


Mr Swan said:


Well, it's far too early to make any conclusions, but we will be affected—markets are affected, budgets are affected. But we're committed to bringing our budget back to surplus …


Now it is a 'commitment'. Even Minister Wong said:


There's really only one set of numbers I'm worried about, and that's making sure we get back into surplus by 2012-13 and that's what this budget will do.


She is here today, so it will be interesting to hear from her whether that was a categorical guarantee.


I live in wonder about some guarantees. Remember the war against obesity? What happened to that? Did we win that war? Have we now smote the fat people? Have they gone? No, we lost. We did not seem to win that war. Then the war on Fuelwatch. What happened to that voyeuristic episode? Did we deal with that problem? No, fuel still went up. Then there was the toolbox for the 21st century—remember Kevin Rudd saying, 'This is the toolbox for the 21st century. Every kiddie's got to have one'? What happened to that? Well, they did not get it. They are still waiting. We got half the toolboxes for twice the price. It just goes on and on. The Building the Education Revo­lution was just incredible. The takeover of the hospital system—did we take over the hospital system or is the hospital still winning? Who is winning that fight? Who has taken over the hospital system? And the latest one is: 'She has full confidence in Craig Thomson.' It is incredible. It is quite a mess and it relates exactly to your economic plan.


They had a temporary extension of their debt. We had a $75 billion gross debt. They always like to talk to you about net debt; they will never talk to you about the actual debt. They have this mystical number which they can never actually tell you how they get to. They can never actually give you the numbers. It is out there like the Yowie or the Abominable Snowman. It is one of those things that is out there but which you can never get a photo of. You can never quite get to it. It is not as definitive as Craig Thoms­on's signature. It is out there but it is going to come back some day.


What exactly do we have here? They had a temporary increase in their limit from $75 billion to $200 billion because China was going to go into recession. That is what they said. China did not go into recession, but our debt went from a temporary increase of $200 billion to a permanent increase in our overdraft of a quarter of a trillion dollars, because Australia does not want to feel left out. We want to start talking about out debt in portions of a trillion too. It is only fair and reasonable. That is the sort of thing that the Labor Party wants to do to you. They want to be there with the rest of the world. They want to catch up with them on climate change and catch up with them on debt. They want to make sure that we achieve that objective.


Even in the last speech from Senator Carol Brown she said that it was an issue of no confidence. She had to be corrected by Senator Polley, who walked over and said, 'Don't say the words ""no confidence""; I don't think that's quite appropriate at this point in time.' Of course it should not be 'no confidence', it should be 'no competence'.




Senator Polley:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I would like to take exception to being verballed by the senator when in fact I did not have a conversation with Senator Brown.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senator Polley, that is not a point of order. You will have the opportunity to correct that when you give your speech. There is no point of order.




Senator JOYCE:
  It should have been an issue of no competence. Australia has absolutely no confidence in your competence. That is the issue we are at at the moment. Every time I want to have a bit of a giggle I just go back to projections that you put forward in 2008-09. That was before the North Atlantic global financial crisis. China kept buying our stuff and so did India, so they kept it going on. They predicted that we would have a $21 billion surplus in 2008-09, but we actually ended up with a $27 billion deficit. Then the year after that they predicted a $19.7 billion surplus and we got $57.8 billion—the biggest deficit Australia has ever had in its history. Hooray, we got there, and it only took you a couple of years to do it. Then the year after that there was a $49.4 billion deficit, the second biggest, then a $22.6 billion deficit. They are incredible no matter what they do. They talk about 'return to surplus within the cycle', but the cycle for the Labor Party goes for centuries. It just never stops. The cycle starts getting bad and then it gets worse. Then there is always the promise out there in the sunny plateaus, the sunny outlands, where it will all get better. But now we are left with a resounding success that our finance minister, formerly the minister for climate change—and remember the greatest moral challenge of our time— (Time expired)

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2011-08-18,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:59):  What an embarrassment! No wonder they got rid of you as the shadow spokesperson. It is very easy to come into the chamber and try and verbal people and make things up as you go. You are getting to be quite experienced at that. Let us look at this matter of public importance:


The Gillard Government's continuing inability to balance the budget and wavering commitment to achieving a budget surplus in 2012/2013.


Let us look at the people who have put up this matter of public importance. On 19 August 2010, in the Australian:


National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling identifying a $377 million hole in the Coalition's Education Tax Refund policy.


The rot had started. Once again, in the Australian, the newspaper that the coalition used to decide their MPIs about the carbon price:


Abbott's plan would use taxpayer dollars to pay for government to fund industry to lower its emissions. The Gillard scheme taxes industry to give it a price incentive to change its ways and, to the extent it can't or won't, funnels much of the revenue from the carbon tax back to the public (lower- and middle-income earners) through tax cuts to compensate for expected price rises.


The significance of achieving this target should not be underestimated for the clarity it brings to why the scheme of Labor is better than that of the coalition. I quote:


It is a two-horse race, and when it comes to doing something about climate change—


the coalition horse is lame. The Australian continued:


Abbott's response to Labor's package is a bundle of contradictions. He'll have significant tax cuts of his own we are told, just without the carbon tax which pays for them. He scoffs at the value of a 5 per cent emissions reduction target by 2020, even though the target is bipartisan and underpins Coalition climate change policy.


And yet we have this MPI. Then we had Joe Hockey at the Press Club with an extra­ordinary performance. The Sydney Morning Herald noted:


Mr Hockey repeatedly stumbled over claims he miscalculated spending savings simply respond­ing that 'they were right at some point in time'.


These are the people that bring this MPI into this place. The Sydney Morning Herald went on:


... the Opposition has said it would be able to return the Budget to a surplus early by imposing tougher cuts on spending, and has accused the Government of not being vigorous enough in the economic statement released last Tuesday.


There is more:


… part of the $52 billion the Coalition had said it would cut from spending included $1.7 billion from Labor's proposed company tax cuts, which were to be funded by a higher mining tax.


What was the problem with that? The coalition would not proceed with the mining tax. Give me a break. Then we have the Victorian Premier helping you out. He is someone who in 2008 said:


We support an emission capping and trading scheme as the least costly way of responding to global warming.


The modelling commissioned by Mr Baillieu deliberately phrases results in a negative way such as the 23,000 jobs being 'lost'. It is a pity the modelling did not include key assist­ance measures under the plan of the Gillard government for a clean energy future with assistance to nine out of 10 families and industries across Australia. Talk about political expediency being more important than economic honesty. The list of economic incompetence is endless, but there is a limit to my time so I will not mention the $70 billion black hole that needs to be corrected before the coalition can even get back to zero.


Mr Deputy President, when can you recall the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, saying the surplus was in doubt? I do not and I cannot recall any comment from Senator Penny Wong suggesting that there was anything other than a solid commitment to returning the economy to surplus. So where does the concern about wavering come from? Maybe it comes from the attitude of the coalition to coal seam gas exploration, mental health funding, the complete lack of counting skills that we have seen since the last election and which butcher to visit. 


Numerous media outlets have reported on the favourable IMF outlook on the Australian economy. Even the Wall Street Journal helped out, noting:


During last year's election campaign, Labor promised to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13 in a push to underline its claim to conservative economic management. It has continued to insist the promise is iron-clad.


Yesterday, the Treasurer said the IMF had offered a ""resounding endorsement"" of Labor's economic policy, confirming that the nation's outlook remained strong, despite renewed fragility in the global economy.


The IMF commends the government's fiscal strategy to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13 despite the impact of natural disasters, highlight­ing that Australia's fiscal consolidation is 'faster than in many other advanced economies and is more ambitious than earlier envisaged' …


Other IMF comments include:


Australian economy forecasts


Following natural disasters at the beginning of the year activity is expected to bounce back in the second quarter.


Forecast for real GDP growth of 2% for calendar year 2011


3.5% for calendar year of 2012 stemming from commodities and private investment in mining and liquefied natural gas


Unemployment forecast to remain below 5% in 2011 and 2012


I note already around 750,000 jobs have been created since we have come to office, and nearly 190,000 jobs in the last year alone, with more than nine out of the 10 jobs created in the last 12 months being full-time jobs. The IMF suggests a strong position to adjust:


There is ample scope to cut the interest rates and provide liquidity support for banks in the event that global financial markets become severely disrupted. 


The important thing is to recognise how much stronger our economy is. We have avoided recession, giving us very strong public finances and very low debt; low unemployment at around half the level of the US; a massive pipeline of investment, particularly in resources; strong financial institutions and world-class regulators; and a well-functioning government. Just taking the last comment of 'a well functioning govern­ment', who do we believe: the IMF or Malcolm Turnbull telling SBS that Australia is run by a 'dysfunctional and chaotic government'? I suspect Malcolm is getting confused with the party with whom he sometimes associates himself. Australia's net debt will peak at 7.2 per cent of GDP in 2011-12. If you look around the world, you see the USA with 86 per cent in 2016; Japan, 164 per cent in 2018; the UK, 80 per cent in 2013; Canada, 36 per cent in 2013; France, 82 per cent in 2013; Italy, 101 per cent in 2011; and Germany, 55 per cent in 2012. You only have to look at the powerhouses of Europe, Germany and France, to realise how well Australia is performing compared with the last Howard government, the highest taxing government in Australia's history. And what did they do for Australian families? They did nothing.


Labor has provided numerous new jobs, childcare assistance and paid maternity leave. We reformed health funding. We have provided education support. We have developed plans for aged care, disability support, mental health assistance—and the list goes on and on.




Senator Sherry:
  Increased the age pension.




Senator POLLEY:
  And we increased the pension; that is right. And who is the biggest threat to the Australian pensioners? Those people on the other side, because they have a track record. When we talk about reform of the aged-care sector, who is the biggest threat to the aged-care sector in this country? Those opposite. When you were last in government you had 11½ very long years, as far as older Australians were concerned, to do something about the aged-care sector, and you did nothing. No, sorry; I correct the record. You did do something. You had six ministers, and each one of them failed the Australian people. Each one of those six ministers failed older Australians, and the people will not forget that. Your track record in terms of reforming the aged-care sector and disabilities is on your head. When you were in government you had 11½ years and did nothing.


But this government has been creative. We are a forward-thinking, progressive government. You just have to compare that with those on the other side, who are only about negatives: no, no, no. That is the mantra of Tony Abbott: no, no, no; oppose, oppose, oppose. I refute this MPI because it is a disgrace for those opposite to even come into this chamber and suggest it.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2011-08-18,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (16:09):  Earlier this week, when I represented the Leader of the Opposition at the state funeral of the former member for Melbourne Ports, Clyde Holding, I had the opportunity to meet two former Labor prime ministers, Paul Keating and Bob Hawke. It is pretty appro­priate to remember that today. We on this side have always been quite generous about some of the things that the Hawke govern­ment did in the late 1980s, particularly around fiscal consolidation. We have been generous about that—a generosity of spirit that I note the Labor Party have never shown. But—their intellectual dishonesty put to one side—meeting those two former Labor prime ministers reminded me just how much of a pale shadow of the Labor Party these people are.


As opposed to the government that undertook fiscal consolidation after the banana republic comments of the then Treasurer, this is now the party of the inflation genie. After it came to office, we somehow had to tackle a screaming inflation genie that had got out of the bottle. It was the party that before the election said, 'This reckless spending must stop.' If only this government had lived up to those words. It has not. This government has demonstrated in four years that it is utterly incapable of managing this nation's finances.


I will not recount all the figures that have been outlined so effectively by my colleagues Senator Cormann and Senator Joyce. But there is the simple one, the $20 billion surplus that has turned into tens of billions of dollars of endless deficits. There is the myth that the government somehow saved or created some jobs. It is the Keynesian delusion that you can actually create jobs through simply pumping money into the economy, a delusion rooted in how you put the country into recession 20 years ago. You came out of that with the view that, when faced with a downturn, you should, as the Secretary to the Treasury famously said, 'Go early, go hard and go households.' But we know from evidence all around the world, particularly in the United States, as we are seeing now—Senator Polley, you quoted it at such length—that when the government pumps money into an economy it does not create jobs; it simply increases future taxation by driving the budget into deficit. It builds inflationary pressures in the economy because serious structural reform is not achieved by just pumping money into people's hands.


Even more importantly, there has never been an analysis of those alleged 200,000 jobs you saved or created—I get my terminology wrong because the numbers keep changing. There is some analysis around at the moment that shows it works out at nearly half a million dollars a job. How is it worth the taxpayers of Australia paying interest now and having higher taxation than they should in the future in order to save jobs at that cost—it is an assertion that we reject, but just using those numbers shows how ridiculous that claim is—rather than benefiting from what should have been done in order to address the global financial challenges, which was to cut taxes? Because we know now, from evidence all around the world, that when you give people a one-off payment, particularly when it drives a budget into deficit, you do not actually change their behaviour. We know that a lot of that money was used to save or to pay down debt. Some of it was even put into the pokies. But it was not actually used to do what the government claims it was.


Most importantly, this government did that because it wanted to direct the handouts and the projects, and that is the core of the problem: it wants to direct where the money goes. It wants to direct what people do with their money. It does not actually want to give people the choice to invest, to spend their own money as they see fit, absent of government control, because the desire for patronage is at the core of this government. We saw it in other programs it proposed. Does anyone hear of the Ruddbank anymore, a bank that was going to expose Australians to tens of billions of dollars of risk in order to prop up a commercial construction industry? Some might say that the govern­ment was blinkered by being held captive by the CFMEU and the various building unions. Do we hear of the billions of dollars that were poured into the car industry, another highly unionised industry?


This is the core of the problem. Labor has always been about patronage. People know, when the government drives the budget into deficit to send them a little cheque, that after it wastes all the other money, that bill is going to come due. That is what drives people's behaviour, particularly when we had the rhetoric saying that the sky was going to fall in on the Australian economy—because this current Treasurer is incapable of taking responsibility, and over there you know it as well as I do, senators on the government side. This Treasurer is incapable of taking responsibility for the government's decisions, because there is always an excuse. At the start it was the inflation genie. You threatened an incredible budget that was going to pull back all the reckless spending. Then, when you did not do that, you had to run around the country scaring the wits out of every household and small business in order to justify your tens of billions of dollars of wasteful spending.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator RYAN:
  Senator Polley calls me outrageous. The truth is outrageous here, Senator Polley, because that is what your government has done—it has forced up taxes for every future Australian taxpayer.


I want to turn to this myth, this issue they keep talking about, with respect to net debt. When this government counts the net debt, as it appropriately does in the budget, it does so in a table that talks about net financial worth. The $74 billion Future Fund was created and dedicated to fund the liabilities for Commonwealth public sector super­annuation. What the government wants to do is to take that and count it twice. It says, 'Let's look at the gross debt and subtract the Future Fund and a few other things to come up with the net debt figure.' But you are counting it twice because we still have the liability. It is not debt but it is a government liability and a taxpayer liability. You still have the $120-odd billion of superannuation liabilities and you are effectively trying to count the Future Fund twice. The other assets of the Commonwealth are not necessarily able to be liquidated, unless someone is proposing we liquidate the Commonwealth of Australia. You are trying to count the Future Fund twice in order to reduce the figure of the debt you have imposed on future Australians.


The cost of the debt this financial year is $12 billion in annual interest payments. Let us just put that in context. That $12 billion would remove their excuse for trying to strip private health insurance rebates from millions of Australians. Secondly, it would pay for a national disability insurance scheme. Those two measures alone would be funded if this government had not racked up such extraordinary levels of debt—and not only that but it also means higher taxes in the future.


This government falsely compares Australia to our neighbours and economic competitors, as if having a neighbour who owes more money than you is somehow a defence to the bank manager. The truth is, as we saw during the global financial crisis, we need a strong public sector to support the capital needs of this country. We have always been a serious and large importer of capital and our banks, which are substantial borrowers in wholesale funds markets overseas, need the strong public debt position of the Commonwealth in order to support those funding needs.


This government talks about savings. The problem is that two-thirds of its savings actually come from increased tax imposts. We have a mining tax based on taxing iron ore, of which a former Labor minister for finance himself wrote that 'there is rarely if ever any economic rent in iron ore.' That was Peter Walsh, another ghost of Labor's past who would hang his head in shame when he looks at this government. Real tax reform does not increase the size of the state. This government may claim it is a lower taxing government, but it does not count if you are not collecting the taxes. What counts is what you spend. Every dollar this government does not collect in tax to fund its voracious spending is money that has to be paid by future Australian taxpayers.


We also have the flawed analysis that it is okay because debt is only seven per cent of GDP, as if GDP, every domestic dollar earned by the private and public sectors in this country, is somehow available for the government. The idea that we should measure ourselves on the basis of what the government could theoretically tax—every single dollar in the economy—is flawed. We are seeing that now in the countries of Europe and North America, and particularly western Europe and the United States, who for so long have rested easy in the delusion that they can keep increasing their public sector debt and measure it against a growing GDP. For some of those countries it is mathematically impossible for them to pay back their debt. I have seen an analysis of Ireland that shows Ireland can almost never pay back its debt because it can barely service the interest upon the debt that it recently took on. This government does not understand what it means to balance the budget over the economic cycle, other than the political cycle. The political cycle is that the ALP runs deficits and the coalition runs surpluses.



We had a promise to run a surplus of one per cent of the Commonwealth budget, which has grown from $260 billion to $350 billion in four years. They promised, years out, a one per cent surplus. It suddenly became an aspiration, and very soon it will simply be another excuse. This party cannot manage our finances. Its contrived and confected empathy will be like a mythical surplus.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (16:19): I would like to begin my contribution by acknowledging the courage of Senator Cormann in proposing a matter of public importance on budget surpluses. There he is, from the insecurity of a huge jerry-built glasshouse, daring to hurl some very small pebbles at the government. But, fortunately for Senator Cormann, he has a hide that really makes that of the average rhinoceros look wafer thin. Fortunately for him, he does not mind being accused of exaggeration, distortion and humbug. He likes being the fall guy for the opposition. He does not mind being a patsy for boldly going where no Liberal senator has been before and, I suspect, none are likely to go in the future.


Why did he do it? Why did he propose this matter of public importance? I do not know, but I would sincerely like to thank him for giving me the opportunity this afternoon to compare the economic credibil­ity of the government with that of the oppo­sition. After they have been exposed for their 2010 election costings black hole, which of course is a well-known debacle, this week we have a $70 billion black hole which threatens to swallow up an entire govern­ment department—the department of climate change—and 20,000 Commonwealth public servants along with it. The mantra of the opposition is that it will save more, spend less and deliver bigger budget surpluses. I think we know now that the opposition suffers from congenital innumeracy, so I think it is worth while having a closer look at this $70 billion black hole. Thirty seven billion dollars of it is in spending commit­ments the opposition announced in the 2010 election campaign, including $11 billion from the unwinding of the minerals resource rent tax. Then there is another $27 billion from the unwinding of the carbon tax. Finally, there is just a mere $7 billion or $8 billion to fund the income tax cuts that they promised. These are Mr Hockey and Mr Robb's figures; they are not mine. This is what Mr Hockey and Mr Robb have been telling their own colleagues they need to find in savings.


What will this $70 billion in savings actually mean? The Prime Minister and ministers in the government have been very clear: it will mean stopping Medicare pay­ments for four years; it will mean stopping the age pension for two years; it will mean stopping assistance to people with disa­bilities for three years; and it will mean stopping the family tax benefit payments for three years.


With the recent events in the global economy, it is obvious that Australia needs a steady hand on the tiller. The last thing we need are gigantic blank cheques and gigantic black holes from the opposition. The govern­ment's economic management has positioned Australia as one of the strongest, if not the strongest, economy in the developed world. Action taken by this government during the global financial crisis meant that we emerged from the global recession with strong growth, low unemploy­ment and solid public finances. Our economic stimulus package provided much-needed confidence at the time. It supported growth and protected jobs and it protected businesses as well. Because of this govern­ment's stimulus, Australia has emerged as virtually the only advanced economy to avoid recession and with a fiscal position that is the envy of the developed world. We have lower debt than other major developed economies, with the public net debt expected to peak at around one-tenth of that of other major developed economies.


The government has a clear path to bring the budget back to surplus well ahead of many comparable countries. Australia is one of only 14 major countries to have a AAA credit rating from the international rating agency Standard and Poor's. The government has been consistent and effective in imple­menting its fiscal strategy, constraining spending growth and putting in place responsible savings. That strategy has been endorsed by international rating agencies and the international community. In their article IV concluding statement released earlier this month, the IMF said this about the govern­ment's budget:


On fiscal policy, we commend the authorities for remaining committed to returning the Common­wealth budget to surplus by 2012/13 ... This consolidation is faster than in many other advanced economies and is more ambitious than earlier envisaged ...


The international credit rating agency Moody's on 11 May this year said:


Moody's notes that Australia's government debt remains among the lowest of all AAA-rated governments.


Rating agency Standard and Poor's said that Australia has exceptionally strong public sector finances, underpinned by low public debt and strong fiscal discipline. But I always think in these matters of public importance the final word should go to the Liberal Party. A coalition MP was reported as saying after this year's budget reply:


We can’t keep agreeing with government spending measures opposing savings and revenue measures and keep our financial credibility intact.


Unfortunately, that was an anonymous Liberal Party MP, but Senator Cormann and the others who have spoken in the debate know who it is, as I know who it is—just check the Adelaide Advertiser of 28 May this year. Then Senator Minchin, whom I know you respect very much, Mr Deputy President, and who was quite a hero to so many opposition senators, in his own newsletter of July this year said, 'If you err on the side of populism that is ultimately self-defeating because you end up standing for nothing.' Both the anonymous Liberal MP and Senator Minchin of course were right. I think Senator Cormann, the other Liberal senators and Senator Joyce from the National Party should take note of what their colleagues have said. I think that, really, Senator Fifield, who submitted this matter of public interest, and Senator Cormann, who proposed it to the Senate, should stop wasting the Senate's time on these matters. I stand by the economic credibility of the government and I believe that the facts on this speak for themselves.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (16:32):  Obviously these were amendments under debate immediately prior to question time and we heard from the minister immediately prior to question time. Unfortunately what we heard from Minister Ludwig was one of those wonderful contri­butions that goes something along the lines of, 'Trust us, we will work it out a little bit later.' This was basically his contribution in a nutshell: 'Yes, we are having discussions. We acknowledge there is a problem that needs to be addressed. We are working to find a way to address it'—the minister suggested it might take about a month to come up with that solution—'but we would be most appreciative if you would pass the bill in the meantime.' Unfortunately the 'Trust us, we'll fix it later' approach to government is something that we have come to be extraordinarily wary of when it comes to this government. We do not think that they can be trusted to sort things out later. Senator Xenophon and the coalition have worked together to put forward amendments to deal with issues particularly faced by the landfill gas sector because we want to know that there is going to be a solution. We also want to know that that solution will be in cast iron terms and acceptable, to make sure that we do not have the type of perverse outcomes that we have talked about previously.


As I highlighted with a prior amendment, this amendment is one that particularly relates to the flow-on effects of the cessation of operation of the New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme and how the Carbon Farming Initiative provides a capacity to pick up from there when that scheme ceases operation. The GGAS has driven landfill gas collection and CO2 abate­ment from the waste sector quite effectively. The electricity generation projects built under that scheme, as well as under the Commonwealth's Greenhouse Friendly scheme, have been reliant upon income from offset credits. GGAS will cease at the point of a carbon price coming in and we are advised that without that type of credit support a number of these projects have the potential to become quite unviable. That is why we think that it is so important that we make sure that the viability of these projects is guaranteed and that they are secured for the future, wherever they are.


The Carbon Farming Initiative, as proposed by the government, could be a possible solution to this but unfortunately it is currently not. It does not do enough to ensure that those who went in early and did their best to capture emissions and do something constructive with them by generating electricity are not disadvantaged. We do not want to end up with the perverse outcome of having a government implement­ing a scheme that is designed and intended to ensure that we get a growth in emission abatement activities, but instead we risk seeing the possibility that the early mover advantage is lost and they cease those abatement activities. The Carbon Farming Initiative offset credits could and should be used in lieu of the credits that these schemes have previously relied upon. That is what we would hope to achieve out of the amend­ments that Senator Xenophon and the coalition have pursued. GGAS landfill projects are not, of course, specifically identified on the positive list, and a number of them are required to collect some gas, under their EPA licences, for odour control and safety. Under the bill as it is proposed, projects must be on the positive list, or not be required by law, and may have a baseline applied. Industry is concerned that this creates uncertainty, given questions as to how much gas must be collected by law, about whether they may in fact be excluded from the CFI and, if not, what the accepted baseline is that will be applied. We have attempted to address those issues in the amendments that have been put forward. To resolve this, it has been suggested that these landfill gas projects be added, with a standardised baseline to cover off these issues, so that they can continue with some certainty and continue to operate commercially and effectively.


The landfill gas industry is important and it is significant. In 2009, waste in landfills generated total emissions of 15½ million-plus tonnes of CO2 equivalent, of which around 4½ million were recovered. That is a good, positive effect and it shows a baseline around 29 per cent. However, industry is concerned about whether that is a fair or effective indication of common practice, especially because a large proportion of the abatement was due to GGAS and GHF landfill gas projects. Those GGAS landfill gas projects, I am advised, accounted for abatement of around 3.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, or more than 20 per cent of landfill emissions in 2009. It has been estimated that GHF, Greenhouse Friendly, landfill gas projects accounted for abatement of around 700,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. So when you take out the GGAS and GHF, Greenhouse Friendly, projects the raw baseline number of existing activity is reduced to below five per cent, on these sums.


The industry concede they do not see that as a realistic baseline and acknowledge that some abatement that would have occurred from these other incentive schemes would have occurred in any event for other reasons. They argue that a 10 per cent national baseline for GGAS landfill projects would be realistic. We have set out some figures in these amendments that set dual standards dealing with the different schemes that have been in operation to date. Given the proven nature of the technology involved here and the activities that are underway, and given of course the reliability of the existing schemes and the manner in which they have been built up—they have been voluntarily entered into and have had significant investments made in them; not unreasonably, as a result of the incentives that were there—it is important to make sure that they are accommodated under the Carbon Farming Initiative. I know the minister gave some assurances that they would be but, as I said before, assurances, promises and 'she'll be right, mate' type commitments do not quite cut it anymore. We want to know that there is an agreement in place that provides certainty for these facilities, whether they are the facilities in Bendigo or Ballarat, the facilities in Tweed shire or Newcastle, or the facility in Launceston—facilities, I am told, that could be jeopardised if we get this wrong. From those landfill sites we would then see increased emissions escaping and have the perverse outcome that in passing this and getting it wrong we have actually increased emissions in parts of the economy. That would make absolutely no sense to anybody. I think everybody in the chamber who has spoken on this to date has agreed that that type of outcome would make no sense. Senator Xenophon and the coalition are attempting to prescribe a solution to ensure that that would not be the case. We think that getting a solution in the legislation in the here and now is the best way to take this forward.


We are pleased that Senator Milne and the Greens have acknowledged that there needs to be a solution and we are pleased that the government have acknowledged that there needs to be a solution. The concern, though, is that the government have to date failed to provide any reassurance to the parliament on what that solution will be and how it will be applied and, importantly, failed to provide reassurance to industry to make sure they are confident in and comfortable about the manner in which this will move ahead.


So I would leave the challenge there for the minister. We would hope to get something far more certain than the words he uttered before question time on this matter. If we do not, we will certainly be persevering with this amendment. Obviously, unless we proceed very quickly through this, he will have at least an extra couple of days to come up with something that provides all parties—and I would trust that Senator Xenophon and the Greens feel likewise—with a lot more confidence that a solution is there than what he has said to date.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:44):  Earlier today, in making my contribution on this amendment and acknowledging the problem that we had, I indicated that I would be taking a watching brief according to what has been negotiated in discussions between all parties, with the Greens talking to the LNC, Senator Xenophon and the govern­ment. I have had further meetings in relation to this and I am now satisfied that there will be an outcome within a month that will set an appropriate baseline that is fair and takes into account what would have occurred otherwise and what can genuinely be regarded as additional. I am satisfied that we will get to that outcome within a month to the satisfaction of all parties. The sooner that can happen the better for all parties concer­ned. I thank the industry across Australia for having drawn the attention of the Senate to what could have been a perverse or bad outcome. That is one of the good things about having a community engaged with legislation as it goes through—you can actually get to address some of these issues.


One of the main concerns I have about the amendment is the impact on the integrity of the DOIC as it has been established. The whole point here was to have an independent and rigorous assessment of methodologies and have a body that can come up with baselines and methodologies for the kinds of numbers that we come up with that are rigorous and can be defended in any fora, both domestic and global. I want to make sure that we do not have political direction of the DOIC which would undermine at the start the very idea of having an independent integrity commission.


At the same time I want to make sure that there would not be job losses or the closing down of facilities that are assisting us in reducing our emissions across Australia. I indicate to the Senate that the Greens will be opposing this amendment for that reason. I am satisfied that we have now reached a conclusion that will be satisfactory to all parties. I also put on the record that if a resolution of this issue does not occur in the next four weeks to the satisfaction of all parties, we will be discussing it again.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:47):  I am grateful for Senator Milne's contribution and also for her intervention. She has taken a keen interest in trying to get a resolution to this carbon emissions matter. I agree with the sentiments of what she is saying. If this amendment is lost—it is not a criticism of the government in any way—I worry about what remedy there is if there is an unsatisfactory solution. That is a genuine question. If the amendment is lost, what recourse can LMS, and other entities that have been doing good work on greenhouse gas abatement over many years, have? What are they left with? I accept from the minister that the negotiations are proceeding with goodwill but I am concerned that, in the absence of a legislative framework, these entities are vulnerable. They have done the right thing.


It is worth reflecting on recommendation No.1 of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee into this Carbon Farming Initiative legislation. Paragraph 2.36 states very clearly:


The committee recommends the government consider options to ensure there are no perverse incentives to cease existing abatement projects, and encourage first movers to undertake further abatement or sequestration activities under the Carbon Farming Initiative.


The devil is in the detail. If a formula is not set by legislation, which is my preferred outcome and that of my co-sponsor, my colleague Senator Birmingham—we moved this jointly, with Senator Birmingham doing so on behalf of the opposition—then we will have some difficulty. It is regrettable that it has had to come to this, that an amendment had to be introduced, but Senator Milne took a very active and laudable role in trying to deal with this matter and that was most welcome. I know this sector is very grateful for Senator Milne's interest and intervention but it is still not quite resolved, and that makes me very nervous. That is why it is important to proceed with this amendment.


If this amendment is defeated—it appears the numbers are not here to pass it—what recourse will there be if there is a stumbling block in negotiations? Secondly, as I understand it, there are some figures that are toing and froing on baselines. I know that negotiations have been taking place with goodwill on the part of the department and the minister's office and the industry sector, but what safeguards are there if there is a breakdown in negotiations? Are we back to square one and back to the uncertainty? These are businesses that need to look at their financing or refinancing, and the uncertaity would be a significant factor in their long-term commercial survival. Despite the fact that I accept everyone's goodwill on this issue, I wonder how we deal with that conundrum,?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (16:50):  I will go back to what I said originally about this matter. It is important to maintain the integrity of the system. Senator Milne said it in a perhaps shorter way than I am about to, but this amendment seeks to take things outside the available procedures that have been established to make sure that in an international setting those people who look at the integrity of the system see that it is not compromised. 


This amendment avoids the methodology; it avoids having an independent assessment. It puts in a specific clause that would open up the ability for others to come along and say, 'We have our own specific circum­stances and we therefore want a legislative solution. We want the same as the landfill industry.' You open up the integrity and put it in jeopardy. Secondly, dealing with what I think Senator Xenophon talked about, this is not a negotiation. It is very important to keep that in mind—it is not a negotiation.




Senator Xenophon:
  It is.




Senator LUDWIG:
  It is not a negotiation; it is an evidence based way of gaining what the baseline would be. So you do not sit in a room, as with industrial relations, and bargain about what the baseline should or should not be. It is about an evidence based outcome. Why? Because internationally we want to maintain the integrity of the system. To do that there has to be an independent assessment. It has to be evidence based and the methodology has to be followed. That is why we do not support a separate individual amendment dealing with one industry which then bypasses that. You would want them to go through and develop the methodologies—evidence based metho­dologies—and have the independent assess­ment to ensure the integrity of the system so that where it lands it is supported by the evidence.


Ultimately it is a legislative instrument and if people disagree with it, it will come back here as a legislative instrument. We all know that, if the legislative instruments get it right, they generally go through this place. If they do not then there is an opportunity for those people to disallow the instruments in the Senate if they do not think they got it right. That does mean, however, that if it is disallowed it will have to go back through the process again. But that is what people can decide to choose in the Senate—it is always an option available to us. So it is much better to deal with it in that way than to simply mandate through what is ultimately an amendment to the bill, which would then be an amendment to the act, which is specific and about only one industry. It then goes around the actual integrity of the system. So what you are doing in one fell swoop is making sure that the bill itself, if it were to be passed with this amendment, would already have a hole in it; it would have a landfill—it would make sure that it would be criticised for not being able to stand up to scrutiny and not having an independent process to assess each of the methodologies. So to deal with Senator Xenophon's issue around negotiation, it is consultation, sure; but it is evidence based to arrive at appro­priate, researched figures which are backed up by the evidence. So it is not a bargain. 


Lastly, to deal with the issue of ensuring that everybody got it right—it is a legislative instrument; people can decide in here that they did not get it right and make their own judgments about that. But first and foremost it is, with the best of government intention, designed to solve this in a very short space in time—because we do recognise there is an issue that needs to be resolved, but the way to resolve it is to use the framework.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:56):  I am fired up now. I appreciate the minister's answer, but it is a negotiation. The minister says it is not a negotiation, it is not collective bargaining, it is not a plea bargain—but it is a negotiation about a structure to ensure that there is some fairness and equity in this. This is not a surprise to the government or to the department. This has been going on for month after month after month. LMS have been knocking on doors, trying to get an equitable outcome here, warning of the perverse outcomes. You had the Senate committee making very clear in their first recommendation that the government should consider options to ensure there are no perverse incentives. They have been saying that the incentives are perverse under the current bill. We have had this eleventh-hour approach—and thank goodness for Senator Milne's intervention in this to try and get a just outcome, an equitable outcome, an environmentally sound outcome—and yet we are still talking about something that should have been resolved months ago. How many months have to pass, how many doors do they have to knock on, to get this outcome? This is not acceptable.


This is something that the government was aware of and was warned about; the minister's office was aware of it. And yet we still have a situation where there is a lack of certainty; there is continued uncertainty in what is being proposed. So why will it take a month? My question to the minister is: why on earth will it take a month, when you have been on notice about this for many, many months? Why can't we get a formula in place that gives certainty to this sector, which has been an early adopter—in fact, the first adopters, I would dare to say—of greenhouse gas abatement?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (16:58):  If I can just add to Senator Xenophon's question of why will it take a month, and put a slightly different perspective on that question: Minister, if you are going to follow all of the processes laid out in the act, if it is going to be a fully independent determination of the DOIC, how are you going to do it in a month? By the time this legislation goes back to the other place, is dealt with, is proclaimed, and then you have gone through the appointments processes of the membership of the committee who do all of their determinations and come up with a methodology as pre­scribed in the legislation, how on earth are you going to provide that certainty within such a short space of time? It strikes me that your arguments conflict with one another. It strikes me that on the one hand you are saying, 'We want to deal with this quickly; and trust us, we can and will deal with this quickly and provide certainty to this sector', but on the other hand you are saying we have to go through all of the processes laid out in this bill to maintain the integrity of it. It strikes me that it is utterly impossible for you to be able to go through all of the processes laid out in this bill, maintain the integrity of it and at the same time achieve an outcome in a very short period of time. So which is it, Minister? Is it a negotiation—which you claim it is not—that will give us an outcome in a short space of time, or is it rather a proper process of the bill which will leave this industry hanging in limbo and uncert­ainty until such time as all those of processes have gone through; and of course it will be quite some time before we actually see those regulations relating to these methodologies come back to this place.

Unfortunately what we heard from Minister Ludwig was one of those wonderful contri­butions that goes something along the lines of, 'Trust us, we will work it out a little bit later.' This was basically his contribution in a nutshell: 'Yes, we are having discussions. We acknowledge there is a problem that needs to be addressed. We are working to find a way to address it'—the minister suggested it might take about a month to come up with that solution—'but we would be most appreciative if you would pass the bill in the meantime.' Unfortunately the 'Trust us, we'll fix it later' approach to government is something that we have come to be extraordinarily wary of when it comes to this government. We do not think that they can be trusted to sort things out later. Senator Xenophon and the coalition have worked together to put forward amendments to deal with issues particularly faced by the landfill gas sector because we want to know that there is going to be a solution. We also want to know that that solution will be in cast iron terms and acceptable, to make sure that we do not have the type of perverse outcomes that we have talked about previously.


As I highlighted with a prior amendment, this amendment is one that particularly relates to the flow-on effects of the cessation of operation of the New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme and how the Carbon Farming Initiative provides a capacity to pick up from there when that scheme ceases operation. The GGAS has driven landfill gas collection and CO2 abate­ment from the waste sector quite effectively. The electricity generation projects built under that scheme, as well as under the Commonwealth's Greenhouse Friendly scheme, have been reliant upon income from offset credits. GGAS will cease at the point of a carbon price coming in and we are advised that without that type of credit support a number of these projects have the potential to become quite unviable. That is why we think that it is so important that we make sure that the viability of these projects is guaranteed and that they are secured for the future, wherever they are.


The Carbon Farming Initiative, as proposed by the government, could be a possible solution to this but unfortunately it is currently not. It does not do enough to ensure that those who went in early and did their best to capture emissions and do something constructive with them by generating electricity are not disadvantaged. We do not want to end up with the perverse outcome of having a government implement­ing a scheme that is designed and intended to ensure that we get a growth in emission abatement activities, but instead we risk seeing the possibility that the early mover advantage is lost and they cease those abatement activities. The Carbon Farming Initiative offset credits could and should be used in lieu of the credits that these schemes have previously relied upon. That is what we would hope to achieve out of the amend­ments that Senator Xenophon and the coalition have pursued. GGAS landfill projects are not, of course, specifically identified on the positive list, and a number of them are required to collect some gas, under their EPA licences, for odour control and safety. Under the bill as it is proposed, projects must be on the positive list, or not be required by law, and may have a baseline applied. Industry is concerned that this creates uncertainty, given questions as to how much gas must be collected by law, about whether they may in fact be excluded from the CFI and, if not, what the accepted baseline is that will be applied. We have attempted to address those issues in the amendments that have been put forward. To resolve this, it has been suggested that these landfill gas projects be added, with a standardised baseline to cover off these issues, so that they can continue with some certainty and continue to operate commercially and effectively.


The landfill gas industry is important and it is significant. In 2009, waste in landfills generated total emissions of 15½ million-plus tonnes of CO2 equivalent, of which around 4½ million were recovered. That is a good, positive effect and it shows a baseline around 29 per cent. However, industry is concerned about whether that is a fair or effective indication of common practice, especially because a large proportion of the abatement was due to GGAS and GHF landfill gas projects. Those GGAS landfill gas projects, I am advised, accounted for abatement of around 3.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, or more than 20 per cent of landfill emissions in 2009. It has been estimated that GHF, Greenhouse Friendly, landfill gas projects accounted for abatement of around 700,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. So when you take out the GGAS and GHF, Greenhouse Friendly, projects the raw baseline number of existing activity is reduced to below five per cent, on these sums.


The industry concede they do not see that as a realistic baseline and acknowledge that some abatement that would have occurred from these other incentive schemes would have occurred in any event for other reasons. They argue that a 10 per cent national baseline for GGAS landfill projects would be realistic. We have set out some figures in these amendments that set dual standards dealing with the different schemes that have been in operation to date. Given the proven nature of the technology involved here and the activities that are underway, and given of course the reliability of the existing schemes and the manner in which they have been built up—they have been voluntarily entered into and have had significant investments made in them; not unreasonably, as a result of the incentives that were there—it is important to make sure that they are accommodated under the Carbon Farming Initiative. I know the minister gave some assurances that they would be but, as I said before, assurances, promises and 'she'll be right, mate' type commitments do not quite cut it anymore.

From those landfill sites we would then see increased emissions escaping and have the perverse outcome that in passing this and getting it wrong we have actually increased emissions in parts of the economy. That would make absolutely no sense to anybody. I think everybody in the chamber who has spoken on this to date has agreed that that type of outcome would make no sense. Senator Xenophon and the coalition are attempting to prescribe a solution to ensure that that would not be the case. We think that getting a solution in the legislation in the here and now is the best way to take this forward.


We are pleased that Senator Milne and the Greens have acknowledged that there needs to be a solution and we are pleased that the government have acknowledged that there needs to be a solution. The concern, though, is that the government have to date failed to provide any reassurance to the parliament on what that solution will be and how it will be applied and, importantly, failed to provide reassurance to industry to make sure they are confident in and comfortable about the manner in which this will move ahead.


So I would leave the challenge there for the minister. We would hope to get something far more certain than the words he uttered before question time on this matter.

At the same time I want to make sure that there would not be job losses or the closing down of facilities that are assisting us in reducing our emissions across Australia. I indicate to the Senate that the Greens will be opposing this amendment for that reason. I am satisfied that we have now reached a conclusion that will be satisfactory to all parties. I also put on the record that if a resolution of this issue does not occur in the next four weeks to the satisfaction of all parties, we will be discussing it again.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:47):  I am grateful for Senator Milne's contribution and also for her intervention. She has taken a keen interest in trying to get a resolution to this carbon emissions matter. I agree with the sentiments of what she is saying. If this amendment is lost—it is not a criticism of the government in any way—I worry about what remedy there is if there is an unsatisfactory solution. That is a genuine question. If the amendment is lost, what recourse can LMS, and other entities that have been doing good work on greenhouse gas abatement over many years, have? What are they left with? I accept from the minister that the negotiations are proceeding with goodwill but I am concerned that, in the absence of a legislative framework, these entities are vulnerable. They have done the right thing.


It is worth reflecting on recommendation No.1 of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee into this Carbon Farming Initiative legislation. Paragraph 2.36 states very clearly:


The committee recommends the government consider options to ensure there are no perverse incentives to cease existing abatement projects, and encourage first movers to undertake further abatement or sequestration activities under the Carbon Farming Initiative.


The devil is in the detail. If a formula is not set by legislation, which is my preferred outcome and that of my co-sponsor, my colleague Senator Birmingham—we moved this jointly, with Senator Birmingham doing so on behalf of the opposition—then we will have some difficulty. It is regrettable that it has had to come to this, that an amendment had to be introduced, but Senator Milne took a very active and laudable role in trying to deal with this matter and that was most welcome. I know this sector is very grateful for Senator Milne's interest and intervention but it is still not quite resolved, and that makes me very nervous. That is why it is important to proceed with this amendment.


If this amendment is defeated—it appears the numbers are not here to pass it—what recourse will there be if there is a stumbling block in negotiations? Secondly, as I understand it, there are some figures that are toing and froing on baselines. I know that negotiations have been taking place with goodwill on the part of the department and the minister's office and the industry sector, but what safeguards are there if there is a breakdown in negotiations? Are we back to square one and back to the uncertainty? These are businesses that need to look at their financing or refinancing, and the uncertaity would be a significant factor in their long-term commercial survival. Despite the fact that I accept everyone's goodwill on this issue, I wonder how we deal with that conundrum,?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (16:50):  I will go back to what I said originally about this matter. It is important to maintain the integrity of the system. Senator Milne said it in a perhaps shorter way than I am about to, but this amendment seeks to take things outside the available procedures that have been established to make sure that in an international setting those people who look at the integrity of the system see that it is not compromised. 


This amendment avoids the methodology; it avoids having an independent assessment. It puts in a specific clause that would open up the ability for others to come along and say, 'We have our own specific circum­stances and we therefore want a legislative solution. We want the same as the landfill industry.' You open up the integrity and put it in jeopardy. Secondly, dealing with what I think Senator Xenophon talked about, this is not a negotiation. It is very important to keep that in mind—it is not a negotiation.




Senator Xenophon:
  It is.




Senator LUDWIG:
  It is not a negotiation; it is an evidence based way of gaining what the baseline would be. So you do not sit in a room, as with industrial relations, and bargain about what the baseline should or should not be. It is about an evidence based outcome. Why? Because internationally we want to maintain the integrity of the system. To do that there has to be an independent assessment. It has to be evidence based and the methodology has to be followed. That is why we do not support a separate individual amendment dealing with one industry which then bypasses that. You would want them to go through and develop the methodologies—evidence based metho­dologies—and have the independent assess­ment to ensure the integrity of the system so that where it lands it is supported by the evidence.


Ultimately it is a legislative instrument and if people disagree with it, it will come back here as a legislative instrument. We all know that, if the legislative instruments get it right, they generally go through this place. If they do not then there is an opportunity for those people to disallow the instruments in the Senate if they do not think they got it right. That does mean, however, that if it is disallowed it will have to go back through the process again. But that is what people can decide to choose in the Senate—it is always an option available to us. So it is much better to deal with it in that way than to simply mandate through what is ultimately an amendment to the bill, which would then be an amendment to the act, which is specific and about only one industry. It then goes around the actual integrity of the system. So what you are doing in one fell swoop is making sure that the bill itself, if it were to be passed with this amendment, would already have a hole in it; it would have a landfill—it would make sure that it would be criticised for not being able to stand up to scrutiny and not having an independent process to assess each of the methodologies. So to deal with Senator Xenophon's issue around negotiation, it is consultation, sure; but it is evidence based to arrive at appro­priate, researched figures which are backed up by the evidence. So it is not a bargain. 


Lastly, to deal with the issue of ensuring that everybody got it right—it is a legislative instrument; people can decide in here that they did not get it right and make their own judgments about that. But first and foremost it is, with the best of government intention, designed to solve this in a very short space in time—because we do recognise there is an issue that needs to be resolved, but the way to resolve it is to use the framework.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-08-18,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:56):  I am fired up now. I appreciate the minister's answer, but it is a negotiation. The minister says it is not a negotiation, it is not collective bargaining, it is not a plea bargain—but it is a negotiation about a structure to ensure that there is some fairness and equity in this. This is not a surprise to the government or to the department. This has been going on for month after month after month. LMS have been knocking on doors, trying to get an equitable outcome here, warning of the perverse outcomes. You had the Senate committee making very clear in their first recommendation that the government should consider options to ensure there are no perverse incentives. They have been saying that the incentives are perverse under the current bill. We have had this eleventh-hour approach—and thank goodness for Senator Milne's intervention in this to try and get a just outcome, an equitable outcome, an environmentally sound outcome—and yet we are still talking about something that should have been resolved months ago. How many months have to pass, how many doors do they have to knock on, to get this outcome? This is not acceptable.


This is something that the government was aware of and was warned about; the minister's office was aware of it. And yet we still have a situation where there is a lack of certainty; there is continued uncertainty in what is being proposed. So why will it take a month? My question to the minister is: why on earth will it take a month, when you have been on notice about this for many, many months? Why can't we get a formula in place that gives certainty to this sector, which has been an early adopter—in fact, the first adopters, I would dare to say—of greenhouse gas abatement?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-18,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (16:58):  If I can just add to Senator Xenophon's question of why will it take a month, and put a slightly different perspective on that question: Minister, if you are going to follow all of the processes laid out in the act, if it is going to be a fully independent determination of the DOIC, how are you going to do it in a month? By the time this legislation goes back to the other place, is dealt with, is proclaimed, and then you have gone through the appointments processes of the membership of the committee who do all of their determinations and come up with a methodology as pre­scribed in the legislation, how on earth are you going to provide that certainty within such a short space of time? It strikes me that your arguments conflict with one another. It strikes me that on the one hand you are saying, 'We want to deal with this quickly; and trust us, we can and will deal with this quickly and provide certainty to this sector', but on the other hand you are saying we have to go through all of the processes laid out in this bill to maintain the integrity of it. It strikes me that it is utterly impossible for you to be able to go through all of the processes laid out in this bill, maintain the integrity of it and at the same time achieve an outcome in a very short period of time. So which is it, Minister? Is it a negotiation—which you claim it is not—that will give us an outcome in a short space of time, or is it rather a proper process of the bill which will leave this industry hanging in limbo and uncert­ainty until such time as all those of processes have gone through; and of course it will be quite some time before we actually see those regulations relating to these methodologies come back to this place.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2011-08-18,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (17:52):  I spoke yesterday in the chamber about the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, an international treaty born out of the tragedy and bloodshed of the Second World War, and about the importance of the convention in providing protections and safeguards to so many who have been forced to flee from their homes and homelands. I said that as Australians we should be proud of our nation's role in the formulation of the convention, as we should be proud of our connection with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a treaty that celebrated its 60th anniversary three years ago and out of which the refugee convention grew. We should never forget that and we should never forget that article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:


Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.


The Menzies government ratified and acceded to the refugee convention and enshrined into Australian law our commit­ment to some of the world's most vulnerable people.


Sixty years after the implementation of the convention, the international community continues to face enormous challenges in meeting the social, economic and human­itarian plight of refugees. Here in Australia we have largely been shielded from the global movement of refugees because of simple geography and the relative difficulty of arriving on our shores coupled with the very real danger of embarking on such a journey.


In 2010 there were 358,800 applications for asylum in industrialised countries. Of those 358,800 applications for asylum, Australia received 8,250. As a matter of comparison, Sweden, a country with less than half Australia's population, received 31,800 applications. Canada received 23,200 applications and the United States received a staggering 55,530 applications. The UNHCR puts the total number of asylum seekers worldwide at 837,500. I think that these comparisons tell a story in themselves.


Australia has had its own history of refugee movements. Our first real experience with mass arrival by boat—and I use the word 'mass' advisedly given international comparisons—was with those fleeing the newly unified Vietnam after the Vietnam War. The first boat to reach our shores arrived in Darwin in April 1976. Over the next five years 2,059 Vietnamese people arrived on our shores. It is now often forgotten that by the mid-1980s Australia offered a home to another 90,000 people languishing in refugee camps across South-East Asia. When the Fraser government negotiated for the settlement of the Vietnamese people affected by the decade-long war, few would have predicted what a positive and profound effect these people would have on our national identity and what a valuable contribution they would make to Australian society.


The same is true of the Chinese citizens allowed to stay by the Hawke government following the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. Not only was this a recognition by the Australian government that Australia must play its part in the international community; it was a signal that we as a nation would not sit by as innocent people suffered for their beliefs and ideals, the very same beliefs and ideals that Australians enjoy and should never take for granted.


Sixty years is a long time. Many instruments and institutions of international law have come and gone over those decades. Few, however, have had the lasting effect of the refugee convention. Australia's role as an original signatory and ratifier is something I believe Australians should be very proud of. I hope that in this, the 60th year of the Geneva convention relating to the status of refugees, we can keep some of this history in mind, that we can keep in mind why the need for the refugee convention arose. An open mind should assist us to appreciate that, while circumstances now may be different to those faced by refugees after World War II, today's refugees are just as vulnerable as those Australia sought to help in previous decades.


The application of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees to those who come to Australia is paramount. I for one will always stand up to argue Australian government policies must remain consistent with it. UNHCR Australia suggests that the refugee convention has helped over 50 million people restart their lives. This is an extraordinary achievement and one that I believe all nations involved should be proud of as we celebrate 60 years of the refugee convention.

Senator Chris Evans:
  The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:


During the period 1 July to 31 December 2010 Navy met its obligations to designated operations and other short term directed tasking. Navy is not required to and does not prepare all fleet units to the same operational level of readiness. To do so would be unnecessary, inefficient and costly. The preparedness of fleet units is maintained at an appropriate level to meet strategic guidance and ensure effective training throughput.


Those fleet units held at higher readiness for short notice operational roles are appropriately manned, equipped and trained for the tasks that they might have to perform. Fleet units at other stages of the continuum will also be crewed in a manner that is best suited to their assigned tasking. This might mean the reduction in certain trained/skilled positions filled in order to make way for additional trainees. Fleet units invariably go to sea with all available accommodation filled.


To meet and sustain operational, exercise, preparedness and training requirements, fleet units are operated in a cycle of scheduled maintenance, training and operational availability. Planned major maintenance activity periods are a routine element of the operational cycle.
