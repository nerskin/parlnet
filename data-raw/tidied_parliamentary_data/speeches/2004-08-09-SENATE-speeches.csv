"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-08-09,"—I am continuing my speech in the second reading debate on the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004. The national interest analysis, which was done by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—JSCOT—in report No. 61 informs us that the free trade agreement is `GATT plus'; that is, it will remove almost all barriers to Australia's export of goods to the US through a negotiation of offer and request. The way it works is that it will provide an agreed list of exceptions to which obligations of the FTA do not apply. The result of the free trade agreement, it is stated, will be to increase market access. It is argued, both in JSCOT's report No. 61 and in the later report of the Senate Select Committee on a Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America, that the free trade agreement will bring significant economic gains to Australia. Just how big those economic gains will be—as I stated last Thursday—is still in contention. I suspect that we will have to wait to see the conclusion to that debate. 
The point that should be made about this debate is that we are not arguing about minuses but about the magnitude of the gains that will accrue from the free trade agreement. Unfortunately, the national interest analysis which accompanied the treaty did not contain any specific financial information on costs and benefits. The only such information provided to the JSCOT was an estimate by Treasury of the cost of the agreement. Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, I note that you are a member of that committee. The Treasury, through the NIA process, made available economic modelling to that committee in a report by the Centre for International Economics. This report showed a variance in the gains that may accrue through the FTA—one from a high base to an even higher base. 
One of the most notable benefits that will accrue from the FTA is investment liber-alisation. However, investment liberalisation could have been implemented in a unilateral action by government decision. It is one of the issues that came up in negotiations on the free trade agreement with Singapore. Investment liberalisation will increase the threshold for foreign investors from $50 million to $800 million—a significant change. The reports by JSCOT and the Senate select committee illuminate this issue. 
In addition to the economic modelling that was provided to JSCOT, the committee was also fortunate enough to receive the Dee report, which was then used extensively by the select committee. The Dee report became available towards the end of that inquiry and identified modest gains to be gained from the FTA. Notably, the Productivity Commission was not called on to analyse the FTA. This was an omission, or an oversight, by this government that should have been corrected. It can still be corrected by allowing the Productivity Commission to take up the cudgels and do the job that it does best—analysing economic models and matters such as the free trade agreement. It could provide some future information to both the government and the opposition about how the FTA will proceed.  
It became transparent throughout the process that the government had not undertaken rigorous examination or engaged in consultative rounds with the states and with its own stakeholders, which I think is an oversight that the government could have corrected. It could have ensured that the states were brought on board more. The JSCOT report comments on the lack of consultation by the government with respect to the free trade agreement. 
The FTA is a living agreement. It does not just finish, as does the construction of a house. There will be ongoing dialogue with the US—and there will be ongoing dialogue, I suspect, in this chamber—about how the FTA will continue. There will also be a significant joint committee to supervise the operations of the agreement. This committee will play a central role in how the FTA will unfold. The committee will meet annually and review the current functioning of the agreement. It may consider any improvements or amendments, clarify issues and issue interpretations, and it becomes part of the initial stages of any dispute resolution process that may be called for.
Another important consideration is that the agreement does not allow private investors to directly challenge government decisions. It remains a government-to-government document. Individual investors are of course able to raise concerns about their treatment with their respective governments, but what will emerge is a functioning, flexible trade agreement. That clearly will not suit all who want clarity, certainty and a document with a black-and-white approach. This is not one of those. However, I think it is best to refer to this statement made by Ms Meg MacDonald during the JSCOT hearings:
We think that the various forums and mechanisms established under the agreement ... will be able to continue the work of streamlining the bilateral business environment ...
Turning for a moment to the technical detail, for the free trade agreement to come into force both parties will need to fulfil their domestic approval processes. These processes include amending or agreeing to legislation and accepting an agreed date of introduction of the agreement. These two bills before the Senate today are part of the process which will enable the free trade agreement to come into being.
One of the major sticking points at the moment, which is quite a live issue in the Senate, is the pharmaceutical debate. The DFAT fact sheet says that the annex will:
... provide more opportunities for companies seeking listing of new medicines on the PBS to have input to the process.
That has caused a significant amount of debate. It is clear that no-one wants to either directly or indirectly undermine our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. At least, I am confident the opposition take that view; I am not sure all the government ministers take that approach. The question can be formulated in this fashion: will the free trade agreement either directly or indirectly undermine the Australian PBS system?
The analysis undertaken by JSCOT examined each individual issue. JSCOT heard `no compelling evidence' that the agreement would affect prices of medicines, that the review mechanism would affect the PBS, that patent issues would weaken the PBS, that the establishment of a working group could undermine the PBS or even that the behaviour of US pharmaceutical companies could potentially undermine the PBS. On the issues separated and dealt with individually they came to the reported conclusion—if it can be called a conclusion—that there would be no tangible effect on the PBS. However, if you look collectively at the individual statements that are contained in report No. 61 by JSCOT and in the report of the subsequent select committee, you will see that there remains a concern. I think that that concern can be addressed by Labor's amendment. 
Before I look more at the PBS, I want to comment briefly on Labor's approach. Over the last several days we have seen the validation of Labor's approach to the free trade agreement with the United States. It is a complex document with more than 1,100 pages and a considerable amount of detail included. Labor said at the beginning of this year that we owed it to the Australian people to examine it. My email account is, and was, overflowing with views from the elderly, the young, the sick and those who have to care for them. In fact, in the last four days over 900 emails have been received in my inbox. Labor's commitment to using the Senate—that is, through the select committee—for its intended purpose as a house of review to examine the agreement is borne out by that process. Since announcing our intention to put up two amendments—that is, the local content amendment and the PBS amendment—I have received further encouragement from people in my state of Queensland.
The Prime Minister calls this `a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—a chance to open trade'. Irrespective of the once-in-a-lifetime tag, I think we owe it to the Australian people to let them have their say about the FTA. That stands as the hallmark of what Mr Latham outlined when he first took the approach he did in respect of the FTA. He said that the select committee should be allowed to do its work—to examine the FTA, to build on the work the JSCOT committee had done to ensure that the FTA was properly scrutinised. The opposition forced the government to put its touted FTA under the spotlight. Frankly, I think it was a worthwhile and necessary process. Considering the length of time it took the Howard government to deliver all of the information about the FTA to the select committee, they have done remarkably well in the time available to produce their comprehensive report.
Two issues remain outstanding. One of them has, I think, been resolved by the government agreeing with us. The second is in relation to the PBS. The interesting fact about that is that the final appeal mechanism for the PBS was delivered to the public arena no earlier than two weeks ago. It could have been delivered earlier. The government could have provided information on how the system was going to work, given the comments made originally in the treaties report and the subsequent comments by the select committee.
The process requires generic manufacturers to do two things: firstly, certify that they do not infringe any existing patent; and, secondly, certify that they have notified the patent holder of their intention to seek listing on the PBS. This notification requirement could allow patent holders to consider whether to take early pre-emptive action against a generic manufacturer. There might be issues surrounding that as to whether or not they would and whether or not it is similar to the US legislation. But what we have to concentrate on is ensuring that the PBS in Australia is sound and continues to deliver affordable medicine to people.
In contrast to the government, Labor was determined to get it right. The government has failed the Australian people in not ensuring that the PBS was solid. The Prime Minister made disparaging remarks about the select committee and the process Labor undertook to ensure that the FTA was properly scrutinised and that all the issues were examined and considered. However, given that the Prime Minister has already conceded that we had a valid viewpoint on the question of cultural content, I think he should reconsider the issues and his words about the PBS as well. 
Today, I expect we will see the opposition's amendment to the PBS but that is not a matter I will talk about during the second reading debate. In my view, it would have been far better if the government had last week joined with Labor and said, `Yes, there are issues; there is a problem and we need to address it,' rather than to continue over the weekend to create doubt that otherwise might not have arisen.
In relation to these two amendments and these two issues, the government would not have looked at Australian content if it were not for the Australian Labor Party; nor would they have looked at ensuring the continuation of a strong PBS if it had not been for Labor. In conclusion, over the weekend Labor and the government have had a chance to spar about these issues. I think it is high time now that we took these issues to a conclusion and that the government got on with it.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-08-09,"—I rise to speak in the debate on the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004. On a number of occasions in recent weeks—commencing on about 28 or 29 July—I was cited in the Adelaide Advertiser as being a person who supported the free trade agreement and its implementation. I probably was the only member of the parliamentary Left to adopt this position but I did so after great deliberation and with no confidence in the prospects of the El Dorado that the government has tried to con the Australian public to believe would flow from the treaty into the Australian economy.
I supported the FTA with absolutely no trust in the white shoe brigade of the government—from the Prime Minister down—whose rhetoric knows no bounds on this issue, as with many others, and whose credibility is inversely related to their outlandish rhetoric. I supported the agreement in the belief and expectation that the implementation and ratification were inevitable and in the belief that ratification would present a real opportunity for a parallel agenda to be pursued by those who had concerns about the downsides of this treaty. I believed that that agenda would be critical to any balanced outcome for the Australian people.
We are led to believe that there is only an upside but I would like to put on the record an early part of the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America because I think it reflects some of the diversity of outcomes arising from this treaty. The report says:
For many people, however, the Agreement represents nothing but economic, cultural and employment risks from exposure to powerful United States interests. Some economists have argued that the trade diversion effects of the AUSFTA could work to the overall detriment of the Australian economy. Many have argued strongly that the Agreement will undermine Australia's sovereignty and erode social policy, and that many of the AUSFTA's provisions will severely restrict Australia's future capacity to direct and manage its own affairs. 
That paragraph sums up the diversity of concerns in the community, ranging from economic to cultural concerns and concerns about sovereignty. They were concerns that I addressed in coming up with my position on this matter. 
For me the ratification process presents an opportunity to address some of these fundamental concerns in a long-term way; to focus in a meaningful way on some issues such as the PBS, cultural content and so on; to develop forward agendas and secure long-term structures and outcomes; to address some of the issues that arise from the FTA; and to address some issues which have their genesis before the FTA but also run parallel to it. By expanding and changing the market, pressures are going to be put on existing systems and existing legislation, and those sorts of issues have to be addressed in a timely way. At the same time the politics were, and continue to be, extremely important for me. The government's lie machine has been in overdrive. Expectations across industry sectors have been raised. If the critical and central issues could be addressed then the politics also demanded a balanced outcome. 
The outlook I adopted was not a new one. It has been successfully used by progressive people in mainstream politics in the ALP quite often in the past. It is one that, as a member of the Hawke-Keating cabinets, I participated in quite often. In fact, if one goes back even as far as post-war reconstruction under the Marshall Plan, one can see the obvious elements of a strategy that should have been used from the start but which has been forced on the government by the opposition leader, Mark Latham. That is, you cannot have economic reform without a contemporaneous social policy underpinning such reform. Under the last Labor government we had unquestionably an enormous trade liberalisation, regulatory reform and global agenda. We opened up Australia to the world but we recognised—and we paid ongoing policy respect to—the fact that some of our citizens would miss out on the benefits and some would lose because of the opening up of the Australian economy to global pressures, expectations and demands.
Recognising that, we acted to either insure them from the effect or, importantly, provide them with new opportunities arising from new markets and new agendas. So we had a steel plan. Particularly for my state of South Australia, we had a car industry plan. When it came to the banking sector we had consumer protection and regulatory measures. We had a raft of social and community adjustment programs. We had those measures with regard to our trade and economic liberalisation agendas, and we had them when our environmental or Indigenous agendas were going to impact on smaller outlying and regional communities.
These opportunities have been tried and proven in the past. These opportunities should have been seized by this government when developing the Australian position on the AUSFTA. But the government did not. Not only did it not take a broad approach to policy, one driven by the concern of Australians, but it did not even go through the formal processes of, for instance, raising this treaty with the Treaties Council of ministers before it agreed to the AUSFTA. In fact, probably the first real opportunity the public has had to have input in the parliamentary process and in the development of this treaty came through the Senate committee in particular, a committee that the government has bagged consistently from day one, rather than through the processes of the House of Representatives and the Senate. But it has been a committee process that has raised for the consideration of the parliament some critical issues that quite obviously needed to be addressed right from the start.
I need to make one other point at this stage, one that I think is fundamental and that exposes the hypocrisy of some of the proponents of the AUSFTA in the current debate. I have always proceeded in politics on the premise that the Australia-US alliance was a critical fundamental piece in our policy settings—the alliance with the US, that is, not with the neoconservatives who have momentarily hijacked that country and its policy directions. The alliance is an important security link that permeates many other areas of policy. It has never worked and would never work if Australia were to be a client state, in servitude to US interests, or a deputy sheriff. It only works and it only resonates if it is respected by a broad cross-section of Australian people and a broad cross-section of the Australian politic. It is not an alliance of conservatives of both countries; it is an alliance between countries. And it is only an alliance that works for us, proud Australians that we are, if it is an alliance with dignity. We can have our disagreements, we can disagree on major issues—as we have in the past—but we should always have that right to disagree and take a different position to that of the US. This right is fundamental to a meaningful alliance. 
Within these parameters two things are important. General support for the alliance across the broad section of the body politic is critical to its continuation as an important factor in political life in this country, as with the USA. It is not good enough to have an in-house club between neoconservatives on both sides. It is not good enough to marginalise and politicise the alliance in that respect, which has happened quite consistently over recent months. It is an agenda that has been consistently pursued by the conservatives in this country in particular. If you do not have broad support for the alliance, if it is only left to the Right on both sides in both countries, then you do not have a healthy, ongoing alliance. You need to have, as much as possible, people from across the spectrum—the Right, the centre and some on the Left as well—to ensure that you have a healthy, dynamic relationship. But it has been marginalised, and I think that has been unfortunate for those who claim to pursue the interests of the alliance but who, in the process, are undermining it. On the other side of the debate, in the US, the way that President Bush has played politics with this has not been helpful. In earlier days the US ambassador fell into that trap, but it is good to see that in more recent days he is taking a more diplomatic approach to the issue.
It is important not to politicise the alliance; it is also important not to threaten the underpinnings of our trade and security policies. Year after year in this place, the conservatives in particular have said to us: `You have got to keep the US alliance immunised from day-to-day political issues. You cannot use it as a political bargaining chip.' But what have we had in recent months? We have had this Prime Minister, desperate to do anything to retain government, using this alliance for that specific purpose. For him, it does not matter if he trashes it, it does not matter if he marginalises it, so long as he gets the political outcome he wants. Those on the conservative side of politics have particularly been the ones who for decades have been using the mantra: `We can't use the alliance as a bargaining chip'—whether it comes to agriculture, whether it comes to issues such as MX missiles, whether it comes to Star Wars and so on. Unfortunately, those on the conservative side have dragged the alliance into day-to-day politics here. People like the Prime Minister you would expect; but it is a pity that the likes of Paul Kelly and Greg Sheridan—people I know and respect—and others like them who know better, and I know they know better, are not writing better. It is a pity they are falling for the government's strategy. It is a pity they have become so institutionalised that they have lost their balance and their long-term perspective on issues such as this. 
We have before us legislation in respect of that treaty, but it is legislation and a treaty which would have not received adequate scrutiny—responsible scrutiny—had it not been for the Senate committee process. As I said, it was a committee that was criticised for its institution, criticised for its deliberations and criticised for its outcomes, but it is a committee that has come up with quite a number of areas of concern. The Australian people need to understand what is in the nuts and bolts of this treaty. They need to go into it with eyes wide open. Except for this Senate committee, they would have been going into it with eyes wide shut. It is not the El Dorado that the Howard government claimed it was: a $6 billion assertion that we heard on day one has conveniently disappeared into the ether. The committee says there are benefits and there are negatives, but the benefits are probably marginal at best.
There will be winners. For instance, with respect to some of those winners in my state, South Australia, the manufacturing industry came solidly behind this agreement in the first instance, but people in the vehicle industry realised that where there might be some manufacturing industry adjustments, particularly in the component parts industry, they are not going to be to the benefit of the South Australian community. Similarly, the fishing industry is cited as an industry that expects major opportunities out of this treaty. That has been the view expressed by some of their leaders. But with the rules of origin that apply, and with time, a lot of those people in that industry have started to realise that, once again, their expectations should be nowhere near as high as they have been led to believe by the government. Wouldn't it be really great if we had a government that focused on a huge market for them, a market that does have trade barriers—the European market. There is a 15 per cent barrier there. Were we to get rid of that as a priority that would be of major benefit, particularly to the fishermen in Port Lincoln and other parts of South Australia, if not to the whole country.
One of my primary concerns was the cultural community. `Let's protect it' was the mantra coming through on the emails; but protect what and protect for how long? This industry came up as a candidate for the typical Labor solution in this area—that is, to ensure that if you are going to be affecting the rules that govern the industry then you have to make sure that the industry gets not just protection but a springboard into future generations of that industry. You need to do so not just with an industry plan but by looking at the future generation of technologies, the future delivery platforms and the real protection that is going to be needed. You do not have real protection now and you have not had real protection in recent years under the ABA chaired by David Flint. What the industry needed, what it needs and what Mark Latham has proposed it will now get is a new platform of protection and support. That is going to be critical for its future.
There were many concerns with the agreement, as I said, one of which was the PBS—and that has had a solid work-out. The dishonesty of the government knows absolutely no bounds. Minister after minister over the weekend appeared on radio and TV telling us that this agreement will not change the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. What this agreement does do is change the market. It changes the players in the market, it changes their share of the market, it changes the pressure in the market and, consequently, it changes the regulatory mechanisms that are in play. If you have an evolving market, yesterday's regulatory mechanisms will never be good enough for the future. The government knows that but dishonestly tries to skirt the issue of what this trade agreement does for the pharmaceutical market. The market will not be the same. That is a fundamental outcome of this agreement. If the market will not be the same then you have to focus on how to best protect our patent laws in the context of a new market and in the context of new pressures on the PBS. 
Once again, the federal opposition leader's initiative in this area is one that any responsible government should have come up with. But what have we had from the government? We have had dishonesty, disingenuity, a belittling of concerns and a belittling of the ideas of the other side. On the one hand the government say, `Well, we will listen to a good idea,' but do you reckon they have the capacity to come up with one themselves? This has been quite stark in recent discussions on this issue. If you look at the Senate committee report, whether on health services, patent law, the service industry or, particularly, intellectual property—an issue that has not been adequately addressed either by the government—you will see that it was the Senate process, rather than the government, that came up with the concerns with the agreement and with the way to address them. The government have just blindly signed to a treaty without even scant respect for the concerns of the people it might affect.
For a treaty that was inevitably going to be passed into law, it was important to me that a parallel agenda be developed. As I say, the usefulness of the Senate committee process was shown again in the weight of the report. For that I have to congratulate you, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, and other members of the committee, particularly Senator Peter Cook, who obviously deliberated on this issue under enormous personal duress. I think he and you have done a great job in a very comprehensive report. I must say, after debate on this report by almost all the Senate, hardly anyone has been able to find fault with it—with its fundamentals, with its premises or with its deliberations. There might be some political argument as to outcomes and as to some value judgments at the end, but I do not think anyone has managed to strike a blow at the heart of the validity of this report. Senators need to be commended for that.
The development of that parallel agenda was something that was always going to come out of this, and the opposition leader has done that. Some people might say, `You can have that agenda but it doesn't have to be within the legislation.' That is almost like the Prime Minister saying to us in the parliament: `Trust me. I'll look at it into the future.' The Prime Minister's store of trust with us and with the Australian public has worn out. The strategy of ensuring that legislation is amended as we go towards a treaty is obviously a much more productive one than taking this Prime Minister and this government on trust. Some issues raised need to be taken much more seriously than they have been. I have quoted one paragraph from the Senate committee report. It is also important in closing to acknowledge that, as the report says:
Any trade agreement, especially one as unprecedentedly complex as the AUSFTA, necessarily entails both costs and benefits ... Assumptions are invariably contestable ...
Econometric reports, as the committee found, led in different directions. Agriculture, investment and service industries were important. The power imbalance in the marketplace was something that the committee seized upon but that the government has never acknowledged. The report continues:
While the removal of tariff and other barriers enhances Australia' access to the American markets, the opening of Australia's markets to highly competitive and export-oriented US firms will obviously have ramifications for Australian companies and their employees.
We are dealing with a huge market and, as the report says, with firms geared up to greater consumption levels and greater opportunities to offset costs, and that is something that needs to be factored in. At the end of this process, we are in a position where amendments have been put up by the opposition. Those amendments go very much to the heart of protecting the Australian public from the excesses of this treaty, excesses which we always knew were going to be there. It is a pity the government did not put them up, but I am pleased to say that the leader of the Labor Party had the courage to do so and has the courage to pursue them to their conclusion. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2004-08-09,"—I rise to address an issue that has not been focused on terribly greatly so far in the debate on the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004 but that is nonetheless very important—that is, the issue of multilateralism versus bilateralism in the making of agreements. The reason I do so will become obvious in a few moments, but at the outset I want to acknowledge those people who have taken the time to endlessly bombard me with emails to try to sway me in my views on this issue—and many people around here have felt that pressure. Having said that, there is a plus in this whole process. It needs to be realised that the Senate committee process once again has stood the test of time. The value of the process is that it gives the public an opportunity to make representations to the Senate committee, to express their views and their doubts on the issue at hand, to have their views weighed up by the members of the committee and in this case to have the evidence and the agreement itself closely scrutinised by the Senate.
That is a fundamentally important issue because without that scrutiny people could not have felt secure in what the government were telling us. The government were telling us: `We have an FTA with the United States. You should feel warm and fuzzy about that. Trust us.' Unfortunately, one is not in the position in this parliament, particularly on this side, to trust the government and what they might say on issues as important to Australians as a free trade agreement with the United States. So the public scrutiny process was terribly important indeed. The Labor senators—and I congratulate them for their diligence in the scrutiny of the free trade agreement—brought down some 43 recommendations, which are appended to the report. That shows that it has been the subject of scrutiny and, as we all know of course, if agreement can be reached on the issue of the PBS it is likely that the legislation on this US free trade agreement will pass through this chamber by the end of this week. That will be a major milestone in our relationship with the United States in respect of trade.
I particularly want to look at the issue of bilateralism in free trade agreements as opposed to multilateralism. I had the pleasure back in 1997 of being the chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, a position which I have left behind me for some time now, though I am still a member of the committee. That committee was handed a reference on Australia and APEC, a review of the APEC processes, APEC itself and multilateralism, and it gave the opportunity for bilateralism to be discussed and debated as well. I think it is worth while noting in this debate, whilst the focus has been almost solely on bilateralism—and rightly so, because it is a bilateral agreement—that multilateralism has been pushed, in my view, to the back. That is most unfortunate, because I think that most of the major gains that we will make as a trading nation will be made in the multilateral arena rather than in the bilateral arena as such. I think it is worth revisiting that. 
It is worth while looking, firstly, at the final report of the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America which was tabled in August 2004. One can see that there is not a great deal there that is focused on multilateralism versus bilateralism, but I will go to this report and also to the earlier interim report, and then to the Senate committee report on APEC back in July 2000. In that final report, of 2004, paragraph 1.18 of the majority report of senators concluded:
A prominent advocate of liberalised global trade, in its multilateral rather than bilateral manifestations, is Professor Ross Garnaut.
I must say that when I get to the report on APEC it is not unexpected that Ross Garnaut was very much a player then, and earlier in this area of trade, championing the cause of multilateral trade. The report goes on:
He has expressed concerns on several occasions about the risks arising from preferential bilateral agreements, and has identified five key risks that are at play in the AUSFTA—
The AUSFTA is the Australia-US free trade agreement. It is worth while just going over these risks for a moment. They are concerns that are valid but do not get much airplay when the focus is purely and simply on the implementation of the agreement. But they should weigh on the minds of Australians thinking about where our role in trade negotiations should go in future. The first point Ross Garnaut raises, and it is quoted in the report of the committee, is:
... the negotiation of a bilateral FTA would accelerate the weakening of the multilateral system.
Professor Garnaut has been consistent in that view, which he expressed when he appeared before the inquiry into APEC. And there was a subsequent inquiry into our relationship with Japan, which arose out of the APEC inquiry, when similar views—if my recollection serves me correctly—were mentioned. So there is a concern expressed by him, and I share that concern, that shifting to a bilateral system of negotiation of trade agreements will weaken the multilateral system. We have seen a propensity on the part of this government to go down the bilateral path—we have seen the Singapore free trade agreement and others—and it seems also that at the same time the government has lost any zest and life for APEC itself. That is a tragedy indeed.
The second point arising from Professor Garnaut's comments to the committee that is quoted in the report is:
... there will be resulting trade diversion from Australia's most important export region, East Asia ...
If one goes back to the original formation of APEC, one will find that the focus was not only on our relationship in trade with the United States but also with our Asian neighbours, and on their importance to us as their economies grow and they become a greater part of our marketplace. To me that is a very valid and important point indeed. The report then outlines his next point:
... the rules of origin associated with a US FTA would raise transaction costs in international trade and lower productivity in the process ...
His next point is as follows:
... the exclusion of US agricultural subsidies from the FTA would corrode the position of free trade agricultural exporters in the international system and could negate any benefits from increased market access to the US...
The last point, as outlined by the Labor senators, is this:
... the processes of policy making in developing this agreement, relying on commissioning consulting reports with limited terms of reference, have been very damaging to trade policy processes.
One could gain quite clearly from that the fact that Professor Garnaut's view of bilateralism versus multilateralism is clearly and heavily weighted in favour of the multilateral stage. Whilst the committee did not refer at length to it there, they did make some comment on it in the earlier interim report, which they tabled in June 2004, under the heading `Multilateral v bilateral trade agreements'. I will just look at a few considerations that were again reported by the majority of senators—being Labor senators—in that report. At paragraph 1.23, the report notes: 
A prominent concern among critics of free trade deals is that Australia's negotiation of a free trade agreement with the United States of America would be detrimental to current multilateral trade and service negotiations by undermining the principles of the multilateral trading system through the WTO.
The report goes on to give an example of that. The interim report did note that DFAT had, not unexpectedly, a different view. So that some balance can at least be said to be seen in what I am saying here today, I will quote what the report cites as the DFAT view. At paragraph 1.27 the report says:
DFAT considers free trade agreements that are comprehensive in scope and coverage can complement and provide momentum to Australia's wider multilateral trade objectives. DFAT stated that one of the best ways of ensuring this occurs is for agreements to meet the criteria in the WTO agreements.
In the very next paragraph, the report goes on, not unexpectedly, to contradict that. It says:
However, free trade agreements are contrary to the fundamental `most favoured nation' principle that underpins the WTO.
At paragraph 1.29, the report goes on:
The Committee also notes arguments that suggest that, with the more recent focus on regional and bilateral trade agreements, there is a risk that Australia and the world may see the emergence of the same global tensions that applied prior to the Bretton Woods Agreement.
I am also aware that that very paragraph appeared in an earlier report of the committee as well. The report continues:
Such a situation may see deepening political divisions and Australia being excluded from certain trade blocs with enormous economic consequences. 
I will later move to what Professor Garnaut put before the committee, but that conclusion really raises the fundamental concern I have—that is, how we are viewed in the Asian region. We are undoubtedly part of Asia. We need to trade with the Asia-Pacific region. It was nearly two years ago, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, when you and I were part of a group that toured throughout the region for the Senate foreign affairs committee. We noted the importance of growing trade for many of the microeconomies in those areas. Of course, it will not be through bilateralism that those economies are saved; it is only through multilateralism that we can hope to promote good economic growth so that they can be free from all the negatives that happen when there is a lack of economic growth in those countries. I think Professor Garnaut's comments as quoted in the report sum up that concern. On page 6 he is quoted as saying:
In our region there is a danger that we will end up over time—not tomorrow but over time—with a division down the Pacific, with us being part of a block with the United States and most of East Asia having discriminatory arrangements amongst themselves that leave us out. That would obviously have horrific economic consequences for us. The economic consequences would be much smaller for the United States and Europe, but they would be huge for us, because they are our main export markets. In addition, there is a danger that that would make cooperation more difficult on the many things that we have to cooperate on at this difficult time in the world.
That is a real concern. There are growing markets, particularly in China where there are burgeoning markets. I know we are going into a bilateral there. But why the need for bilaterals? Why the need to go down that path exclusively, as seems to be happening? On reflection, from what I read in the report about Australia and APEC, it seems to me that APEC, in effect, has been abandoned. I know that that is not entirely the case. I know that there are liberalisation and facilitation discussions still taking place at the level that APEC is operating at. But it is not operating to the extent and degree that it needs to to provide a more broad based marketplace for trade within the Asia-Pacific region. 
Last but not least, I want to look at the concern that is noted at paragraph 1.30 on page 6 of the interim report:
The Committee acknowledges that it is inherent in bilateral and regional free trade agreements that the MFN principle is not followed. However, the Committee notes that APEC, a regional economic forum that Australia helped establish, is based on the principle of `open regionalism'. In other words, what progress APEC makes in opening up markets in member economies is then automatically shared with the world on an MFN basis. This approach strengthens the multilateral system and prevents the Asia Pacific region from becoming an exclusive economic club.
I think that that sums it up; that says it all.
In the brief time that is left to me it is worth while looking at what APEC is about. APEC was set up, admittedly under a Labor government, and it brought about some major economic benefits for Australia which we are sharing and relishing even today. APEC was born back in 1989 in Canberra. If one reads the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee of July 2000, one will see a very good chronology, at least up until 1999—headings such as `1990—Reaffirmation of APEC's general principles and objectives', `1991—APEC: “an international personality''' and `1992—In search of a vision'. According to the report, the ministers at the APEC conference agreed that a small eminent persons group should be established to articulate a vision for trade in the Asia-Pacific region to the year 2000. This group would also identify constraints and issues that APEC should consider and would report initially to the next ministerial level meeting in 1993. That was a major step forward—looking for a vision.
I do not know if it can be said of the US free trade agreement that it is necessarily in itself a vision. It is a very narrow view of the world. It does not take in the broader area. But it is interesting to look at the 1993 leaders summit and the `political horsepower', as the heading describes it in the report. It refers to what the eminent persons group had found and recommended to the APEC ministers. On page 14, the report says that the EPG identified three main dangers to the region's economic growth. The first danger identified was the erosion of the multilateral global trading system. The second danger was the trend toward inward-looking regionalism, and of course that has no place and plays no role for Australia. We need to have a broader and much more inclusive outlook. The third issue raised by the eminent persons group was the risk of fragmentation in the region. The Australia-US free trade agreement does not do anything, in my view, to fit in with any of those principles. It keeps us in a very narrow, very slender, very slim part of the world.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2004-08-09,"—It is always a pleasure to follow Senator Hogg; in his many years as a member of the Senate and in his many years of active involvement in either the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade or the Senate's Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, he has always been involved in a number of areas in which our relationship in trade, in particular, has been fleshed out and exposed. I was not going to speak in relation to the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004. However, when I was listening to some of the characters on the other side speak— 
—Yes, Senator George Brandis comes to mind. I thought it was only right that I come down and give my two bob's worth. In particular, I would like to thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, because I had an opportunity to read your contribution to this debate and the work which you did in quoting some of the US congressmen in relation to this trade deal to which I will refer shortly.
I came down on the 12.35 Qantas plane yesterday, a Dash 8 from Sydney. The Leader of the Opposition was on that plane—as was one of the senior staffers, Simon Banks—and he was sitting up the front. As you would know, when travelling on those small aircraft, when you are in the emergency area you are issued with documents asking you whether there is some assistance you might be able to give. Admittedly, one-third of the plane was full of Japanese tourists, but two-thirds of the plane was not. When the young stewardess went over to Mr Latham and said, `In the case of an emergency would you be prepared to assist?' the whole plane broke out in good-natured laughter and they all said, `Please, Mark, help us get rid of this government.' I joke not, because I was there, I saw it and it was quite humorous. But I think you would have to say that at the moment we are probably in the throes of trying to assist in getting rid of this government.
When we left here at the end of June, I was sure that we would not be coming back. I thought that for most of the year—and I think my colleagues might agree with me—the coalition had not been kicking too many goals but that maybe in that last week or so we had had some difficulties and it might have been that the Prime Minister had that five weeks in which he could go around the electorate opening bridges, going to football games and doing whatever else we politicians might do in that break, and that he might want to think about calling an election before we came back. If you recall, the coalition's primary vote did increase and in fact ours was level pegging with theirs.
The opportunity was there for the coalition to call the election that is now being mooted. But, no, they did not. Prime Minister Howard came back this week thinking Labor were at sixes and sevens on the free trade agreement, that he would have the opportunity to exploit what was seen as division within the Labor Party and that he would ram home what he believed was our inability to lead this country. What a difference 24 hours makes. Within 24 hours that grin was wiped off the Prime Minister's face. Once again the Prime Minister is faced with a situation—like the one he faced in the week of the opening of parliament this year—where he has to accept Labor's initiatives, which he will inevitably do, on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I will go on to that in a second.
The Prime Minister was already prepared to accept our amendments on local content. What a marvellous backflip that was from the Prime Minister. Within 12 hours he agreed to do that one on the local content, and almost for a week he has been strung out and wandering out there wondering what to do next in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That is exactly where we are at the moment. What a difference 24 hours makes. You thought you were coming back to this parliament to exploit the divisions within this party. You thought that would lead you to be, towards the end of this week or maybe the end of next week, in a perfect position to call an election because you would be on a high. Haven't you been given the raw end of the pineapple? You have found yourselves in a situation where it has all backfired on you. 
Politics is sometimes a matter of luck, but all this year this coalition have had no luck at all. Every which way the chessboard has been played we have been able to outmanoeuvre them—on each and every occasion. They let go the opportunity they had to use a perceived division within the Labor Party. Where is it now? They are on the back foot. They are the ones that have lost the initiative. They are the ones that are yet again having to come up with suggestions from the Labor Party for how to get themselves out of this impasse. Once again they have demonstrated that they are not capable to continue in power. After not using that opportunity they had, you would think those coalition MPs in marginal seats would be gnashing their teeth. I like to always think of the expression, `If you cannot look after yourself, how can you look after anybody else?' That is exactly where the coalition have got themselves at this stage. They cannot look after themselves. They are out there meandering about wondering where they will go next.
There were two elements to the free trade agreement that we found objectionable. The Labor senators on the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America made this recommendation on local content:
... that Australia's local content requirements for free-to-air television, subscription television and radio be enshrined in legislation, so that reductions in these quotas require reference to the Parliament.
There was concern that the ratchet nature of Australia's local content regulations would endanger local content on television and radio in the future. Labor's proposed amendment to ensure local content in legislation is an entirely sensible measure to ensure that local content requirements can only be changed by the parliament of Australia. Currently the Australian content standard for commercial television, known as the Broadcasting Services (Australian Content) Standard 1999, regulates the amount of local content on free-to-air television. This is reviewed regularly. While it is informed by legislation, the local content quotas themselves are not enshrined in legislation.
The Prime Minister quickly agreed to this amendment. Despite all his protesting and his demands that the Australian people and the parliament simply trust his opinion on the benefits of the free trade agreement, he speedily acquiesced to Labor's recommendations regarding local content. That demonstrates that the Senate's committee process was useful. Why did he do it so quickly? I think we know. He did not want all those actors walking around the marginal seats raising concerns about local content. That is why he speedily agreed to it. He did not want actors like Toni Collette or Geoffrey Rush going out doorknocking in some of the marginal seats across this country. So of course he made an opportunistic decision, thinking that would be smart enough to put us in a bind. Hasn't that backfired on the coalition?
The significant difference between ourselves and the coalition on the free trade agreement—and the one that will matter most to Australians' hip pockets—is on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. While it is good for Australia that the Prime Minister has agreed to Labor's position on local content rules, the one remaining hurdle is our proposed change to patent rules applying to pharmaceuticals. As we know, the big issue in this is evergreening. Just to remind people, evergreening is a process by which patent-holding pharmaceutical companies lodge new patents to prevent the production of generic forms of drugs. In cases where the patent for a drug is due to expire, pharmaceutical companies will lodge a fresh application, sometimes on dubious grounds, in an attempt to perpetuate—or, as they call it, evergreen—their sole right to produce and sell the medicine concerned. 
There are a multitude of dubious patent applications which have been lodged in the United States, which demonstrates that this is a problem which could have a lasting effect on the accessibility of cheap, effective generic drugs in Australia. Often in the United States a fresh application for a patent will be lodged to change the use to being primarily for children rather than for adults, as the first patent stated. The new patent could be for the physical appearance of the pill or capsule itself rather than the chemical composition of the medicine. These sorts of spurious or dodgy applications have the potential to undermine Australia's access to cheap, effective drugs, because they slow the listing of generics on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
People need to take in the weight of what I said about what these pharmaceutical companies are up to. This is not something that could happen or something that happens only in the United States; this happens in the United States and in many other countries around the world. These huge and profitable pharmaceutical companies make sure that people have less access to cheap generic drugs. In this process of evergreening you can imagine people in the law firms in New York, Boston and London, quaffing back their Moet Chandon on a Friday afternoon wondering how they can make sure that they protect their clients, the big pharmaceutical companies. It can be as trivial as the size of a `new' product, its colour or, as I said, whether it is square, oblong or round. They may have put a band through the centre of it or two bands through the centre of it. This agreement would prevent—and we will look at Labor's amendment—Australians having access to these generic forms of drugs.
These are not just concerns that are rightly raised by Australian legislators. As I said at the commencement of my contribution, Senator Marshall no doubt had his staff look at some of the contributions made in the US Congress. I want to quote the three congressmen that Senator Marshall quoted in his contribution to this debate. Firstly, there was Mr Tom Allen, a US congressman. He said:
... I question whether it is appropriate to use trade policy to interfere in other nations' health systems. We certainly wouldn't accept such a demand from other countries.
That was said in the US Congress by a US congressman, querying why they were doing something to one of their allies. Let me quote Mr Henry Waxman, yet another congressman. He said:
Domestic healthcare policy should not be decided in trade agreements.
I agree with that. He continued:
It is wrong for us to interfere with another country's domestic health policy, particularly when it comes to the affordability of medicine which is an equally sensitive issue here in the United States. This is special interest policy making at its worst. The Bush Administration is letting the pharmaceutical industry use trade agreements to manipulate the drug laws of the United States and other countries in ways that the industry could not otherwise achieve.
This is nirvana for these greedy pharmaceutical companies—a nirvana that is being legislated by the United States government and acquiesced in by their sycophants here in Australia. Let me read what Mr Mark Udall, yet another US congressman, said in relation to the free trade agreement and its impact on the pharmaceutical industry:
I am concerned about the potential precedent of the Administration meddling excessively in the internal affairs of a trading partner. With regard to this treaty, the USTR initially sought substantial changes in Australia's drug-pricing program. Though the USTR was not completely successful, the agreement does give U.S. drug companies more say in what drugs are included under Australia's universal drug coverage program. While market access for U.S. goods is important, we shouldn't be in the business of bullying the world and potentially undermining a country's ability to provide prescription drugs to its citizens.  
Nowhere in the debate so far have I heard any reassurances from the government spokespeople that if we were to pass this legislation without the foreshadowed Labor amendments we would not be suffering in the long term from being denied access to generic drugs and damaging our current pharmaceutical benefits system.
Recommendations 19 through to 25 by the Labor senators dealt with their concerns in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits aspect of this legislation. In fact, Labor's amendment will be coming out shortly. It will not be just the tap on the hand approach that has been put forward by the coalition to deal with people who would try to prevent access to generic drugs. Our amendment will be strong, as our shadow minister, Ms Gillard, has said, and it will have in it punitive actions for people who do this. 
Finally, I want to make a comment in relation to tainted blood and the free trade agreement. Labor senators recommended that, consistent with the terms of the free trade agreement, the Commonwealth ensure that the following occur whenever possible: all blood products to be used in the Australian medical system must be sourced from Australian blood plasma; Australian blood plasma must continue to be collected by voluntary donation; if plasma fractionation is to occur outside Australia then Australian plasma should be processed on separate production lines; and if plasma fractionation occurs outside Australia then overseas suppliers must satisfy at least the same level of medical standards that apply to Australian suppliers. The Senate has just conducted an inquiry into what we call `tainted blood', hepatitis C and people who acquired hepatitis C via blood transfusions. The level of infection in this country is nowhere like the level of infection in the United States because of the fact that we still have a voluntary system in this country rather than the system in the United States, where people are paid for the blood they donate for use in transfusions. 
I started off my contribution by giving you an anecdote about the Leader of the Opposition and about the view of people who wish to make sure that our country is left in safe hands. I know that when the amendments come before the Senate and the House of Representatives the government will probably have to accept them in the end, because, as you would be well aware, Mr Deputy President, we are saying to them that this is the way to get this bill passed. The government are also being told this by their business masters. In fact, the Business Council of Australia has told them to pass them, the Australian Industry Group has told them to pass them and the Australian Medical Association has told them to pass them. The Australian Medical Association commented that Labor's enabling legislation would make generic drugs more freely available or at least make sure that there were no flaws or snags along the way. That is exactly what the Australian Medical Association said in relation to Labor's proposed amendments. In conclusion, you might have thought the coalition were walking into a great week last week. Didn't it turn sour very quickly? It will continue to turn sour on them, because they have lost the touch.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-09,"—I am pleased to conclude the second reading debate and to take the opportunity to thank all honourable senators for their contributions. The debate has gone considerably longer than was expected to allow the Labor Party further drafting time for its patent amendment. I noticed that the speaking list was added to this morning to allow yet further hours. It seems astonishing to me that, if Labor were to come up with a worthwhile idea, it would take it so long to produce that idea in written form. We all know, in fact, that it has run into great difficulty in that regard. 
We believe that this is a historic moment and a historic debate. It is a debate on enabling legislation that will allow this country in turn to put the US-Australia free trade agreement into operation. It is an agreement that has been negotiated between the two governments of Australia and the United States of America that gives the Australian export industry an opportunity to significantly grow its exports into the largest and most dynamic country in the world. We know that it would not have been achieved by a Labor government, because, of course, Labor do not believe in bilateral trade agreements. They believe in putting all their eggs in the multilateral basket. If that does not succeed then these opportunities simply will not come about.
By contrast, the coalition government, being much more pragmatic, took the opportunity to seize a range of different bilateral trade agreements: one with Singapore, the Thailand trade agreement and now the US one. We are making significant progress with ASEAN as well. Further down the track we will look at the sorts of opportunities that China is going to present. So, yes, we on this side of the chamber are prepared to take the benefits and opportunities that flow from multilateral trade reform, but we are not so much purists that we will forgo the opportunity to take significant advantages if they present in the bilateral form.
I have to say that there were many who believed that it would be impossible, particularly within this time frame, to negotiate such an agreement with the United States. The fact that it was successful is a great credit to Minister Vaile and to the Australian negotiators, and I am particularly pleased with the reception it received after endorsement by the administration in the United States. The reception in the Congress was overwhelming. I think somebody said that it is the best vote that a bilateral trade agreement has ever received. I think that in part reflects the very close and positive relations between the two countries, which have clearly also been enhanced by the Howard government.
So it is a very important moment. Legislatively we are looking at locking in an agreement which we believe will give a $6 billion benefit to the economy annually after year 10. That is $57.5 billion over 20 years. It can produce another 30,000 jobs for the Australian community. It reflects the approach that our government has taken to the economy: to get the fundamentals right, keep interest rates down, keep inflation down and steady, and free up the industrial relations system so that business will grow and be in a position to take new opportunities as they present. On the other side of the ledger, we look to facilitate greater opportunity in export markets, of which this bilateral agreement with the United States presents the greatest opportunity of all.
That is why this agreement and this legislation are so important to the coalition. They will give the Australian economy the opportunity for significant growth in the future and for many more thousands of Australians to obtain worthwhile employment. They will significantly build on the economic successes of the last 8½ years. It is true that we said that in this negotiation there were a number of areas that we would need to protect, areas that are vitally important to this country for a range of different reasons. Certainly we wanted the expanded economic opportunity—but not at any price. Of course, an example of that is in relation to quarantine. We were not prepared to sacrifice the Australian quarantine system and the safeguards that are so important in that regard, and we succeeded in protecting the Australian quarantine system. 
Secondly, we were obviously interested in preserving what we referred to as `the cultural sector in Australia' from a much larger economy whilst recognising that we do not want to be too protective because we want our cultural industries to be able to invest in the United States. We succeeded in doing that in these negotiations and I think it was a very good outcome in that regard. Thirdly, we said that the PBS was sacrosanct and that we were not going to put in jeopardy the protection Australians have for reasonably priced medicines through the PBS. We succeeded in negotiating this agreement without putting in jeopardy that system and all of the benefits it has that we treasure.
Labor, for its purposes—and after it had been through many months of agony on this matter, agony demonstrated through the Senate committee inquiry as well as through the joint inquiry and through various public manifestations—decided that it really had no choice but to support the agreement. In fact, the Australian Labor Party would have looked ridiculous—there is no doubt about that—if, after the endorsement that the agreement received by the US Congress, it had gone out and voted down this opportunity of another 30,000 Australian jobs, apart from all of the other benefits.
Not surprisingly, Labor, wanting to salvage a few political points, picked up one recommendation of the joint committee in relation to the audiovisual sector. I have to say that I found that interesting because, during the many months of deliberation on this matter, Labor seemed to dismiss the considerations of the joint committee, which was actually set up for the specific purpose of examining prospective treaties, saying that, rather, it needed to rely upon a separate Senate committee. When it came to the crunch, it referred back to the joint committee to find a recommendation that was supported by both sides to justify an amendment to further entrench in law the audiovisual protections. We are prepared to come on board. We may not have thought that it was necessary and we may well have thought that the existing system provided the protection that was necessary, but we can accommodate that and we have put forward an amendment to do so.
As to the second area in which Labor thought that it might be able to seize a short-term political benefit, it was argued that in some way this agreement provided a disincentive for the growth of generic drugs, that that would produce a cost pressure and that therefore, by amending the Australian Patents Act to address unsatisfactory practices that occur overseas but that do not occur in Australia, the potential for growth in the generics sector would be supported. That was, of course, a nonsense as the Australian patents system works well. There is not the same opportunity for abuse as exists within the United States, Canada and some other places. Nevertheless, it was a line that could be spun, and it was spun by Mr Latham, that this would be an amendment that would in some way look to ensure lower priced drugs.
I have to say that this government, in its support for the PBS, has also strongly supported drugs at an affordable price. There is no benefit for this government in drugs that are going to become unaffordable, but you need to approach that in two ways. Firstly, you have got to provide the incentives for the pharmaceutical sector to develop new products. Secondly, you have got to ensure that those incentives are not such that they are unfair to the ultimate growth of generics and with the downward cost pressures that they can introduce into the marketplace. It has been the view of this government that that has worked well for Australia and will continue to work well for Australia, but Mr Latham said no, it could only be safeguarded by an amendment. We have waited all of last week and all of today so far for this magic amendment. As Mr Howard said, when the amendment is put on the table it will be considered. We badly want this agreement to pass, for all the benefits that I outlined in the second reading speech. We will approach the debate in the committee stage on that basis: always constructive and helpful but certainly not wanting to see the destruction of the patents system to achieve that goal. It is in that spirit that we will approach the committee debate. I thank the Senate for its patience and with that conclude my second reading presentation. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-08-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked by Senators Collins, Crossin and Moore today relating to carer allowance for children with disabilities and to debt recovery.
The issues involved here are further examples of government misrepresentation and politicisation of the Public Service. Looking at the article in today's Australian newspaper referring to carers and the freedom of information request, I could easily characterise this as volume 4, chapter 186 of the politicisation of the public sector. The case highlights the callous disregard for the circumstances of a family with one baby and acknowledges that even though this child, who required far more medical treatment and remedial treatment than perhaps a child with Down syndrome, was excluded from carer allowance provisions under the government's new regime there was very little regard for what would occur with that child. 
Perhaps of greater concern in this piece is a different aspect. Highlighted in a communication from Peter Fisher, a senior Centrelink bureaucrat, is the phrase:
We should have a knowledge of this—
this was the Asperger syndrome issue of last year—
and a line to peddle on Saturday.
Where have we gotten to so that senior public sector bureaucrats refer to each other and senior Department of Family and Community Services officials with respect to the lines they need to peddle? We know where we are: we now have these senior bureaucrats thinking that to preserve their occupations they need to peddle lines for this government.
Today, the day after 43 former military chiefs and senior diplomats accused the Prime Minister of going to war with Iraq based on a deception and of making Australia a bigger terrorist target, we can see quite clearly that these misrepresentations go well beyond the areas of foreign affairs. All Australians are familiar with the `children overboard' affair and other areas of foreign affairs where concerns have been raised, but this is a very good example of how these concerns extend into areas such as social benefits. It has taken a formal freedom of information process to uncover the truth about how this government were planning to remove 30,000 families from the $90 per fortnight carer allowance. Last year Labor discovered in the government's budget figures that that was how they had costed it. That was the reduction anticipated by this government into future years. Surprise, surprise: perhaps this is the reason the government no longer provide family and community services forward estimates. Those forward estimates highlight the assumptions that the government are making based on the cuts that they intend to make.
The estimate that came out of those figures corresponded to their review of 70,000 families who received carer allowance for their disabled children. The figures seem to confirm to Labor that 30,000 of those 70,000 families would lose this important payment when they are reassessed under the government's tough new disability rules. Senator Patterson got up today and said that Labor had agreed to a review. Yes, we had agreed to a review. What we have not agreed to is their tough new disability rules. That is what this whole debate had been about. When we raised this issue with Senator Vanstone her response was to deal with our questions with utter scorn. It was claimed that Labor were scaremongering, that there was no target for removing payments and that the figure of 30,000 for those that were likely to be removed from the payment just simply was not relevant. What Senator Vanstone did not say was that she had estimates from her own department that 36,000 people would lose the payment.
What else Senator Vanstone did not say was that the Prime Minister was fully briefed on this issue as well. For the Prime Minister to say on Alan Jones's program that he had only just recently had this issue raised with him defies all credibility. As a result of this freedom of information request, we now know that he had very clear and comprehensive advice on the issues and the problems involved here months ahead. But, of course, this is not strange for the Prime Minister who was once known as `honest John'. I ask senators in this chamber whether they can recall the last time anyone referred to our Prime Minister as `honest John'. I suggest it was many years ago, and even then it was obviously a charade. The truth in this case of the government's decision to redefine what constitutes a disability has forced tens of thousands of families off the carer allowance. Nothing in this recent budget is going to compensate for that.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2004-08-09,"—We have Senator Collins, the shadow minister, coming in here every week, having been on the opposition benches and in the portfolio for quite some time, unable to produce an opposition policy. We are probably only a couple of weeks out from the calling of an election and all she can do is come in here, screech like a banshee and walk out. She reads a speech that has been prepared for her by somebody else and then just struts out. I do not think it would be unreasonable to expect this honourable senator, if she is going to be an honourable senator, to be honourable with the Australian public and—instead of coming in here whingeing, whining and grizzling—to actually present an alternative policy. But there are no policies.
One must ask: when is this Labor opposition ever going to prepare any policies? This government has increased carer payments and allowances far beyond what was ever provided by Labor in government. They had 13 years to develop good policy in this area and did not. Thanks to the Howard government, we now have the carer payment being provided to approximately 84,000 people at a cost of nearly $830 million this year alone, and the carer allowance being provided to nearly 300,000 people at the cost of nearly $770 million in 2003-04.
What are the opposition going to do? They do not know. They have no idea. But they come in here and they make up stories about what may or may not have happened. They make up stories about the disabled; they make up stories about the aged. This is fear politics. They figure that if they go out there and make people fearful about their entitlements they will somehow vote for this bunch of turkeys over here that cannot come up with a policy, cannot come up a tax policy—
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I hope Senator Knowles is not reflecting on people on this side of the chamber in any way.
—Senator Knowles, in the interest of the conduct of the chamber it might be better if you withdraw that statement.
—If they are that precious, I am happy to withdraw it—absolutely happy. But it certainly drives home the point of the preciousness of the opposition. We have a situation in where they cannot possibly come up with policies. We are talking about a very special group of people today. We are talking about those people who receive carer payments and carer allowances and we are talking about disabled people. I work very closely with a number of disabled people in the community. Do you know what they have said repeatedly? They have said that the Labor government in those 13 years never delivered what they get today. And yet here we have the Labor opposition coming in here minus policies and any alternatives other than to whinge, grizzle and gripe. I think that is unacceptable in this day and age when people demand more information and rightfully expect more information. Yet the Labor Party cannot deliver it. The Howard government has always been committed to focusing on people with disabilities because they are a very important group of people whom the Labor government let fall between the stools. They are not allowed to do that any more. They and their carers are being carefully watched, managed and supported, particularly through the way in which they can get allowances. 
I have been particularly concerned that state responsibility in this area has gone backwards since we have had Labor states. All they want to do is shift the blame onto the Commonwealth government. It is about time that governments got together and supported the people who need carers and those with disabilities. It is not about time for this Labor opposition to come in here minus policies and continue to constantly threaten and harass those most vulnerable people in our community.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2004-08-09,"—We have got another litany of excuses and fables really from people on the government about this matter concerning the carer allowance and people who have a disability. Really, it is another example of a government that refuses to accept responsibility for its decisions and the impact of its policies, and a perfect example today of a government that distorts the truth in order to protect itself. Some years ago, a government being accused of being loose with the truth might have occurred fairly irregularly. It is almost a daily occurrence now with the Howard government. The feedback from the doorsteps, the street stalls and at market stalls is quite clearly that the Australian public do not trust this government. This is another perfect example of why that is the case.
Senator Knowles would allege that we are making up stories. There is no story to be made up here. The figures are before us in absolute black and white today. It is unfortunate that it has taken a freedom of information action on behalf of one of Australia's national newspapers to uncover the truth, but that is the issue, isn't it? You have to wait a number of months or weeks before events unfurl before your eyes with this government, before we have a Senate committee or a newspaper or before someone takes action to peel away the layers of deceit and mistrust in this government and finally uncovers the real story.
We had a situation last year where there was a review of the carer payment and the eligibility of certain disabilities to be either on or off the list. We now know, of course, that information was requested and provided not just to the Minister for Family and Community Services but to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet almost two months before the Labor Party started asking questions and three months before the Prime Minister told Alan Jones on air, as Senator Collins said, that he knew next to nothing about what was going on. This is a government that did know, lied about what it knew and tried to hide what it knew. Senator Vanstone stood in this chamber on at least two occasions and again misled the Senate and the Australian people—this is another example—by denying that this government was about to strip the allowances of 30,000 carers. It turns out, of course, that it was 36,000 carers. The truth is the government's decision to redefine what constitutes a disability forced tens of thousands of families off the carer allowance.
I remember at the time doing some work with people in the Northern Territory who belonged to the Down Syndrome Association. They were most concerned that they were going to be taken off the list. The question that I alluded to today was that there were six conditions that were automatic qualifiers for the carer payment. We now know that they were chosen in part because they were able to get organised and they were able to get motivated. They had the loudest and noisiest concerns, so it seems with this government that the squeakiest wheel does get the grease, that the organisations that could lobby the hardest and were motivated got put on the list somehow. I am not saying that is not fair, but what about all the other disabilities that were absolutely ignored—for example, the claims about children with insulin dependent diabetes?
I am not entirely sure about the groups Senator Knowles is referring to, but a lot of people I come across who have children with disabilities or who work with people with disabilities say that they would have been eligible for the carer allowance. It is not that they did not bother to apply; it is just that the form was totally inadequate, was time consuming or did not provide them with enough space to clearly explain why they needed the carer payment. The process was made more difficult for people and it was a very frustrating process, but at the end of the day, even if you bothered to apply, most of your disabilities were cut off the list. This is a government that continues not to tell the truth. It is a government that continues to deny the most needy people in our society the help and assistance they want.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2004-08-09,"—Not only has Senator Crossin's time expired; her arguments have expired as well. In fact, these arguments have been so long left mouldering on a shelf somewhere that they stink quite heavily. We see the Labor Party trot them out from time to time and air them around the chamber, and they do not smell any better with age. The fact is that we have here an attempt by the Labor Party to discredit the achievements of this government with respect to enhancing the security of Australian families, and to do so they are resorting to almost every trick in the book. They are blowing up and exaggerating cases where possibly administrative failure has occurred. They are making much of supposed contemplated changes in the system, which actually do not translate into any adverse outcomes for Australian families or for individuals entitled to particular allowances.
Today we have heard much made of the fact that there was a difference in the projection of people affected of between 35,000 and 36,000. I do not think that is exactly riveting the families of Australia. It is not exactly generating much discussion around dinner tables and barbecues in this country. We are told that the form the government used to allow people to advise them of changes was totally inadequate. I ask senators opposite to step back a moment from what they are doing and to look at the big picture of what has happened to Australian families in the last eight years. It is hard to imagine any family or individual receiving benefits in this country through Centrelink who is not better off in real terms under this government and who has not had a substantial, measurable improvement in their condition as a result of what this government has done.
Let us make allowances for inflation and things like that and compare the condition of people on disability support benefits back in 1996 to that of the same people today. Look at the condition of people receiving family benefits in 1996 and today. Look at unemployment benefits in 1996 and today. Each of those groups of individuals or families has had a substantial increase in its position as a result of what this government has done, yet somehow the Labor Party continue to focus on the minutiae, on the irrelevant and on the untruthful in order to make their point. We even had the shadow Treasurer not long ago, the man who purports to want to manage the $800 billion Australian economy, make the claim that 8.5 million Australian families missed out on any benefit in the 2004-05 budget. That is a pretty interesting claim, because, according to the latest census data, there are only 4.9 million Australian families. Where the figure of 8.5 million Australian families missing out comes from, I do not know.
The Labor Party are in overdrive when it comes to distortion and misrepresentation at this time and the question needs to be asked: what is Labor's alternative? We are not at some abstract point in the debate where it is fair enough just to throw criticisms around; we are a matter of weeks potentially from going to the Australian community and asking for judgment. The Australian community will expect not only to judge the record of this government but also to see what are the alternatives of the alternative government—if I can use that grandiose title to describe those opposite. What are those alternatives? Of course, we do not know. We do not know what they are proposing and what they would do differently. They would do it better apparently, but what that means we do not know. They are focusing on eligibility, breaching and things like that. Tell us what you are going to do. Are you not going to penalise or ask for some accounting from those who receive payments illegitimately or illegally under the terms of the Australian law? Is that your position? We want to know, and I think the Australian community is entitled to know. As I said, there would be no Australian family not better off under this government's social security arrangements when compared with those of the former government. Until they come up with the goods on their policies, I think we are entitled to take what they say with a massive grain of salt.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2004-08-09,"—I also am taking note of the answers given in question time this afternoon by the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson. In some of her responses, Minister Patterson accused the ALP of scaremongering, running a fear campaign and making up issues around the responses to the recent reviews of the disability pension, particularly the specific issue of carers. It is not a scare campaign, Minister. The issues and concerns that we are raising are those that have been raised with us by members of the community—families, friends and indeed, as Senator Knowles referred to, some of the most vulnerable people in our community. They came to their members of parliament and they raised their concerns about what they saw as an attack on their role and entitlement with somehow a view that they were not fulfilling a worthy task and were somehow taking down the government. They raised with us the fear that the complexity of the form gave them little chance to justify their role and their entitlement to a payment from their government.
The minister accused us of not supporting a review that we passed through legislation. As Senator Collins pointed out, we did support a review. A review process is a natural part of any legislation that is looking at entitlement. What we and the people who came to our offices are concerned about is not the fact of a review but the motivation behind the review. What is the intent of the review? Is it really to look after the people who are taking on a caring role in our community? Is it really to ensure that they are receiving appropriate payments and support from their government? Or is it a blatant attack to save money, to knock entitlements off people so that the government will then have more money? In terms of the process, we are talking about an appropriate review, one to ensure that people understand their rights, take part in the process effectively, are actively engaged with the department—in this case, Centrelink, through the Department of Family and Community Services—and are fully aware of their entitlements and responsibilities.
We need to understand the process and to work effectively with members of the community, not make them feel as though they are victims and not make them feel as though they are criminals. In this process is it right then for the minister to say that a certain number of people—and the numbers just flow off the tongue every time we hear a response, but it was several thousand people—did not bother to respond? Do we know why they did not bother to respond? Did we follow up more effectively than just by another letter in the mail? To just keep sending written information is not the way to ensure that people communicate, particularly given the time frames and workloads that some of these people have. 
To a specific question this afternoon on the data-matching and debt recovery processes which may be occurring throughout the rest of this year, the minister—almost biblically—responded `not at all' twice. Twice the minister was asked whether she or her office were aware of any plans to delay data matching or debt recovery for the rest of the year. In response to that question—twice—the minister told us what data matching was. The minister told us how important debt recovery was. We know that, Minister. Because we have been through numerous Senate estimates processes, we know how important to the department effective debt recovery processes are, how much planning is involved and how many resources are required to make an effective calendar, ensuring that the appropriate processes are put in place. What we wanted to know was what processes were in place throughout the rest of the year. We did not get an answer. What we were told was that the department was the one that would have these processes in hand. What we want to know is what processes are in hand and what is going to happen in the areas of debt recovery and data matching for the rest of this year. The minister said that she never takes anything that the ALP says on face value. What we are wanting to know, Minister, is exactly what is happening. What are the motivations of the reviews that are going on? What indeed was the motivation of the attacks on the carer pension in the last year? Do not take us on face value, Minister; just simply respond to the questions that we ask and to the questions to which the carers and families of Australia deserve to know the answers.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-08-09,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need to:
	(a)	acknowledge the finding of the High Court on 6 August 2004 that it is constitutional and lawful under the Migration Act to keep a person in detention indefinitely even where there is no real likelihood of that person being able to be deported from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future; and
	(b)	act immediately to amend the Migration Act to make it unlawful for a minister to be able to keep a person detained indefinitely even where there is no real likelihood of that person being able to be deported in the reasonably foreseeable future.
This is, without doubt, an extraordinarily urgent matter and I think many Australians—and, I suspect, many in this parliament—do not fully appreciate the seriousness of the situation. Following the 4-3 decision of the High Court it is now law in this country—and to be technical it was not law until Friday because previously there was a standing decision of the Federal Court to the contrary—that a person can be kept in migration detention indefinitely even when they have said that they want to be deported, even when the Australian government has tried for a prolonged period of time, without success, to deport them, and when there is no real likelihood of that person being able to be deported in the reasonably foreseeable future. Even in such circumstances that person can be kept locked up indefinitely. It is quite literally a life sentence or a potential life sentence for a person who has not been charged and who has not been tried—without any scope for judicial oversight of that detention. That is obviously extremely serious and extremely distressing. To use the words of one of the High Court judges who ruled in favour of the government, it is a tragic situation for the people concerned—and the person concerned in this case.
It is, I suggest, an extremely serious situation for the entire Australian community because we now have a situation where a government minister can deny freedom to a person, can lock them up for administrative purposes indefinitely, without recourse to the courts, without charge, as long as they can get an act through the parliament that gives them that power and that power relates to one of the heads of power in the Constitution. We have an act such as that today, which is the Migration Act, that gives the power to keep a person in administrative detention forever, even if they cannot be deported. That act gives that power to a government minister. It also means that it is now lawful if a government can get a law through this parliament in a whole range of other areas, and the obvious immediate potential is in the area of security and all the so-called antiterrorist legislation that is being passed, with a clear head of power for the government to act in that area. It would be lawful, if a relevant act empowered the government to do so, to detain someone indefinitely without charge on the grounds of security and public safety. I believe that is something that the vast majority of Australians would find extremely concerning and I believe it is not what the parliament could possibly have envisaged when it passed this particular section of the Migration Act back in 1992. 
I should emphasise that the Democrats strongly oppose mandatory detention and we strongly oppose keeping people in detention any longer than is necessary, but under the act as it stands the purpose of detention is to keep people in detention whilst their claim for a visa is being assessed and to keep them available for deportation as soon as is practicable. The problem for the people involved in the cases before the High Court—and a range of other people—is that it is not practicable at any stage in the foreseeable future for those people to be deported. So the purpose of keeping them in detention so they can be deported as soon as practicable, I would have thought, becomes void. I submit that that would have been the intention of the parliament when this piece of legislation was passed. But we never know, of course, and the fact is that the High Court has ruled otherwise, so my opinion of what the intention of the parliament might have been and my opinion about how the act should be interpreted does not matter. The High Court have spoken, as they have the power to do under the Constitution, and they have interpreted the law to allow the government of the day to keep a person in administrative detention indefinitely.
Today in question time the minister said, `We have got a safety valve because we have got ministerial discretion, so is not forever because the minister can let a person out.' They can, but they do not have to, and there is no legal avenue anyone can pursue to compel them to let that person out. There are people now in detention, from even before this decision—because the government was resisting the interpretation of the law as it previously stood—who have been there for one, two, three or four years who have signed a piece of paper saying: `Deport me. I am willing to go. Send me back.' And the Australian government has not been successful in sending them anywhere, so they have been detained. There is a person in Baxter, Mr Kassim, who has been in detention since 1998. He has submitted to go back. He is originally from the disputed region of Kashmir but has not been able to obtain travel documents and has not been accepted by the government over there, so he is perpetually locked up. Can any of us imagine what it would be like to have to face that scenario? What would it be like to be a human being denied your freedom, caught in the ultimate bureaucratic catch-22 and imprisoned for the foreseeable future without any legal avenue to pursue?
This undermines one of the most fundamental principles that our country and our rule of law are built upon: the right to freedom. Freedom from arbitrary imprisonment by an executive government is one that is now clearly at risk. There is a wide range of issues that could flow on from this. The bill of rights debate needs to be explored again. But all this motion seeks to say is that this decision indicates an interpretation of the law that the Democrats believe goes far too far and that we should immediately reverse that and enable a person to be freed from detention if there is no prospect of them being deported in the foreseeable future. There are plenty of other things that we believe should happen, but that simple fact, that simple situation, that people should not be condemned to the prospect of perpetual detention without any recourse to a court, should be removed.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2004-08-09,"—Senator Bartlett raises some really important issues this afternoon. Let me join him on the most important of them. What the High Court decided was that failed asylum seekers—that is, those people who have no right to be in this country—who cannot be deported immediately from Australia can be held in detention until there is a place to which they can be deported. In other words, unlawful noncitizens can be detained until they are either deported or removed or a visa is found for them. It is that simple. People who are not entitled to be here can remain in detention, full stop. Despite the outrage expressed by Senator Bartlett, we are talking about people who arrived in this country seeking asylum, whose cases have been often exhaustively examined—sometimes over months or, indeed, years—and who have gone through all the appeal processes and been found not to qualify for refugee status. In summary, these people have no legal right to remain in Australia. The reason they cannot be deported immediately is either that they are stateless or there is insufficient identification to ascertain their country of origin. What Senator Bartlett's amendment proposes is that it should be illegal for the government to detain those people if we cannot deport them in the reasonably foreseeable future. What Senator Bartlett is saying is that people who are not refugees—those people who have gone through the process and do not qualify as refugees—who have no right to be here, should be set free, at large in the community, if we cannot deport them straightaway.
My friend and colleague Senator Brandis will discuss the High Court's decision later. Let me draw on one quick quote from Justice Callinan in the al-Khafaji case. This goes to the heart of the matter. In relation to the relevant sections of the Migration Act, Justice Callinan says:
The statutory language here is specific and clear. It gives effect to the difference in status between aliens and citizens. Such curtailment of freedom as occurs—
it occurs—
occurs for a statutory purpose within constitutional power only. People who do not have valid claims to refugee status or to whom the nation owes no obligations of protection take the risk in unlawfully entering the country that they will be detained. It is difficult to believe that they can have any different understanding. If they do, ignorance of the Australian law can afford them no greater excuse than it would an Australian citizen.
People coming into this country cannot expect, if they have no right to be here, to be at liberty in this community. Let me just say that again, because that is the nub of it: people who come here and have no right to be here cannot expect to be at liberty in our community. That is the argument in a sentence.
Let me concentrate very briefly on the public policy impacts of Senator Bartlett's proposition. There are several of them, but let me come to the crux. If Senator Bartlett's amendment became law, what consequences would it have? Mr Acting Deputy President, imagine you are an asylum seeker who has not been granted refugee status in Australia and all your avenues of appeal have been exhausted. According to Senator Bartlett, you should be set free until such time as we can find a country for you to be deported to. He is saying, `We'll let you out into the community, but come and see us when we've found you a country that you can be deported to.' Is that going to work? What sort of public policy answer is that? According to him, we should let people into the community and, as soon as we have found a place they can be deported to, say, `Come and check in at the police station so we can send you back to a country where you may not necessarily want to go.' It is not even a practical outcome. It is not going to work. 
Secondly, it would create an unfair new migration category of people who cannot stay in Australia because they have not satisfied the requirements under any of the migration streams but who are nevertheless allowed to stay because no-one wants them. Is that fair? In this country we have one of the most generous refugee programs in the world. During 2003-04, over 13,000 humanitarian program visas were granted—the greatest number in eight years. Eighty-five per cent of those were dedicated to people being resettled from refugee situations overseas—people often living in really desperate circumstances in places like the Kakuma camp in Kenya; not people that came here, sought refugee status and had that status denied. There are so many other people—desperate people—that want to come to this country. What this country will not allow—cannot allow, of course—is queue jumpers.
Ultimately, Australia has an obligation to make sure that failed asylum seekers are safe and secure—I accept that; we all do—but not that they are at liberty. I accept that failed asylum seekers should not be pushed out of Australia if we do not know where they come from, but that does not mean they should be set free among the community. My friend Senator Bartlett has been busy the last few days in the press. An article on page 6 of the Canberra Times on Saturday said:
Senator Bartlett said the court had unfortunately found that the Government had the power to lock up for the rest of their lives people who had committed no crime.
That is right: they have committed no crime, but they also have no right to be here. They may have committed no crime, but they have no right to be in this country. That is why they will be deported as soon as a place can be found, and that is why the government believes they should be held in detention until then. Finally, the article continued:
“The potential for this massive increase in government power, without legal protection, is chilling,” he said.
There is no increase in government power at all. This, of course, is Labor legislation dating, I think, from 1992. These are Labor provisions. In the end, there is always ministerial discretion. As Senator Vanstone said today, ministerial discretion can take care of those genuine cases where people cannot find a country to go to and where humanitarian reasons mean that ministerial discretion should be accorded.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Immigration: Detainees</title>,Matters of Urgency,13,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-08-09,"—by leave—I move:
Omit all words after paragraph (a), substitute:
(b)	acknowledge that the High Court in its finding was dealing with the small number of cases who are regarded as `stateless';
(c)	acknowledge that the 4/3 finding, with the Chief Justice in the minority, reflects the very serious concern in the community of asylum seekers being detained for lengthy periods of time;
(d)	condemn the Government for its failures in the asylum seeker area, in particular, the lengthy detention of asylum seekers without review, the detention of children for lengthy periods, and its refusal until recently to contemplate graduated detention;
(e)	note that Labor's policy approach requires graduated detention and the ongoing monthly review of asylum seekers who are not finally assessed within 90 days of claiming asylum; 
(f)	believe that Labor's approach will ensure that the small number of failed asylum seekers who are `stateless' will not be left in limbo for lengthy periods of time;
(g)	believe that Labor's approach will ensure a case by case assessment of such cases, leading to settlement in a third party nation state, or the use in these cases of alternative forms of detention, including residential housing projects, supervision in the community or release into the Australian community on a temporary basis pursuant to the exercise of ministerial discretion; and
(h)	call on the minister to immediately review the two individuals concerned, with a view to deciding whether their continuing detention in Baxter detention centre is appropriate and in the public interest given their recent presence in the Australian community for 12 months on terms and conditions as set by the Federal Court.
Firstly, let me say that the High Court ruling made on Friday underlines the point which Labor supports—that detention in immigration detention centres can only be for immigration purposes, not for a punitive purpose. The four to three ruling of the High Court also underlines community concern at lengthy periods in detention without review. Senator Bartlett's motion seems to want to eliminate mandatory detention altogether, and that is something the Labor Party does not support. Unfortunately, Senator Bartlett is trying to use the narrow point the High Court was required to rule on to broaden the debate to one on the overall mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals.
The narrow point of the case before the High Court was whether the ability to resettle a stateless person, who cannot be returned to a state of origin, sees the immigration purposes ceasing and, therefore, the basis for detention disappearing when all efforts have been exhausted to settle that person in a third-party nation-state. This has always been a very difficult point in Australian immigration and migration administration, and generally it has been dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The difficulty of the issue has been heightened by this government's obsession to condone long-term immigration detention. 
The government has presided over a very bad period of immigration detention, in my view. The government's administration and policy on immigration detention have undermined the integrity of Australia's migration regime and have left it open to criticisms, such as allegations of punitive detention, by allowing lengthy periods of detention without graduation of detention or regular review. These criticisms go to the heart of the overwhelming problem of asylum seekers under the Howard government's regime. This government has taken the integrity out of Australia's approach. 
The High Court ruled by majority that keeping a stateless person in immigration detention indefinitely is not punitive. Under the Migration Act the government has the authority to detain a person for migration purposes—and Friday's decision more than reinforces that authority. It also provides the authority to detain a person who in all likelihood will not be returned to their country of origin or settled in a third nation-state. When it comes to stateless people, the options are to attempt to resettle them in a third-party nation-state or to make a judgment about a person's ongoing detention, such as an alternative form or graduation of detention or release into the community. The government has traditionally adopted a case-by-case assessment approach to detention, but not in this instance. 
The Senate Select Committee on Ministerial Discretion in Migration Matters highlighted the government's inability to understand the process and to ensure it has clear guidelines and operates in a fair, transparent way. This government has lacked integrity in this area—a lot of decisions have not been transparent and have been made behind closed doors. The Prime Minister, the former minister for immigration, Mr Ruddock—and it appears that the current minister is continuing in this vein—have allowed this system to fall by the wayside.  
Labor's approach is far more sensible. It advocates a case-by-case approach which will ensure that people are not lost in the system for long periods of time and that we have an immigration system of integrity that treats people with civility and dignity. It will also ensure that there is transparency and openness in the process. Under Labor's new policy approach there is a mechanism that deals with this difficult situation. Firstly, we believe strongly that immigration detention can only be for an immigration purpose. Secondly, we believe in graduations of detention—once an initial assessment has been completed, it is possible to contemplate graduations of detention such as residential housing projects, which we see at Port Augusta, and supervision in the community, which we have seen more recently from the government. 
We have also made it clear that one of the great problems with the government's very bad policy and administration in this area is that people are being left in limbo for long periods of time. That is why we have committed ourselves to a policy approach of 90 per cent of people being dealt with and finally assessed in 90 days and those people who cannot be assessed in that way being subject to a monthly review. That is the best way of ensuring that people are not lost in the system. As I understand the facts and circumstances of both Mr al-Kateb's and Mr al-Khafaji's cases, until the decision on Friday they had both been in the community for at least 12 months, under conditions provided by the court. 
I understand that Minister Vanstone is currently considering the case of these two persons, and I assume that is with respect to the terms of the discretion available to her as minister. However, another issue highlighted during the course of the select committee on ministerial discretion is that the basis upon which she makes the decision whether or not these persons should be granted discretion and be released—and the conditions that might also be attached—rests only in her mind; the decision that the minister makes is not transparent for this parliament to look at. In fact, if she did make that decision, I believe that we would get a pro forma report—not something with considered reasons why she made her decision—tabled in parliament in six months time.
I hope in truth that Minister Vanstone is now contemplating whether it is appropriate in accordance with the exercise of ministerial discretion that these two persons be released back into the community on similar terms and conditions. The minister must now make a judgment whether it is sensible to return these persons to Baxter at taxpayers' expense, given the fact that they have been in the community for at least 12 months, under various terms and conditions, or not to return them—in other words, to make or exercise her ministerial discretion. Under Labor the latter would happen. Labor would approach this in a much more humanitarian and different manner to that by which the present minister and the former minister have approached stateless persons. We would determine these matters, as I have stated earlier, on a case-by-case basis. 
The High Court, in this instance, has outlined—and enabled us to underscore in the debate that we are having today—that you can only detain people in immigration detention centres for an immigration purpose. The court has also ruled that, while the possibilities of returning a person to their country of origin or settling them in a third nation-state exist—regardless of how remote those possibilities are—a person can be detained for immigration purposes. But the 4-3 majority also reflects that the court shares the community's and my very grave concerns about people being detained for lengthy periods of time. 
Labor's approach is to ensure that 90 per cent of people are assessed in 90 days and that those who are not assessed on that basis and remain in immigration detention beyond that period are reviewed on a monthly basis. When you have a very small number of people who are stateless, you have to make a judgment as to whether it is possible to return them to a third-party nation-state. If it is not possible, you have to make a judgment on a case-by-case basis about different forms of detention—for example a residential housing project, supervision in the community in the case of these two appellants or releasing them into the Australian community on a temporary visa basis.
The decision will receive significant reading by more learned persons than me. Justice Gleeson said:
A more difficult question, which does not arise in the present case, concerns the power of a court to impose conditions or restraints in the case of a person who is shown to be a danger to the community or to be likely to abscond. It may be that the reason for difficulty in arranging for the removal of a detainee is that the detainee is regarded by his country of nationality, and other countries, as a dangerous person. Whether that could affect the detainee's right to be released from administrative detention, or the terms and conditions of release, is a matter that could arise for decision in another case.
The difference between the government's position and Labor's position is fundamental to the motion we are debating today. The High Court ruling made on Friday is indicative of what we have seen for the last eight years from this government. The government has presided over very bad policy and very bad administration in this area. It has allowed people to be lost in limbo. It has allowed people to be lost in the system. Essentially it has said that people can stay in Baxter for lengthy periods of time because this would somehow deter other people from coming to Australian shores.
In the course of this year we have seen Minister Vanstone subtly change from the previous minister's dogged approach to asylum seekers and to shift the emphasis to ministerial discretion, but there is no commitment from the government to change the system for the better. We have not seen a report of the Senate Select Committee on Ministerial Discretion in Migration Matters, and we do not know whether the government will act upon those very good recommendations of the committee. That, in truth, underlies this government. The government now has before it a report on ministerial discretion that includes recommendations to make the system more open, transparent and fairer for all. The government remains silent on the issue. There is no commitment from the government to change the system by way of legislation. Minister Vanstone has slipped people out from Baxter and from Nauru in the middle of the night, behind closed doors. We want to change the system for the better. That means, so far as detention is concerned, committing to graduations of detention and not to Senator Vanstone's whim. Labor's new processing system would see 90 per cent of people processed in 90 days.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2004-08-09,"—Last Friday the High Court gave its judgment in two consolidated appeals—al-Kateb and al-Khafaji. Although the facts were somewhat different, the cases raised a common question: what may one lawfully do under the Migration Act in the case of illegal entrants to Australia who have applied unsuccessfully for protection visas but who, because of their stateless condition, cannot be deported to another country; and, in particular, is it a misuse of the Commonwealth's power to keep such people in detention while attempts are made to find a destination to which they may be deported? The cases were resolved in favour of the government in both instances. 
We have heard a lot of rather emotional rhetoric from Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Bartlett about locking people up for life. The fact is that all that those cases decided was that it is not beyond the exercise of the Commonwealth's power to detain people for an indefinite period of time as a preliminary to seeking to deport them. As soon as a state can be found that will accept those two people, they will be deported. In fact, in both cases they sought to be deported, having exhausted their legal remedies under the Migration Act.
The facts were slightly different but the principal proceedings were the al-Kateb proceedings. Let me say something briefly about them. Mr al-Kateb arrived unlawfully in Australia by boat in December 2000. He is a stateless person. He was born in Kuwait of Palestinian parents. The government of Kuwait will not accept him, and the governing authorities of Palestine will not accept him either. He sought to be classified as a refugee and his application failed. He appealed that decision to the Refugee Review Tribunal, and his appeal was dismissed. He sought review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal in the Federal Court, and his review application failed. He then appealed that decision of the Federal Court to the full court of the Federal Court, and that appeal was dismissed. So there were four administrative or judicial determinations of Mr al-Kateb's claim for refugee status, and every one of them failed. You could not possibly say that he did not have the opportunity of a hearing. He then sought to challenge the relevant provisions of the Migration Act, not because he was a refugee but on the ground of habeas corpus.
Senator Mason made the point very well. It was also the point made in the leading judgment of the High Court by Justice Hayne, who pointed out:
The detention to be examined is not the detention of someone who, but for the fact of the detention, would have been, and been entitled to be, free in the Australian community.
We are dealing here with a person who came to Australia unlawfully, who took full and free advantage of the Australian law to seek to establish his status as a refugee and who failed on four consecutive occasions. So this is not a case of a man who is entitled to be considered to be a refugee. 
It is a hard case; I accept it is a hard case. It may very well—because of the element of hardship involved—be a proper case for the exercise of the ministerial discretion. Senator Vanstone indicated in question time today that she would consider the matter, and no doubt she will do so with care and sensitivity. Nevertheless, it remains that we are dealing with a person who came here unlawfully, not as a refugee, who failed on four consecutive occasions to establish their statutes as a refugee, who actually sought to be deported from Australia and who has no right or entitlement—as Senator Mason and Justice Hayne have both pointed out—to be at liberty in the Australian community. I think Justice Hayne put the question very well and very directly when he said in his judgment:  
It is essential to confront the contention that, because the time at which detention will end cannot be predicted, its indefinite duration (even, so it is said, for the life of the detainee) is or will become punitive. The answer to that is simple but must be made. If that is the result, it comes about because the non-citizen came to or remained in this country without permission. 
	...	...	...
The removal of an unlawful non-citizen from Australia then depends upon the willingness of some other country to receive that person. If the unlawful non-citizen is stateless, as is Mr Al-Kateb, there is no nation state which Australia may ask to receive its citizen. 
His Honour went on to quote from one of the most distinguished and, I might say, most famous liberal American jurists, Judge Learned Hand, in an opinion he wrote in an equivalent American case in 1952, United States v. Shaughnessy. In slightly more old-fashioned language, Judge Learned Hand said: 
“An alien, who comes to our shores and the ship which bears him, take the chance that he may not be allowed to land. If that chance turns against them, both know, or, if they do not, they are charged with knowledge, that, since the alien cannot land, he must find an asylum elsewhere ... When at his urgence we do let him go ashore ... we may give him whatever harborage we choose, until he finds shelter elsewhere if he can.”
Those are the facts in this very sad case. As I say, it may be an occasion for the exercise of ministerial discretion. But it cannot be charged against the Australian government or the Australian people that the operation of this act—an act originally amended to its current form by the Keating government—is unjust, when the person suffering a liability under the act is a person who comes here, as Justice Hayne said, without permission, who has exhausted the avenues which Australia has afforded him and who, through no fault of the Australian government, cannot find a state to be deported to. It is a sad set of circumstances, but the blame for that set of circumstances does not lie at the feet of the Australian people.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Immigration: Detainees</title>,Matters of Urgency,13,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2004-08-09,"—I listened with interest to the contributions of both Senator Mason and Senator Brandis to this urgency motion, and I certainly have to agree with one thing—these people are in an extremely difficult situation. Indeed, I could not have put it better myself. But we have surely now got ourselves to a situation where we need to show some compassion and some concern for people who did not come here illegally: they came here to seek asylum. They have been found under our very tough laws—and you correctly say that it was Labor that originally brought in these laws; and they have been toughened since—not to be entitled to asylum. What are they entitled to? That is where we are at now with this High Court decision. 
Basically there are three key problems: firstly, the policy of mandatory detention; secondly, forecasting whether or not there is any possibility in the future that someone can be removed—in other words, whether international circumstances will change; and, thirdly, the issue of cooperation of another country. After all other avenues have failed, we come now to ministerial discretion. With the High Court decision being very clear, this will be the last opportunity for these people. 
At the end of the day, the problem is our law being so tough and so inflexible that people are asking to be taken out of Australia. They have had enough. They are sick of being locked up. They are sick of the persecution here. They want to go but, as we see in the case of Mr al-Kateb, there is no possibility of that. His home state will not accept him and nor will anyone else. The courts have accepted that Mr al-Khafaji would be persecuted in his home state of Iraq. He cannot go back there. Syria, where he spent some time, does not want him—so back he goes into endless detention.  
It is an absolute absurdity that someone who has not committed any criminal act, who has never been found guilty of any wrongdoing on Australian soil, can face basically life imprisonment—no parole, no hope of ever being released. The way the courts are forced to interpret our law is pretty clear. In the future there may be some vague chance that one of these gentlemen will find that their home state or, in Mr al-Khafaji's case, another state, Syria, have changed their mind and decided to accept them. Until then, there is no chance of any sort of normal life for them in a community; it is back into detention.
The High Court states:
There are, however, exceptional cases, where a visa application has been determined adversely to an alien, or an alien has requested removal, but removal is not possible in the circumstances which prevail at the time and which are likely to prevail in the foreseeable future.
The court asks:
What happens then? Is the consequence indefinite, perhaps permanent, detention? The Act does not, in express terms, address that problem. [3]
Basically, I am here today arguing that we must change this. I am asking the minister to go back to the legislation and make sure that we do not see this situation happening again, because I understand that there are another half-a-dozen, eight or 10 people who could find themselves in this situation. In these two specific cases, as they have exhausted all of their legal options, I call on the minister to have some compassion, to use her ministerial discretion, and to give these people the opportunity to have some sort of a reasonable life by being allowed into the Australian community.

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2004-08-09,"—I also rise this afternoon to speak on the urgency motion presented to the Senate by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Bartlett. As speakers in this debate so far have said, we are here to acknowledge the finding of the High Court last Friday that it is in fact constitutional, and also lawful, under the Migration Act to keep a person in detention indefinitely even in circumstances where there is no real likelihood of that person being able to be deported from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future. Senator Ludwig has moved an amendment to Senator Bartlett's motion to omit all paragraphs after (a) and insert new paragraphs (b) to (h). I will talk briefly about these points before turning to the substance of my remarks.
This amendment acknowledges that the High Court in its finding was dealing with the small number of cases who are regarded as stateless persons. We acknowledge that the finding of the High Court was a split 4-3 decision, with the Chief Justice, Justice Gleeson, in the minority. We think this reflects the very serious concern there is in the community over asylum seekers being detained for lengthy periods of time. We condemn the government for its failures in the asylum seeker area—in particular, the lengthy detention of asylum seekers without review and the detention of children for lengthy periods, which I have spoken about on many occasions in the Senate.
We also condemn the government's refusal—until recently—to contemplate graduations of detention. We note that Labor's policy approach requires graduations of detention and the ongoing monthly review of asylum seekers who are not finally assessed within 90 days of claiming asylum. We believe Labor's approach will ensure that the small number of failed asylum seekers who are stateless will not be left in legal limbo for lengthy periods of time. We believe that Labor's approach will ensure a case-by-case assessment of such cases, leading to settlement in a third-party nation state or the use in these cases of alternative forms of detention—including residential housing projects, supervision in the community or release into the Australian community on a temporary basis pursuant to the exercise of ministerial discretion. Finally, in our amendment we call on the minister to immediately review the two individuals concerned, with a view to deciding whether their continuing detention in the Baxter detention centre is appropriate and whether it is in the public interest, given their recent presence in the Australian community for 12 months on terms and conditions as laid down by the Federal Court. 
As a number of speakers have indicated today, these High Court decisions delivered on Friday, 6 August are of extreme importance and great significance not only to the asylum seekers concerned but also to those who remain in detention and to members of the Australian community who look upon this government's policy in relation to asylum seekers as a national shame. As has been indicated, the finding was a 4-3 decision. I think that in itself is very significant. It highlights the importance of the issues that we are dealing with here, and also the significance of the issues in terms of trying to reach a decision which is both consistent with the law and yet enables some compassion to be shown.
In the time that I have left I wish to make some brief remarks about the judgments. My focus will be on the decisions of the three minority judges—namely, Chief Justice Gleeson and Justices Gummow and Kirby. I should say at the outset that I do not wish to make any criticism of the majority judges in this case because I think they were faced with a very difficult situation. It was a difficult case of statutory interpretation of the relevant provisions. On the basis of the existing law, in many ways they were left with very little option other than to make findings in the way that they did. I refer to the decisions of the minority justices in this case because I think they highlight that there was some scope, some opportunity, to inject into this area of the law some decency, some compassion and some integrity—which is so needed and on which so many individuals' lives depend.
In his judgment Chief Justice Gleeson recognised the difficulty in the case of statutory interpretation that was before him, but he was prepared to accept what had been accepted by the Federal Court of Australia when, in the case of Al Masri, it ordered the release of asylum seekers into the community in circumstances where—as these stateless persons are—stateless people cannot be returned either to their country of origin or to a third-party country. Chief Justice Gleeson was willing to accept, as the Federal Court did, that it is not inconsistent with the remedy of habeas corpus to make an order which permits a person to be released into the community and to impose conditions as part of a final order for release from detention for an individual. Chief Justice Gleeson was able, if you like, to get around the strictness of the existing law by accepting that it is within the power of the Federal Court of Australia—and, indeed, any chapter 3 court—to make a final order for release into the community on conditions.
I now move to the judgment of Justice Gummow, who took a similar approach to that of Chief Justice Gleeson. Like Chief Justice Gleeson, Justice Gummow was prepared to accept that it is certainly possible and within the discretion of the courts to make an order for the release of an individual into the community on conditions and in circumstances where it is quite clear there is no reasonable prospect of that person being deported from Australia and moved to another country willing to take them. 
Finally, I would like to mention the judgment of Justice Kirby. Justice Kirby's judgment really does highlight, to me at least, the gravity of the issues at stake here. I think we should not read these judgments, as I and many others have done, and just look at the strict law. We need to think very seriously about the context in which these decisions are being made and the implications that this decision will have not only for those asylum seekers who remain in detention but for those who may come to this country in the future. In his dissenting judgment Justice Kirby said:
I dissent from the majority view in this case—
and he noted that this view:
... has grave implications for the liberty of the individual in this country which this Court should not endorse.
Justice Kirby was prepared, in layman's terms, `to read between the lines'. He was prepared to look to the way in which this law operates at an international level and, where there is some ambiguity, to permit international law to shape the common law. He makes references to international law principles and believes that, in his view, it is not inconsistent with our Constitution for international law to shape our constitutional principles. At paragraph 175, Justice Kirby said:
Whatever may have been possible in the world of 1945, the complete isolation of constitutional law from the dynamic impact of international law is neither possible nor desirable today. That is why national courts, and especially national constitutional courts such as this, have a duty, so far as possible, to interpret their constitutional texts in a way that is generally harmonious with the basic principles of international law, including as that law states human rights and fundamental freedoms.
We need to be aware that this was a difficult constitutional law case for the High Court, and it has decided as it saw fit. We have a majority judgment; yet three judges in the minority, including Chief Justice Gleeson, took a contrary view. As Senator Ludwig has indicated, Labor will take a different approach to these issues when in government and will introduce some compassion and integrity into the process, which I think have been sadly lacking from the Howard government.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Immigration: Detainees</title>,Matters of Urgency,13,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2004-08-09,"—At this stage in the debate it is worth noting that, in its consideration of the High Court's findings of 6 August last, the Senate has approached the issue very seriously and in a very considered manner. That has not always been the case—sometimes these issues involve a lot of flailing of arms and words—but on this occasion it has been a considered discussion. That is very important and is indicative of the seriousness of the issues at hand and the state in which the individuals to whom the High Court's decision applies find themselves.
By a 4-3 majority the High Court has held that the Migration Act provisions requiring the continued detention of unlawful noncitizens are not invalid and that, under the act, detention must continue until an unlawful noncitizen is removed from Australia, deported or granted a visa. As we know from previous discussion, the majority of the court held that, as a purpose of detention is the eventual removal of unlawful noncitizens, the detention is not prohibited by the Constitution. Accordingly, as the High Court's press release says, `The court has dismissed Mr Al-Kateb's appeal and allowed the minister's appeal in Mr Al Khafaji's case.'
I also note that the current statutory regime is that which was passed by the parliament in 1992, as introduced by a previous Labor government. The purpose of that regime makes it possible to detain and remove persons with no lawful authority to remain in Australia. I note from the remarks of the opposition's spokesman on this issue and the remarks of Senators Ludwig and Kirk that there is no proposal from the Labor Party to amend the act in this specific regard. It is also noted that the act provides flexibility to allow alternative detention arrangements or release where there is no possibility of removal. 
The issue of detention of persons with no lawful authority to remain in Australia is one with which I have involved myself over some years now. It is worth noting that most individuals who are in immigration detention are there for only a short time. But extended periods of detention have led to extraordinary and exacerbated angst amongst those concerned, and amongst many members of the Australian community. This particular matter is about exceptionally difficult cases where resolution does seem to have been impossible. The minister noted in her responses in question time a number of reasons for which lengthy immigration detention often results. She noted that it may be because of the pursuit of judicial review, a process that can take years—as the committee which I chair in this place certainly knows; we have discussed that often enough. It may be because of difficulties of accurate identity determination of the individuals concerned. I know that both the department and the minister are concerned to monitor those processes to ensure they are carried out expeditiously, but it is also important that detainees provide full cooperation for their removal.
It is particularly important to note the remarks that the minister made in question time today. She confirmed the High Court's view that the detention itself is not unlawful and that the act is clear and unambiguous. She went on to say that there is a capacity in this area for the exercise of ministerial discretion, which she described as a `safety valve'. There is ministerial discretion and there is the opportunity for people to be given relief and to stay in Australia.
In saying that, the minister indicated quite clearly to the Senate that she has asked for a review of all of the long-term detention cases individually to come to her and that she will examine those and see whether they warrant intervention. At the same time, the minister indicated that she will look at each of the cases of those people who are, in fact, outside the detention regime because of the Al Masri decision and have not been re-detained. What the minister has indicated is a very important part of the application of policy in this area.
There are many people who are unhappy with the act as it stands. The first speaker in this afternoon's debate, the leader of the Australian Democrats, made that entirely clear. Senator Meg Lees also made it clear. But the aspect of the process which is important to emphasise in relation to these people is the capacity for ministerial discretion to be exercised. I think the remarks of the minister this afternoon should be taken seriously on that note. I would be very disappointed if other senators in the chamber decided not to do that. In her actions in this regard the minister has made her position quite clear and senators can hardly ask for anything more in relation to the legislation as it stands. As I said earlier, I have not seen the opposition suggest that the legislation should be changed.
The minister has indicated the approach that she intends to take. It is important also that the minister is given the opportunity to do that. Having made her intention clear and made the undertaking to the chamber that she will see what response is warranted in all of these cases is an important step in this process. It will enable her to do that with the full consideration, I should imagine, and input of members of the Senate. I, for one, am not usually backward in coming forward on these matters, as the minister and vast numbers of my colleagues will attest to. I will take up an opportunity to raise certain issues with the minister in relation to the situation of the individuals impacted by the High Court decision. I want to say again that it is important that this has been a considered debate and I think senators have contributed constructively to the process.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-08-09,"—I wanted to be on the speaker's list because of my long-standing involvement in this issue. I listened carefully to what Senator Vanstone said in answer to questions today. She appeared to distance herself from certain actions by the current Attorney-General and the previous Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. She also promised to look at these particular cases on an individual basis herself. Whilst that is happening, I want to state that it is my intention to vote for the urgency motion. I do not know how I am going to do that because I would also like to support the amendment by the opposition.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Immigration: Detainees</title>,Matters of Urgency,13,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-08-09,"—I thank people for their contributions to this debate. The Democrats do not support Labor's amendment because it takes away the core part of what the urgency motion seeks to do. The first part of the urgency motion is to note the court's ruling. We now have a serious situation where people can be locked up indefinitely for so-called immigration purposes when there is no prospect of them being deported in the foreseeable future. That includes stateless people where no country is likely to accept them.
The urgency motion goes on to say that we believe that is unacceptable and that the law should be changed to remove that prospect. The Democrats would like to do far more than that to our immigration law but we think that single, simple thing—that it should not be possible for a minister of this government or any future government to keep someone in detention indefinitely without charge—should be acceptable. We should seek to remove such an offensive provision from any law in the land. The longer it is allowed to stand the more it sends a signal that that sort of extreme amount of executive power to deny somebody their freedom is acceptable.
I cannot support any amendment that would remove that simple part from the motion even though Labor's amendment makes a range of other points, some of which have some validity. The simple thing is that the Democrats' strong view is that it is not appropriate for such an enormous power as the denial of freedom to be in the hands of a government minister without any scope for judicial oversight or intervention. I note that the minister did not come to defend the situation at all in this debate. It is good that she might be going to look at the circumstances of the couple of people who are the subject of these court decisions, but there are others.
A person's freedom should not have to depend on the goodwill of any individual minister to have a look at the case. No other democratic country allows that sort of power. No other democratic country allows mandatory detention regardless of the circumstances, regardless of how long you are likely to be in detention and regardless of the prospects of deportation. Senator Mason said these people had no right to be in this country, but they are here, that they may have no right to be anywhere else and, apparently, we say they have no right to freedom. We lock them up indefinitely, according to Senator Brandis as a preliminary to being deported. It is a very long preliminary. We have someone who, next month, will have been imprisoned for six years. It is not a crime to be stateless; it is not a crime to fail in your claim for asylum. You should not lose your freedom for such extreme lengths of time. As a consequence, I believe the law is unjust and it should be changed. The Democrats will continue in our efforts to ensure that it is changed.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-08-09,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This response concerns the award-winning Indigenous tourism operator Anangu Tours. It is most appropriate that the Minister for Small Business and Tourism should respond today, the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples. The International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is an opportunity for all Australians to reflect on the rich contribution Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make to the life of our nation. Today is also an opportunity to recognise the entrenched disadvantage experienced by Indigenous Australians and commit to tackling that disadvantage.
The Howard government's term of office has coincided with the Indigenous Decade of the World's Indigenous People, which ends this year. While comparable nations like the United States, Canada and New Zealand have narrowed the opportunity gap between their Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples, Australia has failed to make much progress. One of the Howard government's most shameful legacies is the fall in the life expectancy of Indigenous women and a growing gap in the life expectancy of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.
Labor believes Australia can and must do better than this. As the shadow minister for reconciliation and Indigenous affairs and also the shadow minister for tourism, I believe the tourism industry has an important role to play in improving the lives of Indigenous Australians. It is one of the reasons why Labor moved amendments to the Tourism Australia Bill 2004. We wanted to ensure that Indigenous Australians with valuable tourism and cultural experience had a place at the table when Australia's new national tourism body engaged in discussion about the future of this industry. I am very pleased to note the appointment of Karen Jacobs to the Tourism Australia board.
As noted in the minister's response, Ms Jacobs operates her own Indigenous tourism business in Western Australia. Operators like Ms Jacobs serve as great examples for other Indigenous Australians with an interest in joining the great Australian tourism industry. Of course, the whole country has much to gain from increased Indigenous involvement in the tourism industry. Through the tourism white paper, the Australian industry has noted that we currently meet only half the international demand for Indigenous tourism experiences. We all have something to gain from meeting more of this demand. Further development of Indigenous tourism will serve to build greater understanding between Indigenous Australians and international visitors and greater understanding within our own nation.
I again congratulate Anangu Tours, an Aboriginal owned tourist operation based at Uluru that won the 2004 National Geographic world legacy heritage tourism award. I believe it is a magnificent achievement for that business, a magnificent achievement for an Indigenous tourism business and a magnificent achievement for this country. In that regard, I approve of the minister's response.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Indigenous Affairs: Tourism</title>,Documents,15,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-09,"—I also congratulate Anangu Tours for the 2004 National Geographic world legacy heritage tourism award win. I want to add a few comments to those of Senator O'Brien. We have to recognise that the first Australians have a relationship with this continent which is steeped in a spiritual connection to the land and which is the essence of what many tourists want to get close to. It is an indefinable but very powerful thing because it is in the make-up of all of us. For Indigenous Australians it is a living component, whereas for far too many people who have generations of their own history in cities and away from the wilds, it has become an echo of the past—yet we seek to go back to it.
What concerns the Greens about the development of tourism in Australia is that too often Indigenous people, who have that particular ability—and it includes a different view of time, which is essential if one is going to reflect on and enjoy Indigenous culture and the land—are swept aside by those who want to plan all tourism according to European precepts or concepts. On a visit earlier this year to Palm Island I was struck by its extraordinary beauty. Because it has been under Indigenous control, it has not been open to the white shoe brigade—thank goodness. The pressures are nevertheless mounting as local government is weakened for the Indigenous people, and they are asking what happens in the future as the pressure for not just leaseholding but freeholding of land grows. Anybody who comes from the world of profit-led tourism can see quick dollars coming from the exploitation of such a beautiful place—its magnificent beaches, its intact ecosystems, its great fishing and its sheer beauty.
The same applies to the rivers of the Kimberley. Five or six years ago I went with others to raft down the Fitzroy River at the behest of the Bunuba people from Fitzroy Crossing and the Kimberley region. What was an adventure trip at that time has developed into one of the great whitewater experiences of Australia, if not the world. From the pictures I have seen since, we had a very placid trip. Get caught after a monsoonal downpour and you are into huge toppers and very exhilarating, fast moving waters. While that might be an exciting thing from a Western viewpoint, what struck me greatly on that trip was the extraordinary relationship of the Bunuba people and the other Indigenous groups in the region with their land and the wish of the young folk to bring the older folk—in particular, the women—back to get a much closer induction into the various gorges, the great rock outcrops, the specific features of the river and the role they have played in the living relationship of those people with the land.
It is a precious opportunity to ensure that the cultural attachment for the land is not divested from the wonderful people of the Kimberley in the way it has been so cruelly trodden on for Indigenous people in the south of the continent. These are big questions and they must be at the forefront of planning. Senator O'Brien brought up the interesting statistic that the demand for Indigenous tours or presentation of the country is twice the capability at the moment. Let the demand keep and make sure that the capability is developed according to Indigenous wishes and not just be a demand thing because— 
—It won't work if it just is.
—Senator O'Brien is quite right. It will not work if that is allowed to take over. Congratulations to Anangu Tours. Congratulations to the Indigenous people whose love and presentation of country crosses to all Australians in this feeling we have for this great continent between the Indian and Pacific oceans.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2004-08-09,"—by leave—This statement is made on behalf of the Prime Minister. The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Brown, as agreed by the Senate on 5 August 2004, and relates to a report of the Council of Australian Governments inquiry on bushfire mitigation and management. I wish to inform the Senate that the government does not intend to table the report at this stage. There is a protocol that such documents are not released without the agreement of the Commonwealth and the states and territories. In accordance with that protocol, the Commonwealth has sought the views of the states and territories on the release of the report. The advice received is that several states do not agree to the release of the report, and as such it would be inappropriate to agree to its release. To do otherwise could damage relations between the Commonwealth and the states and territories and reduce the effectiveness of the Council of Australian Governments.",SENATE,<title>BUSHFIRES</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-09,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
That was an extraordinary statement about the prime ministerial presumption that this parliament is secondary to some extraparliamentary arrangement made with the states. This is the sovereign parliament of Australia. The COAG process, which is being cited here as being superior to this parliament, must not be allowed to continue with this creeping empowerment of the executive at the expense of the Senate and the parliament generally.
How dare this Prime Minister tell the Senate that the government has a document that has been drawn up outside the parliament on a hugely important matter like bushfires, which has fully involved the government and which is, amongst other things, an overview of the national preparedness for bushfires and recommendations for how to tackle them in the future—taking into account several states that have published their own inquiries—but that it will not release it to the parliament, even though the process of this COAG inquiry was established in October 2003 with a view to making sure that the findings would be available to feed into preparation for the summer that is coming up.
Just yesterday I heard on the news that there have been fires in Queensland. We know that, if we get a dry hot spell in the coming months, then bushfires will occur at least in the northern and middle latitude states—if I can call them that—if not so early in the south. If the outcomes from the investigation by COAG, which were available to the Prime Minister and the several states at the start of April, are to be of value to the nation then they must be made available. There is preparation for burning off for the bushfire season being undertaken right across the country now. 
I have had a request from Ms Beth Schultz of the Western Australian Conservation Council. She is commenting, very responsibly, that she can see no good reason why this report should not be released, and several good reasons why it should. First, the Environmental Protection Authority of Western Australia, on the direction of the minister, Judy Edwards, is conducting a review of the fire policies and management practices of CALM—the Conservation and Land Management Authority. It has released a discussion paper on which submissions are due by 20 August. Everyone in Western Australia should have the benefit of the COAG report when making submissions to the EPA review. Darn right they should; that is very sensible.
What about the people who are preparing to meet the potential bushfire threat? We always know that it is unexpected and it can strike in the most unlikely places. But thank God for the bushfire authorities—from the local authorities right through to the state authorities—who meet the emergency when it comes. Why should this document be denied to the nation as a whole or to the people in all states, I think I presume fairly, who are preparing for fires and who want to see it, just because there is a state or territory government somewhere that says, `No, we don't want to release it yet'?
—Or a federal government.
—Or a federal government; thank you, Senator O'Brien. So we go for the lowest common denominator: everybody's preparation, coming out of this report, is held back because this Prime Minister does not have the authority or is manipulative enough, for whatever political reason may be in his head, to say the nation cannot have the benefit of this report, which he has already had for four months. That is just not good enough. We shall have to look, in the next 24 hours, at what motion can be brought back into the Senate—
—A return to order.
—A return to order, Senator Harradine, yes. This effectively is a return to order—it is a request—but the Prime Minister is saying no to it.
I want to finish quickly because I know there are important other matters awaiting us. Where are the reasons for not producing the document? It is not good enough to say that some unspecified states or the Commonwealth are not prepared to release this information. Why not give the nation the benefit of this report? How dare the Prime Minister snub this parliament and say, `You cannot have that information. I have been sitting on it for four months. I will blame some unnamed other state for it. The parliament can go hang.'
—Ask all the states if they want to release the report.
—The ineffectual minister sits over there and says: `Ask all the states.' The Prime Minister in his response to the Senate says he has done that but somebody—and he won't say who—does not want this report released.
—He is protecting Labor states? Get real!
—The minister goes into the political realm of stating the obvious that they are all Labor states, protecting his own ineffectualness as Prime Minister on this matter. 
—I'm as ineffective as the Prime Minister?
—The senator opposite says that he is as ineffective as the Prime Minister. I will leave it for everybody to judge that. That is his statement. I am not going to cavil with it. This is an important and serious matter. This information is important and serious and should be available. This four-month dilatory lapse by the Prime Minister is inexcusable after the history of last year—and who knows what is coming up this summer? Everybody concerned about bushfires has a right to have this information. The Prime Minister has let them down.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-08-09,"—We will let the petulance across the way pass us by. It is very interesting that the government seeks to blame anyone but itself for the non-production of this document. This is a government that has made an art form of not complying with returns to order. It always seems to find a reason why it is someone else's fault that it does not comply. It is fairly typical of the Prime Minister to seek to shift blame to someone else. In this case it is suggested that it is probably a state or territory government—of course a Labor government—but, as I recall Senator Abetz's opening statement, he said that a state or territory government or the federal government could object to the production of a COAG document. He did not say that it was not the federal government that was actually objecting. He did not make it clear that the federal government was not the government or one of the governments responsible for providing the excuse for the non-production of this document in response to the Senate's return to order.
The Howard government does have form in seeking to shift blame and not take actions which are its responsibility in relation to the fighting of fire. It is clear that in the past the Howard government has ignored expert advice that might have made the 2002-03 bushfire season that ravaged Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT less devastating. In the wake of the January 2002 Sydney fires the Howard government promised a national firefighting strategy and a national air firefighting strategy and commissioned the Australasian Fire Authorities Council to provide the advice. But, unforgivably, that expert opinion—the expert opinion of Australia's fire chiefs—was immediately dismissed by the then minister, now backbencher, Mr Wilson Tuckey. We have been waiting for this government to respond to a variety of things, including the House of Representatives select committee report for some time. 
Without wanting to take this chamber's time up for too much longer, I have to say that we can be concerned about the government refusing to comply with returns to order. The Democrats originally supported a motion that I moved to hold up a piece of legislation until the government responded to my returns to order in relation to ethanol and Manildra but, after saying that it was time that the Senate stood up and was counted on the question of holding the government to account for failing to respond to returns to order, the Democrats rolled over on the basis that I had subsequently achieved some of the information by pursuing freedom of information applications—according to the Democrats, that was all right, we would accept what had effectively already been provided; not the rest of the information—and passed the bill. At that time I said that it would be very difficult for any party in the Senate to have confidence that the government could be held to account for not complying with returns to order. We have seen just that action today and, frankly, the government knows it can do it with impunity because of that action by the Democrats. I am not surprised and senators should not be surprised. I think it is a pattern which has emerged from this government. The Senate is now unable—because of the unwillingness of the Democrats to hold the line—to pursue this further.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-08-09,"—I know the chamber's time limit on such matters but I do have to express my concern about the failure of the Council of Australian Governments to provide information which is quite essential for our consideration. The upshot is that national policy issues are being debated in an atmosphere of secrecy. COAG is not directly accountable to the Australian people, yet it has a profound influence on the way that we are governed. It lacks transparency. There have been a number of occasions when there have been requests for COAG documents, and they have either not been forthcoming or, alternatively, they have come when all the debate is over.
COAG is only a relatively recent invention, if I can use that word. It has been around for about 10 years. It is a council of Australian government ministers, but the agenda and papers are prepared by civil servants in the state and federal spheres. That is fine—I am not criticising civil servants, the majority of whom, presumably, are very dedicated people who provide high-quality advice to their ministers—but very few Australians have actually heard of COAG. It and its papers are not subject to freedom of information legislation. I am not objecting to the existence of COAG, because I think it is important that a council of Commonwealth and state ministers exists and there is a need for coordination of activities in various fields, not least of which are firefighting, land management and so on. I had some thoughts on this matter published in the Canberra Times of Thursday, 28 August last year. If people are interested, they can get it all off the Net.
I appeal to all sides to examine where we are going with COAG, whether it is undermining proper accountability and whether its processes are undermining our important democracy. We should calmly have a look at that because it is very important, particularly to the Senate because we are a house of review. Very often you come forward with a particular matter and the federal minister says, `That's a decision of COAG.' Ultimately, we have to make the decision here, and I believe we are entitled to get all of the information and background not only because it is important for our consideration of the matter but also because it is important to put ourselves in the position of the COAG ministers. You cannot do that unless you are provided with the papers upon which they have made their consideration. That should seem obvious to everybody.
For the good of democracy in Australia and for the good of COAG—because, as I said, it is important to have such a coordinating body—I appeal to both sides to look at this calmly and to examine it further. Ultimately, we have got to really have a good look at where we are going with COAG.",SENATE,<title>BUSHFIRES</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-09,"—I was not planning on taking part in this debate. It is my view and the Democrats' view that the government has not complied with returns to order from this place. I think that needs to be treated very seriously and it is clearly not treated seriously by this government. However, I take great exception to the Democrats being blamed by Senator O'Brien for this sorry state of affairs. I remind Senator O'Brien that the return to order to which he referred was complied with. In fact, here I have the documents—some hundreds of documents—whose return to order was complied with. It was not a question of the Democrats giving in to anything. We said to the government, `We won't deal with that legislation until you supply those documents,' and it did. Most of them were indeed supplied under FOI to Senator O'Brien. I do not know what he did with them. Most of them, I imagine, would have been fairly useless in his ongoing attack on the ethanol industry, because most of them point out the advantages of ethanol and of biofuels, so no doubt he was disappointed by that finding. However, as I said, I take very strong exception to being accused of being party to the government's recalcitrance on returns to order. 
We will join Labor at any time at any stage on their suggestion that we hold the government to account. I wish we did far more of that in this place. There are plenty of ways that the Senate can be non-cooperative with the government if documents are not provided when it is reasonable that they should be, and I would argue that our returns to order are most reasonable. As Senator Harradine says, the information that is requested is requested for good reason, by and large. I am not so sure about the great wad of documents that Labor asked for in the Honan debate but, nevertheless, we agreed with those, and I think it was important that they were provided to whoever needed them in the debate.
I make a commitment here and now that the Democrats will join the ALP whenever they invite us—in fact, we have invited them on a number of occasions to do likewise—to not be cooperative when the government does not provide documents that the Senate has asked for. We do need to restore the importance of that. But for Senator O'Brien to come in here and accuse us of being party to some nasty cooperation with the government so it does not have to provide documents is very silly. As I said, I have the documents here and I am happy to hand them around to anyone else who wants them. I know that Senator O'Brien also has them. We had them before we dealt with that piece of legislation. Senator O'Brien is simply fabricating what happened in this place. I think it is important for him to come down and correct the record.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2004-08-09,"—I understand that since the Council of Australian Governments was established over 12 years ago it has been the practice of Australian government to seek agreement of COAG members before officially releasing a COAG report or tabling it in parliament. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has asked relevant contacts in first ministers' departments for advice on whether their jurisdiction agrees to the tabling of the report. To date, the ACT and the Northern Territory have agreed and Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia have indicated their opposition to tabling the report. The other states are yet to respond.

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2004-08-09,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary observer delegation to the presidential elections in Indonesia on 5 July 2004. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I had the privilege of again being a member of the parliamentary observer delegation to the recent Indonesian elections. Indeed, it was not only the first round of Indonesia's current presidential elections, but also the first round ever of direct presidential and vice-presidential elections in Indonesia—a truly remarkable experience. Indonesia, therefore, is one of our youngest and most vibrant democracies. As part of our recent visit to Indonesia, we observed the campaign leading up to election day, we observed the election day and then we took part in some post-election analysis. It would be fair to say that the campaign went relatively smoothly and peacefully.  
There were some initial concerns about the campaign, mostly expressed by the European Union long-term observers who had concerns about the balance of media coverage of the presidential election. The European Union observers felt that both government and privately owned media were far too supportive of the current president and gave far too much coverage of her quest for re-election rather than provide an open and equal coverage of all five candidates. There were also some concerns about the use of incumbency by President Megawati's party, the PDIP, and the inappropriate use of public servants and their positions. Those two issues are something that Indonesia will have to come to terms with, but I am sure they will continue to struggle with them, as indeed we in Australia still struggle with them.
The election day was a very peaceful day. It had a very festive and relaxed atmosphere and was almost celebratory, although much quieter than the previous election day in April for their parliamentary elections. The overall view of our delegation was that the election could be viewed as free and fair. As most observers of Indonesian politics would have noticed, there was some concern initially about what was seen as double punching of ballot papers on election day, but in my view that matter was resolved very quickly. There was a ruling by the electoral commission before voting had finished, and all of those ballot papers were recounted by the end of that Monday night. So it was a very transparent and open process. The counting was very open, like during the parliamentary elections. Because all the results were displayed in public places, it was very transparent right through the various recording stages. 
One of the Australian groups that went out into regional areas to observe encountered some problems in an area of Lampung. They had concerns about polling places opening late and closing early. They formed the view that perhaps there was some intimidation of some voters in those areas but that it would not have had an impact on the overall result of that election. Indeed, it would be fair to say that a lot of polling places in Indonesia opened late on election day because, like Australia, Indonesia is a sports-mad place and there was an important soccer match on the previous night. Apparently lots of local communities agreed that, rather than vote at 7 a.m. as per the electoral commission's ruling, they would start at 9 a.m. so they could have a sleep-in. There was a lower turnout on the presidential election day than there had been for the parliamentary election, which could be an example of all politics being local and people being a lot more interested and vitally concerned about who their local representatives would be in the various local parliaments rather than about the outcome of the presidential election.
As part of its contribution to observing the election, the Australian government not only sent a delegation but also, through the Australian Electoral Commission, funded considerable training of the Indonesian electoral commission and domestic observers to ensure that the electoral process was smooth, transparent, free and fair. Whilst I congratulate the government on this commitment to the vibrancy and freedom of democracy in Indonesia, I did have some concerns about the organisation that was chosen to fund the domestic monitors. This time some $2 million of funding was directed to the JPPR through the Asia Foundation. At the previous election, funding went to a number of domestic monitor organisations. It would be my observation that the JPPR did not fully commit to that independent domestic monitoring role. The organisations that were involved in April were a lot more committed to the process. They were formed around university campuses and academics, so there was theoretical understanding of and commitment to democracy. I am not sure how it happened but in my entire time there on this occasion I saw only two of the Asia Foundation's monitors. Hence I am not sure where the money went. 
One of the recommendations in this report—as was the case in the report on the parliamentary elections—was to send another delegation to the second round of the presidential elections should the Indonesian government invite Australia to do so. There is no doubt that sending a parliamentary delegation was seen as a very high level commitment by Australia to the democratic process in Indonesia, which gave those parties and individuals involved in the democratic process, who perhaps had had some concerns about it, an independent avenue to express their concerns and to make their feelings known. There is no doubt that it was seen to be a very serious commitment by Australia to the flourishing democracy of one of our nearest and largest neighbours. That is an important recommendation of the report. With the second round of the presidential election to take place in September, it may prove difficult for any of our parliamentary colleagues to take part in that delegation, but I urge people to consider doing so should they have the opportunity.
I would like to place on the record my thanks to the others who participated in the delegation. Only two of us were parliamentarians, but the delegation was composed of a number of representatives from different government departments, all of whom spoke fluent bahasa Indonesian—unlike we parliamentarians—and all of whom had an incredible depth of knowledge, sensitivity and commitment to the Indonesian people and their electoral processes. It is therefore no wonder that Australia is viewed quite favourably by the Indonesian people when they see the calibre of those who participated.
I place on record my thanks to Bev Forbes, who was secretary to the delegation yet again. Bev was tireless in her commitment to ensuring that our needs were taken care of, and she made sure that we had a complete record of our observations and recommendations. I was accompanied by Dan Hill, an AusAID official at the Australian embassy. Dan's commitment to the Indonesian people is longstanding. His commitment to our aid ventures in Indonesia is another incredible gesture of goodwill and is viewed very favourably by the Indonesian people. Another person who accompanied me on this trip was Glenn Tankard, from the Australian Federal Police. Our Australian Federal Police officers do a fantastic job supporting those of us who travel to places such as Indonesia and supporting the Indonesian people in their quest to deal with the difficulties they are having in combating terrorism and other issues. I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to him for his dedication to the task and for his incredible flexibility. Finally, I would like to thank the government and the people of Indonesia. Their willingness to accept democracy and the openness with which they allowed other people to observe the process stands us all in good stead.",SENATE,<title> DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Parliamentary Observer Delegation to the Presidential Elections, Indonesia</title>",Miscellaneous,17,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2004-08-09,"—Like my friend and colleague Senator Webber I attended the general parliamentary elections in Indonesia in the early part of April. I must say a special thank you to Senator Webber and to Mrs Margaret May, from the House of Representatives, who led our delegation and to Senator Stott Despoja. Senator Webber has attended Indonesian elections twice now. She attended the presidential campaign and the general election. I am sure it has been a phenomenal and very fascinating and interesting experience for her, because it certainly has been for me. One of the high spots in my very short parliamentary career has been seeing a country such as Indonesia have such a tremendous commitment to running an election in the most difficult of circumstances. If time permits, I hope to get into a bit of the detail of some of the difficulties confronted by the government of Indonesia. On my visit, we had the delightful presence of some 17 representatives of the Australian Public Service. Dr Brad Armstrong, from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, was virtually the team leader for our delegation of four members of parliament, me included, and 17 public servants. Amongst the public servants were members of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AusAID and the Office of National Assessments. 
These people were much younger than me, predominantly in their thirties. I pause to say that I could not wish to meet a more professional, experienced, talented group of young Australian diplomats. They were simply outstanding. I was delighted to be escorted to Bali by Ms Kate Callaghan, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She was ably assisted by Mr Brian Hearn from the Australian embassy. Both of them are very fluent Indonesian speakers. They know the culture, and they knew how to get in and drill down into what was happening on the ground during the course of the parliamentary elections. They made the visit to Bali, where I spent the deployment observing the elections, very worth while.
The delegation went to a number of places, which included Bandung in West Java; Bandar Lampung in Lampung; Makassar in South Sulawesi; Semarang in Central Java; Balikpapan in East Kalimantan; Denpasar in Bali, which is where I went and beyond there up into the highlands; Kupang in West Timor, which is where Senator Webber went; East Nusa Tenggara; and Malang in East Java. Those were the eight or so deployments of the various groups of Australian diplomats and parliamentarians. 
Before going out into the field we had briefings in Jakarta from the JPPR, the people's voter education network, who fielded over 142,000 observers into each polling station in Indonesia during these parliamentary elections. We also had briefings from the United States delegation, the EU delegation, the KPU—the government department, if I can call them that, which had the responsibility for conducting the ballots—and a post-deployment briefing from the Japanese delegation. All of these matters and all of these briefings were most enlightening and disclosed an enormous commitment by countries and by non-government organisations throughout the world to seeing that the electoral process in Indonesia went smoothly and was in fact a legitimate expression of the will of the people of Indonesia.
While in Bali, I visited with the other two members of my group some 25 polling stations, commencing at about 6 a.m. on 5 April—if I recall the date. We travelled to Sanur, Denpasar and up into the highlands of Ubud. At each polling station I observed a number of traditionally dressed officials conducting the ballot of approximately 300 voters from the surrounding village or town district. The polling station was usually a school, a public building, a meeting hall or something of that nature. The commitment of the staff and the way they went about dealing with what was a very difficult logistical matter was very impressive. 
Indonesians have varying degrees of literacy. Voting was carried out on four large ballot papers—each with more than a dozen candidates—by punching a hole in the ballot paper. When the official in charge of counting the ballot came around, they held the ballot paper aloft, and people standing around could see the light shining through the pinhole that had been made. The process was extraordinarily transparent, quite fair and fundamentally simple. It met the needs of the people. I was very impressed with the Indonesian people. They are on the road to being an emerging economic power. I must say that, because my preconceived notion was that they were not such an economically designated power. If Indonesians get good leadership and continue to have good government—and I think that is improving—I can see them becoming a very strong nation and a bit of an economic powerhouse in South-East Asia into the future.
As I said, I saw a group of very dedicated officials in their traditional dress running the ballot. I saw a lot of goodwill. I saw no violence. I saw a very orderly procession of citizens who were keen to participate in this process. Overall, I thought the whole thing was very successful.
I pause to mention some of the statistics. There were 147 million eligible voters participating in the ballot that I saw. That, in itself, should say to the Senate that this was a phenomenal logistical exercise. There were 24 political parties contesting the election. There were over 2,057 separate elections in the various provinces around Indonesia, with two houses in each province and two legislative houses back in the capital, Jakarta. There were over 585,219 voting stations to be correctly equipped for a maximum of 300 voters in each station. 
These figures just boggle the mind when you consider what we do in Australia. There were 660 million ballot papers to print and distribute to some of the most isolated regions in the world. There were 581,000 KPU officials and staff to train to go out into these areas to conduct the ballot. On polling day, 3.9 million—that is, almost four million—polling station staff were involved in running the ballot. There were 1.1 million polling station security staff, 15,276 representatives to be elected and 448,705—that is, almost half a million—candidates seeking election. Each ballot paper had a photograph of the particular candidate. In line with what I was explaining about the pinholes, this allowed people who cannot read to recognise the face of the candidate they wanted to vote for. There was a massive amount of preparation in terms of getting the candidates photographed and onto the ballot papers. 
Having said all of that, the cost that Australia contributed to the elections was a mere $15 million. I think it was a very important $15 million. The overall cost of the process for all the presidential elections and the three run-offs that will occur at the end of this year is approaching $US3 billion. This is a phenomenally huge commitment, which Indonesia should be extremely proud of. I think it is working well. It is going to achieve a strong result, and it has engaged the population in an exercise that has taken them to a whole new dimension in terms of good governance and adherence to, and respect for, the democratic process. 
I am delighted to participate with Senator Webber in reporting to the Senate that things are looking very healthy in terms of democracy in Indonesia. My heart goes out to them and I congratulate them on the huge effort they have undertaken and on the success they have had in so doing.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2004-08-09,"—This evening I would like to highlight the work of a small but enthusiastic group of students in Melbourne. This group of students from Melbourne and Monash universities have joined together to form Ampersand—a non-profit organisation aimed at encouraging university students to do more volunteering and community work. Katia Sanderson, Sarah Cleghorn, Jennifer Brook, Denis Cairney, Sam Hardwick, Remy Kinna and Suzi Young are the students and recent graduates behind Ampersand, and they are to be commended for their energy and commitment.
Ampersand is motivated by two ideas. The first is that students are one of the more underrepresented demographics involved in regular volunteer work. The second is that, by getting involved in community work, students will become more focused on others and more active in their communities. Ampersand's strategy is to improve the awareness of students about community work and the ability of students to find suitable community work. The Ampersand web site will provide a hub for volunteering information for young people. This database of opportunities will be promoted by Ampersand at universities in Melbourne. 
Ampersand will also aim to make volunteering more attractive to students. Part of this will involve promoting the idea that volunteer work complements paid work experience and ultimately produces more well-rounded employees. The name `Ampersand' was chosen to signify that there is a community life beyond study and beyond work—that you can work and make a community contribution. To help achieve its goals, Ampersand has linked up with Volunteering Australia, the national peak body working to advance volunteering in the community, which is supported financially by the Australian government.
Recently, two of the founding members of Ampersand, Katia Sanderson and Sarah Cleghorn, met with me to seek support in launching the organisation. It was encouraging to meet young people committing a significant amount of time and energy to their community. No-one could fail to be impressed by the zest and purpose of Katia and Sarah. Since completing year 12 in 1999 as school co-captain at Ruyton Girls School, Katia Sanderson has discovered how volunteer work can profoundly alter someone's life path. Katia tutored underprivileged students with the Ardoch Youth Foundation during her first two years of study at Melbourne University. Katia was so inspired by this experience that she deferred study to volunteer on a full-time basis. She spent six months at the Children First Rotary Farm in Kilmore in Victoria, helping Moira Kelly care for Third World children recovering from life-saving medical treatment. Katia then travelled to Albania, where she worked with the Sisters of Mother Teresa in orphanages and in food distribution programs. Now volunteering with Lighthouse and Anglicare's Friends Program, Katia has returned to a combined degree in arts and social work. 
Katia's colleague Sarah Cleghorn, also a graduate of Melbourne University, embraced the challenges of motivating and supporting young debaters in her position as school debating captain in 1999. This experience led Sarah to adjudicate for the Debating Association of Victoria's schools competition. Both Sarah and Katia have a profound commitment to making accessible the experiences volunteer opportunities can offer.
In my first speech to the Senate, I proposed a measure to provide incentive and reward for young people to become more involved in their community—that is, to offer university students the opportunity to reduce their HECS debt in return for undertaking regular volunteer or community work. Katia heard my proposal on ABC radio's PNN while sitting in a broken down car, waiting for the RACV to come along. Katia and her colleagues were interested because they recognised that such a proposal would complement the work of Ampersand.
A compassionate society is one in which we can place ourselves in the shoes of others. It is a society where we understand that the different lives and circumstances of others are not always of their own making. The HECS mechanism can be utilised to foster greater community involvement by students; in doing so, we could support the work of groups like Ampersand. If today's students become more involved in volunteer and community work, there is a good chance they will stay involved in later life. The aspirations of students behind Ampersand are admirable. I hope Ampersand has a successful launch and helps engender a new spirit of community involvement among current and future university students.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Ampersand</title>,Adjournment,21,1
