Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (09:31):  We seem to be going through this particular process quite regularly at the moment with one particular bill. You would remember that in the past we had a composite bill that included about seven changes that were proposed, some of which were not going to be implemented until 2017. The one before us today is to be implemented in January 2016, and there was one that was going to be earlier than that.


I will not traverse the arguments that I put to this place on Monday about my concerns about the fact that we on the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee have not had significant time, I believe, to look in depth at the proposals in front of us. I think we went into detail on our view that the best way in any of these situations is to allow people who are interested in the legislation to have the opportunity to provide submissions, to ask questions and then to come to a public inquiry of a committee to allow all of us to understand fully the complexities of the issues and also the concerns. That particular process was handled in this place. We have not had that issue. We have already passed the largest component of that composite bill, which was the change to the assets test, and the second part has come before us. This is another part where we have had real trouble in really looking at exactly what the impact will be, the numbers of people that will be involved and also how it fits into the overall planning of people on pensions.


In this case, we have advised the government that we will be supporting this particular part of the legislation, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Defined Benefit Income Streams) Bill 2015, which is on the defined benefit process. We have had considerable discussion with people who understand the impact, and we note—and we say this very openly—that, in the time that we had submissions in this area, there was only one submission that actually pointed out objections to this part. We know that a number of individual people have contacted us subsequently and pointed out their concerns because of their personal circumstances, and we acknowledge that there will be people who are affected by this change. However, in view of the overall process and the overall budgetary impact, our party is supporting this particular change.


We accept also that in this case the information that we received in the departmental submission points out clearly the background to how we have arrived at what is defined as an anomaly in the way the income test is handled for people in this area. There is a clear explanation in the department's submission:


A defined benefit income stream is a pension paid from a public sector or other corporate defined benefit superannuation fund …


It particularly impacts on people who have had a public sector background, 'where the pension generally only reflects years of service and final salary'. The department continues:


In these schemes employers usually fund these income streams as liabilities arise. Generally employees do not provide any of their own contributions to these income streams.


However, some of these schemes, particularly State Government schemes, include up front contributions …


Then the department goes on to explain clearly how the anomaly has occurred that there has been different treatment to the defined benefits scheme. The department's explanation goes back to 1998. I have to admit I was working in the department around that time—



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator MOORE:
  The Department of Social Security at the time. My corporate memory does not actually go back to that time, but I remember clearly that at that stage there was one of the fairly regular overhauls of social security legislation. This happened many times, but 1998 was a big one. As part of the overhaul of the social security rules for income streams, the means test treatment for defined benefit income streams was standardised. There was discussion across the community at the time. Under the income test in particular there were changes to the asset test treatment, and we are looking at an income test change here. Under the income test, all income was accessible except for a small portion representing the amount of personal after-tax contributions, if any, provided directly by the member. This amount was called the deductible amount and was based on the income tax definition, again trying to make sure there was some consistency between the definitions. It was set at a fixed dollar amount when the income stream commenced. It was clear that was the way that planning was done.


In July 2007 there was another process of change which does occur. It looked at superannuation. I remember this one very clearly. I was here, and there was great discussion around this one. This was called at that stage the better superannuation package, and at that stage superannuation measures were introduced to simplify the taxation of superannuation payments. Through that process, the change in the calculation of the deductible amount resulted in people with service prior to 30 June 1983 having a significant amount of up-front employer contributions treated as after-tax contributions. The higher deductible amount was also changed from a fixed amount to a percentage of annual income, which meant it increased as income stream payments increased.


This is complex in the way it operates, but we know that the people who are affected, who have their own packages involved, have great interest in and great knowledge of their individual circumstances. They have taken advice, they understand and they know what the impact of every dollar is in their weekly, monthly and annual process. They understand most clearly what any changes would mean to the way their circumstances are assessed and, particularly under our social security network, how their processes are affected in terms of their access to pensions as well as the other things that run with pensions at the state, federal and local government levels.


Together, the changes that I indicated happened as part of the better superannuation package resulted in a higher deductible amount and, consequently, higher income support payments even though nothing had changed for the defined benefit recipient in terms of their contribution. For example, as at 30 June 2006, only 2.6 per cent of income support recipients had a deductible amount greater than 10 per cent. The figures in terms of those who are going to be impacted by this are small but still significant. The department has indicated in their submission that there are around 140,000 DSS recipients with the defined benefit income streams. Around 55 per cent of income support recipients with defined benefit income streams currently have no deductible amount. The processes I have described in the way the schemes were handled. Their circumstances indicate that they are not assessed in this way. A further 10 per cent have a deductible amount less than 10 per cent, which was about 2.6 per cent, as we said. Approximately 35 per cent—around 47,700 people—are impacted by the change, of which around 20 per cent are provided by federal government, 75 per cent by state and local governments and round five per cent by corporate organisations that had had their own defined scheme.


The measures that are in this piece of legislation will generate savings of $465.5 million, as calculated by Treasury, over the forward estimates for all affected agencies. For the first full year, approximately 46,000 DSS recipients will receive a pension allowance reduced by an average of $2,150 a year—$82.70 a fortnight—and the allowances of 1,700 DSS recipients will be cancelled. That is the explanation of the process and the background to how this package will impact on pensioners across Australia.


I have to mention the correspondence that I have received in my office. Mr President, a large number of the correspondents have been from your state, Tasmania. I am not sure—and I have not been able to get information from the department—whether any greater number of people in Tasmania are part of this scheme. But in the emails and letters that have been coming there have been quite a number from Tasmania. I am interested in this and I will be following up, Minister, as to whether we can get more information about why that is so. It could well be that they are just people who have more networks and more access to information and share the process of contacting their parliamentarians from Tasmania. That is a possibility. We have had people from across the country contact us with different concerns about the other changes in this bill. I acknowledge those people who have taken the time to contact our office and to make their concerns known.


As the shadow minister said in the other place when this bill was being debated, I think only yesterday, this is not an easy decision. It is clear that any such decision by anyone in this place is not easy, because we know that there will be an immediate impact on people's own plans, ways of living and process of planning for the future. However, because of the very limited number in the quite small client group that will be impacted by this, I think there is an opportunity for them to have information and to have support—to get some financial support both through the Centrelink process and outside, to see what the maximum income will be if they lose part payment or if they lose the kinds of figures that were given to us by the department in their submission.


We will be supporting this bill. We maintain our concern about the fact that there has not been, I believe, an opportunity for sufficient scrutiny to give those people who have taken the time to contact us more chance to work through the documentation that we have received from the department. As I said earlier on this particular part of the submission, I made some comments the other day about the quality of the modelling that we had received. On my reading of the departmental submission that we received on this—the background and the figures that they provided—I have confidence in supporting it. So, with those caveats about lack of consultation, with the concern about the people who will be affected—because I know there will be those—and with the understanding that the whole issue of retirement payments will necessarily be considered by this chamber into the future, Labor will support this bill.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2015-06-24,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:43):  Before I begin to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Defined Benefit Income Streams) Bill 2015, I point out that some time was spent in the chamber on Monday having a go at the Greens for passing what we thought was a much more straightforward bill, although some people would argue that it is complex: the pensions asset test bill. We note that the pensions asset changes have been extensively discussed since April, before the budget came in, when the changes were mooted. But this part of what was a bigger bill, which is now a separate bill, has not had much discussion and is in fact quite complex. I am framing my comments in that context.


As we highlighted during the discussion on the pensions asset limit changes, the Greens are supportive of better targeting of government assistance to those who most need it. Those who have saved and can contribute to their retirement should be doing so. The treatment of the deductible amount of the defined benefits is clearly not well targeted. However, through this process it is unclear who is affected and how. I will go through that in a minute.


This measure has not had as much attention as the assets test, because a lot of focus was on the assets test and, as I said, this one is a lot more complicated and it is harder to work out who is affected. There has been little public discussion. However, people, as Senator Moore just pointed out, are now focusing on it more. There are a lot of emails. I note that we are getting a lot of emails from Tasmania. I think that perhaps that shows that the Tasmanians have their act together and have been looking at this issue.


Changes were made in 1998. The anomaly that was introduced in 2007 has led to defined benefits not being fully assessed by Centrelink, which considers pension eligibility. In other words, part of your income is not being assessed when determining pension eligibility. It does need to be corrected. It is unfair. As I understand it, it was not the defined purpose of the changes in 2007, so we do not disagree that this needs to be addressed. However, by the time the Senate committee reported in this place, we were not discussing this particular measure in that bill, so again we feel that people have not had as much opportunity to look at the detail of this, and that is because some of the information is not available. We all agree that this needs addressing, but we have concerns about how it is going to impact on people.


I note from Senate estimates that 65 per cent of those on a defined benefit income will not be affected, so we are not talking about all recipients of a defined benefit when we are talking about the impact. This is important, because we know that these schemes were offered to a wide range of public servants and that many of the 141,000 people who currently have one were in front-line services: we are talking about teachers, nurses, firefighters, social workers and police. On the other hand, we know that these schemes were also offered to department heads, to judges and even, as I understand it, to some politicians. So we are talking about a group of people who, it would be fair to say, have very good salaries, and we are talking about a group of people—teachers, nurses, firefighters—who were not on extremely high salaries.


Judging from the calls and questions that our offices and some of my colleagues' offices have received, the government has not shown the community how this measure will operate. As I said, it has not been as publicly debated as the assets test was. It is worth nothing that there are literally hundreds of schemes. When we looked at this in estimates, the Department of Social Services could not tell us how may schemes there are. Some of the schemes only have a handful of pensioners in them. Understanding all of the interactions here is impossible without an almost forensic analysis of each of those schemes.


With the pension assets test, the government was able to show how it had done its due diligence with microsimulation modelling. The department used real data and applied the tests to that data in a robust way so that we can say—and I am confident we can say—there are at least 171,000 pensioners who will be better off in the first instance under the new assets process. With this measure, it is fair to say we do not have quite the same confidence. I was there during the estimates process, but I have also gone back and pored over the detail of those estimates in Hansard. Unfortunately, during the estimates process, the Department of Social Services could not tell us how many funds there are. As I have just said, there could be, as we understand it, literally hundreds. It also could not tell us whether those funds are still taking new entrants. We think most of them are not, but it is not clear. The department could not tell us how many people there are in each scheme—as I said, in some instances, there are only a handful—what the occupations of those receiving the benefits were and what the average household income for recipients in a defined benefit scheme is. These are the questions that the department could not answer. None of these questions, to my knowledge, have been subsequently addressed by the department's submissions or in response to further questions on notice through the normal estimates process.


While we do support and will continue to support measures that make the pension and income support system fairer, it is difficult to know what some of the full range of impacts will be. I am particularly concerned about those who were teachers, firefighters or police, who, it is fair to say, were not on high incomes. We know some of the average impacts, but nothing so detailed as a micro-simulation of the effects, using real data, appears to have been done. If the government does have these figures, they have not been released. The government certainly has released them for the pension assets tests.


Representatives from firefighters, teachers and police have contacted the Greens and told us that they are concerned about the impacts that this legislation would have on their members, and also to express concern that some things are unclear. It is unclear what the full effect of the changes will be and in fact what the range of impacts will be on some of the recipients.


I suspect a lot of people are unnecessarily worried. There is a large group of people who get only a small amount out of the scheme. Of those affected by the bill, it appears that those who have large exempt proportions were those who were able to contribute over and above the basic contributions their employers made, in the same way as the wealthy are now taking advantage of the super tax breaks. So, in other words, this is going to impact more on those who were contributing a large amount of money and are benefitting very substantially from the loophole that occurred. I repeat again that we do not think it is fair when some are getting a lot of money, and high benefits, from a loophole, where a large amount of income is not being assessed in the income and assets tests. I think any fair-minded Australian would think that that is not fair.


Clearly, people are having a hard time getting across this very complex system, particularly with so many schemes to review. The police federation has told us that they alone have 15 schemes that affect serving and retired police officers. Again, there is a high level of complexity. We know that employees took out a range of options and gave up other benefits or income in a range of ways as a condition of their employment, particularly before the current superannuation arrangements came into place.


I urge all organisations that have been commenting on this, and looking into it, to carefully monitor how their members are affected and to bring to the government's attention any unintended consequences. Having said that, I also acknowledge that social service stakeholders support better targeting of pensions—I have raised this issue repeatedly in this place. These include ACOSS, the Welfare Rights Network, Uniting Care and COTA. They have submitted to the inquiry that they support this change, but they stated they would like to see changes occur in the context of the retirement income review, which, of course, the government is now undertaking as part of their tax review. I have consulted with these groups, and it is clear to me that although they support measures that make the pension fairer they want to see all income treated according to the same rules. I have paid careful attention to what stakeholders are saying.


I also draw the Senate's attention to the change that will take place in six months time, whereas the other pension changes take place on 1 January in the following year. Although the Council on the Ageing does support these changes, they have concerns about the time frame. By comparison, the pension assets test gives people 18 months to adjust. The point made to me is that because this is a defined benefits scheme there is less ability for people to adjust than there is if you are adjusting to the new changes to the pension assets test. A number of people have written to us to highlight that there is not the same option to rearrange your affairs under this scheme. I will certainly be monitoring this process carefully.


People have also raised concerns with us that, while it was clear in the pension assets test changes that there were individuals who were going to be affected, they would in fact get the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. It is unclear to people whether in fact that is going to be the same process for those who are affected by these changes to the defined benefits scheme, and I urge the government to clearly look at the people who are affected and at how they are getting support. I also note that there is some interaction here with working-age payments and pensions, particularly the disability pension, that people have raised concerns with us about. They feel that the government has not properly addressed those concerns. From submissions to the committee, and also from emails we are getting, we know that there are 247 police on disability pensions who, it appears, will be affected.


It is not clear how to identify how defined benefit schemes have been used to provide care and support to those who are forced into early retirement due to a severe workplace injury. Those who have worked on the NDIS and have participated in the discussion about no-fault injury insurance schemes will know that this is another area of reform that is very difficult and is currently underway.


I will be watching to ensure that this bill does not have unintended consequences for those with a disability. It is clearly a small group—we think less than 0.1 per cent of all pensioners—but that does not mean that those people are not important. It means that we need to very carefully, again, look at not just the broader group but specific groups within those who are being adversely affected.


We have given this issue very careful consideration—the same as we gave the pension assets test changes very careful consideration. We understand that there may be a group of people who are affected—in fact, who have unintended consequences—and that is our area of concern, particularly for those people on modest incomes as public servants, such as teachers and firefighters, who may be adversely affected. They went into these schemes thinking that that was the right thing to do. They got caught up in the loophole and, again, we acknowledge the loophole. It is unfair that there are those with a high level of assets who are getting a very healthy income stream out of this process who are not being counted. We acknowledge that we need to address that issue, which is why we will be supporting this bill. As you can see from what I have just described in my second reading contribution there are complexities here, but we agree that we need to make this process fairer. 


We will be supporting it, but we urge the government to monitor the impact of this, particularly the unintended consequences, because they have not been able to model them the same as they could model—as I said, through the microsimulation process—the impact of the pensioner assets test. They have not been able to do this here because it is complex, because of the multiple schemes. I understand that. We do not know how it is specifically affecting different former income earners. Again, I do not know whether the government is finding it too hard to model, or they just have not done it. 


We urge them to monitor this. We certainly will be, and if there are unintended consequences for those people, particularly those with low and modest assets, we urge the government to then bring it back if they need to make amendments. If they do not, we will be. We will be monitoring this carefully, because overall we do think it is in the best interests of making the whole system fairer and consistent and applying rules that have equal impact. However, there may be a group of people who are affected through this process. Please monitor it. 


We certainly will be, and we will bring back changes if this is causing hardship for those people who were teachers, firefighters and police. We note that military personnel have been exempted from this process. We need to look at those other public servants whom no-one could say were on very high incomes and who have contributed through their service, thinking they were doing the right thing. We will be monitoring that very carefully and proposing amendments if the government does not act to address those unintended and unforeseen consequences.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2015-06-24,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (09:59):  I do not think there are other colleagues looking to make contributions, so I will sum up at this point. As has been canvassed, this bill will introduce a further 2015 budget measure improving the fairness and sustainability of the pension system for improved fairness and equity. The bill will make sure a fairer proportion of superannuants' actual defined benefit income is taken into account when the social security income test is applied.


From 1 January 2016, this measure will introduce a 10 per cent cap on the defined benefit income test that can be excluded from the social security income test. A defined benefit income stream is a pension paid from a public sector or other corporate defined benefit superannuation fund where the pension paid generally reflects years of service and the final salary of the beneficiary.


Current arrangements allow some defined benefit superannuants to have a larger proportion of their superannuation income excluded from the pension income test, but it is important to point out that people receiving Department of Veterans' Affairs pensions will not be affected by this change and that defined benefit income streams paid by military superannuation schemes will be excluded. This is essentially an equity measure. I commend the bill to the Senate.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:43):  Before I begin to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Defined Benefit Income Streams) Bill 2015, I point out that some time was spent in the chamber on Monday having a go at the Greens for passing what we thought was a much more straightforward bill, although some people would argue that it is complex: the pensions asset test bill. We note that the pensions asset changes have been extensively discussed since April, before the budget came in, when the changes were mooted. But this part of what was a bigger bill, which is now a separate bill, has not had much discussion and is in fact quite complex. I am framing my comments in that context.


As we highlighted during the discussion on the pensions asset limit changes, the Greens are supportive of better targeting of government assistance to those who most need it. Those who have saved and can contribute to their retirement should be doing so. The treatment of the deductible amount of the defined benefits is clearly not well targeted. However, through this process it is unclear who is affected and how. I will go through that in a minute.


This measure has not had as much attention as the assets test, because a lot of focus was on the assets test and, as I said, this one is a lot more complicated and it is harder to work out who is affected. There has been little public discussion. However, people, as Senator Moore just pointed out, are now focusing on it more. There are a lot of emails. I note that we are getting a lot of emails from Tasmania. I think that perhaps that shows that the Tasmanians have their act together and have been looking at this issue.


Changes were made in 1998. The anomaly that was introduced in 2007 has led to defined benefits not being fully assessed by Centrelink, which considers pension eligibility. In other words, part of your income is not being assessed when determining pension eligibility. It does need to be corrected. It is unfair. As I understand it, it was not the defined purpose of the changes in 2007, so we do not disagree that this needs to be addressed. However, by the time the Senate committee reported in this place, we were not discussing this particular measure in that bill, so again we feel that people have not had as much opportunity to look at the detail of this, and that is because some of the information is not available. We all agree that this needs addressing, but we have concerns about how it is going to impact on people.


I note from Senate estimates that 65 per cent of those on a defined benefit income will not be affected, so we are not talking about all recipients of a defined benefit when we are talking about the impact. This is important, because we know that these schemes were offered to a wide range of public servants and that many of the 141,000 people who currently have one were in front-line services: we are talking about teachers, nurses, firefighters, social workers and police. On the other hand, we know that these schemes were also offered to department heads, to judges and even, as I understand it, to some politicians. So we are talking about a group of people who, it would be fair to say, have very good salaries, and we are talking about a group of people—teachers, nurses, firefighters—who were not on extremely high salaries.


Judging from the calls and questions that our offices and some of my colleagues' offices have received, the government has not shown the community how this measure will operate. As I said, it has not been as publicly debated as the assets test was. It is worth nothing that there are literally hundreds of schemes. When we looked at this in estimates, the Department of Social Services could not tell us how may schemes there are. Some of the schemes only have a handful of pensioners in them. Understanding all of the interactions here is impossible without an almost forensic analysis of each of those schemes.


With the pension assets test, the government was able to show how it had done its due diligence with microsimulation modelling. The department used real data and applied the tests to that data in a robust way so that we can say—and I am confident we can say—there are at least 171,000 pensioners who will be better off in the first instance under the new assets process. With this measure, it is fair to say we do not have quite the same confidence. I was there during the estimates process, but I have also gone back and pored over the detail of those estimates in Hansard. Unfortunately, during the estimates process, the Department of Social Services could not tell us how many funds there are. As I have just said, there could be, as we understand it, literally hundreds. It also could not tell us whether those funds are still taking new entrants. We think most of them are not, but it is not clear. The department could not tell us how many people there are in each scheme—as I said, in some instances, there are only a handful—what the occupations of those receiving the benefits were and what the average household income for recipients in a defined benefit scheme is. These are the questions that the department could not answer. None of these questions, to my knowledge, have been subsequently addressed by the department's submissions or in response to further questions on notice through the normal estimates process.


While we do support and will continue to support measures that make the pension and income support system fairer, it is difficult to know what some of the full range of impacts will be. I am particularly concerned about those who were teachers, firefighters or police, who, it is fair to say, were not on high incomes. We know some of the average impacts, but nothing so detailed as a micro-simulation of the effects, using real data, appears to have been done. If the government does have these figures, they have not been released. The government certainly has released them for the pension assets tests.


Representatives from firefighters, teachers and police have contacted the Greens and told us that they are concerned about the impacts that this legislation would have on their members, and also to express concern that some things are unclear. It is unclear what the full effect of the changes will be and in fact what the range of impacts will be on some of the recipients.


I suspect a lot of people are unnecessarily worried. There is a large group of people who get only a small amount out of the scheme. Of those affected by the bill, it appears that those who have large exempt proportions were those who were able to contribute over and above the basic contributions their employers made, in the same way as the wealthy are now taking advantage of the super tax breaks. So, in other words, this is going to impact more on those who were contributing a large amount of money and are benefitting very substantially from the loophole that occurred. I repeat again that we do not think it is fair when some are getting a lot of money, and high benefits, from a loophole, where a large amount of income is not being assessed in the income and assets tests. I think any fair-minded Australian would think that that is not fair.


Clearly, people are having a hard time getting across this very complex system, particularly with so many schemes to review. The police federation has told us that they alone have 15 schemes that affect serving and retired police officers. Again, there is a high level of complexity. We know that employees took out a range of options and gave up other benefits or income in a range of ways as a condition of their employment, particularly before the current superannuation arrangements came into place.


I urge all organisations that have been commenting on this, and looking into it, to carefully monitor how their members are affected and to bring to the government's attention any unintended consequences. Having said that, I also acknowledge that social service stakeholders support better targeting of pensions—I have raised this issue repeatedly in this place. These include ACOSS, the Welfare Rights Network, Uniting Care and COTA. They have submitted to the inquiry that they support this change, but they stated they would like to see changes occur in the context of the retirement income review, which, of course, the government is now undertaking as part of their tax review. I have consulted with these groups, and it is clear to me that although they support measures that make the pension fairer they want to see all income treated according to the same rules. I have paid careful attention to what stakeholders are saying.


I also draw the Senate's attention to the change that will take place in six months time, whereas the other pension changes take place on 1 January in the following year. Although the Council on the Ageing does support these changes, they have concerns about the time frame. By comparison, the pension assets test gives people 18 months to adjust. The point made to me is that because this is a defined benefits scheme there is less ability for people to adjust than there is if you are adjusting to the new changes to the pension assets test. A number of people have written to us to highlight that there is not the same option to rearrange your affairs under this scheme. I will certainly be monitoring this process carefully.


People have also raised concerns with us that, while it was clear in the pension assets test changes that there were individuals who were going to be affected, they would in fact get the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. It is unclear to people whether in fact that is going to be the same process for those who are affected by these changes to the defined benefits scheme, and I urge the government to clearly look at the people who are affected and at how they are getting support. I also note that there is some interaction here with working-age payments and pensions, particularly the disability pension, that people have raised concerns with us about. They feel that the government has not properly addressed those concerns. From submissions to the committee, and also from emails we are getting, we know that there are 247 police on disability pensions who, it appears, will be affected.


It is not clear how to identify how defined benefit schemes have been used to provide care and support to those who are forced into early retirement due to a severe workplace injury. Those who have worked on the NDIS and have participated in the discussion about no-fault injury insurance schemes will know that this is another area of reform that is very difficult and is currently underway.


I will be watching to ensure that this bill does not have unintended consequences for those with a disability. It is clearly a small group—we think less than 0.1 per cent of all pensioners—but that does not mean that those people are not important. It means that we need to very carefully, again, look at not just the broader group but specific groups within those who are being adversely affected.


We have given this issue very careful consideration—the same as we gave the pension assets test changes very careful consideration. We understand that there may be a group of people who are affected—in fact, who have unintended consequences—and that is our area of concern, particularly for those people on modest incomes as public servants, such as teachers and firefighters, who may be adversely affected. They went into these schemes thinking that that was the right thing to do. They got caught up in the loophole and, again, we acknowledge the loophole. It is unfair that there are those with a high level of assets who are getting a very healthy income stream out of this process who are not being counted. We acknowledge that we need to address that issue, which is why we will be supporting this bill. As you can see from what I have just described in my second reading contribution there are complexities here, but we agree that we need to make this process fairer. 


We will be supporting it, but we urge the government to monitor the impact of this, particularly the unintended consequences, because they have not been able to model them the same as they could model—as I said, through the microsimulation process—the impact of the pensioner assets test. They have not been able to do this here because it is complex, because of the multiple schemes. I understand that. We do not know how it is specifically affecting different former income earners. Again, I do not know whether the government is finding it too hard to model, or they just have not done it. 


We urge them to monitor this. We certainly will be, and if there are unintended consequences for those people, particularly those with low and modest assets, we urge the government to then bring it back if they need to make amendments. If they do not, we will be. We will be monitoring this carefully, because overall we do think it is in the best interests of making the whole system fairer and consistent and applying rules that have equal impact. However, there may be a group of people who are affected through this process. Please monitor it. 


We certainly will be, and we will bring back changes if this is causing hardship for those people who were teachers, firefighters and police. We note that military personnel have been exempted from this process. We need to look at those other public servants whom no-one could say were on very high incomes and who have contributed through their service, thinking they were doing the right thing. We will be monitoring that very carefully and proposing amendments if the government does not act to address those unintended and unforeseen consequences.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2015-06-24,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (09:59):  I do not think there are other colleagues looking to make contributions, so I will sum up at this point. As has been canvassed, this bill will introduce a further 2015 budget measure improving the fairness and sustainability of the pension system for improved fairness and equity. The bill will make sure a fairer proportion of superannuants' actual defined benefit income is taken into account when the social security income test is applied.


From 1 January 2016, this measure will introduce a 10 per cent cap on the defined benefit income test that can be excluded from the social security income test. A defined benefit income stream is a pension paid from a public sector or other corporate defined benefit superannuation fund where the pension paid generally reflects years of service and the final salary of the beneficiary.


Current arrangements allow some defined benefit superannuants to have a larger proportion of their superannuation income excluded from the pension income test, but it is important to point out that people receiving Department of Veterans' Affairs pensions will not be affected by this change and that defined benefit income streams paid by military superannuation schemes will be excluded. This is essentially an equity measure. I commend the bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

  Thank you. I have been engaged, as we all have, in lots of meetings since the debate on excise. I did indicate during my second reading contribution that I would vote against that bill. I felt sure that the Greens, who spoke against the bill, would have called a division, and I would have been able to vote. I am horrified to find now that, in spite of opposition, the Greens have, for the first time ever, not called a division. Therefore, I was unable to record my vote against the legislation. I just wanted to make that clear.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (12:23):  I am pleased to be able to speak to the Airports Amendment Bill 2015 today. The bill addresses deficiencies in regard to the Airports Act 1996 as these deficiencies create uncertainty and confusion about the process for establishing a second Sydney airport. Labor believe that Sydney needs a second airport sooner rather than later. We on this side of the chamber recognise that such infrastructure development is vital to continue economic growth. It is in this context that Labor support this bill.


The Airports Act 1996 was initially developed to address issues associated with the ongoing ownership and operation of our major airports following a process of privatisation that occurred in the early 1990s. It is focused on regulating ownership, planning and development of 21 federally leased airports. These 21 include all the main capital city airports around Australia. One of those privatisations was the lease of Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport, which was a transaction that occurred in 2002 under the Howard government. The legislation before us today seeks to deal with some of the unintended consequences of that transaction.


This bill also addresses the fact that the proposal for Sydney's second airport is based upon a greenfield development, and is something not contemplated by the regulatory structure of the current act. It also envisages the mandatory adoption of the environmental conditions in any airport approval. The opposition welcome that move because we believe that environmental best practice must underpin the development of Sydney's second airport. Sydney is a global city. Its efficient operation is central to the economic productivity, not just for New South Wales, but for the entire nation. Sydney's economic productivity is currently constricted by infrastructure limitations resulting in limited space and bottlenecks in the traffic network. There is broad consensus across experts that a second Sydney airport is needed.


The New South Wales and federal governments commissioned the joint study into Sydney's aviation needs which was commenced and completed under the former federal Labor government, reporting in March 2012. It warned that the economic consequences of inaction would be dire, including a $6 billion loss in national GDP by 2035. The key recommendation of the 3,000-page report was the development of a second Sydney airport. Handled properly, a second airport can provide important employment opportunities and jobs for tens of thousands of people in Western Sydney. The joint study found that, in the absence of a second airport in Sydney:


The number of total jobs that will not be created is estimated to grow over time as unmet demand increases. This is averaged to be 12,700 in NSW and 17,300 nationally over the period from 2011. In 2060 alone, the annual estimate of foregone jobs is approximately 57,000 in NSW and 77,900 nationally.


The Grattan Institute undertook detailed research last year, identifying geographic locations in which high-paying, high-productivity jobs are located. It noted:


Inner city areas and secondary commercial hubs, such as those around large cities' airports, also tend to be more productive than other locations. 


New employment opportunities generated by a new Sydney airport are not restricted to the airport site. Airports attract industry to their precincts. The importance of this cannot be overstated.


The 2013 State of Australian cities report made clear that Australia is undergoing a shift whereby jobs growth is moving from the suburbs to the inner city. Notwithstanding this shift in jobs to the city, housing remains most affordable in suburban areas. The result is that many Australians have to commute from their homes in the suburbs to their jobs in the city. The social consequences of this trend are significant. Many Australian parents are now spending more time commuting than they spend playing with their children. The construction of a second airport in Sydney would go a long way to addressing this challenge for families in Western Sydney. A second Sydney airport would not only increase economic growth but improve the lives of thousands of people who would be able to live closer to their workplaces. That means less time on the road for parents and more time with their family and friends.


The Airports Act was designed to deal with existing federally leased airports and does not address the development of an entirely new airport. This bill provides for the development of a master plan focused on the strategic and conceptual elements of the development proposal, as well as a process for initial major development plans. Once the development of the new airport is complete, the standard five-yearly approval arrangements that exist for all other federally leased airports will come into effect.


Importantly, Labor welcomes the bill's proposed strengthened role for the environment minister in making mandatory environmental conditions rather than, as is currently the case for other airports, making non-binding recommendations to the infrastructure minister. Labor emphasises that the EIS process which is being conducted under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 needs to be thorough, evidence based and transparent, with conditions that address environmental amenity as required. We welcome the commitment from the minister to allow a full process of concurrent community input into both the airport plan and the EIS later this year.


In conclusion, after working in government to lay the groundwork for the development of a second Sydney airport, Labor will continue to play a constructive role in making the project a reality. But in doing so we insist on proper process, including public consultation and assessment of environmental impacts. The project must focus on optimising the economic outcomes of such a development, including maximising employment opportunities for Australians. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2015-06-24,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (12:30):  I rise to speak on the Airports Amendment Bill 2015. This bill goes some of the way to clarifying the process around the construction of a new airport in Sydney and removes the veto that the Sydney Airport Corporation, which runs the existing airport, currently has over the construction of a new airport. The Greens are not opposed to changing the rules around the construction of another airport and requiring an environmental impact statement, but we want to place on the record that we feel that an airport at Badgerys Creek does not seem to stack up as the right option for Sydney residents. We are seeking to amend this bill to ensure that should the location of any future airport be moved away from Badgerys Creek the government cannot turn around and say, 'Here's an environmental impact statement we prepared earlier for Badgerys Creek; that'll do.'


The government is rushing to build the Badgerys Creek airport without an owner or a builder. All it has is a commitment to more than $2 billion for more congestion-inducing roads in Western Sydney. There will not be a rail connection, and high-speed rail is not under consideration at all. This is not the transformative approach that Sydney residents and visitors need. The push for Badgerys Creek lacks crucial detail and is instead based on a whole host of false assumptions. If an airport at Badgerys Creek goes ahead, residents will suffer. There is no way around the increase in aircraft noise. While the land around Badgerys Creek is yet to be developed, that certainly will not be the case in 2025, when the airport is first operational. When look at this we must not look at what Badgerys Creek will look like in 2015; we must look to what it will look like after it has been in operation for a while.


It is unlikely to have a curfew. In fact, proponents of Badgerys Creek have stated on numerous occasions that the only way the airport will be financially viable will be if it operates on a 24-hour basis. It is completely unfair to suggest that Western Sydney residents should be subjected to a 24/7 airport when residents in the inner west of Sydney and the inner city have appropriate respite with a curfew. This will not reduce aircraft noise around the existing airport either. In fact, it is far more likely that the creation of a second airport at Badgerys Creek will increase aircraft noise at Mascot. Badgerys Creek is expected to be a smaller airport with less hangar space and a smaller runway, similar to Avalon airport in Melbourne. And like at Avalon, Badgerys Creek will soak up demand for smaller, regional flights, leaving more arrival and departure slots open at Mascot for large, international jets. This means more aircraft noise, not less.


The benefit for jobs is not all it is cracked up to be. The Prime Minister's claim that the project will create 60,000 jobs is a fine example of pulling figures out of nowhere. The alleged job-creation figures have been used by several Western Sydney councils as well as Unions New South Wales to justify their support for Badgerys Creek. A more realistic scenario was developed by the New South Wales Business Chamber, which stands to gain enormous sums of money via the creation of another private—yet publicly subsidised—airport. They were relying on passenger movements estimated by the federal government's joint study into aviation capacity, and they slashed the job-creation estimates to one-sixth of Abbott's claim by 2040. It is quite clear that Abbott and the business lobby have inflated job-creation figures to boost support for Badgerys Creek.


But perhaps the worst part of this plan is the details of how people will get there and the impact of congestion on locals. There is $2 billion earmarked for massive, polluting roads and nothing for a rail connection. This is just going to put more pressure on roads. We know that the best way to unclog our roads is to give people the option of efficient, safe and affordable public transport. The jury is still out on the need for a second airport in Sydney. It has been challenged by numerous economists. In April, Fairfax economics editor Peter Martin wrote that he:


… would like to know the government had tried other solutions before settling on spending billions building a new airport in an inconvenient location.


It is these other options that we must be looking at. Imagine if we got serious about high-speed rail along the east coast of Australia. We could significantly reduce demand on our airports while delivering a much-needed boost to our regional centres. Yet we seem to be going around in circles.


The Melbourne-to-Sydney air route is the fifth-busiest air route in the world, and it is the third-busiest overland route—that is, a route where to travel overland is not straightforward. Sydney-to-Brisbane is pretty busy, too. The proportion of people who travel from Sydney to Canberra by air is ridiculous, given that the distance is under 300 kilometres.


The level of air travel into Sydney from Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra is the sign of a desperately underdeveloped rail system. Medium-fast services should be able to travel faster than cars but badly fail that benchmark in all directions. And of course high-speed rail would really compete against air travel between Sydney and Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra. What needs to happen is inclusion of the likely development of high-speed rail in the planning mix—to actually consider what that means for the number of flight arrivals and departures into Sydney.


Establishing a high-speed rail authority and reserving the route for high-speed rail are much more important than planning for a second airport in Sydney, because high-speed rail and good old ordinary, medium-fast, as-long-as-it was-efficient rail have the potential to be major factors enabling us to not only reduce the pressures on airports in Sydney but drastically reduce our transport related carbon pollution.


The rest of the world is moving on high-speed rail, so why not us? Other than Australia, Antarctica is the only other continent that does not have high-speed rail. And at the speed that we are moving on high-speed rail, it seems that the penguins are likely to beat us to it. 


High-speed rail is affordable. You can tell this by the fact that the Chinese, the Japanese and the Spanish high-speed rail developers are all interested in coming to Australia and building high-speed rail as a purely private operation without needing public money. I am not saying that is the way that we should be heading, but the fact that they are interested in doing this shows you that there is a strong economic case for the development of high-speed rail along the east coast of Australia. 


Without going to the transformative stage of high-speed rail, we need to make improvements to our existing rail services so that you can get from Sydney to Canberra, Sydney to Melbourne and Sydney to Brisbane faster than you can drive. This sort of thing is possible in every other country in the world where you have an efficient rail system. It needs to occur, and the way it has to occur is through putting more investment into improving our rail systems, not spending all that money on massive, polluting roads. We need affirmative action for public transport, because of the huge benefits to Australia that it would deliver. 


I am not arguing that there is not a future for air transport, but we have to note that it is the most difficult form of transport to implement with zero carbon emissions. And that is where we need to be heading—we need to be reducing our carbon pollution to zero. The world is realising this. The world is moving on this. Country after country are having much more ambitious carbon reduction targets than Australia. The Pope has realised this as well. But it is clear from debate after debate in this chamber that Australia is very, very slow—as slow as the trains that travel between Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Brisbane. The good thing, of course, is that a better transport mix is not only low carbon but is better for local communities too. And the residents of Sydney deserve no less.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:40):  I rise to speak on the Airports Amendment Bill 2015. The Greens do not oppose this bill as we are supportive of measures designed to limit the authority of the privatised Sydney Airport Corporation to dictate transport policy in New South Wales. When Sydney Airport was privatised by the Liberal-Nationals not only did the government cede authority over an important level of transport policy in Australia; it handed monopoly control of air travel in and out of Sydney to a private company that paid no tax in the 10 years following privatisation. What a deal. Travellers in the community are in agreement that the privatisation of vital transport infrastructure has been a failure. 


The privatisation of Sydney Airport has made it much more difficult for the government to pursue a sustainable, long-term and consultative plan around air travel in the Sydney region. As previously stated, the Greens do not oppose plans to grant the government greater authority vis-a-vis the Sydney Airport Corporation when it comes to the planning of air-travel infrastructure. The Greens do oppose, however, the current plan—supported by the Liberal and Labor leaderships—to build a supplementary Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. This opposition is shared by many in the local community as well as local Labor and Liberal MPs. My colleague Senator Janet Rice, the Greens transport spokesperson, has set out our position with regard to this aspect of the bill.


The fact that this legislation has been brought on more than six months after the government announced its intention to construct an airport at Badgerys Creek shows the lack of momentum behind this project. The fact that the legislation explicitly expands the potential list of bidders for the construction and operation of an airport at Badgerys Creek shows how little success the government has had in securing any private support for its plan to build a new airport at Badgerys Creek. All we have seen so far has been an announcement, the funding of more roads and now this legislation—months after the fact. 


Many in the community and experts in the infrastructure industry remain convinced that the Abbott government and the Labor opposition have little intention of actually constructing an airport at Badgerys Creek. Both the coalition and Labor are keen to be seen to be getting on with planning for a new airport as a way to present a jobs message for Western Sydney. We now know that this promise does not stack up. 


Time will tell if Badgerys Creek is ever built. The Greens are concerned that the case for the project does not add up for locals and the environment, and this is clearly illustrated when we look at the promised jobs growth. When Prime Minister Tony Abbott made his announcement last year regarding Badgerys Creek airport, many of the assumptions used by the coalition and the building lobby to build support for the airport were reported in the media as fact. As a result, much of the debate around the benefits of Badgerys Creek as a location for a second Sydney airport lacks accurate detail. 


In his announcement, Prime Minister Abbott stated that the construction and operation of Badgerys Creek airport would create 60,000 jobs—60,000 jobs is a lot, and the announcement was clearly made to impress people. It was over an unspecified time frame. When you see that, it makes you wonder. The alleged job creation figures have been used by several lobby groups to justify their support for an airport at Badgerys Creek. No sources were presented for the Prime Minister's 60,000 jobs figure claim. It has been argued that to achieve such a high figure the airport would have to have passenger movements rivalling Heathrow Airport in London or Los Angeles airport—a feat unlikely to be repeated at a supplementary airport at Badgerys Creek. 


The only recent estimation of jobs created by the construction and operation of a Badgerys Creek airport was conducted by the New South Wales Business Chamber, a lobby group for the business sector who obviously stand to gain enormously by the creation of another private—yet, publicly subsidised—airport and the associated publicly subsidised infrastructure to service the airport. Their report estimated that 30,000 jobs be created by 2050—at least they gave us a time frame. Now that figure is already half of the figure touted by the Prime Minister and reported in the media, time and time again. However, this figure also relies on the assumption—

There is broad consensus across experts that a second Sydney airport is needed.


The New South Wales and federal governments commissioned the joint study into Sydney's aviation needs which was commenced and completed under the former federal Labor government, reporting in March 2012. It warned that the economic consequences of inaction would be dire, including a $6 billion loss in national GDP by 2035. The key recommendation of the 3,000-page report was the development of a second Sydney airport. Handled properly, a second airport can provide important employment opportunities and jobs for tens of thousands of people in Western Sydney. The joint study found that, in the absence of a second airport in Sydney:


The number of total jobs that will not be created is estimated to grow over time as unmet demand increases. This is averaged to be 12,700 in NSW and 17,300 nationally over the period from 2011. In 2060 alone, the annual estimate of foregone jobs is approximately 57,000 in NSW and 77,900 nationally.


The Grattan Institute undertook detailed research last year, identifying geographic locations in which high-paying, high-productivity jobs are located. It noted:


Inner city areas and secondary commercial hubs, such as those around large cities' airports, also tend to be more productive than other locations. 


New employment opportunities generated by a new Sydney airport are not restricted to the airport site. Airports attract industry to their precincts. The importance of this cannot be overstated.


The 2013 State of Australian cities report made clear that Australia is undergoing a shift whereby jobs growth is moving from the suburbs to the inner city. Notwithstanding this shift in jobs to the city, housing remains most affordable in suburban areas. The result is that many Australians have to commute from their homes in the suburbs to their jobs in the city. The social consequences of this trend are significant. Many Australian parents are now spending more time commuting than they spend playing with their children. The construction of a second airport in Sydney would go a long way to addressing this challenge for families in Western Sydney. A second Sydney airport would not only increase economic growth but improve the lives of thousands of people who would be able to live closer to their workplaces. That means less time on the road for parents and more time with their family and friends.


The Airports Act was designed to deal with existing federally leased airports and does not address the development of an entirely new airport. This bill provides for the development of a master plan focused on the strategic and conceptual elements of the development proposal, as well as a process for initial major development plans. Once the development of the new airport is complete, the standard five-yearly approval arrangements that exist for all other federally leased airports will come into effect.


Importantly, Labor welcomes the bill's proposed strengthened role for the environment minister in making mandatory environmental conditions rather than, as is currently the case for other airports, making non-binding recommendations to the infrastructure minister. Labor emphasises that the EIS process which is being conducted under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 needs to be thorough, evidence based and transparent, with conditions that address environmental amenity as required. We welcome the commitment from the minister to allow a full process of concurrent community input into both the airport plan and the EIS later this year.


In conclusion, after working in government to lay the groundwork for the development of a second Sydney airport, Labor will continue to play a constructive role in making the project a reality. But in doing so we insist on proper process, including public consultation and assessment of environmental impacts. The project must focus on optimising the economic outcomes of such a development, including maximising employment opportunities for Australians. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2015-06-24,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (12:30):  I rise to speak on the Airports Amendment Bill 2015. This bill goes some of the way to clarifying the process around the construction of a new airport in Sydney and removes the veto that the Sydney Airport Corporation, which runs the existing airport, currently has over the construction of a new airport. The Greens are not opposed to changing the rules around the construction of another airport and requiring an environmental impact statement, but we want to place on the record that we feel that an airport at Badgerys Creek does not seem to stack up as the right option for Sydney residents. We are seeking to amend this bill to ensure that should the location of any future airport be moved away from Badgerys Creek the government cannot turn around and say, 'Here's an environmental impact statement we prepared earlier for Badgerys Creek; that'll do.'


The government is rushing to build the Badgerys Creek airport without an owner or a builder. All it has is a commitment to more than $2 billion for more congestion-inducing roads in Western Sydney. There will not be a rail connection, and high-speed rail is not under consideration at all. This is not the transformative approach that Sydney residents and visitors need. The push for Badgerys Creek lacks crucial detail and is instead based on a whole host of false assumptions. If an airport at Badgerys Creek goes ahead, residents will suffer. There is no way around the increase in aircraft noise. While the land around Badgerys Creek is yet to be developed, that certainly will not be the case in 2025, when the airport is first operational. When look at this we must not look at what Badgerys Creek will look like in 2015; we must look to what it will look like after it has been in operation for a while.


It is unlikely to have a curfew. In fact, proponents of Badgerys Creek have stated on numerous occasions that the only way the airport will be financially viable will be if it operates on a 24-hour basis. It is completely unfair to suggest that Western Sydney residents should be subjected to a 24/7 airport when residents in the inner west of Sydney and the inner city have appropriate respite with a curfew. This will not reduce aircraft noise around the existing airport either. In fact, it is far more likely that the creation of a second airport at Badgerys Creek will increase aircraft noise at Mascot. Badgerys Creek is expected to be a smaller airport with less hangar space and a smaller runway, similar to Avalon airport in Melbourne. And like at Avalon, Badgerys Creek will soak up demand for smaller, regional flights, leaving more arrival and departure slots open at Mascot for large, international jets. This means more aircraft noise, not less.


The benefit for jobs is not all it is cracked up to be. The Prime Minister's claim that the project will create 60,000 jobs is a fine example of pulling figures out of nowhere. The alleged job-creation figures have been used by several Western Sydney councils as well as Unions New South Wales to justify their support for Badgerys Creek. A more realistic scenario was developed by the New South Wales Business Chamber, which stands to gain enormous sums of money via the creation of another private—yet publicly subsidised—airport. They were relying on passenger movements estimated by the federal government's joint study into aviation capacity, and they slashed the job-creation estimates to one-sixth of Abbott's claim by 2040. It is quite clear that Abbott and the business lobby have inflated job-creation figures to boost support for Badgerys Creek.


But perhaps the worst part of this plan is the details of how people will get there and the impact of congestion on locals. There is $2 billion earmarked for massive, polluting roads and nothing for a rail connection. This is just going to put more pressure on roads. We know that the best way to unclog our roads is to give people the option of efficient, safe and affordable public transport. The jury is still out on the need for a second airport in Sydney. It has been challenged by numerous economists. In April, Fairfax economics editor Peter Martin wrote that he:


… would like to know the government had tried other solutions before settling on spending billions building a new airport in an inconvenient location.


It is these other options that we must be looking at. Imagine if we got serious about high-speed rail along the east coast of Australia. We could significantly reduce demand on our airports while delivering a much-needed boost to our regional centres. Yet we seem to be going around in circles.


The Melbourne-to-Sydney air route is the fifth-busiest air route in the world, and it is the third-busiest overland route—that is, a route where to travel overland is not straightforward. Sydney-to-Brisbane is pretty busy, too. The proportion of people who travel from Sydney to Canberra by air is ridiculous, given that the distance is under 300 kilometres.


The level of air travel into Sydney from Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra is the sign of a desperately underdeveloped rail system. Medium-fast services should be able to travel faster than cars but badly fail that benchmark in all directions. And of course high-speed rail would really compete against air travel between Sydney and Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra. What needs to happen is inclusion of the likely development of high-speed rail in the planning mix—to actually consider what that means for the number of flight arrivals and departures into Sydney.


Establishing a high-speed rail authority and reserving the route for high-speed rail are much more important than planning for a second airport in Sydney, because high-speed rail and good old ordinary, medium-fast, as-long-as-it was-efficient rail have the potential to be major factors enabling us to not only reduce the pressures on airports in Sydney but drastically reduce our transport related carbon pollution.


The rest of the world is moving on high-speed rail, so why not us? Other than Australia, Antarctica is the only other continent that does not have high-speed rail. And at the speed that we are moving on high-speed rail, it seems that the penguins are likely to beat us to it. 


High-speed rail is affordable. You can tell this by the fact that the Chinese, the Japanese and the Spanish high-speed rail developers are all interested in coming to Australia and building high-speed rail as a purely private operation without needing public money. I am not saying that is the way that we should be heading, but the fact that they are interested in doing this shows you that there is a strong economic case for the development of high-speed rail along the east coast of Australia. 


Without going to the transformative stage of high-speed rail, we need to make improvements to our existing rail services so that you can get from Sydney to Canberra, Sydney to Melbourne and Sydney to Brisbane faster than you can drive. This sort of thing is possible in every other country in the world where you have an efficient rail system. It needs to occur, and the way it has to occur is through putting more investment into improving our rail systems, not spending all that money on massive, polluting roads. We need affirmative action for public transport, because of the huge benefits to Australia that it would deliver. 


I am not arguing that there is not a future for air transport, but we have to note that it is the most difficult form of transport to implement with zero carbon emissions. And that is where we need to be heading—we need to be reducing our carbon pollution to zero. The world is realising this. The world is moving on this. Country after country are having much more ambitious carbon reduction targets than Australia. The Pope has realised this as well. But it is clear from debate after debate in this chamber that Australia is very, very slow—as slow as the trains that travel between Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Brisbane. The good thing, of course, is that a better transport mix is not only low carbon but is better for local communities too. And the residents of Sydney deserve no less.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2015-06-24,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:40):  I rise to speak on the Airports Amendment Bill 2015. The Greens do not oppose this bill as we are supportive of measures designed to limit the authority of the privatised Sydney Airport Corporation to dictate transport policy in New South Wales. When Sydney Airport was privatised by the Liberal-Nationals not only did the government cede authority over an important level of transport policy in Australia; it handed monopoly control of air travel in and out of Sydney to a private company that paid no tax in the 10 years following privatisation. What a deal. Travellers in the community are in agreement that the privatisation of vital transport infrastructure has been a failure. 


The privatisation of Sydney Airport has made it much more difficult for the government to pursue a sustainable, long-term and consultative plan around air travel in the Sydney region. As previously stated, the Greens do not oppose plans to grant the government greater authority vis-a-vis the Sydney Airport Corporation when it comes to the planning of air-travel infrastructure. The Greens do oppose, however, the current plan—supported by the Liberal and Labor leaderships—to build a supplementary Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. This opposition is shared by many in the local community as well as local Labor and Liberal MPs. My colleague Senator Janet Rice, the Greens transport spokesperson, has set out our position with regard to this aspect of the bill.


The fact that this legislation has been brought on more than six months after the government announced its intention to construct an airport at Badgerys Creek shows the lack of momentum behind this project. The fact that the legislation explicitly expands the potential list of bidders for the construction and operation of an airport at Badgerys Creek shows how little success the government has had in securing any private support for its plan to build a new airport at Badgerys Creek. All we have seen so far has been an announcement, the funding of more roads and now this legislation—months after the fact. 


Many in the community and experts in the infrastructure industry remain convinced that the Abbott government and the Labor opposition have little intention of actually constructing an airport at Badgerys Creek. Both the coalition and Labor are keen to be seen to be getting on with planning for a new airport as a way to present a jobs message for Western Sydney. We now know that this promise does not stack up. 


Time will tell if Badgerys Creek is ever built. The Greens are concerned that the case for the project does not add up for locals and the environment, and this is clearly illustrated when we look at the promised jobs growth. When Prime Minister Tony Abbott made his announcement last year regarding Badgerys Creek airport, many of the assumptions used by the coalition and the building lobby to build support for the airport were reported in the media as fact. As a result, much of the debate around the benefits of Badgerys Creek as a location for a second Sydney airport lacks accurate detail. 


In his announcement, Prime Minister Abbott stated that the construction and operation of Badgerys Creek airport would create 60,000 jobs—60,000 jobs is a lot, and the announcement was clearly made to impress people. It was over an unspecified time frame. When you see that, it makes you wonder. The alleged job creation figures have been used by several lobby groups to justify their support for an airport at Badgerys Creek. No sources were presented for the Prime Minister's 60,000 jobs figure claim. It has been argued that to achieve such a high figure the airport would have to have passenger movements rivalling Heathrow Airport in London or Los Angeles airport—a feat unlikely to be repeated at a supplementary airport at Badgerys Creek. 


The only recent estimation of jobs created by the construction and operation of a Badgerys Creek airport was conducted by the New South Wales Business Chamber, a lobby group for the business sector who obviously stand to gain enormously by the creation of another private—yet, publicly subsidised—airport and the associated publicly subsidised infrastructure to service the airport. Their report estimated that 30,000 jobs be created by 2050—at least they gave us a time frame. Now that figure is already half of the figure touted by the Prime Minister and reported in the media, time and time again. However, this figure also relies on the assumption—


Debate interrupted.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2015-06-24,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  I rise today to pay tribute to the work of the Australian Department of Defence and the Australian defence industry in the largest maritime search in aviation history. All Australians know that on 8 March 2014, a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft disappeared during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew on board, including six Australians. No evidence of a crash site has been found but it is now presumed that flight MH370 ended its journey in the southern Indian Ocean, where the search continues today. Australia has provided substantial resources for that search, as we should. An initial search for the aircraft focused on part of the South China Sea, where the plane had disappeared from air traffic control radar screens as it headed towards the Vietnamese southern coast. However, a week later, fresh analysis indicated that MH370 had for some unknown reason diverted from its intended course and probably tracked south to an area some 2,000 kilometres west of Perth in the southern Indian Ocean. On 17 March, the Australian government assumed responsibility for search operations, partnering closely with China and Malaysia. The subsequent search covered some 4.6 million square kilometres and called upon the expertise of some of the finest minds in this field of endeavour from across the world. Ships and aircraft from Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States have been involved in this search. It is the largest and costliest search in aviation history.


While the whereabouts of the doomed aircraft remains a mystery to this very day, it is worth reflecting on the efforts of Australia's defence forces, government agencies and industry in rapidly deploying such a massive search operation. It is testament to what can be achieved when Defence and Australian defence industry cooperate in a crisis. It also underlines the importance of maintaining and enhancing our own defence industry capability. I would like to firstly commend the Department of Defence for playing a key role in supporting the Australian Maritime Safety Authority as the lead search and rescue agency. The Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Base West on Garden Island, south of Perth, and RAAF Base Pearce, north of Perth, worked quickly to prepare the facilities to support a search force that would consist of multinational assets which would not just consist of units from our closest allies. The Royal Australian Navy's replenishment ship HMAS Success was the first Australian vessel to search for MH370, deploying on 19 March from Fleet Base West. In the following weeks it was joined by the Anzac class frigates HMAS Perth and HMAS Toowoomba. RAAF Base Pearce and Perth International Airport became the hubs for air search efforts involving more than 22 military aircraft and civilian jets from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. In the 42 days of searching at that time, some 345 air sorties were conducted into some of the most remote maritime regions on our planet. The entire search operation was led by Chief Coordinator of the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, Air Chief Marshal, Sir Angus Houston. In just one day's work, Air Chief Marshal Houston would coordinate up to 10 military aircraft, four civilian aircraft and 13 ships into the search area. The Joint Agency Coordination Centre also liaised closely with Boeing, the United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, and Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation. This was an extraordinary effort, logistically and diplomatically.


I have mentioned the work of various parts of Defence and of government agencies. But I think it is important to spend some time talking about the critical work of our local defence industry players in the search for MH370; work which has been largely unrecognised and, as I have become aware, unfortunately in some cases inaccurately reported. It demonstrates in stark relief the importance of fostering local defence industry expertise and capability in Australia. The major priority in the first few days of the search was locating the aircraft's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, or black boxes, as they are well known. The black boxes are fitted with an acoustic pinger that transmits a pulse at over 160 decibels at 37.5 kilohertz for at least 30 days. However, the water depth in the search area ranged between 4,000 and 5,000 metres, making detection of this pinger—even at 160 decibels—extremely difficult. Locate the pinger and you locate the aircraft.


The RAAF contacted Sonartech Atlas, a Sydney-based systems engineering company specialising in the design and development of sonar systems for naval and civilian applications. Sonartech had worked on the design, manufacture and support of submarine sonars for the Royal Australian Navy, the United States Navy and a number of NATO navies. Sonartech has also developed an acoustic processor that could be used to detect and analyse acoustic signals picked up by sonobuoys. Defence knew that Sonartech Atlas's acoustics systems could locate submarines from an aircraft—but could it locate the ping from a black box some five kilometres under the water? This was the burning question. It is important to note that the frequency and nature of the pinger is quite different from the acoustic signatures that are usually searched for with sonobuoys. Sonartech's team investigated the situation and determined that a combination of its equipment and a particular sonobuoy could be used to detect the black box pinger. Within three days of being contacted by the RAAF, Sonartech Atlas had assembled a system in Sydney, tested it in its lab, and shipped it to RAAF Edinburgh in Adelaide where it was assessed by the engineering personnel of 92 Wing and the Maritime Patrol Systems Program Office, and then installed into an Australian maritime patrol aircraft, shortly after which that aircraft deployed to Western Australia to participate in the search. Within two weeks, a further four systems were assembled by Sonartech and sent to Western Australia for installation aboard Australia's other maritime patrol aircraft in search of MH370. Sonartech also provided two acoustic analysts to fly aboard our RAAF aircraft to assist with the collection and initial review and analysis of acoustic data. These on-scene reviews were supported by in-depth analysis conducted by DSTO staff, members of the Australian Joint Acoustic Analysis Centre at HMAS Albatross in Nowra, New South Wales, and Sonartech personnel in their Sydney office. This essentially tripartite approach with Defence, science and local industry, highly specialised as it is, working together in short time, is just one example of how Australian high-tech industry can and does effectively work with government.


The RAAF had the only air assets involved in the search for MH370 that were capable of conducting an airborne acoustic search—a situation that attracted the interest of the other aircrews involved in looking for this missing aircraft. The Australian maritime patrol aircraft's acoustic search covered an area in the order of 3,500 square nautical miles.


It is also worth mentioning that some of the specialist software used for the analysis had been progressed by Sonartech through the Capability and Technology Demonstrator Program administered by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. This demonstrates the relevance and value of the CTD Program to enhancing Australian Defence capability.


The loss of MH370 is a tragic and unfortunate event, the response to which is a clear demonstration of Australian ingenuity and an example of how Defence and Australian industry can work together given the right environment. This is also true in the case of other government and Defence agencies that were involved, with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, which I mentioned earlier, analysing acoustic data, predicting drift and re-evaluating Inmarsat signals used to determine the likely flight path of the doomed aircraft. The DMO's Maritime Signature Management and Target Services Systems Program Office provided equipment and resources to support the pinger detection trials. The Maritime Patrol Systems Program Office, responsible for the maintenance, upgrade and configuration control of the Australian maritime patrol aircraft, rapidly assessed and approved the temporary configuration change.


The search for flight MH370 has highlighted the need for the continued investment in and support for local capabilities, not just within government agencies and Defence but also in our local private industry. Australia must seek to advance its technological capacity and capabilities, preparing the nation for the future and future crises. It is a future in which our industry can take its rightful place, not just as a repairer, assembler or integrator of foreign technology, but that of a designer, developer and supplier of services and technology to receptive local customers and to overseas markets. We must recognise the skills that we do have and build on them. This may take some time, but it is important that we ensure our industry is viable and sustainable, and one that we can turn to for help in dealing with the challenges we must face, not just those in our long-term future but also those in the short term, particularly those crises which are impossible to predict.


This government recognises the importance of Australian defence industry and is committed to the further development of its capacity and capabilities. We are, however, a prudent government which recognises that this cannot be at any cost. We have an obligation to get the taxpayer value for money, and, where Australian industry can effectively and efficiently deliver it, it must be used. This commitment to local capacity of course is very relevant to our Future Submarine program, a program which will draw upon industry capacity and result in the creation of hundreds of new Australian jobs.

That dramatic change in the policy of the Australian government occurred in September 2013, when the Australian government changed and a government was elected that was committed to restoring the Australian shipbuilding industry—because, Senator Carr, as you should know, during the six years of the Labor government, for most of which you were the minister for industry in this country, not one single warship was commenced at any Australian shipyard.

Newcastle Trades Hall Council secretary Daniel Wallace said unions and shipbuilding firms had been warning about the ""Valley of Death"" since Labor was in power.


So the 'valley of death', Senator Carr—this phrase that has been around the Australian shipbuilding industry for some time, by the way—is a phrase that comes from the trade union movement complaining about the 'valley of death' into which you sent the Australian shipbuilding industry during the Rudd, Gillard and Rudd governments, when you served as minister for industry.

I seek leave to make a short statement to provide further information to the Senate.


Leave granted.




Senator PAYNE:
  A project company requesting a project agreement under an Investment Facilitation Arrangement will need to identify the current and projected skills shortage in the business, and why these vacancies cannot be filled by Australian workers. The company will need to demonstrate that skilled workers are needed for a project, including how many, at what stage, and for which occupations. In order to sponsor workers, approved sponsors requesting an labour agreement under an IFA will need to provide information as required by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, which may include requirements for labour market testing or evidence of their domestic recruitment efforts. ChAFTA will not remove the need for employer sponsorship or for compliance with all other 457 visa requirements.


In all of our existing FTAs, now including ChAFTA, Australia has exempted the following individuals applying for temporary entry work visas from labour market testing: business executives as intercorporate transferees, senior managers as intercorporate transferees; independent executives; and certain skilled workers who are defined as either specialists or contractual service suppliers. Applications for temporary entry by these categories are managed under the sponsor-driven 457 visa arrangements. Under ChAFTA, Australia has also excluded the category 'installers and servicers' from labour-market testing. These workers already have access under Australia's 400 visa subclass, and ChAFTA makes no practical difference to this arrangement. It is also important to note that our ChAFTA commitments are reciprocal; China has also given access for Australian workers in these five categories.

  In relation to the senator's question concerning some statements that the Prime Minister made in October last year and the question of a potential inconsistency, I can advise there is no inconsistency relating to the Prime Minister's statements when he said, in relation to the government's industry, innovation and competitiveness agenda that, 'labour market testing will remain'. The Prime Minister also said at the same press conference that the government wanted the 457 scheme to be easier to engage in, to attract more skills to Australia's economy while not undermining anyone's pay and conditions. While ChAFTA, like our other existing FTAs, achieves this goal by making it easier for companies to move their staff—in a limited number of exempted categories—between China and Australia, it has not otherwise removed the need for labour testing. Rather than reducing opportunities for Australian workers, ChAFTA enhances their prospects for new jobs in Australia. Together with the high-quality FTAs with Japan and South Korea negotiated by the government, ChAFTA will create jobs for Australians, not constrain them. As I stated earlier this week, and again on 22 June, independent modelling commissioned by the government forecasts the three North Asia FTAs to create almost 8,000 jobs in 2016, peaking at almost 15,000 jobs in 2020, as increased exports and cheaper imports allow Australian businesses to hire more workers.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Attorney‑General (Senator Brandis) to a question without notice asked by Senator Carr today relating to jobs in the ship building industry.


Could I pose a simple question: has this government actually come to terms with its responsibilities as a government? Because every possible explanation we get from this government—and it is demonstrated in the answer we heard today—is that they are still acting as an opposition. They do not take responsibilities as a government. After two years in power, the Abbott government has failed to ensure that there is any meaningful work for Australia's shipbuilding industry and its workers. Yet they still act as if they were in opposition by suggesting that this is a problem that, of course, is the responsibility of the opposition! We know the reality is somewhat different.


In 2013, the previous Labor government, in its bid to maintain the shipbuilding capacity of this nation, create the jobs and maximise the value for our Defence acquisitions, proposed a series of measures to actually bring forward work for shipbuilding in this country.




Senator Back:
  You just didn't tell anyone!




Senator KIM CARR:
  Yes, we did. And, after the election, it was the Abbott government that abandoned that plan, and the result has been a decimation of the Australian shipbuilding industry under this government's watch. Overnight we have learned that another 160 jobs will be lost. These are highly skilled jobs. That is 160 jobs lost for skilled construction workers at Forgacs in Tomago. That is on top of the 450 jobs that have already been lost at Forgacs under the Abbott government, and the reports have indicated that the remaining 290 positions at Forgacs are earmarked to go by Christmas unless this government actually gets into gear and does something—takes up its responsibilities—to ensure that we have sufficient work in our shipyards.


With no work, there is no certainty. The impact of that will see the incompetence of this government demonstrated by seeing large numbers of Australian workers thrown on the scrap heap. These are highly skilled men and women. They are irreplaceable. And if it is the case in the future that we do need to rebuild the capacity in Australian shipbuilding, it will be incredibly difficult and incredibly expensive to try to replace them. The jobs of 610 workers have been lost at Forgacs in Newcastle. There have been 120 lost at ASC in Adelaide. Hundreds were lost at Williamstown. And there are hundreds more to go.


The government, in two years in power, has failed to fulfil its responsibilities and failed to live up to expectations of what it said before the election but, above all, failed to acknowledge that it has a responsibility to act. This is a government that has seen thousands more ship workers' jobs at risk because of the failure of this government to acknowledge those responsibilities. What this government needs to do is to sit down with the shipbuilding companies and with the unions and be able to work through a realistic plan to bring work forward to make sure that these yards stay open, because closing these yards will have a profound long-term consequence for the industrial capacity of this country.


Under Labor's 2013 plan, we proposed that, at a minimum, one of the two supply ships for the Navy be constructed in 2015-16 and that it be, as a minimum, a hybrid build—built part overseas and part in Australia—but that the other be built in Australia, and that we would also bring forward the Armidale Class Patrol Boat replacement with local construction. And only Labor has committed to building and maintaining 12 future submarines in Australia. That is unlike the dodgy deal that this government has already done with the Japanese, where we are in the business of building a shipyard in Japan while closing shipyards in Australia. Let us see how this government explains that at the forthcoming electoral contest. Let us see how they explain why it is they are proceeding to export Australian jobs and skills and destroy our defence capabilities—as we know from the former audit commissioner Tony Shepherd, who made it clear. Surely we have learnt something from experiences in war in this country. And we have seen from the former defence minister's claim that we could not build a canoe in this country how wrong that attitude is. We should, according to Mr Shepherd, have confidence in Australian shipbuilding. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-06-24,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:11):  Senator Carr is just a gift that keeps on giving! It is just absolutely fantastic! Hypocrisy has been writ large here this afternoon.


It has been said that Labor did not commission the construction of any naval vessels during their time in government. Well, that is not quite right. They did in fact commission the construction of 12 landing craft. But do you know where the 12 landing craft contract went to? Navantia, in Spain. Not a little island off the coast of Melbourne, but Spain—that is where Labor's only contribution went.


We heard from Senator Carr this afternoon that, regrettably, there have been staff put off or who will be put off from the Forgags project and also BAE's.




Senator Cameron:
  Forgacs!




Senator BACK:
  Thank you, Senator Cameron; I will defer to you on that. The reason, of course, was that BAE and the other company did not tender—they did not tender on the Pacific Patrol Boat Program.




Senator Kim Carr:
  The tender arrangements were impractical—totally impractical!




Senator BACK:
  But let me give you further and good information, since you obviously do not know it, Senator Carr. It was the coalition government that brought forward the Pacific patrol boat tender. It closed last Wednesday at 2 pm. And what was the Labor Party's only other commitment to the naval industry with regard to fleet size while they were in government? It was the purchase from the United Kingdom of what became the HMAS Choules, on which I had the pleasure of being, in Fremantle harbour, when it was named and commissioned.


As to the decisions by these companies to reduce their workforce, were they anything to do with the coalition government? Not on your nelly! It was, in fact, as Attorney-General Brandis told us, the trades hall secretary Mr Daniel Wallace who said that the unions and shipbuilding firms had been warning the Labor government since they were in power in 2010-11, and it was Defence—if only the then minister had bothered to listen—under the Labor government that had advised the government, back in 2011 or earlier, that they must commence construction of new naval ships or indeed they would lose the contract.


This afternoon I heard Senator McEwen in her senator's statement talking at some length about the pride with which everyone was associated the other day when the Hobart was launched. Well, as Senator Gallacher and Senator Carr and Senator Conroy would know, and as I am sure Senator Cameron should know, that project, the Air Warfare Destroyer project, was commissioned under the Howard government by the then defence minister, the proud South Australian, Robert Hill. Robert Hill signed the contracts and funded the project, and he has seen the benefit of the first of those vessels having been launched the other day.


Senator McEwen was talking about the apprehension of everybody around what the future might be. I wonder whether Senator McEwen might have gone and explained to those people why there needed to be any apprehension at all. The simple reason was that Labor went to sleep at the wheel during its time in government. Not only did they not commission one warship to be constructed in this country, but they took billions of dollars out of the Defence budget when Mr Stephen Smith was the Defence minister. We see a circumstance this afternoon where, regrettably, the Labor Party—amnesia writ large—did nothing when they were in government. Now the coalition is getting on with the job, only to be vilified by the very people who know deep down—and this includes the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, a South Australian—that they did nothing.


To answer Senator Carr's question: what has the coalition done? We are there supporting the naval shipbuilding industry. In June of last year, 12 months ago now, we brought forward the $78 million for the design work to retain the option of the future frigates. In December 2014, we announced that we were working with industry to fix the AWD program, a program that needed fixing because Labor did nothing during their time in government. That will create the industry around the fleet of future frigates. They need not go to Spain. They can be built here because of the excellence of this government. In February, the Defence minister announced the competitive evaluation process for the construction of our Future Submarine program. We stand proud. (Time expired)

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:16):  Senator Back said that there was a gift that kept giving. That is Senator Back. To suddenly become an expert on shipbuilding when he cannot even understand or say the name of the shipyard where workers are losing their jobs is an absolute joke.



Government senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator CAMERON:
  They have sent in here the Western Australian senator who would not even know where Newcastle is and would not care about the jobs in Newcastle.



Senator Back interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Back, leave the chamber.




Senator CAMERON:
  They do not care about high-skilled jobs in this country. They never have and they never will. Look at the pomposity and arrogance from this government. They are not concerned about what happens to high-skilled jobs in this country. Four thousand high-skilled jobs in the shipbuilding industry will go down the tube because of the incompetence and uncaring view of this government.


It is not only skilled jobs in the shipbuilding industry. Look at Toyota and Holden. They chased them out of this country. They told them to pack up and go away. The University of Adelaide has estimated that closing the motor vehicle industry will mean 200,000 job losses in this country. It will mean the loss of 98,500 jobs in Victoria and 24,000 jobs in South Australia alone. Forgacs, that shipbuilding company in Newcastle, will now be reduced to zero jobs by Christmas this year.


You have to look at what this government is all about. They want to send the jobs overseas. The submarines will be sent to Japan. We all know that a deal has been done to send the jobs to Japan. We all know that the senators from South Australia in here were absolutely mute about that issue for weeks. They did not have the backbone to stand up for jobs in their own backyard. From what I hear, the coalition members in the Newcastle and Hunter region are equally as mute, equally as jelly backed and equally as weak kneed as those MPs and senators down in South Australia.


What has this government got against high-skilled jobs that allow Australian workers and Australian tradespeople to access the middle class of this country? Why are they determined to hollow out the middle class of this country? Why are they determined to send jobs to China? Why are they determined to send jobs to Japan? Why are they determined to send jobs to Korea, when we should be building the ships and building a manufacturing base in this country?


This coalition are not to be trusted. They said they would build 12 submarines in South Australia and they have reneged on that deal. They are sending those submarines to Japan; we know that full well. They have misrepresented their position. They have lied to the Australian public. They should be held to account for that.


At the moment, we are seeing this hollowing out of manufacturing jobs. They come here and they say, 'We've got these great trade agreements.' We heard the spin being put on the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement by the acting minister here just after question time. But that free trade agreement means that there will be a movement of skilled workers from China to Australia at a time when shipyard workers and vehicle workers are losing their jobs. This is economic madness.


This is a mob who wrap themselves in the Australian flag every chance they get. But when it comes to doing something about maintaining jobs so that we have got the independence to build our Defence acquisitions in this country, they run away from it. They do not wrap themselves in the flag. They send the jobs to Japan. They send the jobs to China. They do not stand up for this country. They are an absolute disgrace. They are untrustworthy and they should be thrown out at the earliest chance we can get to do it. (Time expired)

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2015-06-24,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:21):  It is always a pleasure to be in the chamber when Senator Cameron makes a contribution. He often reminds me of those big storms out west. They start with a lot of promise and a big build-up of dark clouds and they end up just being wind. They have no ideas, no reflection on why the shipbuilding industry finds itself in this position—nothing, just empty wind. There is a further term, but the standing orders apparently prevent me from finishing the sentence.


Let us open with this question: in the six years Labor was in government, how many naval vessels did you commission? Just run it out—naval vessels. The answer would be none. I have not heard the opposition, in their contributions, making reference to why some of these companies find themselves in this position. If you do not want to listen to our contribution, let us go back to the Newcastle Trades Hall Council secretary, Daniel Wallace—I am assuming that you are in concert with Mr Wallace in relation to his observations. He said that the unions and shipbuilding firms had been warning about the valley of death since Labor was in power. The valley of death they made reference to was the—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, resume your seat. There are too many interjections in the Senate, and they are too loud.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I am finding it hard to function.




Senator Conroy:
  That won't change if we shut up!




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Give it a try. What we have here is a commercial decision by VAE, and they are entitled to do that. I understand a little about commerce, but their decision has to do with six years under the Labor government when there was shipbuilding inaction—that is the term to be used—and, again, going back to Wallace and the valley of death. 


This government is committed to supporting a productive and cost-effective naval shipbuilding industry in this country. We are prepared to invest in the skills and knowledge base of the Australian naval shipbuilding industry. We are prepared to commit to a long-term investment to ensure the industry enjoys a future in Australia—and these things take time. The absolute only explanation Labor could give for their inaction for six years was 'preparation for an industry'. Of course, that was not happening. It takes time for these matters to go through. We will lay out a clear, fully funded plan for a strong and secure Australia in this space. 


Joel Fitzgibbon did nothing for shipbuilding in this country when he was the defence minister and he certainly did nothing to send more work down the pipeline for Australian shipbuilders, including those in Newcastle. I will mention here, Senator Conroy, so sit quietly: during the six years of Labor, where were you; where was Daniel Andrews; and where was Jay Weatherill? Why didn't they lobby their federal colleagues at the point when, as they were advised by Defence, critical decisions needed to be made? 


Here we are now with a board full of revisionists wanting to visit on why these difficulties exist in the shipbuilding industry and accepting no responsibility whatsoever. We know why nothing was happening in this space: because Labor were too busy dismantling the great economic situation they were left with after the John Howard government. They even acknowledged the need for urgent decisions to be made in the 2009 and 2013 Defence white papers that they published but they did nothing. By making no decisions, Labor willingly put shipbuilding jobs at risk. Such is their disregard for proper processes that, under Labor, the 2012 and 2013 Defence capability plans were never even considered or approved by the National Security Committee.


There will be more contributions here. I imagine Senator Conroy will be next. It will be interesting for him to lay down why all this inaction occurred in the six years under Labor, whilst our economy was being dismantled and put in its weakest position in the history of this place. They should accept personal responsibility for the fact that these jobs are now under threat. Had they been active during their period in the term, we would have had, and would continue to have, a vibrant shipbuilding industry in this nation.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2015-06-24,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:26):  Firstly, I want to put on the record that Labor's first thoughts are with the affected workers and their families who are dealing with this news at an extremely difficult time. That is the difference between this side of the chamber and that side of the chamber. They have been in government since 2013 and the ordinary performances from Senator Brandis, Senator Back and Senator O'Sullivan is simply to reiterate the six years prior to that. 


You have had two years to make decisions. I am sure it is of no comfort to a worker sitting down with his family and his kids to have you throwing across the chamber that two years ago someone else should have done something. The reality is that you have had two years of government. You won government. You had a defence minister and you had him white-anted. You have had your defence department white-anted. You have had the economic rationalists take over, saying, 'We will just not build anything here. Let's go and get a Japanese submarine and put all of those workers in South Australia, all of those workers at Williamstown, Forgacs, under the pump. Push them down.'


We actually care about workers, their families, their jobs and their futures—unlike anybody on that side, from what I have seen in their contributions today. I do not think any of those families are going to get any comfort out of this debate when you simply say, 'Someone should have done something six years ago.' You won government and, in the two years since then, all you have done is dismantle. You have dismantled a whole viable well-trained blue-collar workforce. Go back to Senate estimates where Defence Secretary Richardson said there wasn't a problem in the blue-collar workforce. He said there are no issues there—the issues are in that tier of management. He did not say it was political. He said, 'I don't detect any less inclination to pay a premium for building in Australia'—very careful, diplomatic words—but there is. This is clearly what has happened here. You have got in, you have had a look at it, and you have said, 'We'll let this go the same way as Holden; we'll let this go the same way as manufacturing in this country.' You do not care about workers or their families. You will take no proactive steps in respect of maintaining good, skilled jobs and conditions. And there have been opportunities for you to do something different.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  We are doing things.




Senator GALLACHER:
  What it looks like you are doing, as Senator Carr has said, is transferring the whole future of submarine building to another country. You are avoiding the opportunity to set up in South Australia for a long, long time a decent, well-paid industry. And Forgacs is another example. You figure that you can hide that away in the economy of New South Wales. You think you can just slip out of that space and let those manufacturing jobs go.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Six years!




Senator GALLACHER:
  The response is repeatedly that 'someone should have done something six years ago'. Well, you had an opportunity. Labor had the 2013 Future Submarine Industry Skills Plan and a plan for naval shipbuilding. It was designed to maintain industry capacity, create jobs and maximise the value for Defence acquisitions. It appears as though this government is going completely in the other direction: 'Let's invest overseas, let's take hard-earned taxpayers' dollars and invest in Japanese shipbuilding or submarine capability.' That is totally contrary to the best interests of this country. From a strategic defence point of view and from an economic perspective it is totally contrary to the national interest. And they stand here in this debate and say to workers who are facing redundancy, unemployment and relocation—all of the problems when workers lose their jobs—that it was 'someone else's fault'. They say, 'Don't blame a government that has been in power for two years, blame someone else who six years ago should have made a different decision.' I do not think workers will take any comfort from that. (Time expired)

The speech read as follows—



HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (NEW ZEALAND CITIZENS) BILL


The purpose of the Higher Education Support Amendment (New Zealand Citizens) Bill is to address a long standing inequity in the treatment of long term residents of Australia who – by circumstance of their birth – are New Zealand citizens.


These students are eligible for subsidised places at Australian universities, as Australian students are at New Zealand universities.


But at present New Zealanders, however long they have lived in Australia, are denied financial assistance under the Higher Education Loans Program (HELP).


An oddity of the Minister for Education's two attempts to revise the Higher Education Support Act 2003 has been the inclusion of overdue, non-controversial and comparatively minor reforms among the radical and contentious changes that were the substantial content of that legislation.


In the former category is a legislative remedy for the plight of students who, although they are long-term residents of Australia, are New Zealand citizens.


Currently, only Australian citizens and Australian residents who hold humanitarian visas may apply for the various HELP schemes.


It is an accepted principle that the beneficiaries of HELP should be people who will be able to repay the loan because they will be paying Australian taxes. 


The Minister has indicated that the Government intends to expand the collection of HELP debts to include Australians who have moved overseas, but the fundamental principle stands.


It could hardly be argued, however, that extending HELP eligibility to long-term New Zealand residents of Australia would undermine this principle.


These New Zealanders are, as former Minister David Kemp's adviser Dr Andrew Norton has said, people ""who have been in Australia for much of their lives, went to Australian schools, talk with Australian accents and consider themselves Australians for most purposes"".


(Commentary from Carlton blog, 4 April 2015.)


The exclusion from HELP of people who can be so described is anomalous and unfair, and on that there seems to be broad agreement across the political spectrum.


When Labor was in government we announced legislation to rectify the problem, which would have taken effect on 1 January this year.


The legislation was not introduced, because the election intervened.


But after the present Government took office the Prime Minister and his New Zealand counterpart agreed that the issue must be resolved, and in the 2014 Budget papers the Government stated its intention to do so.


Labor would certainly have supported a Government bill, along the same lines as the bill we had foreshadowed, that opened HELP to New Zealanders in this country. 


When the Government finally acted on the matter, however, the measure was bundled in with its attempt to deregulate university fees and cut funding for Commonwealth supported places.


As all Senators know, there are no circumstances in which Labor would support a bill containing those measures.


We have urged the Government to introduce a separate bill to allow New Zealanders in Australia to apply for HELP assistance, but the Minister has so far refused to do so.


He is effectively holding these students hostage to his desire to deregulate fees.


He wants to remedy one injustice by imposing a much greater one. 


But Labor will not acquiesce in the Minister's stubborn refusal to act in a bipartisan manner on what surely should be a non-controversial matter.


The Higher Education Support Amendment (New Zealand Citizens) Bill 2015 will do what the Government could have, and should have, done by now.


Since the date at which the original legislation would have come into effect has now passed, the measure contained in this Bill will commence on 1 January 2016.


The Bill amends sections 90-5, 104-5, 118-5, and 126-5 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003.


These sections define citizenship or residency requirements for, respectively:


HECS-HELP, the loan scheme for university students in subsidised places;


FEE-HELP, the loan scheme for students in full-fee places;


OS-HELP, the loan scheme for students undertaking studies overseas; and


SA-HELP, the loan scheme that assists students to pay services and amenities fees.


The Bill also amends clause 44 of Schedule 1A to the Act, which sets out citizenship or residency requirements for VET FEE-HELP, the loan scheme for students in higher level vocational education and training courses.


The Bill applies the same residency conditions for each of these loans.


As with the legislation originally proposed by the previous Labor government, this Bill does not provide recently arrived New Zealand citizens with access to HELP.


To be eligible, a student who is a New Zealand citizen must:


hold a special category visa under the Migration Act 1958;


have been a dependent child when he or she first began to be usually resident in Australia;


have first been usually resident in Australia at least 10 years before the date of lodging the request for HELP assistance, or the date of lodging a previous successful request for a unit in the same course of study, whichever is earlier;


have been in Australia for a period of, or for periods totalling, 8 years during the 10 years before the relevant lodgement date; and


have been in Australia for a period of, or for periods totalling, 18 months in the 2 years immediately before the relevant lodgement date.


In other words, the beneficiaries of this change in eligibility requirements for HELP would be long-term residents of Australia by any measure.


They are people who would reasonably be expected to be taxpayers in Australia after graduation.


Reasonable people would not deny the justice of allowing these long-term Australian residents, who have come from a country with which Australia has such a close and historic affinity, to obtain access to HELP assistance.


The Bill does differ in one significant respect from the bill that Labor would have introduced in government.


It amends section 238-12 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, which provides that amounts paid to HELP recipients should come from Consolidated Revenue.


As Senators will be aware, a private senator's bill cannot include an appropriation provision of this kind.


The Bill therefore inserts an additional subsection in section 238-12, which states that ""an amount that is payable by the Commonwealth as a result of the amendments … is to be funded out of money appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of such a payment"".


For this Bill to achieve its aim, the Government must therefore be willing to support such an appropriation.


The Government must cooperate to that extent, and it can have no justification for refusing that cooperation.


What this Bill does, after all, is implement a policy that the Government says is its own.


The Bill circumvents the wholly unnecessary obstacle created by the Minister tying the measure to his plan to deregulate fees and cut funding for undergraduate places.


There is no reason why passage of the measure contained in this Bill should be impeded by the fundamental disagreement between the Government and the majority of Senators on deregulation.


There was never any good reason to include this measure in a deregulation bill, as the Minister has done.


I therefore ask the Minister, and all Government Senators and MPs, to take the fair and reasonable alternative, and treat the plight of New Zealand students at Australian universities separately.


I ask you to support this Bill, which sets in place a policy on which there should be broad agreement in this place.

I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  It is time for a broad-ranging royal commission in this country into white collar crime and misconduct in the financial services sector. Nearly 12 months ago, the Senate inquiry of the Economics Committee made a recommendation for a royal commission into the Commonwealth Bank. Following that, in the last 12 months, thanks to some brave whistleblowers and some dogged reporting from Fairfax journalists, we have seen allegations and revelations of misconduct at Macquarie Bank, ANZ, National Australia Bank and, recently, at IOOF. How many more scandals are lurking under the surface?


Although the Senate has done some good work, and I do commend some of my colleagues in this chamber for their work, the committee made a recommendation for a good reason. That is, a royal commission would have the powers to get to the bottom of this and sort it out once and for all for the good of the financial services sector and for the good of the Australian people. I recommend my fellow senators support this motion.

Senator FIFIELD:
  The government's position has not changed. The financial services industry has never been under closer scrutiny. Over the past 12 months alone we have had five inquiries into the sector. The Financial System Inquiry made recommendations to strengthen regulation of the financial advice sector and increase ASIC powers, as did the Economics Committee inquiry into the performance of ASIC. We are now working on raising professional standards for financial advisers in response to the bipartisan parliamentary joint committee inquiry. There is also a Senate inquiry into the scrutiny of financial advice which is due to report next year. Another Senate inquiry into forestry managed investment schemes is due to report mid year.


The government has delivered on its commitment to introduce a public register of all financial advisers. At the same time, substantial changes to the regulatory regime for financial advisers through FoFA are due to come into full force on 1 July. Also, the financial advice sector is a key focus for ASIC.

The speech read as follows—



AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT BOARDS (GENDER BALANCED REPRESENTATION) BILL 2015


The need for balanced gender representation at board level, across all sectors, has long been widely recognised. Ideally, a company or government board should represent not only its own stakeholders, but the wider community. A balance of views, backgrounds and approaches has been shown to result in better outcomes for boards, and by extension for the entities they manage.


In particular, a significant body of research has shown that boards with more balanced gender representation lead to better financial outcomes for companies, as opposed to those with boards that consist entirely of one gender. For example, a recent study undertaken by Credit Suisse in September 2014 found that companies with more than one woman on the board returned a compound of 3.7 per cent a year since 2005 over those with no women on the board. 


This echoes earlier research by Credit Suisse in 2012, which found that companies with women on the board outperformed those without by 26 per cent. Equally, a paper produced by Professor Robert Wood from the University of Melbourne's Centre for Ethical Leadership summarises over forty pieces of research that support the argument that gender equality on boards leads to better outcomes.


The aim of this Bill is to implement in legislation the existing Government policy in relation to gender balance on Government boards, and as such to emphasise the Government's position as a leader in gender equality. The policy, which was established by the former Gillard Labor Government following the 2010 election, establishes a gender diversity target of 40 per cent men and 40 per cent women on Government boards, with the remaining 20 per cent to be made up of either gender.


The Bill introduces these targets as a positive obligation, rather than an aspirational objective. It also provides for certain exemptions, such as when it may not be reasonably practical to meet the target. The explanatory memorandum expands on the circumstances that would apply in this situation.


The Bill applies the gender balance target to Commonwealth entities under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013; Ministerial advisory committees; review committees where the appointments are made entirely by a Minister or the Cabinet; and Commonwealth statutory authorities. This definition is consistent with the boards that are currently required to report for the purpose of the Gender Balance on Australian Government Boards Report.


Further, the Bill establishes a legislative basis for the reporting requirements that currently exist in relation to the Gender Balance on Australian Government Boards Report. Under the Bill, each Portfolio will be required to supply information on each board within its remit to the Minister, who will then be required to collate this information into an annual report to be tabled in Parliament.


While this Bill focusses on existing policy, it is important to note the need for further measures to support this legislation. The Government should improve support and funding for programs such as Boardlinks to grow the pool of potential applicants, as well as working with organisations such as Women on Boards to raise awareness of this legislative change.


While there appears to be no valid argument as to why this legislation should not be put in place, the research quoted above shows that there are many arguments as to why it should. The business sector has made significant progress in terms of gender-balanced representation over the years, but there is still a leadership role for Government in terms of promoting boards that are more representative of our society as a whole.


The Australian Government has a responsibility to lead the way in terms of gender-balanced representation on boards, in order to drive a much-needed cultural shift. This legislation ensures the current policy, which is supported by both major parties, will remain in place and enforceable into the future.

 (Queensland) (17:23):  It is a pleasure to join with Senator Rachel Siewert and also with Senator Nova Peris to talk on this committee report this afternoon and also, at the very start, to pay considerable tribute to Senator Linda Reynolds, who came into the Senate quite recently. Through working with some people she met in a visit to a young person in a nursing home, she was stimulated and challenged to take up the issues around this particular concern and has been tireless in working with our committee. It is just a shame that she is not in the chamber today, but I feel certain she will be talking on this report at a future time.


In 2005, I was a member of a community affairs committee that looked into the issues around quality and equity in aged care, and at that time there was quite a community push around the issues of young people in nursing homes. In chapter 4 of its report, that committee—which has become known as the Marshall committee in reference to its chair, Senator Gavin Marshall—made a number of recommendations. One which I think is particularly pertinent in this discussion is:


The Committee is strongly of the view that the accommodation of young people in aged care facilities is unacceptable in most instances. The Committee therefore recommends that all jurisdictions work cooperatively to:


assess the suitability of the location of each young person currently living in aged care facilities;


provide alternative accommodation for young people who are currently accommodated in aged care facilities; and


ensure that no further young people are moved into aged care facilities in the future because of the lack of accommodation options.


That report was in 2005. We are now in 2015, and that same recommendation could be moved unchanged into the recommendations from this report. That is a frustrating element of the work we have done.


There are also some very rewarding and positive elements. One was looking back and seeing that, as a result of the work of that committee and other pressures at the time—I never think that our Senate committees alone can change the world immediately; I think they can change the world, but they often need a lot of help from other areas—there was a response from the Council of Australian Governments and our Australian government, and there was a five-year program put in place, Younger People with Disability in Residential Aged Care. That was initiated in February 2006, and it was an important program. The commitment was by COAG, and it looked to making changes and ensuring that governments in every state and territory, and the federal government, had the issue of the inappropriate housing of young people in nursing homes as a priority, and there was significant funding for that five-year period.


One of the issues, though, is always to look at the accountabilities and the reporting process. Now, in 2015, it is difficult to see exactly what the real responses and impact of that process were. We know that there has been an examination, and unfortunately the examination was able to say that, whilst for some people this particular process had a good outcome, for many the need was still there. This is what we saw in our committee.


We also looked at the very important area of the human rights infrastructure within which young people in nursing homes should be considered. We know that we are a signatory to a number of United Nations conventions, and particularly the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. A core component of that human rights commitment is 'the equal right of all persons with disabilities to live in the community, with choices equal to others', and that signatories 'shall take effective and appropriate measures to facilitate full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of this right and their full inclusion and participation in the community'. That, in fact, is the hub of the process that we followed in our committee: to listen to people about whether in fact that right has been enshrined in our community. Unfortunately, it is clear that that is just not true.


As with all of the committees in which we are involved in this place, the most confronting and rewarding aspect is listening to people who have the generosity, courage and resilience to come and talk to the committee about their own experiences. Again, across a number of public meetings that we had, we were challenged and privileged to meet with young people, their families and their supporters—people who have dedicated their lives to ensure that there can be difference in this space. Consistently, whilst we heard some good stories about where there has been some progress, overwhelmingly what people were saying to us was that they did not feel as though they had the opportunity for inclusion in their communities or the right to have a place to call home.


One of the things I remember was the submission that we had from an organisation called JFA Purple Orange—a great name and a great submission. I do not know whether you would call it 'Purple', but I will. 'Purple' said in its submission to us:


Home is more than shelter; it is a place of identity and expression, sanctuary and safety, a place that fosters strength, wellbeing and revival. Home is intimately and inextricably connected to the person. People with disability need to have choice in the place and with whom they live rather than simply accepting an accommodation offer or not. Current accommodation offers rarely relate to social networks, location of family, recognition of culture, personal desires or ambition.


You take what you are given because you do not know whether you will ever get a chance for anything else again. We heard from a number people about their fears, and we saw their anger about their voices not being heard. They were not given a choice of a place to call home. What is there through the limited access that people have to appropriate housing for disability across this country indicates that there is no choice. There is desperation, there is need and there is an acceptance in some places that that is the best you can do. Our committee does not accept that limitation. We cannot, because we have a responsibility to the people who came to talk to us to join with their calls to say they must have choice and they must have safety.


Senator Siewert talked briefly about the importance of rehabilitation. The clearest memory I have of this particular committee was meeting with families of people with significant disabilities and hearing from them about the way they have dedicated their lives to ensuring their family members will have support We have heard that aged care is not the appropriate place to provide support for a young person—often it is the only choice, but it is not appropriate—and we heard the anger about the fact that, once a young person is confined to aged care accommodation, their needs and the desperate need they have for rehabilitation to help them becomes stronger. They want to become the best and most independent person they can possibly be, but that rehabilitation service is not available in aged care accommodation. I suggest that anyone who is interested look at the Hansard coverage of a number of our hearings, particularly one that we did in Melbourne, when we heard about the way people's lives have been completely impacted and the dedication of those around them.


We have made a number of recommendations but the core of our recommendations must be providing appropriate accommodation for young people with disabilities—and by this we mean people under 65, not just under 50 and not just under 30. We can celebrate that there have been changes, particularly in the younger cohorts. For people under 65, aged care is not the best option. This should be a priority for governments at all levels, to ensure that there is change and response. 


We wait, impatiently, for the NDIS paper on housing. I believe it has been leaked and that a paper is available and it has gone out to states—it just has not come to us. We did not request this particular document—we begged for it. We have been doing that for months. As yet the housing paper around NDIS has not become public. We believe that we have to see within this paper a real commitment to ensuring that those recommendations from 2005 will not be shelved in 2015. That will ensure that young people will not be only able to be placed in aged care accommodation when they have a disability. The people who are already in that place should be supported and we should be looking at ensuring that no more young people are provided only with that option. I also want to say thank you to all the people who helped us. (Time expired)

Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (17:34):  The young people in aged care report is a timely contribution to the important issue for young people with a disability who currently live in or are at risk of entering a residential aged care facility. I am very grateful to have been a member of the Community Affairs References Committee for this inquiry. I am sure all Australians understand that any one of us could become disabled at any time and be in need of care. So it is something that matters to all of us, but it also matters because a good society, and a great country, makes sure that people who are vulnerable are properly cared for—and that is what is at the heart of the mission of all carers.


As Senator Moore did, I thank my colleagues in the committee—Senator Siewert, the Chair, and Senator Moore and Senator Reynolds. Senator Reynolds is not here today but she was very passionate about this inquiry. I acknowledge the generosity and passion of everyone we spoke with—thank you to all the witnesses. In particular I would like to thank the witnesses from the Northern Territory: Carpentaria Disability Services, HPA, Somerville Community Services, Darwin Community Legal Service, the Aged and Disability Advocacy Service, the Multiple Sclerosis Society, Step Out Community Access Service, the Anyinginyi Health Aboriginal Corporation and the Department for Communities and Social Inclusion


I also acknowledge the previous inquiries held into this important issue. I have visited aged care facilities in the Northern Territory and I have seen the professionalism of those who work with disabled people in our community—whether that be in aged care facilities or in the home—and I have nothing but the utmost respect for carers. These wonderful dedicated carers strive to make our society better by assisting those members of our community that are in need of care and support.


In the Northern Territory and throughout Australia during our hearings we were able to provide affected people, their families, their carers, service providers and state and federal government agencies the opportunity to talk about current policies and the inadequate systems that have led to young people being placed in this situation. We listened and heard clearly what those living this experience had to say, and I think it was vital that we do that, particularly at this time of transition with the rollout of the NDIS. Senator Moore has recently touched on what the NDIS means. We looked at the relationships between this community of people with complex needs and the agencies, organisations and other stakeholders.


We also heard about the lived reality of people with complex needs and we sought to make some sound recommendations in our report of what could be done—not yesterday, but now and into the future. As I said previously, this inquiry set out to answer some important questions around the inadequacy of the existing services, the numbers and distribution of young people in the aged care system, those outside of any system, and those that are not currently receiving any care.


Accessing this data was not easy, and this needs to improve. We heard that repeatedly throughout this inquiry. Governments need that data to plan the disability and support services well into the future. We also looked at the trends and the health and support pathways that are available and the things that are not available. The serious and pressing question that has loomed for some time is whether the aged care system is appropriate for young people with a serious disability. I echo what Senator Moore said: the evidence was clear and the situation is not acceptable. Our recommendations take into account the evidence which clearly demonstrates that residential aged care is inappropriate for young people—especially for people under 65 years of age—and that there is an undersupply of Specialised Disability Accommodation. As mentioned, we note that the inquiry took place during the transition to the NDIS and that 'person-centred care' is vital and is the way of Australia's future. But it would be remiss of us not to point out the concerns we have—concerns regarding the arrangements for significant capital to be used to build the facilities that are required to address the dire shortages of appropriate facilities and services.


The major guiding principle is that young people with disabilities need to be in appropriate accommodation where they can access the care and services that they need. This is what we base our recommendations on. I commend the report to the Senate.

 (Queensland) (17:23):  It is a pleasure to join with Senator Rachel Siewert and also with Senator Nova Peris to talk on this committee report this afternoon and also, at the very start, to pay considerable tribute to Senator Linda Reynolds, who came into the Senate quite recently. Through working with some people she met in a visit to a young person in a nursing home, she was stimulated and challenged to take up the issues around this particular concern and has been tireless in working with our committee.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (17:49):  I would like to acknowledge the Deputy President's sterling chairmanship of the Procedure Committee—




Senator Conroy:
  I think that's illegal in some states!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  It does not happen very often! Keep going.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I think it is worth pausing for a moment to reflect on the fact that the Procedure Committee is one of the places where the Senate really manifests its best self—where colleagues come together, seek to determine what are the best, fairest and most efficacious procedures for this place. 


This particular Procedure Committee report is of some significance because there are a number of temporary orders which are becoming part of the standing orders. I know that is something that is of particular interest to Senator Wong, who I think has shared the frustration of many of us for some time of having to leaf through standing orders and various addendums in the form of temporary orders. The clerks will now have the opportunity to bring forward a new and consolidated set of standing orders, which I am sure we all look forward to. 


Many colleagues will be very excited to know that the temporary orders relating to adjournment arrangements which saw open-ended adjournment on Thursday nights will not be continued and that we will in fact, in that area, revert to what the standing orders currently are. I know that many colleagues have been exercised about that.


While I am on my feet, I might talk a little more broadly about the Senate and procedure. What prompts me to do this is that earlier in the week I was speaking at the CEDA State of the Nation conference. I was on a panel with Mr Palmer from the other place, Senator Xenophon and Senator Wong. We each had the opportunity to address CEDA's proposition, which was 'That the Senate is a battlefield'. I did note in my contribution at the CEDA conference that it had sort of echoes of Pat Benatar's Love is a Battlefield!There were enough people in the audience who were of an age to appreciate the cultural allusion that I was making. 


The other propositions of CEDA were that, in effect, it is the end of reform as we know it, and that it is not possible for the government to achieve significant reform in this place. I contested those particular propositions by CEDA and pointed out that the Australian Senate is probably the most misunderstood of Australia's 15 legislative chambers. I also pointed out that I do not think that the Australian Senate has ever had a rap quite as bad that of the New South Wales Legislative Council, which, up until the mid-1980s had 12-year terms, no constituents and no electorate offices. Indeed, up until the mid-1980s, when then Premier Wran introduced some constitutional changes, members were not even elected; the Legislative Council was appointed by the Legislative Assembly on the basis of the proportion of the vote that particular parties received at the preceding general election. Also, it only took members one term to be entitled to the pension. Anyway, I do not think that we have ever had a reputation as bad as the one the New South Wales Legislative Council used to have.


I think that another significant misapprehension is that the Senate was, in some way, modelled on the House of Lords. Of course, all of us here know that that is not the case, and that the Australian Senate was very closely modelled on the US House of Representatives. As we know, there are equal numbers of senators from the states, and it was designed to be a strong upper house. Indeed, it was designed to be equal in powers to the House of Representatives in all respects other than in money bills. So I think that that is a misapprehension; we have a different role and function compared to that which is in the United Kingdom, where, obviously, the House of Lords has the capacity to delay but not to deny. 


We have a good and important role in terms of scrutiny. We have our 16 purpose-built Senate committees; we have the eight legislation committees and the eight references committees. So I think that our role is not well appreciated in terms of our responsibilities. The truth is, as I think we know, that federations are hard. We have 15 legislative chambers and nine jurisdictions, compared to New Zealand, which has one legislative chamber and one jurisdiction. But the federated nature is the price that we pay for unity in the first place. We do have a very different history which sees us in this place as a place of significant review. 


I also pointed out to CEDA that that we have, in fact, had a fairly productive time in this Senate. I pointed out that, as of a week or so ago, since the election we have in this Senate passed 234 bills, not including the ones of this week, and 161 packages of legislation. We had 15 bills negatived in old Senate and 18 bills negatived in the new Senate, but many of those were subsequently passed into law. I thought that this might be a good opportunity to indicate that I gave a very spirited defence of the Senate at the CEDA conference. I indicated that we have had a good degree of success in this place, as a government. 


I did not want to let the opportunity pass, as I commenced my remarks, of paying tribute to Deputy President Marshall for his chairmanship of the Procedure Committee and, of course, for his role as chair of committees in this place. Anyway, I thought that some of the discussions which took place in relation to the Senate in another part of this building earlier in the week might be of interest to the Senate.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:58):  When debate was interrupted earlier today, I was talking about the Airports Amendment Bill 2015, which we have before us now. I was talking about the big promises on jobs associated with Badgerys Creek airport. I relayed how the Prime Minister promised that that airport will deliver 60,000 jobs. There is no time frame for that, but the promise is out there and it has been repeated many times. Then we have the New South Wales Business Chamber promising 30,000 jobs by 2050. That 30,000 figure is already half of the figure touted by the Prime Minister and reported in the media; however, it relies on the assumption that passenger movements are significantly higher than even the most generous predictions. A more realistic scenario, which was also developed by the New South Wales Business Chamber but this time relying on passenger movements estimated by the federal government's joint study into aviation capacity, puts the job creation figures at 10,000 by 2040. It is quite clear that the Prime Minister and the business lobby have inflated job creation figures to boost support for Badgerys Creek. Without a time line, without a business case and without a contract, any job creation figures touted by the government must be taken with a large grain of salt. This is clearly very important because the jobs issue is something that is very critical to the people of Western Sydney—and we start to see how considerably they have been misled, sadly, by both the Liberal and National parties and the Labor Party.


The issue of a curfew is also highly relevant to the business case behind Badgerys Creek. It has been stated many times that Badgerys Creek will only be viable when there are 24/7 operations, but this would expose residents in Western Sydney to aircraft noise that Sydneysiders living close to Sydney Airport at the Kingsford Smith site are protected from. The infrastructure minister ruled out a curfew just last month, further evidence that the community is ignored in order to protect the interests of the private corporations lining up to make a nice profit out of the construction of a publicly subsidised supplementary airport. How can the Liberal-National government argue that the residents of Western Sydney should be subjected to a 24/7 airport when residents in the inner west and the inner city benefit from a curfew at Kingsford Smith airport? While it is true that much of the land around Badgerys Creek is yet to be developed, that certainly will not be the case in 2025, when the airport is allegedly going to be first operational, or in 2035, when it has been operating for a decade. It makes more sense to create policy around what Badgerys Creek will look like in 20 years, not what it looks like now.


It has also been said that Badgerys Creek will reduce aircraft noise associated with Kingsford Smith airport. It is far more likely that the creation of a supplementary airport at Badgerys Creek will increase aircraft noise at Kingsford Smith. Badgerys Creek is expected to be a smaller airport with less hangar space and a smaller runway, similar to Avalon Airport in Melbourne. Like at Avalon, this means that Badgerys Creek will soak up demand for smaller regional flights, leaving more arrival and departure slots open at Mascot for large international jets. This means more aircraft noise, not less. More noise pollution for the locals is certainly not what we want.


Despite the fact that the leadership of the Labor Party and the coalition are on a unity ticket when it comes to Badgerys Creek, local Labor and Liberal MPs around the proposed airport site have raised significant concerns. Last year, Chifley Labor MP Ed Husic said:


I have maintained an unwavering position against an airport at Badgerys Creek for 15 years.


He is certainly spot on. He further said:


I remain firmly of the view this airport will adversely affect the quality of life of the people of western Sydney and I won't be changing my position until I—and more importantly my constituents—are totally convinced it is in their best interests.


Another quote:


There must be detailed discussion and consultation with the community on any proposal for an airport the equivalent size of Brisbane's and to date this has not happened.


I agree with much of what the member for Chifley has said and it is disappointing that the leadership of his party has run roughshod over his concerns to back the Abbott government's proposal fully. As recently as last month, the member for Chifley was, rightly, attacking the Abbott government for not taking its proposal for an airport at Badgerys Creek to an election and for failing to implement a curfew. Again, these are absolutely valid points and it is a shame they have been ignored by the Labor Party leadership and the shadow infrastructure minister, Anthony Albanese.


The shadow Treasurer and member for McMahon, Chris Bowen, is also opposed to the operation of an airport at Badgerys Creek without a curfew, again putting him at odds with Mr Albanese. The Labor members for Parramatta, Greenway and Werriwa are also on the record opposing a 24/7 airport at Badgerys Creek. The member for Blaxland, Jason Clare, has stated publicly that any new airport at Badgerys Creek should be serviced with a rail link, not just road links. The government has already ruled out a rail link when Badgerys Creek becomes operational. It is simply extraordinary that the concerns of all these local Labor MPs have been ignored by Mr Albanese in his eagerness to support the Prime Minister's proposal for a 24/7 operation at Badgerys Creek. It is not just local Labor MPs who have spoken out against this proposal; many Liberal MPs have done so also. The member for Lindsay, Fiona Scott, has strongly opposed the operation of a 24/7 airport at Badgerys Creek.


While the Abbott government is currently pursuing the construction of an airport at Badgerys Creek, the Greens believe that, at an absolute minimum, an environmental impact assessment should be undertaken as soon as possible so the community is fully aware of its impacts. I will be moving a Greens amendment to the bill to clarify that, if Badgerys Creek airport is not constructed, a completed environmental impact statement for this location cannot be used as a substitute for an environmental impact statement for any other future airport location. The Greens do not oppose this bill, but we do believe it is really important that this amendment is adopted.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-06-24,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:05):  The Airports Amendment Bill 2015 makes arrangements for a second airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek in Western Sydney. Clearly, Sydney does need a second airport—Kingsford Smith airport at Mascot is at capacity—but I wonder whether the need for it and the urgency would be as great if we had some high-speed rail links in this country, particularly between Sydney and Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, and Sydney and Brisbane.


Sydney Airport Corporation has the right of first refusal to develop and manage the new airport. This option was part of the original privatisation deal that saw the airport sold for $5.6 billion by the Howard government in 2002. The privatisation of Sydney Airport, creating a monopoly out of our largest and oldest airport, has been a disaster for Sydney and the nation. Now we are considering a bill that makes arrangements to possibly extend that monopoly to the new airport, cementing high costs of services for the travelling public for decades to come. Many formally state owned enterprises have been privatised since the 1980s and sometimes not with a good result for the public—from the Commonwealth Bank to Telstra to electricity grids; and, in my home state of South Australia, the state government is crazily trying to privatise the Motor Accident Commission—but the privatisation of Sydney Airport has to take the cake as the craziest of all. It was not inevitable. The federal government did not have to privatise the airport and it did not have to include a first right of refusal for any second airport within 100 kilometres of Mascot, guaranteeing not only a monopoly now but a monopoly into the future if that is what the new owners want.


Back in 2002 it was thought to be a high price but, 13 years on, it is clear that Macquarie Bank got Australia's largest and oldest airport for a bargain. But it has gained a reputation for providing overpriced low levels of service, as a private monopoly, for those who have to use the airport. Sydney Airport Corporation pretty much charged what it liked for its services, including to the airlines and the travelling public, via landing and car-parking fees. Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you know—through chairing regional and rural affairs and transport committee inquiries—that landing fees for Qantas, for Australian airlines, are exponentially higher than they are for comparable overseas airports. It is a rip-off. 


The ACCC is on the record as being concerned at the privileged place Sydney Airport Corporation has in extending its monopoly. Each year the ACCC looks at the prices set by airports and has found Sydney Airport to have the most exorbitant parking rates of any airport in Australia. In fact, it is way up there on an international level. For example, it costs drivers $32 for three hours or $135 for seven days in the longer-term carpark. These charges have generated a revenue of $120 million in the last reporting year—up 4.9 per cent, in margin, on the previous year. Why do they do it? It is because they can get away with it, as a monopoly. They will do it again at Badgerys Creek if they decide to take up the option to develop, which I suspect they will.


The issue of landing and parking fees for airlines has also been a sore point in Sydney. No one could accuse me of being mates with Qantas CEO Alan Joyce—and he cannot do anything about this; I even got a lawyer's letter from him over something I said about him, but we sorted that one out—but he is on the record as saying that Australian airports could charge fees for oxygen if they could and that Sydney Airport had amongst the highest charges. On this issue, I agree with Mr Joyce in his advocacy. He is absolutely right. He is speaking not just for his company but for all Australian airlines that want a fair go and for consumers who are being ripped off.


It does not end there. Credible reports from Michael West and Fairfax Media show that Sydney Airport Corporation pays little or no tax to the federal government. According to Mr West—a very experienced business journalist—Sydney Airport did not pay any tax in its first 10 years but has delivered more than $1 billion in fees to advisers and financiers. Because it is a monopoly, it can afford to carry huge debts and it claims interest on that debt as a tax deduction. That effectively cancels out any profits. The real profits are soaked up in hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to its bankers and financiers, each year. It is a nice little earner.


This monopoly privatised corporate entity generates about $700 million in financing costs soaked up on Macquarie Bank clients, bankers, advisers and security holders. To quote Rupert Murdoch, 'A monopoly is a terrible thing unless you happen to own one.' No wonder the ACCC has openly questioned why Sydney Airport received a first right of refusal to operate a second Sydney airport. In its 2013 airport updates the ACCC said that separate owners of the two Sydney airports would encourage lower prices and increase capacity and quality for customers. But that is not to be. The ACCC report said:


Unfortunately, in this case short term budgetary considerations have served to undermine the competitive framework that delivers improved services and lower prices within a market economy.


Who will pay, in the long run, for this undermining of competition? It will be the people of Australia, particularly the hapless passengers who have to travel through Sydney Airport and get ripped off, day in and day out. Those who must travel through its airport include many from my home state of South Australia who catch connecting flights, particularly to the United States and across the Pacific.


It has not been that long since the privatisation—just 13 years. In that time Sydney Airport has had three CEOs, but its first, Max Moore-Wilton, is now the chair of Sydney Airport Holdings, which owns 84 per cent of Sydney Airport. He has come a long way since those days, before the privatisation, when he was secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. He left to take up the helm of Sydney Airport Corporation just months later. He now has the unprecedented opportunity to create a privately owned multisite airport monopoly in Sydney. 


Sydney Airport might not be the only private company that charges like a wounded bull and structures itself to pay as little tax as possible, but it is Australian and was created by our federal government. The privatisation of Sydney Airport has been a disaster, and that disaster is set to continue if Sydney Airport Corporation decides to take up its option to develop and operate Sydney's second airport. We will rue the day, if that happens.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-06-24,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:12):  I want to make a few comments on Sydney Airport and the Western Sydney airport. I commend Senator Xenophon for his great interest and passion around aviation and protecting our aviation assets. He and I have worked quite closely on the rural affairs and transport committee on a number of occasions. I do differ a little with him, in terms of our major airports. The intent of the government when Deputy Prime Minister Anderson, I think it was then, looked at privatising airports—I think with our major airports—has been relatively well met. As I look and travel around the country I see that the privatisation has allowed an injection of capital, which has transformed the major gateways into each of our states around Australia. 


Unfortunately, I cannot say I am quite so supportive of our secondary airports, the likes of Bankstown and Archerfield and others around the country. As recently as last weekend, when I was up at Port Augusta speaking with the manager of the unincorporated lands, I was very aware of the fact that airfields owned by local government and particularly those that serve remote communities are constantly under pressure to maintain the airfields to be capable of taking the Royal Flying Doctor Service, mail services and other services they critically need.


There are a couple of aspects to privatisation. Those in secondary and remote areas I am not such a great fan of; we still need to find ways to invest in those and make them viable for the future. With our primary airports privatisation certainly has transformed Australia, particularly when you look at the role of the airports as a hub not only for passenger movements but also for freight. This week I met with people at the Sydney Airport to talk about the Western Sydney airport and understand what their plans are for servicing regional communities and having that connection with international flights. I certainly compare it with South Australia with the advent of international flights—for example, going direct from Adelaide Airport to Asia and places like Hong Kong and therefore China. There is the export industry—for example, our prawn industry, which does not have the volumes to justify a freight aircraft all by itself—and there are other industries in a similar case. Once you have a passenger service, it means that you have the ability to get freight onto an aircraft and into a market and it opens up new markets around the world, but the important part is to have that link.


Certainly a key part of my discussions around the Western Sydney airport was to make clear in my mind that the planning of the airports and the airlines was to have a joined up service where we did not leave regional communities in the situation where, if they had business to conduct, travel to do or, importantly, exports to get to market, they were relegated to a secondary airport and then had to make a connection across Sydney to a major airport. I am pleased to report that that is not the intention that is being proposed at the moment.


Having been in the aviation industry for many years and having watched debates flow to and fro, I am very conscious that people have talked and talked and talked about Sydney airport and where it might be for longer than I think Senator Ian Macdonald has been talking about Traveston dam. By the time we have built the Sydney airport, perhaps we would have float planes on Traveston dam. I am glad to see that finally, after many years, we have a decision on a location and now we have started the process towards creating the airport.


If you look at the number of movements that come through Sydney and particularly if you look at the management of traffic—they have a cap on the number of movements in a period of time—it comes right down to managing the number of aircraft, even within a quarter of an hour block. It makes it very inefficient for the airlines in terms of bringing aircraft in, because, if they have to divert around weather, for example, or volcanic activity in Indonesia or somewhere and they fall outside of their preapproved slot, there are more aircraft programmed in a period and they do not have the fuel to hold, they end up getting diverted. In terms of the reputation of Australia as an international destination, the last thing you want is uncertainty on behalf of the passengers as to whether they are going to end up in Sydney, which is where they wanted to go, or possibly Brisbane or Melbourne, which are the two logical diversion points. Having the extra capacity at a Western Sydney airport means that we would be able to manage in a far more effective way the flow of air traffic and the volume coming in, not only overall but in any given time frame, which means that we will be able to see a great reduction in the number of aircraft that have to divert to other ports. That can only be good in terms of marketing Australia as a reliable destination for business, including tour businesses, as well as for people who wish to import and export goods using the airports.


This is an example of a promise by the government that, coming into government, there were a number of things we would do. There are the promises you have all heard: stopping the boats, which we have done; getting rid of the carbon tax, which we have done. This is one more area where the Prime Minister promised he would be the infrastructure Prime Minister and would drive development and things that would create jobs. I am pleased to see that this is one more area where the Australian people can look at the Abbott government and say, 'They have actually been prepared to take a decision. It is not popular with everyone, but it is a decision that provides the potential to grow the Australian economy.' If there is one thing that I firmly believe the coalition is characterised by it is looking at ways not to distribute wealth but to grow wealth—to make the pie bigger, because a rising tide floats all boats and people benefit when there are more jobs and more opportunities.


Certainly, when I look at Badgerys Creek and I look at what it will provide, I see it has significant benefit in terms of both investment and job creation. Ernst and Young did an analysis where they found that an airport at Badgerys Creek has the potential to generate some $24.6 billion in direct expenditure by 2060 and contribute $23.9 billion in gross domestic product to the national economy. It would be the largest job creator in Western Sydney. The construction of both the infrastructure package and the airport itself could create up to 8,000 jobs. Initiatives like this are the reason why we are seeing that the rate of jobs growth under the coalition is higher—in fact, multiples higher than at any time under your government, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle. That is something the Australian community can look to with hope.


In terms of the value of the infrastructure that we are putting in, there is a large infrastructure project particularly around roads to make sure that the access is there. There is some $3.6 billion for a 10-year road investment package for Western Sydney. The Commonwealth is going to contribute some $2.9 billion to that. You can look up the detail of the roads that are laid out. What it says to me is that planning has gone on to create an asset in terms of the airport, but, more importantly, to integrate it with the infrastructure in Sydney. It is that long-term planning that I would like to turn to now.


I give credit to the former government for their aviation green paper and the white paper and the NASAG process that came out of that, which is the safeguarding of our airports process. It is the whole idea of trying to get co-operation between the federal government, state governments and local governments around planning permissions to safeguard airports. I am a little disappointed that it seems to have plateaued and the hard work of taking the policy concept and implementing it appears to have stalled. That may not all be the federal government's fault. It takes cooperation from states and local governments as well to make those things happen. We are seeing a lot of discussion with the Federation white paper and the COAG processes. I think both sides of politics suffer the frustration of our three levels of government and sometimes not being able to drive very good common sense ideas through. But can I say that NASAG and the process of protecting our airports and the airspace that goes with them are things that we do need in the national interest to get some alignment between the federal government, of whichever political persuasion, and the state and local governments. Why? Because it is important to our economy and it is important to lots of social functions—things like banking, mail services and medical services. Where we do not protect airports and the airspace, we will see a degradation in the ability of the aviation industry to service Australia in the manner in which we have become accustomed. The reason it is important for this process to be in place is that I frequently come across people at both local and state government levels who are interested in developing their communities, and I fully understand and appreciate that. Whether it is housing close to airports or large high-rise buildings in a capital city that infringe into the airspace,—the PANS-OPS criteria—those things have a direct impact on the viability of airlines to carry the kind of loads they look at.


In South Australia, for example, there was a great deal of contention a year or so back when people looked at the height of the city buildings and complained about what they called the archaic regulations that stopped us having even higher buildings. There was quite some discussion in the media about that and a bit of a head of steam developing in that these were really archaic rules, we should change them and we should have higher buildings. People did not realise that the height limits were actually related to operations out of the airport. If you were taking off from Adelaide Airport on the north-easterly runway and were flying on a cloudy day with a low-cloud base or by night and you had an engine failure in a large transport aircraft with passengers or cargo, then the airspace has to allow for the worst-case in terms of your performance and your climb configuration for you to control the emergency and then return the aircraft to the airfield. If you build higher buildings, then the aircraft has to be able to out-climb the worst-case, which is an intersection with that building. This means that the operators are constrained to carrying less fuel, which means that they go a shorter distance, or they have to off-load passengers or cargo. Eventually, you start constraining the operations to the point where airlines are not prepared to actually service that centre.


The long-term planning that NASAG envisaged is something that is really important for us to get into place. We have seen some benefits with Western Sydney in how the site was originally identified as early as 1969. As a result, the Australian government acquired a site of approximately 1,700 acres over the next decade or so. Land that has been reserved is now having very tangible inputs. For example, around noise and curfew, the fact that those long-term planning restrictions have been associated with that land has largely protected it from incompatible residential development. That means that the typical noise footprint for aircraft does not affect the same number of people it would if unencumbered building had been allowed in those areas. It is going to affect only around 3,900 residents, whereas a similar noise footprint at Kingsford Smith affects nearly 130,000 residents.


Technology for aircraft is getting better, particularly with precision vertical navigation options. Australia is now one of the greatest users, particularly at Kingsford Smith airport. That and new generation aircraft with high-bypass ratio engines, with a low-noise signature, means that we can get higher volumes of traffic into airports. The point I am trying to make here is that long-term planning that allowed us to set aside that land is now going to have a very tangible benefit. That means Western Sydney Airport will be capable of having 24-hour operations. It will not necessarily have to have a curfew. The planning, combined with advancing technology, gives great capability which will benefit our economy and the number of jobs that can grow at Western Sydney Airport.


As we look at these kinds of developments and the threats enveloping other airports—and in your own state, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you would have seen media recently about Perth Airport and concerns about residential development—there are great concerns around incompatible development. Certainly, there are great concerns as I look at places like Archerfield, Bankstown and Jandakot in Western Australia. I just want to lay out, again, for both sides of politics that, for all levels of government, whether we do it through the Reform of the federation white paper or through the COAG process, we need to get on top of the NASAG concepts. I would argue that we even need to extend it to include what the Queensland government has, which are areas set aside in the approach and take-off paths of runway which allow for the fact that many secondary airports service single-engine aircraft with trainees. There is a danger that, if you have a failure, then, obviously, aircraft can come down in the area. Queensland has done a very good job of quarantining, if you like, a splay at the end of a runway. That is something we should be looking at more on a national basis.


So it is an important process, and I would certainly encourage state and local government associations to look at how they can work constructively with the federal government and realise that this is not just about a loss of rates they may suffer if they cannot build a particular subdivision of housing right next to an airport. If they look at the broader impact, the direct jobs associated with an airport and, also, what the airport enables in terms of tourism, in terms of business travel and, particularly, in terms of export for so many of our small- to medium-sized businesses, the economic impact on the state of having a reduced capability in that airport would be extreme. We really do need to take a long-term view around the issues of airport planning.


This all brings me back to Western Sydney. It is a good news story in that it is going to provide Australia and Sydney—I know Victorians do not like to hear this but Sydney still remains, for many people internationally, the place to see when they come to Australia—with a more reliable and consistent opportunity to arrive without needing to divert and to provide the of kind capacity that will increase the flow of business travel, tourism and trade, which will be good.


The infrastructure side alone is a policy commitment by the coalition which has been fulfilled in terms of saying, 'We are prepared to take the decisions that, for many years, other people have not taken.' We have seen Prime Minister Abbott and his team take that decision. It is welcome. It will help grow, not only Western Sydney's, but Australia's national economy. The more the economy grows, the more we can invest in all the other things that people are legitimately concerned to see us invest in, so we can continue to make the investments in health and education and things like overseas aid and defence, which are important to the nation. I welcome the initiatives of this government, the decisions around Badgerys Creek and the development of Western Sydney's airport.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2015-06-24,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (18:29):  I am delighted to be able to contribute and sum up the debate in relation to the Airports Amendment Bill 2015. To continue on from the exceptionally eloquent speech of Senator Fawcett: this is a good-news story for the people of New South Wales and in particular for the people of Western Sydney. This is fantastic news for the people of Australia in terms of the overall benefit that this airport is ultimately going to offer.


It was on 15 April 2014 that finally the Abbott coalition government announced that the site for the Western Sydney new airport would be located at Badgerys Creek. As we have heard, this is an announcement that has been talked about for some time. In fact, I was not even born, amazingly, when a second airport for Sydney was first discussed. So to have, just over 12 months ago, the culmination of something that had been talked about for decades and decades finally come to fruition under the Abbott government is a fantastic thing for all Australians.


Of course, whilst this is a second airport for Sydney, it must be remembered that first and foremost this is an airport for the people of Western Sydney. But an airport at Western Sydney is going to bring benefits not just to the people of Western Sydney, not just to the people of New South Wales but to Australians as a whole. We know that a new airport at Badgerys Creek is going to be a major boost to the local economy. We know that it is going to create thousands of jobs during the construction phase, but also a pipeline of jobs once the airport becomes operational. This is a government that said, 'We want to be the government that builds the infrastructure to take Australia into the 21st century.' This is a government that said, 'If you give us the honour of electing us to office, we will create the jobs that are going to employ people today and going forward tomorrow. That is exactly what this proposed airport for the people of Western Sydney will do.


The Australian government is now working with the government of New South Wales to deliver the new infrastructure and to deliver jobs for the people of Western Sydney. We are looking at an employment boom of approximately 8,000 jobs that will be created as a result of the construction of the airport and the upgrades that are going to be occurring in relation to the roads that are being built. And of course then we have that flow-on benefit, those long-term jobs that are going to be created for Australians once the airport commences operation, flowing through right to the mid-2020s. We are only in 2015, and we are already talking about an employment boom of 8,000 jobs—quite literally taking us through into the future. As I said, and as we have heard from a number of our speakers, for many decades an airport was proposed, an airport was discussed, and finally, under the Abbott government, the work is now happening. It is certainly a project that the rest of the world will be watching.


Turning to the statistics in relation to the number of passenger trips, for example, 54 million passenger trips are forecast to go unmet at Kingsford Smith airport by 2060 unless another airport is built in Sydney. If we forgo those passenger trips, can you imagine the adverse consequences to our economy?—the loss of the tourism dollar, the loss of purchasing power, the loss of employment. Grabbing hold of those 54 million passenger trips is exactly what we want to do under this government, and that is why we are making the concrete decision to go ahead and build the Badgerys Creek airport.


In terms of the additional infrastructure that is going to be needed, this is a government that is going to ensure that it is a case of roads first and the airport second, because we want to ensure that the airport is a success right from the very start. What does that ultimately mean? It means that thousands of good jobs and better local roads will be delivered well before that first plane taxis down that runway. And what are we looking at in terms of that road infrastructure build? Fourteen intersections, eight kilometres of road and 10 kilometres of shared paths have already been built this year alone. That is absolutely amazing. The airport is going to create economic and employment benefits then be a catalyst for further growth. The analysis undertaken by Ernst & Young found that an airport at Badgerys Creek has the potential to generate 24.6 billion in direct expenditure by 2060. It also found that an airport at Badgerys Creek could potentially contribute a $23.9 billion increase in gross domestic product to the national economy. Again, we are talking about a project that is going to have a huge economic impact on our nation.


This project will be the single-largest job creator in Western Sydney. We are very proud of that as the Abbott government. We said that we wanted to create jobs for Australians. We said that we wanted to be the government that built the infrastructure today for everybody to use tomorrow. That is exactly what we are doing.


With the road infrastructure to date, significant progress has been made on the projects. This is included in the $3.6 billion Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan—$3.6 billion is being injected into Western Sydney by this government under this plan. As you know, the Prime Minister literally broke the ground on the Bringelly Road on 20 January 2015. We have also seen the commencement of construction on the Werrington Arterial Road in March 2015. 


But we do not stop there. The Local Roads Package has also commenced, with $32.4 million being allocated across seven projects under round 1, and submissions for round 2 will be invited in mid-2015. Then we have construction on the Northern Road, which is expected to begin in late 2015, and construction on the new motorway connecting the M7 to the Northern Road motorway is expected to commence in 2019. So again, the benefits of this project are already being seen with the start of construction of road upgrades to support the new proposed airport. 


As I have said, the new airport in Western Sydney is part of the coalition government's investment in the infrastructure for the 21st century, and it is going to generate thousands of jobs and provide a huge economic boost that is going to give us economic growth in Western Sydney. And then of course we have those flow-on effects. It will be a catalyst for investment—investments in education, science, research and aeronautical industries. 


In their contributions, a number of the previous speakers referred to high-speed rail. I would like to make some comments in relation to high-speed rail. The Australian government continues to explore what role high-speed rail could play as part of Australia's long-term transport planning. There is no doubt Australia will need additional transport capacity in the future to meet our growing population's demands for travel. In planning to meet this demand—and this is where a number of our speakers failed to consider other forms of transport—we do need to consider all forms of transport modes, which include aviation, road, conventional rail and high-speed rail. We should not just limit ourselves to looking at high-speed rail, because what we need to do in our considerations is to determine the best approach for our unique conditions and then we need to optimise the benefits for our regions.


In terms of some costings that have been undertaken, the 2013 High Speed Rail Study Phase 2 found that it would cost approximately $114 billion to construct a line between Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane, with construction best staged over three decades and commencing with the Sydney to Canberra section in 2027. 


The same study found that the cost of connecting Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne was approximately $50 billion. They are huge amounts of money that we are talking about here. Whilst I certainly appreciate that a high-speed rail is a priority for the Australian Greens in particular—and we have certainly heard from Senator Rice and Senator Rhiannon in that regard—it is not the subject of the bill that we are referring to and it does not replace the need for an airport in Western Sydney.


Western Sydney has a population of over two million people. That is almost the size of Brisbane. As the population continues to grow, we must provide the appropriate infrastructure a region of that size warrants. Currently, around 30 per cent of workers living in Western Sydney commute well outside their region to get to work. This has an economic as well as a personal and a family impact. Then we have a look at the projections. Where are we going? Projections indicate that, by 2041, a further one million people will live in Western Sydney; and, in the next 20 years, Western Sydney will account for two-thirds of Sydney's population growth but only one-third of jobs. So Western Sydney airport will be a catalyst for growth. It will be a catalyst for investment and it will be a catalyst for jobs in Western Sydney.


The Airports Amendment Bill 2015 is going to amend the Airports Act 1996 to provide for the creation of an airport plan for the proposed Western Sydney airport, recognising that the airport will be a greenfield development that requires a unique process. The Airports Act provides the framework to manage and operate Australia's federally leased airports like Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. The airport plan will authorise the initial development and specify the Australian government's requirements for the airport. 


Importantly, the bill recognises that the environmental assessment process currently underway for the airport is a key part of the approvals process. The bill confers an approval function on the environment minister in relation to environmental matters. The bill will require the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development to incorporate into the airport plan any environmental conditions imposed by the Minister for the Environment following completion of the environmental impact statement. 


Preparation of a new and robust environmental impact statement is underway, and the community will have an opportunity to have a say on the draft environmental impact statement later this year. Once the airport plan envisaged under this act is in place, no further planning or development approvals will be required prior to initial construction commencing 


It will enable detailed design and construction planning to commence as soon as possible after contract signature.


The bill also includes measures that would help the government consider alternative operators, should Sydney Airport group turn down an offer to develop and operate the proposed airport. Under the 2002 sale agreement for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, the owners of Sydney airport have a right of first refusal to develop and operate a second major airport within 100 kilometres of Sydney's centre. If they decline to exercise the right, the Commonwealth is open to looking at other operators, or to developing the site itself, provided it is done on the same terms. However, the Airports Act currently effectively prevents the Commonwealth from taking either of these actions in the event that the Sydney Airport Group declines to accept the offer. Section 18 of the Airports Act requires that the airport lessee companies for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and any airport site declared to be 'Sydney West Airport', as it is referred to in the Airports Act, must be subsidiaries of the same company. This is a legacy provision from the Airports Act as originally passed in 1996.


The bill removes the requirement of common ownership, providing the Commonwealth with the commercial flexibility to deal with third parties, or to develop the airport itself if required. The bill also removes the airport cross-ownership restrictions currently placed on Sydney West Airport. These restrictions prevent cross-ownership of more than 15 per cent between Melbourne, Brisbane or Perth airports and a new airport at Badgerys Creek. The amendment will help maximise the success of any market offering in the event that Sydney Airport Group chooses not to exercise an option to develop and operate the airport. The bill also contain some mechanical provisions to facilitate declaration of the airport site and other preparatory work.


In closing, this is the culmination of decades and decades of discussion. What has been decades of discussion under the Abbott coalition government has finally come to a decision. That decision was announced on 15 April 2014, when we said that the site for Western Sydney's new airport would be at Badgerys Creek. We said that if we were elected to govern, we wanted to be the government that built the infrastructure for tomorrow. We wanted to be the government that takes Australia into the 21st century. We said that we wanted to be a government that creates jobs for Australians today but also ensures that those jobs flow on to become the jobs for Australians well into the future. And that is exactly what we are seeing with the Sydney West Airport. As I have said, we are looking at a multibillion dollar boost to our economy. On top of that, we are looking at the creation of approximately 8,000 jobs. That is an absolutely fantastic package of support for Australians. And these benefits are already being seen with the start of construction of road upgrades to support the new airport. But on top of that, this is going to be a catalyst, going forward, for investment in so many things—investment in education, investment in science and in research, and investment in aeronautical industries.


I have listened very carefully to the debate and I thank those on the opposition benches for their support for this bill. I certainly commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (18:49):  I move amendment (1) on sheet 7735:


(1) Schedule 1, item 30, page 15 (after line 30), after subsection 96B(12), insert:


   (12A) To avoid doubt, if the Sydney West Airport is not to be constructed and operated at Badgerys Creek, New South Wales, subsection (12) does not apply.


The government is currently pursuing the construction of an airport at Badgerys Creek. The Greens believe that, as an absolute minimum, we need to have an environmental impact assessment undertaken as soon as possible so that the community is fully aware of the potential impacts.


However, the reason for this amendment to the bill is to clarify that, if the Badgerys Creek airport is not constructed, for whatever reason, a completed environmental impact statement for Badgerys Creek cannot be used as a substitute for an environmental impact statement for any other future airport location. It is a minor amendment. It clarifies that, if Badgerys Creek does not go ahead for any reason or is substantially changed, a new environmental impact statement would be required for any other airport serving Sydney's west, and that the government would not be able to use the fact that Badgerys Creek was the plan in 2014 and 2015 to bypass proper environmental planning processes.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (18:50):  The government will be opposing the Greens amendment, but on the basis that the government believes that the amendment is unnecessary, given that the specific reference to Badgerys Creek in clause 96 B(12) of the bill. If I could just read into the Hansard clause 96B(12) of the bill. It states as follows:


For the purposes of this section, if:


(a) in December 2014, proposed action consisted of the construction and operation of a Western Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek, New South Wales; and


(b) the proposed action was referred to the Environment Minister; and


(c) the Environment Minister decided under section 87 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 that the relevant impacts of the action must be assessed by an environmental impact statement under Division 6 of Part 8 of that Act;


the environmental impact statement is the Sydney West Airport environmental impact statement.


Certainly, in terms of clause 96B(12) of the bill, you can see, Mr Chairman, as I have read it out for the benefit of the chamber, that that particular clause provides that the Sydney West Airport environmental impact statement is only for the construction and operation of a Western Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek in New South Wales. So, in terms of the amendment moved by Senator Rice, it is not possible for the environmental impact statement that is currently being prepared or any subsequent consideration of that statement to be used for an alternative site.


Additionally, I think it is inconceivable that an airport plan could be determined for the Western Sydney airport at a different location but relying on an environmental impact statement for Badgerys Creek. On that point, can I again confirm for the chamber that the government remains committed to Badgerys Creek as the site for Western Sydney's first airport and, again, that is why we are spending the $3.6 billion on surrounding infrastructure in partnership with the New South Wales government. That is also why we have initiated the right of first refusal process with the owners of Sydney—Kingsford Smith—Airport and have spent the last nine months consulting with the Sydney Airport group, as we are contractually obliged to do, under the right of first refusal process.


So certainly, in terms of the amendment that has been moved by Senator Rice, the government does believe that it is unnecessary and, as I say, we will be opposing it.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:58):  When debate was interrupted earlier today, I was talking about the Airports Amendment Bill 2015, which we have before us now. I was talking about the big promises on jobs associated with Badgerys Creek airport. I relayed how the Prime Minister promised that that airport will deliver 60,000 jobs. There is no time frame for that, but the promise is out there and it has been repeated many times. Then we have the New South Wales Business Chamber promising 30,000 jobs by 2050. That 30,000 figure is already half of the figure touted by the Prime Minister and reported in the media; however, it relies on the assumption that passenger movements are significantly higher than even the most generous predictions. A more realistic scenario, which was also developed by the New South Wales Business Chamber but this time relying on passenger movements estimated by the federal government's joint study into aviation capacity, puts the job creation figures at 10,000 by 2040. It is quite clear that the Prime Minister and the business lobby have inflated job creation figures to boost support for Badgerys Creek. Without a time line, without a business case and without a contract, any job creation figures touted by the government must be taken with a large grain of salt. This is clearly very important because the jobs issue is something that is very critical to the people of Western Sydney—and we start to see how considerably they have been misled, sadly, by both the Liberal and National parties and the Labor Party.


The issue of a curfew is also highly relevant to the business case behind Badgerys Creek. It has been stated many times that Badgerys Creek will only be viable when there are 24/7 operations, but this would expose residents in Western Sydney to aircraft noise that Sydneysiders living close to Sydney Airport at the Kingsford Smith site are protected from. The infrastructure minister ruled out a curfew just last month, further evidence that the community is ignored in order to protect the interests of the private corporations lining up to make a nice profit out of the construction of a publicly subsidised supplementary airport. How can the Liberal-National government argue that the residents of Western Sydney should be subjected to a 24/7 airport when residents in the inner west and the inner city benefit from a curfew at Kingsford Smith airport? While it is true that much of the land around Badgerys Creek is yet to be developed, that certainly will not be the case in 2025, when the airport is allegedly going to be first operational, or in 2035, when it has been operating for a decade. It makes more sense to create policy around what Badgerys Creek will look like in 20 years, not what it looks like now.


It has also been said that Badgerys Creek will reduce aircraft noise associated with Kingsford Smith airport. It is far more likely that the creation of a supplementary airport at Badgerys Creek will increase aircraft noise at Kingsford Smith. Badgerys Creek is expected to be a smaller airport with less hangar space and a smaller runway, similar to Avalon Airport in Melbourne. Like at Avalon, this means that Badgerys Creek will soak up demand for smaller regional flights, leaving more arrival and departure slots open at Mascot for large international jets. This means more aircraft noise, not less. More noise pollution for the locals is certainly not what we want.


Despite the fact that the leadership of the Labor Party and the coalition are on a unity ticket when it comes to Badgerys Creek, local Labor and Liberal MPs around the proposed airport site have raised significant concerns. Last year, Chifley Labor MP Ed Husic said:


I have maintained an unwavering position against an airport at Badgerys Creek for 15 years.


He is certainly spot on. He further said:


I remain firmly of the view this airport will adversely affect the quality of life of the people of western Sydney and I won't be changing my position until I—and more importantly my constituents—are totally convinced it is in their best interests.


Another quote:


There must be detailed discussion and consultation with the community on any proposal for an airport the equivalent size of Brisbane's and to date this has not happened.


I agree with much of what the member for Chifley has said and it is disappointing that the leadership of his party has run roughshod over his concerns to back the Abbott government's proposal fully. As recently as last month, the member for Chifley was, rightly, attacking the Abbott government for not taking its proposal for an airport at Badgerys Creek to an election and for failing to implement a curfew. Again, these are absolutely valid points and it is a shame they have been ignored by the Labor Party leadership and the shadow infrastructure minister, Anthony Albanese.


The shadow Treasurer and member for McMahon, Chris Bowen, is also opposed to the operation of an airport at Badgerys Creek without a curfew, again putting him at odds with Mr Albanese. The Labor members for Parramatta, Greenway and Werriwa are also on the record opposing a 24/7 airport at Badgerys Creek. The member for Blaxland, Jason Clare, has stated publicly that any new airport at Badgerys Creek should be serviced with a rail link, not just road links. The government has already ruled out a rail link when Badgerys Creek becomes operational. It is simply extraordinary that the concerns of all these local Labor MPs have been ignored by Mr Albanese in his eagerness to support the Prime Minister's proposal for a 24/7 operation at Badgerys Creek. It is not just local Labor MPs who have spoken out against this proposal; many Liberal MPs have done so also. The member for Lindsay, Fiona Scott, has strongly opposed the operation of a 24/7 airport at Badgerys Creek.


While the Abbott government is currently pursuing the construction of an airport at Badgerys Creek, the Greens believe that, at an absolute minimum, an environmental impact assessment should be undertaken as soon as possible so the community is fully aware of its impacts. I will be moving a Greens amendment to the bill to clarify that, if Badgerys Creek airport is not constructed, a completed environmental impact statement for this location cannot be used as a substitute for an environmental impact statement for any other future airport location. The Greens do not oppose this bill, but we do believe it is really important that this amendment is adopted.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,2,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-06-24,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:05):  The Airports Amendment Bill 2015 makes arrangements for a second airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek in Western Sydney. Clearly, Sydney does need a second airport—Kingsford Smith airport at Mascot is at capacity—but I wonder whether the need for it and the urgency would be as great if we had some high-speed rail links in this country, particularly between Sydney and Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, and Sydney and Brisbane.


Sydney Airport Corporation has the right of first refusal to develop and manage the new airport. This option was part of the original privatisation deal that saw the airport sold for $5.6 billion by the Howard government in 2002. The privatisation of Sydney Airport, creating a monopoly out of our largest and oldest airport, has been a disaster for Sydney and the nation. Now we are considering a bill that makes arrangements to possibly extend that monopoly to the new airport, cementing high costs of services for the travelling public for decades to come. Many formally state owned enterprises have been privatised since the 1980s and sometimes not with a good result for the public—from the Commonwealth Bank to Telstra to electricity grids; and, in my home state of South Australia, the state government is crazily trying to privatise the Motor Accident Commission—but the privatisation of Sydney Airport has to take the cake as the craziest of all. It was not inevitable. The federal government did not have to privatise the airport and it did not have to include a first right of refusal for any second airport within 100 kilometres of Mascot, guaranteeing not only a monopoly now but a monopoly into the future if that is what the new owners want.


Back in 2002 it was thought to be a high price but, 13 years on, it is clear that Macquarie Bank got Australia's largest and oldest airport for a bargain. But it has gained a reputation for providing overpriced low levels of service, as a private monopoly, for those who have to use the airport. Sydney Airport Corporation pretty much charged what it liked for its services, including to the airlines and the travelling public, via landing and car-parking fees. Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you know—through chairing regional and rural affairs and transport committee inquiries—that landing fees for Qantas, for Australian airlines, are exponentially higher than they are for comparable overseas airports. It is a rip-off. 


The ACCC is on the record as being concerned at the privileged place Sydney Airport Corporation has in extending its monopoly. Each year the ACCC looks at the prices set by airports and has found Sydney Airport to have the most exorbitant parking rates of any airport in Australia. In fact, it is way up there on an international level. For example, it costs drivers $32 for three hours or $135 for seven days in the longer-term carpark. These charges have generated a revenue of $120 million in the last reporting year—up 4.9 per cent, in margin, on the previous year. Why do they do it? It is because they can get away with it, as a monopoly. They will do it again at Badgerys Creek if they decide to take up the option to develop, which I suspect they will.


The issue of landing and parking fees for airlines has also been a sore point in Sydney. No one could accuse me of being mates with Qantas CEO Alan Joyce—and he cannot do anything about this; I even got a lawyer's letter from him over something I said about him, but we sorted that one out—but he is on the record as saying that Australian airports could charge fees for oxygen if they could and that Sydney Airport had amongst the highest charges. On this issue, I agree with Mr Joyce in his advocacy. He is absolutely right. He is speaking not just for his company but for all Australian airlines that want a fair go and for consumers who are being ripped off.


It does not end there. Credible reports from Michael West and Fairfax Media show that Sydney Airport Corporation pays little or no tax to the federal government. According to Mr West—a very experienced business journalist—Sydney Airport did not pay any tax in its first 10 years but has delivered more than $1 billion in fees to advisers and financiers. Because it is a monopoly, it can afford to carry huge debts and it claims interest on that debt as a tax deduction. That effectively cancels out any profits. The real profits are soaked up in hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to its bankers and financiers, each year. It is a nice little earner.


This monopoly privatised corporate entity generates about $700 million in financing costs soaked up on Macquarie Bank clients, bankers, advisers and security holders. To quote Rupert Murdoch, 'A monopoly is a terrible thing unless you happen to own one.' No wonder the ACCC has openly questioned why Sydney Airport received a first right of refusal to operate a second Sydney airport. In its 2013 airport updates the ACCC said that separate owners of the two Sydney airports would encourage lower prices and increase capacity and quality for customers. But that is not to be. The ACCC report said:


Unfortunately, in this case short term budgetary considerations have served to undermine the competitive framework that delivers improved services and lower prices within a market economy.


Who will pay, in the long run, for this undermining of competition? It will be the people of Australia, particularly the hapless passengers who have to travel through Sydney Airport and get ripped off, day in and day out. Those who must travel through its airport include many from my home state of South Australia who catch connecting flights, particularly to the United States and across the Pacific.


It has not been that long since the privatisation—just 13 years. In that time Sydney Airport has had three CEOs, but its first, Max Moore-Wilton, is now the chair of Sydney Airport Holdings, which owns 84 per cent of Sydney Airport. He has come a long way since those days, before the privatisation, when he was secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. He left to take up the helm of Sydney Airport Corporation just months later. He now has the unprecedented opportunity to create a privately owned multisite airport monopoly in Sydney. 


Sydney Airport might not be the only private company that charges like a wounded bull and structures itself to pay as little tax as possible, but it is Australian and was created by our federal government. The privatisation of Sydney Airport has been a disaster, and that disaster is set to continue if Sydney Airport Corporation decides to take up its option to develop and operate Sydney's second airport. We will rue the day, if that happens.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-06-24,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:12):  I want to make a few comments on Sydney Airport and the Western Sydney airport. I commend Senator Xenophon for his great interest and passion around aviation and protecting our aviation assets. He and I have worked quite closely on the rural affairs and transport committee on a number of occasions. I do differ a little with him, in terms of our major airports. The intent of the government when Deputy Prime Minister Anderson, I think it was then, looked at privatising airports—I think with our major airports—has been relatively well met. As I look and travel around the country I see that the privatisation has allowed an injection of capital, which has transformed the major gateways into each of our states around Australia. 


Unfortunately, I cannot say I am quite so supportive of our secondary airports, the likes of Bankstown and Archerfield and others around the country. As recently as last weekend, when I was up at Port Augusta speaking with the manager of the unincorporated lands, I was very aware of the fact that airfields owned by local government and particularly those that serve remote communities are constantly under pressure to maintain the airfields to be capable of taking the Royal Flying Doctor Service, mail services and other services they critically need.


There are a couple of aspects to privatisation. Those in secondary and remote areas I am not such a great fan of; we still need to find ways to invest in those and make them viable for the future. With our primary airports privatisation certainly has transformed Australia, particularly when you look at the role of the airports as a hub not only for passenger movements but also for freight. This week I met with people at the Sydney Airport to talk about the Western Sydney airport and understand what their plans are for servicing regional communities and having that connection with international flights. I certainly compare it with South Australia with the advent of international flights—for example, going direct from Adelaide Airport to Asia and places like Hong Kong and therefore China. There is the export industry—for example, our prawn industry, which does not have the volumes to justify a freight aircraft all by itself—and there are other industries in a similar case. Once you have a passenger service, it means that you have the ability to get freight onto an aircraft and into a market and it opens up new markets around the world, but the important part is to have that link.


Certainly a key part of my discussions around the Western Sydney airport was to make clear in my mind that the planning of the airports and the airlines was to have a joined up service where we did not leave regional communities in the situation where, if they had business to conduct, travel to do or, importantly, exports to get to market, they were relegated to a secondary airport and then had to make a connection across Sydney to a major airport. I am pleased to report that that is not the intention that is being proposed at the moment.


Having been in the aviation industry for many years and having watched debates flow to and fro, I am very conscious that people have talked and talked and talked about Sydney airport and where it might be for longer than I think Senator Ian Macdonald has been talking about Traveston dam. By the time we have built the Sydney airport, perhaps we would have float planes on Traveston dam. I am glad to see that finally, after many years, we have a decision on a location and now we have started the process towards creating the airport.


If you look at the number of movements that come through Sydney and particularly if you look at the management of traffic—they have a cap on the number of movements in a period of time—it comes right down to managing the number of aircraft, even within a quarter of an hour block. It makes it very inefficient for the airlines in terms of bringing aircraft in, because, if they have to divert around weather, for example, or volcanic activity in Indonesia or somewhere and they fall outside of their preapproved slot, there are more aircraft programmed in a period and they do not have the fuel to hold, they end up getting diverted. In terms of the reputation of Australia as an international destination, the last thing you want is uncertainty on behalf of the passengers as to whether they are going to end up in Sydney, which is where they wanted to go, or possibly Brisbane or Melbourne, which are the two logical diversion points. Having the extra capacity at a Western Sydney airport means that we would be able to manage in a far more effective way the flow of air traffic and the volume coming in, not only overall but in any given time frame, which means that we will be able to see a great reduction in the number of aircraft that have to divert to other ports. That can only be good in terms of marketing Australia as a reliable destination for business, including tour businesses, as well as for people who wish to import and export goods using the airports.


This is an example of a promise by the government that, coming into government, there were a number of things we would do. There are the promises you have all heard: stopping the boats, which we have done; getting rid of the carbon tax, which we have done. This is one more area where the Prime Minister promised he would be the infrastructure Prime Minister and would drive development and things that would create jobs. I am pleased to see that this is one more area where the Australian people can look at the Abbott government and say, 'They have actually been prepared to take a decision. It is not popular with everyone, but it is a decision that provides the potential to grow the Australian economy.' If there is one thing that I firmly believe the coalition is characterised by it is looking at ways not to distribute wealth but to grow wealth—to make the pie bigger, because a rising tide floats all boats and people benefit when there are more jobs and more opportunities.


Certainly, when I look at Badgerys Creek and I look at what it will provide, I see it has significant benefit in terms of both investment and job creation. Ernst and Young did an analysis where they found that an airport at Badgerys Creek has the potential to generate some $24.6 billion in direct expenditure by 2060 and contribute $23.9 billion in gross domestic product to the national economy. It would be the largest job creator in Western Sydney. The construction of both the infrastructure package and the airport itself could create up to 8,000 jobs. Initiatives like this are the reason why we are seeing that the rate of jobs growth under the coalition is higher—in fact, multiples higher than at any time under your government, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle. That is something the Australian community can look to with hope.


In terms of the value of the infrastructure that we are putting in, there is a large infrastructure project particularly around roads to make sure that the access is there. There is some $3.6 billion for a 10-year road investment package for Western Sydney. The Commonwealth is going to contribute some $2.9 billion to that. You can look up the detail of the roads that are laid out. What it says to me is that planning has gone on to create an asset in terms of the airport, but, more importantly, to integrate it with the infrastructure in Sydney. It is that long-term planning that I would like to turn to now.


I give credit to the former government for their aviation green paper and the white paper and the NASAG process that came out of that, which is the safeguarding of our airports process. It is the whole idea of trying to get co-operation between the federal government, state governments and local governments around planning permissions to safeguard airports. I am a little disappointed that it seems to have plateaued and the hard work of taking the policy concept and implementing it appears to have stalled. That may not all be the federal government's fault. It takes cooperation from states and local governments as well to make those things happen. We are seeing a lot of discussion with the Federation white paper and the COAG processes. I think both sides of politics suffer the frustration of our three levels of government and sometimes not being able to drive very good common sense ideas through. But can I say that NASAG and the process of protecting our airports and the airspace that goes with them are things that we do need in the national interest to get some alignment between the federal government, of whichever political persuasion, and the state and local governments. Why? Because it is important to our economy and it is important to lots of social functions—things like banking, mail services and medical services. Where we do not protect airports and the airspace, we will see a degradation in the ability of the aviation industry to service Australia in the manner in which we have become accustomed. The reason it is important for this process to be in place is that I frequently come across people at both local and state government levels who are interested in developing their communities, and I fully understand and appreciate that. Whether it is housing close to airports or large high-rise buildings in a capital city that infringe into the airspace,—the PANS-OPS criteria—those things have a direct impact on the viability of airlines to carry the kind of loads they look at.


In South Australia, for example, there was a great deal of contention a year or so back when people looked at the height of the city buildings and complained about what they called the archaic regulations that stopped us having even higher buildings. There was quite some discussion in the media about that and a bit of a head of steam developing in that these were really archaic rules, we should change them and we should have higher buildings. People did not realise that the height limits were actually related to operations out of the airport. If you were taking off from Adelaide Airport on the north-easterly runway and were flying on a cloudy day with a low-cloud base or by night and you had an engine failure in a large transport aircraft with passengers or cargo, then the airspace has to allow for the worst-case in terms of your performance and your climb configuration for you to control the emergency and then return the aircraft to the airfield. If you build higher buildings, then the aircraft has to be able to out-climb the worst-case, which is an intersection with that building. This means that the operators are constrained to carrying less fuel, which means that they go a shorter distance, or they have to off-load passengers or cargo. Eventually, you start constraining the operations to the point where airlines are not prepared to actually service that centre.


The long-term planning that NASAG envisaged is something that is really important for us to get into place. We have seen some benefits with Western Sydney in how the site was originally identified as early as 1969. As a result, the Australian government acquired a site of approximately 1,700 acres over the next decade or so. Land that has been reserved is now having very tangible inputs. For example, around noise and curfew, the fact that those long-term planning restrictions have been associated with that land has largely protected it from incompatible residential development. That means that the typical noise footprint for aircraft does not affect the same number of people it would if unencumbered building had been allowed in those areas. It is going to affect only around 3,900 residents, whereas a similar noise footprint at Kingsford Smith affects nearly 130,000 residents.


Technology for aircraft is getting better, particularly with precision vertical navigation options. Australia is now one of the greatest users, particularly at Kingsford Smith airport. That and new generation aircraft with high-bypass ratio engines, with a low-noise signature, means that we can get higher volumes of traffic into airports. The point I am trying to make here is that long-term planning that allowed us to set aside that land is now going to have a very tangible benefit. That means Western Sydney Airport will be capable of having 24-hour operations. It will not necessarily have to have a curfew. The planning, combined with advancing technology, gives great capability which will benefit our economy and the number of jobs that can grow at Western Sydney Airport.


As we look at these kinds of developments and the threats enveloping other airports—and in your own state, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you would have seen media recently about Perth Airport and concerns about residential development—there are great concerns around incompatible development. Certainly, there are great concerns as I look at places like Archerfield, Bankstown and Jandakot in Western Australia. I just want to lay out, again, for both sides of politics that, for all levels of government, whether we do it through the Reform of the federation white paper or through the COAG process, we need to get on top of the NASAG concepts. I would argue that we even need to extend it to include what the Queensland government has, which are areas set aside in the approach and take-off paths of runway which allow for the fact that many secondary airports service single-engine aircraft with trainees. There is a danger that, if you have a failure, then, obviously, aircraft can come down in the area. Queensland has done a very good job of quarantining, if you like, a splay at the end of a runway. That is something we should be looking at more on a national basis.


So it is an important process, and I would certainly encourage state and local government associations to look at how they can work constructively with the federal government and realise that this is not just about a loss of rates they may suffer if they cannot build a particular subdivision of housing right next to an airport. If they look at the broader impact, the direct jobs associated with an airport and, also, what the airport enables in terms of tourism, in terms of business travel and, particularly, in terms of export for so many of our small- to medium-sized businesses, the economic impact on the state of having a reduced capability in that airport would be extreme. We really do need to take a long-term view around the issues of airport planning.


This all brings me back to Western Sydney. It is a good news story in that it is going to provide Australia and Sydney—I know Victorians do not like to hear this but Sydney still remains, for many people internationally, the place to see when they come to Australia—with a more reliable and consistent opportunity to arrive without needing to divert and to provide the of kind capacity that will increase the flow of business travel, tourism and trade, which will be good.


The infrastructure side alone is a policy commitment by the coalition which has been fulfilled in terms of saying, 'We are prepared to take the decisions that, for many years, other people have not taken.' We have seen Prime Minister Abbott and his team take that decision. It is welcome. It will help grow, not only Western Sydney's, but Australia's national economy. The more the economy grows, the more we can invest in all the other things that people are legitimately concerned to see us invest in, so we can continue to make the investments in health and education and things like overseas aid and defence, which are important to the nation. I welcome the initiatives of this government, the decisions around Badgerys Creek and the development of Western Sydney's airport.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (18:29):  I am delighted to be able to contribute and sum up the debate in relation to the Airports Amendment Bill 2015. To continue on from the exceptionally eloquent speech of Senator Fawcett: this is a good-news story for the people of New South Wales and in particular for the people of Western Sydney. This is fantastic news for the people of Australia in terms of the overall benefit that this airport is ultimately going to offer.


It was on 15 April 2014 that finally the Abbott coalition government announced that the site for the Western Sydney new airport would be located at Badgerys Creek. As we have heard, this is an announcement that has been talked about for some time. In fact, I was not even born, amazingly, when a second airport for Sydney was first discussed. So to have, just over 12 months ago, the culmination of something that had been talked about for decades and decades finally come to fruition under the Abbott government is a fantastic thing for all Australians.


Of course, whilst this is a second airport for Sydney, it must be remembered that first and foremost this is an airport for the people of Western Sydney. But an airport at Western Sydney is going to bring benefits not just to the people of Western Sydney, not just to the people of New South Wales but to Australians as a whole. We know that a new airport at Badgerys Creek is going to be a major boost to the local economy. We know that it is going to create thousands of jobs during the construction phase, but also a pipeline of jobs once the airport becomes operational. This is a government that said, 'We want to be the government that builds the infrastructure to take Australia into the 21st century.' This is a government that said, 'If you give us the honour of electing us to office, we will create the jobs that are going to employ people today and going forward tomorrow. That is exactly what this proposed airport for the people of Western Sydney will do.


The Australian government is now working with the government of New South Wales to deliver the new infrastructure and to deliver jobs for the people of Western Sydney. We are looking at an employment boom of approximately 8,000 jobs that will be created as a result of the construction of the airport and the upgrades that are going to be occurring in relation to the roads that are being built. And of course then we have that flow-on benefit, those long-term jobs that are going to be created for Australians once the airport commences operation, flowing through right to the mid-2020s. We are only in 2015, and we are already talking about an employment boom of 8,000 jobs—quite literally taking us through into the future. As I said, and as we have heard from a number of our speakers, for many decades an airport was proposed, an airport was discussed, and finally, under the Abbott government, the work is now happening. It is certainly a project that the rest of the world will be watching.


Turning to the statistics in relation to the number of passenger trips, for example, 54 million passenger trips are forecast to go unmet at Kingsford Smith airport by 2060 unless another airport is built in Sydney. If we forgo those passenger trips, can you imagine the adverse consequences to our economy?—the loss of the tourism dollar, the loss of purchasing power, the loss of employment. Grabbing hold of those 54 million passenger trips is exactly what we want to do under this government, and that is why we are making the concrete decision to go ahead and build the Badgerys Creek airport.


In terms of the additional infrastructure that is going to be needed, this is a government that is going to ensure that it is a case of roads first and the airport second, because we want to ensure that the airport is a success right from the very start. What does that ultimately mean? It means that thousands of good jobs and better local roads will be delivered well before that first plane taxis down that runway. And what are we looking at in terms of that road infrastructure build? Fourteen intersections, eight kilometres of road and 10 kilometres of shared paths have already been built this year alone. That is absolutely amazing. The airport is going to create economic and employment benefits then be a catalyst for further growth. The analysis undertaken by Ernst & Young found that an airport at Badgerys Creek has the potential to generate 24.6 billion in direct expenditure by 2060. It also found that an airport at Badgerys Creek could potentially contribute a $23.9 billion increase in gross domestic product to the national economy. Again, we are talking about a project that is going to have a huge economic impact on our nation.


This project will be the single-largest job creator in Western Sydney. We are very proud of that as the Abbott government. We said that we wanted to create jobs for Australians. We said that we wanted to be the government that built the infrastructure today for everybody to use tomorrow. That is exactly what we are doing.


With the road infrastructure to date, significant progress has been made on the projects. This is included in the $3.6 billion Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan—$3.6 billion is being injected into Western Sydney by this government under this plan. As you know, the Prime Minister literally broke the ground on the Bringelly Road on 20 January 2015. We have also seen the commencement of construction on the Werrington Arterial Road in March 2015. 


But we do not stop there. The Local Roads Package has also commenced, with $32.4 million being allocated across seven projects under round 1, and submissions for round 2 will be invited in mid-2015. Then we have construction on the Northern Road, which is expected to begin in late 2015, and construction on the new motorway connecting the M7 to the Northern Road motorway is expected to commence in 2019. So again, the benefits of this project are already being seen with the start of construction of road upgrades to support the new proposed airport. 


As I have said, the new airport in Western Sydney is part of the coalition government's investment in the infrastructure for the 21st century, and it is going to generate thousands of jobs and provide a huge economic boost that is going to give us economic growth in Western Sydney. And then of course we have those flow-on effects. It will be a catalyst for investment—investments in education, science, research and aeronautical industries. 


In their contributions, a number of the previous speakers referred to high-speed rail. I would like to make some comments in relation to high-speed rail. The Australian government continues to explore what role high-speed rail could play as part of Australia's long-term transport planning. There is no doubt Australia will need additional transport capacity in the future to meet our growing population's demands for travel. In planning to meet this demand—and this is where a number of our speakers failed to consider other forms of transport—we do need to consider all forms of transport modes, which include aviation, road, conventional rail and high-speed rail. We should not just limit ourselves to looking at high-speed rail, because what we need to do in our considerations is to determine the best approach for our unique conditions and then we need to optimise the benefits for our regions.


In terms of some costings that have been undertaken, the 2013 High Speed Rail Study Phase 2 found that it would cost approximately $114 billion to construct a line between Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane, with construction best staged over three decades and commencing with the Sydney to Canberra section in 2027. 


The same study found that the cost of connecting Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne was approximately $50 billion. They are huge amounts of money that we are talking about here. Whilst I certainly appreciate that a high-speed rail is a priority for the Australian Greens in particular—and we have certainly heard from Senator Rice and Senator Rhiannon in that regard—it is not the subject of the bill that we are referring to and it does not replace the need for an airport in Western Sydney.


Western Sydney has a population of over two million people. That is almost the size of Brisbane. As the population continues to grow, we must provide the appropriate infrastructure a region of that size warrants. Currently, around 30 per cent of workers living in Western Sydney commute well outside their region to get to work. This has an economic as well as a personal and a family impact. Then we have a look at the projections. Where are we going? Projections indicate that, by 2041, a further one million people will live in Western Sydney; and, in the next 20 years, Western Sydney will account for two-thirds of Sydney's population growth but only one-third of jobs. So Western Sydney airport will be a catalyst for growth. It will be a catalyst for investment and it will be a catalyst for jobs in Western Sydney.


The Airports Amendment Bill 2015 is going to amend the Airports Act 1996 to provide for the creation of an airport plan for the proposed Western Sydney airport, recognising that the airport will be a greenfield development that requires a unique process. The Airports Act provides the framework to manage and operate Australia's federally leased airports like Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. The airport plan will authorise the initial development and specify the Australian government's requirements for the airport. 


Importantly, the bill recognises that the environmental assessment process currently underway for the airport is a key part of the approvals process. The bill confers an approval function on the environment minister in relation to environmental matters. The bill will require the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development to incorporate into the airport plan any environmental conditions imposed by the Minister for the Environment following completion of the environmental impact statement. 


Preparation of a new and robust environmental impact statement is underway, and the community will have an opportunity to have a say on the draft environmental impact statement later this year. Once the airport plan envisaged under this act is in place, no further planning or development approvals will be required prior to initial construction commencing 


It will enable detailed design and construction planning to commence as soon as possible after contract signature.


The bill also includes measures that would help the government consider alternative operators, should Sydney Airport group turn down an offer to develop and operate the proposed airport. Under the 2002 sale agreement for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, the owners of Sydney airport have a right of first refusal to develop and operate a second major airport within 100 kilometres of Sydney's centre. If they decline to exercise the right, the Commonwealth is open to looking at other operators, or to developing the site itself, provided it is done on the same terms. However, the Airports Act currently effectively prevents the Commonwealth from taking either of these actions in the event that the Sydney Airport Group declines to accept the offer. Section 18 of the Airports Act requires that the airport lessee companies for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and any airport site declared to be 'Sydney West Airport', as it is referred to in the Airports Act, must be subsidiaries of the same company. This is a legacy provision from the Airports Act as originally passed in 1996.


The bill removes the requirement of common ownership, providing the Commonwealth with the commercial flexibility to deal with third parties, or to develop the airport itself if required. The bill also removes the airport cross-ownership restrictions currently placed on Sydney West Airport. These restrictions prevent cross-ownership of more than 15 per cent between Melbourne, Brisbane or Perth airports and a new airport at Badgerys Creek. The amendment will help maximise the success of any market offering in the event that Sydney Airport Group chooses not to exercise an option to develop and operate the airport. The bill also contain some mechanical provisions to facilitate declaration of the airport site and other preparatory work.


In closing, this is the culmination of decades and decades of discussion. What has been decades of discussion under the Abbott coalition government has finally come to a decision. That decision was announced on 15 April 2014, when we said that the site for Western Sydney's new airport would be at Badgerys Creek. We said that if we were elected to govern, we wanted to be the government that built the infrastructure for tomorrow. We wanted to be the government that takes Australia into the 21st century. We said that we wanted to be a government that creates jobs for Australians today but also ensures that those jobs flow on to become the jobs for Australians well into the future. And that is exactly what we are seeing with the Sydney West Airport. As I have said, we are looking at a multibillion dollar boost to our economy. On top of that, we are looking at the creation of approximately 8,000 jobs. That is an absolutely fantastic package of support for Australians. And these benefits are already being seen with the start of construction of road upgrades to support the new airport. But on top of that, this is going to be a catalyst, going forward, for investment in so many things—investment in education, investment in science and in research, and investment in aeronautical industries.


I have listened very carefully to the debate and I thank those on the opposition benches for their support for this bill. I certainly commend the bill to the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that this bill be now read a second time.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2015-06-24,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (19:20):  In the last week, Australians may have read about the goings on at a company called IOOF. This is a company that has $150 billion worth of funds under management and some 650,000 clients. It is the sixth biggest financial planning company in this country. But today there is a stain on IOOF. As if Australians have not been sickened enough by the dodgy financial practices of some at the CBA, Macquarie Private Wealth and the NAB, we now have very concerning allegations of insider trading, front running and even cheating on exams—and instead of reporting these instances to the corporate regulator, ASIC, it was suggested that a donation be made to a charity. IOOF's Research Division provides independent research for the groups 1,120 member-strong financial planning network on many listed stocks and research reports on thousands of managed funds. The planners read these reports and go out to advise their clients.


With any organisation, and particularly one as large as IOOF, one would expect the highest standards, the highest ethics and a reputation beyond reproach. Tonight I will provide evidence that at IOOF there was no internal control policy for the production, editing and dissemination of research reports; no conflict-of-interest policy relating to such reports; and no share trading policy. What is meant by 'front running'? It is described as 'a practice by market makers of dealing on advance information provided by their brokers and investment analysts before their clients have been given the information'.


Tonight I name the head of research at Bridges, Peter Hilton, as a person who allegedly engaged in front running when he conducted trades on at least 53 occasions over some 20 years. A major part of his role is the dissemination of research to the Bridges network, including recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. I will give some examples. In 2009 there was a potential breach assessment report in the research unit. It was investigated by Rob Urwin, head of investigations. Mr Hilton was questioned on his trading activities, including management of some Questor funds. Questor is a subsidiary of IOOF. I quote from notes taken at a meeting between Rob Urwin, head of investigations, and Gary Riordan, group general counsel, with Peter Hilton. Mr Urwin said:


With regards to the toll trade, I explained that an update Research was sent to the network on 27 August 2009—Maintain Buy. Peter explained that the stock was already a BUY, so an unchanged recommendation ought not trigger the Front Running issue. I explained to Peter that a Research report was given to the network and it was based on update information. Peter was the author of the report. Shirlene placed an order to BUY Toll on the 26 August 2008. Peter advised that he assumed that the order would not be executed until after the embargo period had expired. I explained to Peter the process undertaken by the Responsible Executive of his or her delegate to review staff orders against the embargo list. I advised that it was impossible to put a hold on the order as the Research report has not been disseminated to the network.


As a result of that investigation and the questioning of Peter Hilton he was issued with a warning letter dated 19 May 2009. It was headed, 'First and final warning'. That letter, signed by Michael Carter, who is head of wealth management, said in part:


I have considered your response and it is deemed that your behaviour and actions warrant formal warning. In general if you are to continue in this role, your performance/behaviour needs to improve along with your ability to achieve set goals and demonstrate leadership qualities.


It then listed three expectations. Following that, this line was included:


Please be aware that failure to improve and maintain adequate improvement in the above areas may result in immediate termination of employment.


So this was considered a serious enough breach to warrant threatened dismissal by IOOF, but they did not report this to ASIC. Unbelievably, Peter Hilton was later promoted within the company.


I also have in my possession documents which are compliance breaches by him, where it is alleged he had junior staff cheat on training and compliance exams on his behalf. This results in a final warning, issued on 1 May 2014, where he is told that another breach would result in his dismissal. So that is two warnings to Mr Peter Hilton.


There also allegations of insider trading. I refer to an email from Andrew Boyd, human resources manager, to Danielle Corcoran and Rob Urwin on 22 May, 2009 titled 'Edward Youds—trading ETC'. ETC is the name of the company. I quote:


Darren Sheen and myself have just met with Edward and delivered his first and final warning related to the inappropriate share trading matter. Edward has reviewed and signed the warning and I have placed the document on his personal file. Rob Urwin will facilitate Edward's retraining of the various codes and policies and Edward will ultimately donate the proceeds of profit from the sale of the ETC shares to a charity.


A year later Youds left IOOF. Three minutes later, in another email that Rob Urwin sent to Gary Riordan, he said that he had organised a meeting with Michael Carter to discuss Peter Hilton, and 'ideally I want to go the same way as this example', which I and most people would take to mean a donation to charity or a final warning.


IOOF said on 22 June that it stood by its compliance record. Today it has backtracked and has engaged PwC to commence an independent review of the IOOF group regulatory breach, reporting policy and procedures, and it will inform APRA and ASIC of the outcome. Talk about closing the gate after the horse has bolted! ASIC is now investigating whether there are breaches.


I can show you a document where the chairman, Roger Sexton, and two directors of IOOF were alerted in early February this year that there were breaches of common law, insider trading, front running, false representation of model performance figures, research processes which are not ASIC compliant and breaches of ASIC regulatory guidelines and legislation. There is a black cloud hanging over IOOF.


Here are my questions to those in control of IOOF. To the chairman and directors: why did you not act when you were written to by the whistleblower and provided with the evidence of the breaches? You have been aware of some of them. To CEO Chris Kelaher: you were also given evidence about cheating and faulty research reports, but you allowed Peter Hilton to remain in his position until the media started asking questions. Peter Hilton was allegedly involved in illegal activity dating back to 1995. Why was he allowed to remain in his position and not be reported to ASIC? To Rob Urwin, head of investigations: you allowed this to stay internal. Is there anything else you want to tell us? I would like more details on the investigation you were talking about, which is board related, when you met with the whistleblower over a beer on 12 December. You said the following:


When you talk to someone in the research team, you're a close tight team. You don't just talk to the person that you want to talk to, you talk to everyone else as well. And you try and get inconsistencies in their stories. By the time you get to who you really want to talk to you've got a lot of mud going like that. And that's what I'm doing with this other one, and believe me, it's big. If you're still around mate when this one comes out.


The whistleblower said, 'Okay, but this investigation isn't research related.' Rob Urwin then said, 'It's board related. Sorry, mate.'


Danielle Corcoran, company secretary and head of human resources, has treated the whistleblower badly. She gave Peter Hilton a first and final warning, yet sacked the whistleblower.


To Tim Gunning: you now run Ord Minnett, which is controlled by IOOF. You went there after running Commonwealth Financial Planning during the scandal. I want to talk to you about media reports last year that you used a loophole to reap fees that would otherwise have been against the law under FoFA rules banning conflicted remuneration.


Earlier today in this place a motion calling on the federal government to establish a royal commission into the financial planning industry was defeated. I understand the reasons why the government did not support the motion, but I did support it because I have been advocating for it for five years or more. What I have detailed tonight and what has been detailed in Fairfax media articles in recent days reinforces the fact that the financial advice industry has not learnt its lesson. While these firms continue to flout the law, I will stand up in this place and highlight their wrongdoings.


A warning to these companies: do not do the wrong thing, because you have good, decent people working for you, who will no doubt tip off the media or send documents to my office like the documents which I have received this week. People work hard to save their money. They rely on good financial advice to invest their money safely, not for it to be gambled with. I find it amazing that, when someone is carrying out insider trading and makes a profit, it is not reported to ASIC—let's donate it to a charity and then suggest the next person does the same. This is wrong and these people need to lift their game. No doubt in the near future the Economics References Committee, chaired by Senator Dastyari, will be talking to these people and we can get some questions answered.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  And a fine job he does.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Thank you, Senator Collins. There are a lot more questions. There are always two sides to a story and I will be very keen to hear the story from IOOF and others I have mentioned tonight. Every issue I have raised tonight is backed up by a document or clear evidence in writing—and I make no apology for doing such.
