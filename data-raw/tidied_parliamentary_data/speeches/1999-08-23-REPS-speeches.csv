"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1999-08-23,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, I present the committee's report entitled, Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia's annual report for 1997-98 , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I am pleased to table the latest report of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration into one of our most important financial institutions, the Reserve Bank of Australia. Again, this report is a unanimous one and is based on our public hearing with the bank in June, which was one of the committee's biannual meetings with the bank. These hearings are an integral part of the committee's work and the bank's public accountability strategy.
The performance of the Australian economy over the past year has been impressive. Two years after the Asian crisis first broke and despite a global economic slowdown, the economy continues to show growth rates exceeding four per cent and exceptionally low inflation. Unemployment rates are coming down and seem likely to break the seven per cent barrier this year. The Reserve Bank's steady, deliberate approach to monetary policy coupled with the federal government's financial management deserve much credit for this success. Our report elaborates on this success and presents the bank's view on a number of issues, especially with regard to the role of monetary policy in the maintenance of the conditions for sustainable growth. The report contains information about the impact of tax reform, Australia's links with the US business 
 cycle, business investment, the household savings ratio, employment, the current account deficit and Y2K and financial system stability.
While the economic news contained in this report is generally very good, the committee has taken note of the bank's warning that the low level of household savings in Australia could jeopardise future economic growth and recommends that the government give appropriate attention to this matter. The bank's research has shown that Australia's household savings ratio has declined substantially over the past two decades. It is currently at 0.4 per cent, and it is well below the 12 per cent average that prevailed in the early 1980s. March ABS figures reveal that, over the past four years, the level of household debt in Australia has increased by nearly 50 per cent to average over $20,000 per person.
I would now like to turn to another subject which received a fair amount of attention at our June meeting—bank fees and profits. When the committee met with the bank in December last year, we asked the bank to compile some trend data on bank fees and charges, as there was a perception in the community that these were being raised to offset some income reductions banks are experiencing due to an interest margin squeeze resulting from increased competition in the lending market. Prior to the committee's hearing with the bank in June, reports of the results of a KPMG survey lent credence to this perception, and the intense publicity which ensued guaranteed the bank's study on the subject—released two days before the public hearing—would be noticed and appreciated for being a worthy and timely contribution to the debate on the subject. I do not propose to go into the detail of the bank's study and the discussions which took place on this matter. These are detailed in the report. I will say, though, that the committee accepts the broad findings of the Reserve Bank that the average borrowing bank customer has more benefited from the decline in lending rates than suffered from increases in bank fees and charges.
We have since been looking at recent revelations about the `cash for comments' 
 publicity arrangements between a radio commentator and the Australian Bankers Association. These revelations have only strengthened the committee's determination to pursue its investigation into bank fees and charges. Despite the recent attempt at a public apology by the chairman of the ABA on behalf of the banking industry, the committee needs more to convince it that the industry has committed itself to any meaningful reforms. While the committee has deferred for the moment conducting a specific inquiry into this matter, it will be following with great interest the outcomes of the various inquiries into the Laws-ABA affair.
Finally, I would like to thank the Reserve Bank, especially the governor, Mr Ian Macfarlane, and all members of the committee, particularly the deputy chairman, Mr Greg Wilton, and our secretariat staff, Bev Forbes and Shelley McInnes, for their contributions to the hearing and to this report. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee</title>",Committees,0,1,speech
"Wilton, Greg, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—I too would like to commend the responsible and mature approach the Reserve Bank continues to adopt towards the management of monetary policy in this country. However, this bank legitimately and understandably continues to express concern at an issue of national significance that the member for Werriwa, others on this side of the House and I have canvassed over some time. That issue is the fall in the household savings ratio.
While we have seen a rise in public savings, this has been at the expense of private savings. This government cannot continue to cut, for example, child-care funding of millions of dollars, on the one hand, while simultaneously forcing private citizens, on the other hand, to pay for their own savings without generating what the Governor of the Reserve Bank has referred to as a `possible ailment with the potential to bring Australia's economic growth to a halt'. People not only are saving less but are concomitantly spending more. Household debt in Australia has increased by over 13 per cent in the year to March. While this is not dissimilar to levels in other Western democracies, the RBA stated 
 in its semi-annual statement in May of this year:
. . . a continued period of rapid growth in household credit could generate concern, given that households will have to service their higher debt levels out of nominal incomes that are growing at a much slower rate than in . . . the 1970s and 1980s.
As I cited at paragraph 2.36 of the review, the ABS March quarter financial accounts released on 28 June of this year demonstrated that Australian household debt grew by $10.8 billion during the March quarter. In June 1995, Australian households owned $258 billion or about $14,276 per person. By June 1998, households owed $357.5 billion or around $19,000 per person. By March this year, the total level of household debt had risen to $387 billion or an average of $20,500 per person.
The governor cited three specific ways that the trend in household savings could jeopardise Australian growth. The first was the possibility of inadequate provision for retirement, which would place an excessive burden on future taxpayers. The bank cites a solution to this as lying primarily within improving retirement income policies. While the governor did not specifically agree that a new pre-retirement savings plan was needed, I would nevertheless urge him and the bank to reconsider this view and urge the government to countenance extending and enhancing the existing superannuation guarantee levy arrangements.
The second problem relating to falling household savings ratios is that they could lead to an increase in the current account. A larger current account results from a decline in aggregate savings relative to aggregate investment. Australia is a small trading nation and, as the member for Werriwa has attested on many occasions, we cannot go on growing faster than our trading partners without simultaneously incurring a problem on our external account. The transfer from public to private savings—that is, from government to business savings—for the reasons outlined earlier, masks the underlying seriousness of this problem. 
The third possible problem cited by the bank is that increased indebtedness makes the housing sector more vulnerable when rates rise. While the bank cannot target monetary policy to individual borrowing patterns, the bank has acknowledged that increased indebtedness means that interest rates would not need to be raised as much as was formerly the case to achieve a given macro-economic effect. It may well be that Australians are not, by nature, great savers and that we are great spenders. This antisavings mind-set needs to be changed. The bank fees and charges issue raised by the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, the member for Wannon, and the closure of regional rural banks does nothing to endear banks in the minds of Australians and encourage them to save. I thank the secretariat and the committee for their work on this report.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee</title>",Committees,0,1,speech
"Southcott, Andrew, MP",LP,1999-08-23,"—It is a pleasure to speak on this report from the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration. I thank the chairman, the member for Wannon, and deputy chairman, the member for Isaacs, for their work, and also the secretariat for all the work they have put in. I also thank the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank for their help. I would like to touch on a couple of topics that are dealt with in the report. The report is essentially based on our semi-annual meeting with the Reserve Bank governor. The first topic is that of tax reform. In both our December 1998 and June 1999 hearings, the governor responded that the long-term effects of tax reform would be good. Specifically, he recognised that shifting from taxation of income to taxation of sales would be beneficial; it would help to address the very high marginal tax rates that apply in Australia on quite moderate incomes.
As to whether the income tax cuts from 1 July 2000 will come at a time when the economy may be overheating, the Reserve Bank—based on their economic forecast—expect a slowing of consumption and growth next year. So the fiscal stimulus of the income tax cuts will occur at a time when the Australian economy is in a good position to 
 handle it. The inflationary impact of a GST gained some prominence in the newspapers just last week. In a recent speech, the governor said that the Reserve Bank had no way of knowing how businesses and individuals would react. I do not think we should overplay that, however. We should also remember that, in the last two hearings with the committee, the Governor of the Reserve Bank emphasised that the GST per se has no implications for monetary policy—that is, it is seen as a one-off price rise—and the important thing is that the price rise does not get embedded into people's expectations.
Experience in OECD countries in the 1970s and 1980s with introducing a VAT or GST was that the price rise due to those consumption taxes was a one-off effect. The point to make is that most of those consumption taxes were introduced in high inflationary times and yet they did not lead to a building in of inflationary expectations. The important policy implication is that the one-off price rise does not become embedded in inflation expectations. It is important to emphasise—as the Leader of the Opposition did in a question to the Prime Minister earlier this year—that the Reserve Bank has said that, when Japan raised its consumption tax from three per cent to 10 per cent, the relation that it had to Japan's continuing economic slump was due to its being an inappropriate fiscal contraction rather than a consumption tax per se.
The committee noted that business investment had declined dramatically in the December quarter. This issue having been raised, the bank's response was that they felt it was important not just to look at one quarter's figures but at business investment over the whole economic expansion since 1991. They felt that, over that period, business investment had been strong.
Lastly, I would like to talk about savings and the committee's thoughts on it. The committee noted with concern that household savings were 0.4 per cent in the March quarter. I think more recently, since we have met with the Reserve Bank, in the June quarter it has been 0.2 per cent. That compares with a figure of 12 per cent in the early 1980s. The committee also noted with con 
 cern the growth in household debt. As the Reserve Bank governor outlined, there are three problems with declining household savings: firstly, that you may have an inadequate provision for retirement; secondly, it may lead to an increase in the current account deficit; and, thirdly, it means that households are more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates. As highlighted in the latest edition of BRW in an article entitled `US savings—not drowning, waving', this is a complex issue, and you do have to look at national savings overall.
Personal savings are just one part of the national income accounting framework, and what is ignored is the capital accumulation that is no doubt going on. The United States, for example, has very similar problems. In the last six months, it has had personal savings levels of minus 0.9 per cent of GDP. With the growth in personal debt, they noted that interest payments back in the eighties were nine per cent of after-tax household income; because of lower interest rates, they are now six per cent. So people are able to service this growth of debt—but that is because interest rates are low. This is an issue which is still controversial.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee</title>",Committees,0,1,speech
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—The Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration has played a useful role in scrutinising the performance of the Reserve Bank. This process, if you like, is something of a parliamentary report card on the work of the Reserve Bank of Australia, and that is a very healthy process indeed. On that report card, the bank would receive an A for the quality of its pre-emptive monetary policy settings. It would receive a B-plus for improving transparency in its work. There have been many changes to monetary policy in Australia in the past decade. The bank is playing a very useful role in explaining those changes to financial markets and the public at large. Its performance on transparency has certainly improved in recent years.
The main focus of this committee report is its sole recommendation, which is worth recording in the Hansard of this debate. The recommendation reads:
Whilst recognising that the majority of Government economic policy settings are sound, the Committee notes the concern about the level of household savings and recommends the Government give appropriate attention to this issue.
This is a most timely recommendation. In the monetary statement of the Reserve Bank, a great deal of attention has been given to the decline in household savings in Australia. A sensible government would note that that sort of mention in the bank's report sends an alert signal to policy makers in this parliament—and that something needs to be done to improve the level of household savings in Australia.
There are four pillars to a national savings policy. Three of those pillars are: government savings, and they have moved into a surplus position in recent years; retirement savings, which are headed in the right direction because of the Keating government's outstanding reforms on superannuation; and corporate savings, which have been steady in Australia in recent times. The fourth pillar, though, household savings, has a number of difficulties. Australian households have moved into a higher level of indebtedness. For every dollar of disposable income held by the average Australian household, 90c is now owed in debt. Earlier this decade, this amount was just 50c. So, in the space of a few years, Australians have almost doubled their exposure to debt. As debt has risen, household savings have gone through the floor. Ten years ago, Australians saved nine cents in every dollar of their disposable income. This has now fallen to less than half a cent.
This is the great challenge for Australia: to lift its household savings, and thereby lift its national savings. Lifting our national savings is the best way to make Australia secure in the global economy—to lower our exposure to international financial turbulence and to lower our exposure to international financial markets. Indeed, a country which refuses to save can never be secure in the international economy.
This government has failed to improve national savings, despite all its promises prior to the 1996 federal election. The trend generally has been to improve government savings but at a cost to household savings. If the 
 government cuts back on education, health and child-care outlays, as this government has done, it will surely lift its own savings, but at a cost to household savings. Australians just will not go without education, health and child care. They will spend more of their own money on those basics of life, thereby having less money available for their household savings budget. That indeed has been the shift in recent years—that for every extra dollar of government savings there has been a dollar decline in household savings. The relationship is very plain and easy to understand.
This government has no policy for household savings. The Reserve Bank has alerted its concern in its statement. The committee has alerted its concern with this recommendation. Development by the government of a household savings strategy is, indeed, overdue. Some of the options in this area are not easy: they require further changes to Australia's taxation policies and they require some structural reform of the welfare system. But we do need to become a nation of savers—not just a nation of healthy spenders but a nation of forward savers. That is the best security we can have in the global economy.
The government has a lot of work to do on welfare policy and taxation policy to improve household savings. It needs to give Australians the incentives and the security they require in that regard. Hopefully, the government will respond to this recommendation with a household savings policy. I am sure that would be welcomed not just by the Reserve Bank of Australia but by everyone interested in stronger financial outcomes.

I am sure that would be welcomed not just by the Reserve Bank of Australia but by everyone interested in stronger financial outcomes.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 notes the high number of self-funded retirees in Australia who are struggling financially at the present time;
(2)	 recognises that the Howard Government's GST will create greater financial hardship for thousands of self-funded retirees because it taxes the essentials of life, will make people receiving low fixed incomes from superannuation or other measures pay the same rate of tax as people on higher incomes and offers inadequate financial compensation; and
(3)	 investigates other means of offering financial assistance and incentive to struggling self-funded retirees distinct from a Goods and Services Tax.
One of the truisms about this job is that each of us in this house, on either side of politics, encounters constituents with problems that are the same, whatever parts of Australia we represent. For example, we have constituents with problems regarding immigration or associated with social security payments. Each of us encounters constituents with these problems, almost on a daily basis. Another prob 
 lem area that I know we all come across regards the financial plight of many self-funded retirees. Time and time again, self-funded retirees have contacted my office, seeking my assistance and raising their concerns because of the serious financial difficulties that they are experiencing.
We all know that, even in these so-called economic boom times, many self-funded retirees are struggling to make ends meet. It is not a new problem. It is not a problem that gets headlines, but it is a very serious problem that successive governments have wrestled with—that we as members of parliament have all wrestled with—and that I believe has never been adequately addressed. It is my belief that it is also about to get a whole lot worse with the introduction of the Howard government's GST.
I know that the speaker on the government side will invariably disagree with me and will talk about what the coalition government has done to supposedly help our self-funded retirees and how its taxation reforms are the Holy Grail for this section of the Australian population. I know that is his prerogative, but I do hope—probably in vain—that the member might display a little more open thinking than that and address this problem in its full context. I am the first to admit that self-funded retirees did not begin struggling financially under the current government. I am not saying that the previous Labor administration had all the answers to solving this problem; quite obviously it did not.
However, looking at the government's plans for the new tax system, not only is this problem set to continue but it will only be exacerbated by these badly prepared and ill-conceived reforms. We need to come up with a taxation solution for self-funded retirees that is tailor-made to their requirements, their problems, their needs and their future. We need to offer self-funded retirees a taxation solution that recognises the outstanding contribution that they have made to our society throughout their working lives, that recognises their never having called on the government for financial assistance and that recognises that they have paid their fair share 
 of taxes over the years while still managing to save for their future.
Unfortunately, it needs to be said that the GST and the inadequate compensation that is being offered to them in the government's tax package does none of these things and will not improve the lot of self-funded retirees—not by a long shot. The fundamental problem facing many self-funded retirees—and ironically even more so with the low interest rate climate currently in Australia—is the difficulty they have in stretching their savings to maintain the quality and standard of life that they enjoyed when they were in the work force.
As it is at the moment, many self-funded retirees are eating into their hard-earned savings in order to keep their noses above water. This is not only a deplorable state of affairs for them and for our communities but also bad news for the country. Australia has a shocking recent track record when it comes to the level of household savings maintained by its population. We need people saving more, not less. Subsequently, governments need to create an environment for self-funded retirees where saving money is easier and not where it is impossible.
Unfortunately, the GST will make the savings of self-funded retirees disappear even more quickly. To watch this ominous tax grow larger and larger on the horizon every day must be absolutely terrifying for self-funded retirees around Australia. Despite the Prime Minister's repeated assertions about the GST not leaving any Australians worse off, many self-funded retirees will quite obviously be left hurting by the tax package, despite the levels of compensation the government has offered them to make up for the effects of the new tax system.
The maximum level of $3,000 worth of compensation will not protect most self-funded retirees anywhere near enough from the very real pain the GST will bring to them. Take single self-funded retirees who are earning private incomes of $10,000 a year, for example. Under the government's tax package they will lose $1.37 a week. A self-funded retiree couple on $20,000 a year loses 84c a week. For self-funded retirees struggling to 
 make ends meet these are important figures, and they are very distressed by them.
The advent of the GST will immediately devalue the savings of self-funded retirees because, as we all know, savings—especially for this section of our society—are future consumption. With a GST the price of the necessities of life will go up. Most self-funded retirees use their hard-earned savings on buying just that—the necessities of life.
Self-funded retirees will not be out there buying all of those computers, TVs, videos and capital goods that the government likes to talk about dropping in price when the GST kicks in. These people are at the latter stages of their lives. They have already set themselves up in their homes for their retirement. Their furniture, cars and all of their other consumer goods have already been purchased. The purchases they will be making will be far more mundane. They will be buying bus and train tickets. They will be buying food. They will be paying utility bills. They will be perhaps purchasing a few of the little luxuries that they have worked so hard in their lives to enjoy—that is, a ticket to the movies or maybe a round of golf—and who would deny them that?
But these goods and services are not currently taxed under the wholesale sales tax system, and this is something that the Howard government's GST reforms completely ignore—or at least appear to ignore, judging by the amount of compensation that has been offered to self-funded retirees. With this in mind, the government's blanket argument that the GST will increase prices by only 1.9 per cent is absolutely false. For self-funded retirees the story is more likely to be in the area of seven to eight per cent for many of the goods and services that they use and purchase day in and day out.
The stinging unfairness about the Howard government's GST is that it changes the tax goalposts for self-funded retirees after they have worked all their lives to reach and enjoy a certain standard of living in their retirement. Mr Raymond Bricknell, National President of the Australian Investors Association, made a similar point at the Senate hearings into the 
 new tax system. I quote what Mr Bricknell said at that Senate inquiry:
I think it is unfair. Where is the case for suddenly taxing those people again? It really is irrelevant whether they retired before or after the nominated pensionable age, because the reality is that a person who gets to retire at 55 or 60 years has not got to that stage by having an easy life. They work extraordinarily hard and extraordinarily long hours. I have never met anybody who has been able to retire at 55 who has not really earned that retirement.
He went on to say:
Now, having earned the right to retire earlier, they have effectively said, `We'll compress our working lives into a shorter period and retire earlier, and then hopefully get some rewards for that. You know, the time that we didn't have with our children, et cetera, we might have with our grandchildren,' and then they expect a certain standard of living because they make the decision to retire at a certain level of savings.
Once they have retired with that level of savings and left their businesses, sold their businesses, left their employment—whatever—there is no way in the world they can go and top it up again if someone comes along and says, `We're going to take seven or eight per cent off the top of your savings.'
So, if the government is going to introduce a taxation system that really does have the effect of taking seven or eight per cent off the top of the savings of people in that category—
to which I have referred—
then it ought to compensate them to the full amount so that they can just stay where they are now. No-one is asking for a better deal; just leave them where they are now.
Mr Bricknell has hit the nail on the head with these observations. Self-funded retirees are not asking for a better deal than any other Australian with regard to the taxation system. They are not asking for preferential treatment; they are asking for fair treatment, but the Howard government's GST will not treat them fairly. It will leave their finances unequivocally battered and bruised. As I said, I think we need to go back to the drawing board and design a taxation system that fits the needs of self-funded retirees and gives them equity with regard to their financial situation.
Indeed, as the third point in my motion indicates, for those self-funded retirees who 
 are doing it tough financially, I would argue it is time we investigated other ways and means of offering financial incentives and assistance to them at this time in their lives, and that does not include lumbering them with a goods and services tax. To quote Mr Bricknell again:
Why should people have their entire standard of living that they have worked and saved for all their lives reduced simply because a GST is introduced after they retire, or just before they retire. What have they done to deserve retrospective retribution?
Indeed, it is time that we collectively put our heads together and truly offered self-funded retirees, especially those within our communities who are struggling financially, a fair go.

"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,1999-08-23,"—I do not think anybody on this side of the House would argue that the member for Prospect is not a good local member. The member for Prospect uses every opportunity to raise issues on behalf of her constituents, and I accept that she rises in this place on those issues in good faith. I also acknowledge that the member for Prospect was a parliamentary secretary on the front bench of the Labor Party when Mr Keating was Prime Minister and therefore knows full well that no government has done more for independent retirees, self-funded retirees, than the Howard government since 1996.
The independent retiree movement started on the Sunshine Coast in 1990 and, at that time, my electorate took in the whole of the Sunshine Coast. It is a growth area, a retirement area, where 1,400 people a month are being added to my electoral rolls. The majority of those are retirees, so it is little wonder that the independent retiree movement started in that area. It was at about the same time that Grey Power was becoming a movement. The independent retiree movement has continued on, and grown from strength to strength as a movement—and, I might say, an apolitical movement. They speak to people on both sides of the House. When the member for Prospect was in government—she is now 
 in opposition, of course—Maureen Kingston, who was in my electorate at the time, was the national president for the Association of Independent Retirees. She achieved many benefits for the independent retirees of Australia.
This motion is about compensation for independent retirees for the introduction of the GST. I remind the House that the introduction of a GST is also a replacement tax for many other taxes. The introduction of the GST will enable the government to have a radical reduction in income taxes. Let us go back to 1993 when, with the election of the Keating government with Keating as Prime Minister, we were promised tax cuts. We all know about the l-a-w law tax cuts that Mr Keating promised but which were never delivered. Instead, the Keating government delivered a two per cent increase in the wholesale sales tax—the 10 per cent rate went to 12 per cent, the 20 per cent rate went to 22 per cent and the 30 per cent rate went to 32 per cent. I ask: what compensation was offered to Australia's independent retirees?
—None.
—None. What compensation was offered to pensioners, anybody on fixed incomes? None. As I said, no government has done more for independent retirees than the Howard government. Independent retirees are the nation's savers. They have saved for their own retirement, and this government respects that they have so done. One of the first actions of this government for independent retirees was in the 1998-99 budget when the Treasurer announced that the pensioner tax rebate would be made fully available to self-funded retirees so that they would pay no more in tax than a pensioner on the same income. That was a measure that the independent retirees sought from the inception of their organisation. It was the Howard government that delivered on that commitment. Why shouldn't a person who provides income for their own retirement not get the same tax advantage as a pensioner who receives the same amount of income, and receives it tax free?
We took very seriously the concerns about the adequacy of compensation. Treasury 
 estimated that the increase in the consumer price index would be 1.9 per cent as a result of the introduction of a 10 per cent GST. We were particularly concerned about people on fixed incomes. The Howard government has also addressed these concerns for self-funded retirees. Self-funded retirees, who are taxpayers, will benefit from reduced income tax under our new tax system. As the member for Prospect said, the savings of a self-funded retiree will be diminished because of the inflationary effect of the GST by 1.9 per cent. So there was a need for the government to top up that level of savings for retirees so that they could use that top-up to generate income that they had lost because of the devaluation of their savings.
To protect their value of savings, older Australians aged 60 and over will benefit from the aged persons saving bonus worth up to $2,000. This bonus, together with the self-funded retiree supplementary bonus, can be worth as much as $3,000, tax free, to a self-funded retiree. As I said, the purpose of this bonus was to top up their savings.
In respect of the supplementary bonus, the government will match dollar for dollar the income received from savings and investments. The bonus will also be extended to self-funded retirees who are aged 55 and over. This extension will assist people who have taken early self-funded retirement, and Treasury estimates that up to 210,000 self-funded retirees will benefit from this measure. The benefit will phase out when incomes reach $30,000 per year, but at that level self-funded retirees will benefit from the significant income tax cuts that I mentioned earlier in a package worth more than $12 billion.
Under the new tax system, the pension income test will be eased to allow more self-funded retirees to qualify for a part pension. Couples on incomes of up to $48,000 will be able to receive a part pension from 1 July 2000. About 45,000 extra self-funded retirees will qualify under this measure.
The government has also taken steps to assist self-funded retirees in the area of refundable imputation credits. Distributed profits will be taxed at the marginal rates of individual taxpayers, and this will certainly 
 help low income taxpayers. It is also significant to note that, since the government expanded the Commonwealth seniors health card scheme in January this year, more than 163,000 self-funded retirees of age pension age have become cardholders. The card enables access to cheaper medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which is of valuable benefit in dollar terms to older Australians who have additional health care needs as they get older.
There has been also a very real benefit from the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and the new health fund premium concessions for longstanding members, of whom many are self-funded retirees. I said earlier on that no government has done more to specifically help self-funded retirees, independent retirees, who are the savers of this nation, than the Howard government since 1996.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Self-Funded Retirees</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—In seconding this motion, I would like to begin also by acknowledging the good work also of the honourable member for Prospect in bringing forward this motion about self-funded retirees to the House. In particular, item 3 of the motion states:
. . . investigates other means of offering financial assistance and incentive to struggling self-funded retirees distinct from a Goods and Services Tax.
The issues for self-funded retirees are not new, and I noticed the honourable member for Fairfax said, `The Howard government has been the best. We've done the most for self-funded retirees.' I would like to acknowledge some of the things that the Howard government has done, but I do not think we can rest on our laurels, and that is the whole point.
It is no good saying to self-funded retirees, `Look at what we are doing by way of compensation for the GST,' because these are the people who do not have an opportunity now, by definition, to go back to work. In other words, a young person starting work at age 20 will benefit from the so-called tax cuts that are associated with the GST for the rest of their working life. As the honourable member for Prospect has said, the goalposts have been shifted for self-funded retirees.
In not wanting to deprecate in any way what the honourable member for Fairfax has 
 said, let me give you a couple of examples. Is extra money the highest thing on the agenda of self-funded retirees? Sure, they want to have a reasonable standard of living in their retirement and, having been good savers during their working life, I am sure that they would want and have worked towards a reasonable standard of living. But I would say that, of all the people I meet, whether they are pensioners or self-funded retirees, the one thing they do not want to be is a burden on their kids or anyone else.
I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to other honourable members that I have raised in this parliament, admittedly some time ago, the idea that pensioners and self-funded retirees should be allowed to have burn money—that is, they should be able to set aside their funeral expenses and not have it count in any asset test by this federal government or any other state or local government. That is not a big ask, and it follows through on what I consider to be one of their primary concerns—that is, not to be a burden.
Just as the honourable member for Fairfax perhaps strayed and was a little partisan, I hardly think that the imposition of fees on nursing homes was the best thing for self-funded retirees. This is the only category of people in Australia who are going to be hit for six when they need to have care. It is not when a baby is born, not for kids in the children's hospital, not for teenagers in hospital, not for parents in hospital, but our self-funded retirees—our senior citizens—who are somehow, because of their age, discriminated against, in my view, and have to disproportionately provide for their own level of care. I think that is unfortunate. I know it costs big dollars, but I am saying, in the same spirit as the honourable member for Prospect when she made her point, that we need to investigate other things.
The government, particularly the Prime Minister, are often fond of saying that our health care system is first class. Well, it is in crisis. It is a good system, but it is in crisis. I would say that self-funded retirees would be concerned that there be no gaps in their private health insurance and that some of that $1.5 billion that has gone to maintain the 
 current level of subscription to private health insurance should go to the hospital side of it because these people are going to be the acute hospital care users in our system. They want a first-class service, they want to make sure they have got provision for it and they want to be sure that, when they need the service, they will get the service.
So that is why I think the third point of the honourable member for Prospect's motion is most appropriate. Is mere money the best way of trying to compensate them? All she said—and I seconded the motion so I support it—is that we ought to investigate other options. I would hope that the next government speaker should be able to embrace that proposition.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Self-Funded Retirees</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"May, Margaret, MP",LP,1999-08-23,"—As someone who represents more than 25,000 people aged 65 years and over, many of whom are self-funded retirees, I rise to take issue with this motion by the member for Prospect. It is founded on exactly the same sort of scare tactic that Labor rolled out at the last election and that the people of Australia so clearly rejected. The fact is, Mr Deputy Speaker, this motion is based on the completely false premise that one section of our community—namely, self-funded retirees—will be worse off under the new tax system. This is not the case at all.
The Senate's own independent inquiry into the new tax system, with all the evidence brought before it by the community and other interest groups, could not identify any section of the community that would be worse off. It found that perhaps some people could benefit more than others—families with young children, for example—but our ironclad election commitment that no-one will be worse off stood the immense scrutiny of that Senate inquiry. And, Mr Deputy Speaker, I remind the House that this was before the revised plan, which now sees all basic food exempt, but it delivers exactly the same tax cuts for people on incomes below $50,000 and even better compensation for those on fixed incomes.
Perhaps the member for Prospect is not aware that many self-funded retirees pay tax, and they will join all other Australians in benefiting from the biggest income tax cuts in 
 our nation's history. Of course, Australia's self-funded retirees already pay less tax under the Howard government than they did under Labor, because one of the first things we did was to ensure that self-funded retirees on comparable incomes have the same tax-free threshold as pensioners. We have also extended the Commonwealth seniors health card to more than 220,000 self-funded retirees, so they now have the same access to low cost prescription medicines as pensioners. These were two of the major concerns expressed by the self-funded retirees of McPherson when I worked closely with them while Labor was still in government, and it is a reflection of our commitment to support and encourage self-funded retirees that the Howard government moved swiftly to address these inequities.
There simply is not enough time to list all the policies of the Hawke-Keating years that caused hardship for self-funded retirees and pensioners. The deeming fiasco quickly springs to mind. The uncertainty of the recession took its toll, as did Labor's failure to address inequities in the tax and health systems. And of course, there are the massive increases in indirect taxes that Labor forced on all Australians after the 1993 election campaign when they had actually promised not to increase taxes at all. Over the three years from 1993 to 1996, Labor increased the wholesale sales tax and petrol excise by a massive $10 billion—$10,000 million—and exactly how much compensation did Labor provide for self-funded retirees, or any other Australians for that matter? Not one cent.
Despite window-dressing motions like this one, today's Labor hold self-funded retirees in just as little regard as they did in government. In fact, while I was researching this speech, I tried to find their current policies on self-funded retirees. Their Internet site cautions us that all policies are under consideration, confirming that they really do not have any policies.
With the very wording of this motion, Labor are trying to deny the many problems with the current tax system. They try to pretend that the confusing and ridiculous wholesale sales tax system does not tax many 
 of the essentials of life. The member for Prospect might like to explain how toilet paper, soap and shampoo are not essentials. They are all taxed at the moment under Labor's system, and these essentials will actually be cheaper under the new system. Labor know that but it will not stop them running a nasty scare campaign.
I am a very strong supporter of encouraging and rewarding our self-funded retirees who have worked hard and provided for their own retirement. The Howard government has a track record of doing just that, and our responsible approach to economic management means that we will be in an even better position to do more to assist self-funded retirees in the future.
Instead of running a dishonest scare campaign, the Labor members opposite should stop and think how older Australians feel. How do you think they feel after they worked hard for Australia during the war years only to have Labor leave the nation in massive debt? How do you think they felt when you ran up unemployment to record levels and their grandchildren had little hope of finding work? Like most Australians, self-funded retirees know that we must put Australia first—whether it is a newer, fairer tax system or it is making other decisions in our national interest. That is why the coalition was re-elected last year, and Labor's failure to recognise this is why they remain so completely out of touch almost 12 months later.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Self-Funded Retirees</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—Currently, Australia has only 12 per cent of its population aged 65 or above, and only 340,000 of those are independent retirees with no pension benefit. Over the next 50 years that will rise to 26 per cent, with the greatest effect being in the next two decades while the baby boomers reach maturity. What happens in 50 years will not be a worry to most of us here today, but the policies we implement today will be a worry to many retirees in 50 years. To quote Phillipa Smith, the CEO of the Association of Superannuation Funds:
Australia has the unenviable record of `leading' the world in taxing super, being the only country that taxes superannuation at each stage of its life cycle—contributions, earnings and benefits—and for many there is an additional super surcharge. A 
 key objective in any tax reform exercise should be to reduce this complexity and to move towards a system where only benefits are taxed—not contributions or fund earnings.
What we are talking about today is how the government of the day perceives the independent retirees—as a group that save the government money because they have provided for their own retirement or as a resource that will pay tax to the government. Independent retirees have paid taxes all their lives on what they have earned, and now they find under John Howard's `never ever GST' that they will be paying taxes on what they spend.

"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—A short time ago the environmental impact statement on Sydney's second international airport came down. That environmental impact statement put virtually nothing in the way of Badgerys Creek proceeding as Sydney's second airport. Since then, outside process, the Sydney Airport Corporation and the Tourism Task Force have put up a proposal to use Bankstown airport as a dedicated regional service. The people in the regions of New South Wales do not want it. The people of Bankstown in my electorate do not want it. This proposal says that up to $500 million will be spent converting Bankstown. It would actually cost about $50 million. That money is not the Tourism Task Force's money; it would have to be spent by a federal government.
It is not an effective proposal. Up to 35 per cent of aircraft running regional services might be moved to Bankstown—in effect, 25 per cent. This is no long-term solution to the need for a second airport for Sydney. The people of Bankstown have a general aviation airport employing more than 3,500 people 
 which is crucial to the economy of Bankstown. It is also crucial that this federal government makes a decision to go ahead with Sydney's second airport and does not attempt to load on to the people of Bankstown 25 per cent more of jet aircraft out of Kingsford Smith.

 out of a job and without their entitlements being paid. It is interesting that, whilst the government has announced its policy intentions in this regard, that statement was never able to be made by any minister in the previous Labor government. There were eight accords with the trade union movement over 13 years and on no occasion—
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The question was specifically about why the linkage was drawn between his legislation on industrial relations changes and this proposition. There was nothing else. If he wants to debate—
—The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The comments of the workplace relations minister have been entirely relevant to the question, and I call him.
—On no occasion did the Labor Party, in the eight accords that they had with the trade union movement, commit themselves to a national scheme to look after workers. This demonstrates, as clearly as it ever could be demonstrated, that the one government in recent times that has been prepared to look after workers, whether through higher real wages or more jobs, is on this side of the House.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: the question specifically asked why the minister was linking this proposal to his controversial second wave. He has yet to refer to the second wave and he should be asked to come to the question.
—The member for Brisbane will resume his seat. I was conscious of the question, I was listening to the minister's response and I had no doubt that he would be coming to that point.
—I am very happy to come to that point, Mr Speaker, but it needs to be put in context. Even in the last desperate accord between the ACTU and the ALP back in 1995, they said that, while they were prepared to examine the issue, that was provided that it was desirable and practicable. So they were not even prepared to acknowledge the actual need of workers in this situation. At the last election, the government had a policy in 
 respect of workplace relations known as `More Jobs, Better Pay' and we were committed to introducing that package of reforms. In response, the two things that have happened since we have been in government have been more jobs and better pay, particularly for low income people. We said that we would introduce a policy and we have been undertaking a process of consultation, including with the ACTU, on that policy. That policy provides further protection for employees as well as more job opportunities. Given that that bill is currently before the parliament, it is not unreasonable that we would want to add to it a further protection for workers, namely, a national scheme to provide protection in respect of entitlements.
I said to the Democrats about three weeks ago—as we said during the election and have been saying since—that we would like to have that package of reforms through by the end of this year, with a commencement on 1 January. That is a reasonable and sensible timetable. It also provides the opportunity, as I hope will be provided, for any scheme that we do put up to be the subject of inquiry by the Senate committee. It is looking at workplace relations and this is a workplace relations matter. For heaven's sake, we want to get on with this and this is an appropriate means of doing so.

(2)	 recognises the particular difficulties for people with disabilities and their carers and the need for respite care services and facilities in regions such as Gilmore and Macquarie;
(3)	 welcomes the federal Government's specific commitment of over $1.7 billion to the Commonwealth/State Disability Agreement to assist them in their primary areas of responsibility and to increase the support for carers of people with disabilities; and
(4)	 calls on governments at all levels to cooperate with one another to identify, fund and maintain services and facilities for respite care for people with disabilities and their carers.
Today I speak on a topic paramount to the quality of life desired by many of my constituents in Gilmore. These people are the selfless carers of relatives or friends who have disabilities. As advances in medicine and health care practices increase the lifespan of people who once died young, the need for carers grows. In my lifetime people who were born with different abilities were quickly institutionalised or their families were ostracised for wanting to enjoy them at home. Now we are a more humane society. We recognise people's abilities and their right to life, not just life but quality of life. This government has also recognised the change in thinking and has implemented long-term plans to provide the infrastructure to address future needs.
Firstly, there has been the regime to ensure a buoyant economy, one that is sustainable and one that will produce sufficient funding to embark on a project. This project is to identify and develop appropriate accommodation and services to provide respite to all 
 parties, carers and their charges and to offer choices in accommodation for people with disabilities. However, as this program rolls forward in the planning stage, there are carers and people with disabilities who have needs that right now are unmet.
At a recent meeting in my office with parents, friends and carers of people with a wide range of disabilities, the following issues were highlighted: lack of respite beds for children and adults in Shoalhaven in particular and Gilmore as a whole; no permanent beds available for children or adults; no funding for accessing mainstream vacation care; anomalies such as a physically disabled child with normal intelligence is not eligible for any state assistance from DoCS; and children whose disabilities are not classed as severe often miss out on services.
One of the major reasons for most of Gilmore, especially the Southern Highlands and the Shoalhaven, missing out on these services is the regional nature of the funding packages. These areas are lumped in with the Illawarra. On a town by town basis, there are many places crying for services but, if you average the need across the whole of the Illawarra, the figures do not seem too bad. Funding is directed to supposed peak organisations in Wollongong, and there the money stays. This is not to say that there is no need in Wollongong—there is. However, it is logistically difficult to walk out a door in Wollongong past the line of needy people and lose precious time driving up to 3½ hours south to see someone else and then driving all the way back. The result is that the outlying areas simply do not see the services at all.
I welcome the federal government's commitment of considerable funds to the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. It is imperative that the three levels of government work together to provide services that are appropriate and flexible to meet the need. It is only through cooperation and innovation that together we will improve the quality of life for both the people with disabilities and their carers. At the meeting in April this year between Senator Newman and the state and territory disability ministers, this process began. All parties openly and vigo 
 rously discussed the longstanding severe shortage of services. They agreed that addressing the unmet needs in accommodation and other related services is a shared responsibility and have begun to work together to find solutions.
At the local level, my Labor state colleague and I have agreed to work together to ensure that Shoalhaven, Wingecarribee and the Kiama districts do not miss out on their slice of the services. This cooperative approach with local councils, communities and businesses will provide the launch pad for successful, suitable, flexible and quality services. To those who took the time to fill my office to tell my state colleague and me of the unmet needs in Gilmore, I thank you. You have unleashed the process of change in our area. With your forebearance, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will name those people for their concern: Mr and Mrs Yatras, Mrs Makila, Mr and Mrs Byerley, Ms Walker, Ms Barry, Ms Dowling, Mrs Ashby, Mr and Mrs Griffiths, Mr and Mrs Vassallo-Knapp, Mrs Martin, Mr and Mrs Marsh, Mrs Starr, Mr and Mrs Lester, Mrs Denny and Mr and Mrs Bird. I thank you all for caring about this most important need in the Gilmore electorate.

"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—I am pleased to support this motion moved by the honourable member for Gilmore. I previously supported a similar motion when it was moved by the honourable member for Murray back in 1996. For many years I have had a deep concern for people with disabilities, especially the ageing carers of ageing children with disabilities and the lack of respite and long-term future care. This problem is not confined to a few electorates; it is a national problem. I understand that the Time to Care campaign is being conducted by the National Council on Intellectual Disability. It is organising a national day of protest in Canberra on 1 September, where groups will travel from all states to participate. The NCID's campaign focuses on the huge unmet need for disability services throughout the country and the 
 failure of governments to provide adequate resources.
In a report by the National Council on Intellectual Disability entitled Who Cares, More or Less released this year, it was revealed that 9,700 parents over the age of 65 years are still caring for their sons and daughters with a disability at home. These parents provide constant care for their children and have done so since they were born. They need to be assured that this care will continue throughout their children's lives. These parents save governments millions of dollars per year by caring for their children at home. These people, many aged, need to be assured that their children will receive similar care when they are no longer able to provide it. They need to know that their children will be given every opportunity to gain as much independence as they can cope with while, at the same time, receiving all the care and guidance they require.
I must pay tribute to a group in the Illawarra, the Lobby Group for Aged Parents and their Intellectually Disabled Adult Children, who have worked and lobbied for years to have the critical lack of permanent accommodation for adults with an intellectual disability living with ageing parents recognised and addressed. This need still exists. I must also pay tribute to the Illawarra Disability Trust and the many other disability service providers in the Illawarra region who work tirelessly for the disabled in the region. As well as for the ageing disabled children, the need for increased assistance for the younger disabled children is at crisis point.
Whilst I welcome the government's announcement of an extra $150 million towards the needs of people with disabilities, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare recommends that an additional $294 million is needed now to resolve the national disability crisis which exists. In spite of the level of unmet need over many years, government funding has fallen well short of the growth in the numbers of disabled people needing help. There is also deep concern in New South Wales at the moment because the government plans to tender out 190 group homes run by the Department of Community Services for 
 people with a disability. At a time when there is a severe shortage of funds in the disability area, this change also places additional pressure on the parents, because they do not know how these new arrangements will affect their children.
Another group I wish to acknowledge from the far South Coast is the Nardy House Committee in Bega. This group has been trying unsuccessfully for five years to establish a home to accommodate people with severe disabilities within that region. They have been given land, they have had their plans approved by council and they are continually raising funds to help with the building costs. They require capital funding for the building and recurrent funding, but still the government have refused to fund this urgently needed facility. The critical need for permanent care, accommodation and support services for disabled people cannot be overemphasised, and their plight cannot be ignored any longer. I support the motion before the House and call on governments to address the critical need that exists in the area of disability.
Not wishing to enter into an argument with my colleague and friend the honourable member for Gilmore, I want to say that it is logical that there will be more need in the centre of Wollongong because the population is greater. I support what the honourable member for Gilmore is doing in her area, but there is also a continuing need in the Illawarra and the Shellharbour area. We must all work together across the political sides and between state and federal government to solve this great need. The ageing parents of ageing children with disabilities have faced a dreadful plight over many years. They feel that they have been neglected by governments of all persuasions.

"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,1999-08-23,"—One of the measures of a civilised and caring society is the way in which it provides for the vulnerable, the disadvantaged and those with disabilities. Assistance for people with disabilities has come from a combination of sources: state and federal governments, large charitable organisations, local community based charities, church groups and a large 
 army of volunteers—carers, relatives and friends—who selflessly give so much in the way of care to those in need. In my electorate of Macquarie in the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury, according to the latest ABS figures, we have 3,800 recipients of the disability support pension, yet this figure does not in any way adequately reflect the real level of need. It does nothing to indicate the level of profoundness of the need or the degree of disability of those suffering. It does nothing to indicate their dependence on the carers and the burden and strain that carers suffer. It does nothing to indicate particular local problems—and we have a number of those in the electorate of Macquarie.
Problems resulting from the isolation of scattered villages that need services are duplicated many times. Our more urban and metropolitan areas have services which are often not available in outlying areas. We have pockets of low income, low socioeconomic areas where the burden is particularly great on parents trying to access services for their children. We have a higher than average growth rate of people with disabilities in my electorate, yet we have also a large number of community based organisations doing their best to work to help these people, often in the face of extreme disadvantage. I would like to commend groups such as the Bridges Disability Service, Westworks, the Santa Maria Centre, Mountains Community Transport and Hawkesbury Community Transport, just to name a few—but there are many others—who do their best.
There are still many areas of unmet need for our people with disabilities. I would like to highlight a few of these. Firstly, there is the quantity and the range of accommodation needed. There is a need for long-term supported accommodation, emergency accommodation and planned accommodation for respite. There is a need for appropriate transition accommodation and a range of services from residential care right through to community housing and assisted individual accommodation. There is a need for fully staffed crisis accommodation for people with psychiatric disabilities. 
Secondly, there is a great need for people, particularly those with physical disabilities, to have access to appropriate transport services. This is a real problem in the Blue Mountains and in some of the outlying areas of the Hawkesbury. There is a need for support services for community transport. There is a need for more access to public transport and greater assistance with individual private transport. There are also significant barriers to proper access to streets and public buildings. I know this is an area that both the Hawkesbury City Council and the Blue Mountains City Council are working on, but much more needs to be done.
Thirdly, in the area of day care options, there is a need for a much greater increase in services, especially for post-school age young people. There is a need for meaningful day care activities, recognising that many of these people will never gain independence or employment. There is a gap in developing skills in social interaction, leisure activities and independent living for many of these people. I know organisations such as Bridges are doing valuable work, but there is a need for so much more. There is a need for employment services to assist those with milder physical and intellectual disabilities back into the work force, into paid employment.
There is a need for greater help with aids and appliances for people with physical disabilities, including, for instance, greater help with the incontinence aids scheme and access to assistance such as wheelchairs. There is a need for greater respite care for carers—both in crisis situations and in ongoing planning for carers of people with disabilities. I was very pleased that this government recently announced an extra $150 million in addition to increases in the last two budgets to take the burden off the carers of these people. There is a need to continue to help ageing carers of ageing children with disabilities. Much more needs to be done to assist these people.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—Disability services are another manifestation of the crisis currently being experienced in health service provision in Australia. The government needs to address the current 
 unmet need and improve the lives of Australians with disabilities and their carers. That will require the government formulating a disability services policy with goals and strategies that do more than contain costs. Part of the problem in disability services is structural. The Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement gave the most costly services—accommodation and respite care—to the states. The Commonwealth has the much less financially onerous responsibility for employment services, training and placement. A major part of the responsibility for disability services was given to the states, which could not or would not fund them. Minister Newman's own press release of 4 August announcing $150 million in funding admits that she agreed with the states in April that disability support must be a shared responsibility.
The member for Gilmore has mentioned in her motion the federal government's specific commitment of over $1.7 billion to the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. This is somewhat misleading. The funding figures for 1997-98 show that the major contribution to the CSDA comes not from the Commonwealth but from the states. Of that $1.7 billion, the Commonwealth contributes only $555.4 million. The states and territories contribute the other $1,171.6 billion of a total of $1,727 billion. The Commonwealth government contributes less than 20 per cent of the total pool of disability funding while the state and territory governments are contributing more than 80 per cent. The amount allocated to meet the needs of 654,600 Australians with disabilities in 1998 equates to $7.47 per person per day, with the Commonwealth contributing the equivalent of $1.56 per person per day of this total.
There are substantial differences between the states in the way that they provide for people with disabilities. For example, state funding for people with a profound intellectual disability ranges from a little over $1,000 per head in Queensland to more than $3,000 in Victoria. In South Australia, it is a little over $1,800. Nor has disability service funding been increasing to meet the unmet demand, a demand which is growing. For 
 example, in South Australia it is fairly flat. The 1998 schedule A to the CSDA shows Commonwealth funding in 1997-98 of $40.382 million, in 1998-99 of $42.172 million, in 1999-2000 of $43.081 million, in 2000-01 of $44.020 million and in 2001-02 of $44.991 million.
The schedule shows that state funding held constant for all of these years at $93.93 million, except in 1998-99 when it was $96.27 million. These amounts are in 1997-98 dollars for 1997-98, and in 1998-99 constant dollar terms for all other years. The greatest unmet demand for disability support services is for long-term supported accommodation and respite care services. The federal government's funding announcement on 4 August of $150 million followed a meeting of all ministers responsible for disability services. The Commonwealth is in fact offering only $75 million a year for two years. This is far short of what is needed.
In 1997, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimated, on a conservative basis, that at least $294 million is required to fund unmet needs. More than 400,000 Australians with a profound or severe disability are not getting any help or not getting enough help to meet their basic living needs. More than 110,000 primary carers—that is, 43 per cent of those who say that they need help—are not getting enough help to support their caring role. Further, 72,000 primary carers who need respite do not get any respite or do not get enough. When the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement was drawn up, it was recognised that there were significant unmet needs and substantial differences in the way that the states provide disability services.
That is why clause 8(9)(a)(b) was inserted in the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. It relates to unmet demand and projected demand in population growth. It provides for ministers to subsequently agree on the contribution of additional funds. This motion calls on governments at all levels to cooperate with one another to identify, fund and maintain services and facilities for respite care. With the CSDA due to end in two years, this is the time for the government to start developing a better and more comprehensive 
 approach to providing disability services. That will require identifying the extent of unmet needs and developing a realistic program for meeting them. It is time for both the states and the Commonwealth to work out a clear set of responsibilities and obligations in the principal areas of need.

"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,1999-08-23,"—I rise in the House to eagerly support my colleague the member for Gilmore on this critical issue. During October we will celebrate Carers Week and applaud the amazing contribution that over 1.6 million Australian carers make to the community every day of every week of every year. It is estimated that carers save the Australian economy a staggering $16 billion per year by providing care in the home to relatives and friends who are ill, frail and aged, or disabled. It is extremely hard work bathing, dressing, lifting, feeding, medicating and toileting a person 24 hours of the day. Many carers experience social isolation and emotional and physical exhaustion, not to mention the severe financial drain on their living expenses. In rural, regional and remote areas, respite is almost non-existent. One of the many carers in my electorate is Mrs Anne Napoli. Anne wrote to me:
When Patrick was born my husband and I were so happy to be blessed with a beautiful, healthy baby, but soon after he received a triple-antigen our joy turned into heartache and a nightmare and it has been that way ever since.
We have taken Patrick to many major cities in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and had to purchase special aides and equipment to assist him, all of this has been a huge financial drain on myself and my family. I also cared for my aged parents with no financial help from the government. I went into business for myself employing up to 12 people, but the pressure of dealing with my son's disability and my parents' fragile health meant that I had to sell my business to care for them full time.
I have lost the opportunity to secure a financial future for myself, I will not retire on a generous super fund. When Patrick turned 17 I was told that I could apply for a carer's pension and I did, but because of our assets I now receive only $52.30 per fortnight.
Since my father passed away I now care for two people, if I was not able or willing to care for my son and my mother then they would both need to 
 go to a nursing home and that would further burden the taxpayers of this country.
Could you please tell me of anyone doing nursing care 24 hours per day seven days per week for $52.30 per fortnight. Do you think that I and other carers like myself are asking too much to be given increased financial assistance. Is it worth paying a full-time carer's allowance that is not means tested?
I feel totally out of control when I read in newsletters or brochures, how the government is giving millions of dollars for respite for carers, I and other carers personally see none of that!
I know that unless you are in the same situation you cannot possibly understand what it means to deal with the never ending demands, the heartache, the loss of sleep and the tension that builds up in your family. We the carers have to always be in control to keep some harmony and stability in order to hold our families together.
My husband works very hard to provide for us, I have been fortunate that my marriage is still intact after 25 years, but many other marriages break up due to all of the financial and emotional pressures of being a carer.
This letter is representative of the emotions of our many carers. Many from our farming sector are even further alienated, with their entire land and home being asset tested in order to qualify for carers' assistance or access to nursing home facilities. The sheer isolation of these people prohibits them from gaining access to valuable respite or day care. Surely they are entitled to a quality of life that others take for granted and we must see them as warranting special considerations.
This private member's motion could go even further. It could investigate the cost to governments at all levels in paying a non-means tested allowance to all carers. In addition, we could also determine if the New South Wales state Labor government is guilty of short-changing our home and community care funding for frail elderly people with a disability and their carers. We could also ascertain where the respite is being provided and whether rural, regional and remote areas are receiving an equity in funding for respite. Carers are saving this country billions of dollars annually. They deserve to be fully compensated, regardless of their assets. Being a full-time carer erodes one's ability to provide for one's future. This government has 
 put in place many great initiatives for carers. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>People with Disabilities</title>,Private Members' Business,6,1,speech
"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—I am particularly pleased to accept the opportunity to address the House today about a matter that affects the lives of many Australians. I must say that this is one of the very rare occasions where I agree with a member of this government on an issue. Providing for carers and the disabled is not a complicated concept; it is simply a matter of decency. It is about compassion from a society in which many of us enjoy life and its rewards every day in simple and tangible ways, but we must remember that some do not. Protecting and nurturing those who cannot enjoy those pleasures to the same extent as many of us while providing for their needs is the measure of a truly mature society. Let us not forget the lives of those who silently care and nurture people with disabilities. The dedication and attention exercised by some means giving up everything so that they can care and provide for those less fortunate.
But it is here that I differ in my opinions from those of the government member. Let us not deceive ourselves. The needs of these people and their carers require both a moral and a financial consideration. As a matter of research, my office contacted support agencies in Western Australia to verify the sorts of obligations carers of those with disabilities have to cater for. To start with, domestic modifications of the home often begin at around $20,000. Then we include transport modifications at some $3,500. This may entail a special purpose vehicle—try $25,000-plus. Personal modifications generally entail expenditure on beds, bathrooms, chairs and hoists. These can add a further burden of well over $8,000. These are obviously expensive items, and we have not even considered daily living expenses and medications.
It is all too easy to say, `Look, I empathise,' that is all well and good, but let us look at some of the other issues that are involved. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's report, which documents the extent of the needs of people with disabilities and those working in this field, has been noted by this House. It indicates that over 13,000 
 people aged between five and 64 have not had their assistance needs fulfilled in self-care, mobility and verbal communication. Furthermore, almost 39,000 require some form of employment services to be provided as a priority. The report continues by highlighting the plight of those not currently receiving day programs. There were 12,000 people aged 18 to 64 in this category that fell through the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement net.
Members of the House might have listened to my speech the other night about the Gotti family of Victoria Park. The family has a disabled son, Ben. As Ben gets older and heavier, the Gottis get older. What will happen to the family in 20 years time? The situation currently is that an estimated 7,700 people with a severe or profound handicap have principal carers who are over 65 years of age, not to mention those with mild disabilities. Whilst not over 65, this will be a future problem for the Gotti family. For many others, it is also a problem dawning on the horizon.
We must make a firm and unified decision to say to these people, `We will help.' I fear, however, that the current government's policy, if continued, will be a portent of future hardship. I say this because no clear and firm decisions are being made to fully satisfy the needs of carers. As recently as 12 May, Senator Chris Evans asked the question:
Isn't it true that the government's offer of just $20 million for respite care assistance means that only 900 of the 13,400 families you have identified as currently in desperate need of respite care for their child with a disability will receive any assistance at all? How will the government decide which families are to receive this paltry assistance provided in the budget?
I could not be satisfied with the reply of Senator Newman. The government says that they need $300 million now. The government's own report, which it has had for two years, has identified $300 million of unmet need. As Senator Evans illustrated, next year it will all be okay. The government is saying, `Here are some crumbs; here are some programs that will address some of the concerns that will be introduced on 1 July 2000.' What happens until then to those people doing it 
 tough? They will have to wait. If they have child-care needs, if they have a disabled child who needs assistance, they will just have to wait.
We have had two budgets in which the minister could have provided assistance to address these problems. But what has been allocated? Just $20 million to meet a $300 million need. The people who care for people with disabilities say that it is paltry and pathetic—and, frankly, I agree. I conclude by reiterating that I am happy to cooperate in any way with the government to assist those with disabilities and their carers.
—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>People with Disabilities</title>,Private Members' Business,6,1,speech
"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—Since it came to office, the Howard government has set about undermining a number of important principles that have been held dear by both sides of politics traditionally in industrial 
 relations. This government has systematically sought to undermine the independence, authority and powers of the industrial commission. It has actively sought to tip the field decidedly in favour of management and employers. It has deliberately sought to restrict unions in what they are able to do in representing workers, and it has deliberately sought to undermine the safety net minimum conditions that Australian workers are able to have of right.
On that last point, we need look no further than the minister for workplace relations's most recent letter, after the last election, to the Prime Minister in which he wrote to the Prime Minister and complained that the Industrial Relations Commission had provided increases in the basic wage which were, and I quote the minister, `too generous'. These are the payments that go to the lowest paid workers in Australia and, in the view of this government, in the view of Minister Reith, they get too much money.
Unlike their New Zealand counterparts, who established a revolutionary system overnight and abolished a whole raft of protections that existed in the work force, this government have been a bit more cunning. They have changed the ground rules, they have changed the law and set up new bodies that will do their bidding, with political appointees to ensure that is so. They have done all that to set the groundwork for a more gradual but nonetheless effective way of undermining workers' entitlements.
Sadly, what we have now witnessed some years on is employers only too willing to take the opportunity to further exploit their work force. I say at the outset that the overwhelming majority of employers seek to do the right thing by their workers and understand that the long-term interests of their enterprise, as well as their decency in wanting to maintain standards in Australia, require them to treat their work force with dignity and respect. But it is the case that with these new laws that have now been in operation for three years employers have greater freedom in which to exploit workers, and that is exactly what is happening. 
I intend to take the opportunity available in debates such as the grievance debate and the adjournment debate to detail individual cases where that has occurred, and to do that on a weekly basis. These employer rip-offs need to be exposed. These employer rip-offs give the proof, the evidence, as to why we need to maintain a decent independent commission, an independent umpire that is able to ensure that fair play and fair rules apply. It is why we need to maintain a responsible and decent safety net of minimum conditions and not undermine them in the way that this government's 1996 legislation does, or worse, the way that their current bill—the second wave of industrial laws—tries to do. So I will, on a weekly basis, set out an employer rip-off, a real-life case, not fiction, with real people who are working in Australia today and who are finding their basic conditions undermined.
I want to start by referring to one such case in Victoria. Victoria is an important place with which to start this expose because in Victoria the Kennett government abolished the state industrial system, so workers in Victoria are basically left with no protection. If they were in Queensland, New South Wales or Tasmania they could enjoy the protection of a decent state industrial relations system but, in Victoria, they cannot. In Victoria they are exposed, totally, to the ravages of the Howard-Reith model. I have here an example of what can happen under that situation. In some cases, it is quite sizeable companies that should be more responsible and should know what their middle management are doing. This account comes from a university student who was working for Safeway stores in Victoria and the problems that she confronted. She says:
Each department is allocated a number of staff hours each week. This is sent from head office, but at our store the number is revised by at least 12 hours each week thanks to the Store Manager. The Bakery Manager gets into trouble if she uses more than this, so overtime is not paid. Someone comes to the bakery each morning with the adjustment sheet, and the manager or the second in charge will sign it and change your finish time to whatever time you were actually supposed to finish. Our department works a good 15-20 hours unpaid each week. Also, most of us never take all the tea breaks 
 we are entitled to because we know we won't finish on time if we do. This is more unpaid work time.
Part-timers sign a contract that shows which hours they are to work each week. This can be changed if you need to work different days or hours upon negotiation with the department manager, but generally this only happens if your university hours change, which is twice the year. Any extra hours you work outside of your contract are to be paid as casual rates. My new manager pays this, but the manager who left about six months ago would rewrite your contract each week, sometimes more than once a week, if you were needed to work extra hours. This meant that you were effectively a casual being paid part-time rates, as your roster was never the same from one week to the next. I don't know if this happens in other departments, it usually depends on the manager of each department and how much pressure they are under to cut their costs.
She goes on:
The store decides whether to pay public holiday rates on the occasions when a public holiday falls on a weekend. On Boxing Day last year, public holiday rates were paid to people who worked on the Monday, but not to those that actually worked on Boxing Day. I did work the real holiday, and was not paid holiday rates. After asking a few questions, I found out that I was entitled to holiday rates. I asked for the extra money to be paid into my account, but it did not happen until three months later and four trips to the pay office. I finally met the other pay girl who put it in that week. The usual pay lady gave me a different excuse every time I saw her. This has happened again recently when my pay was incorrect by about $70. I was told the money had gone in, but when I checked my bank statements I found that it never had. I have also not been paid travel allowance that I was entitled to when I asked. You are told that it will get done, but it never is. The store will do anything just to save a few dollars.
That is the real-life account of a person who was working for Safeway stores in Victoria. This has happened as a direct result of this government's legislation which encourages employers to go out there and cut corners and treat workers with a level of disdain that should not be tolerated in our community.
The government and their members will wipe their hands of this and say, `These things should not happen; our laws don't approve of this.' It is precisely this government's laws that have facilitated those sorts of actions—where employers think they 
 can change people's time sheets and knock off 15 hours a week overtime, every week, and put it down as unpaid work just for the hell of it—because they know, when the bargaining is done one-on-one, where the strength is.
This government's second wave legislation goes further down this track. They take away from workers the rights to long service leave in their awards, the rights to superannuation in their awards. They actually want to take away from workers the right to have paid jury service leave. Why would any government want to stop ordinary Australians from being able to serve on juries? This government does. This government's second wave legislation, which we will be debating in the parliament later this week, actually proposes to prevent the commission—even if it wants to, it will not be able to—from having paid jury service in any award. It is a common feature now. People need to contemplate what that means. It is not just an industrial relations issue.
We in Australia pride ourselves on an independent judicial system, separate from government, separate from the executive, separate from parliament. Independent—where you can go before 12 of your peers and be judged by them. Under Peter Reith's laws, it will be 12 of your peers who are rich enough to afford the time off work to front up for jury service because he is legislating to take away their right to paid jury service leave.
It is that sort of approach to industrial relations that has encouraged this succession of managers in this Safeway store in Victoria to think that they can treat their workers in such a cavalier and condescending way, to deny them what is their legally due entitlement, to say to them, `You may well have a legal right to that holiday pay, but we're not going to give it to you,' and then, when they front up, to give them all sorts of reasons why it is not going to happen. Workers and individual students like this—and we are talking here about a university student—should not be put in the position where they have to go and negotiate that. They are entitled to it. If you put that together with this government's plans on unfair dismissal, you create a very 
 vulnerable work force. We will continue to expose a case a week, and these employer rip-offs will be exposed. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Industrial Relations</title>,Grievance Debate,7,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—The Social Security Amendment (Disposal of Assets) Bill 1999 —legislation that will apply retrospectively—has caused great angst in the community. Pensioners and senior citizens are rejecting it and believe it is mean-spirited and yet another example of how John Howard and his government are attacking pensioners and older Australians. In this year—the International Year of the Older Person—this government continues to attack older Australians. The quality of life that pensioners in Australia enjoy is being gradually eroded, and this is yet another example of how this erosion is 
 taking place. This legislation is an attack—an attack on the standard of living and quality of life enjoyed by pensioners in Australia.
One value universally held by older Australians is the desire to help their families. This legislation is preventing older Australians from being able to do that. Pensioners are no longer able to help their families out when they are in dire need. This government says, `No, you are not like any other person; you are not allowed to help your family. If you do, you will be penalised. Your social security payments and your pension will be lowered, and that will apply over a five-year period.'
This government has continually attacked pensioners. It has introduced the GST. I was speaking to a large group of older Australians—there were a number of older Australians present at a morning tea I was at last Friday—and the one issue that they continually raised was the GST and how it was going to impact on their lives. They were worried about the increased cost of their electricity, the increased cost of their telephones. They were worried about the increased cost of being able to buy clothes. They were worried about the increased cost of every aspect of their lives. They saw the GST as a tax that was going to affect them every day in every way.
Now, coupled with that, this government is attacking their ability to give money to their family, to their children, to their grandchildren, to be able to help out when they are in need. No longer will pensioners have the independence to be able to decide whether or not they give their money to a member of their family.
The government has once again made changes that disadvantage pensioners in Australia. Every change they make is an attack on the living conditions and on the quality of life enjoyed by pensioners, and yet the government continues to do it. I have been searching to see if there is anything positive that John Howard and his government are going to give to older Australians in this International Year of the Older Person and, I am afraid, I am at a loss. I thought that locally I would do something, and I had a 
 social work student, Michael Whiteside, come to my office to look at issues affecting older Australians. One major issue relates to their independence, their ability to make decisions and their ability to go out there and say, `This is what I want to do.' What this legislation will do, once again, is take away their ability to make a decision that affects their life.
Health is an area that is of great concern to older Australians. The Dental Health Scheme was a scheme that pensioners used widely. It was a scheme that did not cost the government very much money to run. It was a scheme that provided pensioners with dentures, and if a pensioner needed to have dental care they could access it. As recently as last month, I received a letter from the Dudley pensioners in which they implored me to raise in this parliament the need for the Dental Health Scheme to be reintroduced. I do that and I do it in the context of this legislation because it is something else that this government has taken away from older Australians. They feel they are being forced to take out health insurance and they are particularly upset that $1.7 billion has been put into health insurance while they have to wait to have their hip replacements or their knee replacements in public hospitals. If that $1.7 billion had gone into the public hospital system, pensioners would not have to wait for health care.
If you look at every avenue that this government is involved in, you will see attacks on pensioners. I think it was the member for Parramatta who the other day said, `Well, if a pensioner is really poor, we don't mind them getting their pension. We don't mind them having some money but, if they have a bit of money, maybe they should have to pay.' That bit of money that they have has been saved through their life. It is their safety net, their way of knowing they will be secure. As I have said, one of the things they hope they can do, if anyone in their family needs assistance, is provide that assistance. This government is taking away that freedom. This piece of legislation will force older Australians to think twice before they help their families. I implore the minister to rethink his stand on this legislation and 
 think about those older Australians—it might be his mother or his grandmother that will one day want to assist a member of his family and they will not be able to because of this legislation.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (DISPOSAL OF ASSETS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—I rise for the second time today to speak out against what this government is trying to do to elderly Australians. I may be regarded as a cynic, I know I am cynical, but when I hear the Treasurer of this country stand up and issue forth with the rhetoric about how televisions and sound systems have become cheaper, about all of the things the government is doing to make the cost of living better, to make things more achievable, I just wonder how those things apply to the elderly.
This morning I spoke about the hardship that self-funded retirees face under the Howard government's tax reform, the GST. Now I look at the other group of retired people in our society—and I am speaking about pensioners, both those receiving full benefits and those receiving part pensions. Not satisfied with the burden of the GST, and what that is going to place on pensioners and retirees alike, the government has devised another load for the retired to bear.
What does the  Social Security Amendment (Disposal of Assets) Bill 1999  do? If you ask John Howard, the Prime Minister, or Peter Costello, the Treasurer, they would tell you that it closes loopholes that have been used by high income earners to claim the pension. But, if you were to ask them to put a number on just how many people have been able to get a pension, because they have been able to disperse their assets, they cannot tell you.
No-one has been able to show that people have been able to get rid of their assets and go out and claim a pension. No-one has been able to quantify this. No-one has been able to show that gifts and bequests have been anything more than just gifts and bequests. However, if you ask anyone else what this bill will do, they will tell you straight out that it reduces the value of gifts and bequests that a person on a pension or a part pension can give to a relative or friend. It reduces it from $10,000 to $5,000.
It will stop people giving their children or grandchildren more than $5,000 because, if they do, it will be treated as an asset and be included in the pension, deemed income and assets test for a period of five years. Depending on a person's circumstances, this could mean a reduction in fortnightly pension payments of $15 simply because they gave a child or grandchild $10,000 in that financial year.
I grew up in a working-class part of Australia. We went to primary school without shoes on. I am a little younger than the Prime Minister but I am sure that our upbringing was much the same. I have listened to the Prime Minister talk about his white picket fence vision of Australia, and I just wonder how two people who grew up under similar circumstances came to such a different point of view of Australia and of what working-class Australians mean to each other.
Most of the kids I went to school with, like me, lived in an extended family. They had their grandma or grandad living with them, or they lived with them. When elder sisters got married, they generally brought their husband home to the back bedroom because that is what working-class Australia stood for. If the family could give something substantial to their kids when they got married, that was the greatest day of their life. That is what working-class Australians are about. They are about being able to give their family a leg up. They are about being able to make it a little more equal, to just ease the burden a little. That is what they want, and that is what this government is denying them.
The people whom I know, the people whom I get around and talk to, think this is a very harsh thing. I can remember that at weddings there was no big reception. The family would get together and cater. They might put a marquee tent up in the backyard and dad would pull out a roll of carefully folded notes, give it to his son and say, `Here, this might help for a deposit on a block of land,' or `This might help you with your car repayments.' They were the sorts of things that most working-class Australians dreamed of doing. 
But times have changed, I guess. Society has moved on. More families are able to get into houses of their own—I suppose they are. I know a lot of people rent, particularly in my electorate, particularly in the poorer suburbs. The amount of mortgage repayment is much greater than I would have cared to pay. When I hear what young people today have borrowed to buy their home, I must admit that I am very concerned for them because it is more than probably I ever borrowed in my life. In fact, the cost of housing has increased so dramatically that it has moved away from many families. It has moved away from lots of ordinary families, and those people will probably never own their own home, unless of course they can get that family assistance, unless they can get that help.
Car payments have gone up too. I notice there is a smile from the Minister for Employment Services, who is at the table, but he is also aware—or probably not—that he has very low unemployment in his electorate of less than four per cent, I believe. But, if he comes to the Hunter, where it is about 11 per cent, he would realise just how hard it is for those sorts of families to exist and why they see the need when their children cannot get a job, when their children are condemned to life on social security, to give them something to try to make sure that they have the opportunity of equality of education and things like that.
Times are tougher, and I am sure the Prime Minister will agree with that, particularly for the elderly. I am sure the Prime Minister, who loves the word `mateship', would also agree with the need for families to help each other out. I would like to know how this legislation is going to do that. This legislation means that, if a pensioner decides to help out, they are going to be disadvantaged because of it.
This means that the generation who were taught to save, that saving is the way to security later on in life, are sadly mistaken. It means the generation who grew up with parents who helped them out as much as they could and who want to do the same for the next generation simply cannot do it under the Howard government.
Today's pensioners have worked hard for their savings. They do not look on them as everyday accounts to be drawn on for simple purchases such as food. They look on them as an investment. It is the only thing they have to pass on. Under the pretty harsh nursing home legislation, we saw this government force aged people to sell their homes. Previously the home was about the only thing that a lot of these people could pass on. Now their savings are the only thing they can pass on, and they are not going to be allowed to do that either.
Today's pensioners obviously have to be careful with their pensions. I know many pensioners who are going without at the end of a fortnight. They will often miss a meal or two at the end of their pension fortnight, particularly when, if they want to bring their pension forward a day or two, they are going to lose one-fourteenth of their pension for that fortnight. Of course, the government knows that the only time pensioners get that back is when they go out in a coffin.
Is this the loophole the government wants to close? Does the government want to catch high income earners who help their children, or is the government just putting the pressure on the low income earners, on the pensioners, to make sure that life becomes as miserable as it possibly can?
Here I can tell a story. I was contacted the other day by a lady. She is 70. She lives in a mobile home park by herself. Last Christmas, her family gave her a week's holiday on Norfolk Island. It is interesting that it was Norfolk Island, because that is the same place our Prime Minister went on holiday.
This woman, being a pensioner, received the gift from her family to go away and she had a fabulous time. When she came back, in about June I think it was, she got a letter from Centrelink telling her that they were aware she was out of the country for a week. What happened? She had to repay $74.20 of her pension for that fortnight. She could not believe it. She rang my office. I could not believe it. She said, `They told me at Centrelink that, if it had been the week before or the week after, they would not have been able to detect it because it wouldn't have 
 been on the computer that I was out of the country. It just happened to be the week that my pension was due.'
I thought: is this not the story of Australia under the Howard government? The Prime Minister and his family go to Norfolk Island and stay at the governor's residence—a taxpayer funded holiday for the leader of the country. But a pensioner who has paid taxes all her life goes there and what happens? She is denied $74.20 of her fortnightly pension because she was overseas. I guess ministers of the government would say, `That's fair. That's the way it should be.' I do not think that is fair for one minute.
If we have a look at the record of the Howard government and what they have done for the elderly, we can see that they abolished the free dental scheme for the elderly. I happened to be at a meeting of Maitland senior citizens last Thursday. The first thing that happened when I walked in was that one of the ladies getting morning tea ran over to me and said, `Mr Horne, I was at Maitland hospital last week and, do you know, they told me I have to wait four years to get my teeth fixed. I told them: ""Take my name off the list. I'll be dead in four years"".' That is all courtesy of this government. That program was worth $90 million over four years, but the government cut it.
They have removed free hearing aids and hearing services for health cardholders. They have introduced nursing care fees. They have included an annual and extra daily fee. A couple of months ago, a pensioner couple whom I have known for some time rang me. His wife has suffered with ulcers on her legs for some time and he said, `I want you to see if you can get the district nurse to call in more often. She calls in twice a week to change the dressing on my wife's ulcerated legs.' I said, `If that continues to go on, your wife will lose her legs. Do you realise that?' He said, `That's what I'm afraid of.' The next time I spoke to him, his wife was in hospital and they were deciding whether to amputate one or both legs. For what? What are we saving here? The cost of having the district nurse call in to service this person is far less 
 than eventually making sure she is in a nursing home as a double amputee.
I had a lady call me the other day. She is 85 and her husband is 86. He is a veteran and he had a stroke six years ago. Here is an 85-year-old woman caring for her 86-year-old husband who has had a stroke. She bathes him, she dresses him, she toilets him, she does everything. Veterans' Affairs became aware of it and they gave her domiciliary nursing care for half an hour a day. The nurse decided that this 85-year-old lady needed an extra half an hour of care at night to get her husband into his pyjamas and into bed. That went on for a couple of weeks and then she turned up one night and said, `I've got bad news for you. You're only going to get half an hour a day.' This woman broke down. She was in tears and she said, `What happens when I break down and I can no longer do it?'
These are the sorts of every day things that are happening under this government—the government that claims it has got Australia's finances back on track. I keep saying, `At what cost? At what cost to the ordinary working Australians, to the people who served their country in war and who are now in their time of need? At what cost?' This is the government that reduced rent assistance for shared renters, that deemed interest rates on bank accounts of less than $2,000, and the list goes on.
There is no doubt that the Howard government will be known for many things, but I know how elderly Australians will remember it and they will not remember it fondly. They will remember it as the harshest government of their lifetime. They will remember it as a government that has taken away some of the few pleasures they thought they could look forward to in their retirement. They will remember it as a government that really took the icing off the cake.
—Ha.
—The minister laughs at that, too, but I urge him to get out there into real Australia. Don't talk to us about the supposed benefits of the Work for the Dole program. Get out there and talk about the real situa 
 tion—the situation that this government is not addressing.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (DISPOSAL OF ASSETS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1999-08-23,"—In introducing the Social Security Amendment (Disposal of Assets) Bill 1999 —which seeks to reduce the annual allowable gift permitted under the social security asset test from $10,000 to $5,000—the then minister claimed that the current $10,000 `free area' was, to use his words:
. . . anomalous in that it is greater than the maximum single pension rate—some $9,400 per annum. The result is that under the current rules an income support recipient can give away more than that person is entitled to receive by way of assistance.
With respect to the minister, as far as I am concerned this supposed rationale is absolute nonsense. It cloaks the reality that all this bill is really about is saving the government money, and in the scheme of things not much money at that—an estimated $750,000 in savings this year growing to $4.5 million by 2002-03. Is this really the way we want to generate a surplus?
The Parliamentary Library and the department have confirmed that at no time in its history has the gifting provision been in any way linked to the maximum pension rate. I understand that some time ago the rate was around $2,000 but it was then increased to $10,000 by the Hawke Labor government as an act of generosity at a time when it was tightening up social security payments in other areas.
The reality is that this bill has nothing or very little to do with preventing people who are close to getting a full rate of pension from giving away money. It has everything to do with making it harder for those people at the other end—those who are close to qualifying for a pension—to access a part pension.
This measure will make it even harder than it already is for people who are asset rich and income poor to access a part pension. It will deny these people what many call the fringe benefits available when one accesses even the smallest pension of a few dollars a fortnight. By `fringe benefits' I mean the range of federal, state and local government and private organisational concessions available to pension cardholders. As detailed by the 
 former speaker, the member for Paterson, I am talking about things like reduced rates, car registration concessions, reduced train fares and health care cards, although some who miss out on the pension can still at least have that.
Denying people these types of fringe benefits is really what the bill will achieve. It is not about the effective delivery of assistance measures and encouraging more responsible attitudes in the community, as the then minister would have us believe when he introduced the bill. It is clear that what has happened is that the minister has gone to his boffins in Social Security during the budget process and said, `Find me as many little areas where I can save a few bob,' or perhaps Treasury have demanded such savings so that they can yell responsible fiscal management to the money markets where, unfortunately, our real but unproductive income is occurring but our need is not being generated in that area of the economy. But it certainly looks good on the bottom line. Far too often—and this is a classic example—the rationalists in Treasury are more concerned about that bottom line than they are about the impacts this miserly recovery of money will have out there in the real world.
People are still reeling at the way this government changed the way super is treated under the asset test. We have also seen the introduction of the income maintenance provisions for income support payments. We have seen the proposals for the treatment of non-economic loss compensation. The irony is that people whom this penny-pinching bill will hurt most form a good part of the constituencies of current and past ministers. I am talking of course about farmers, and specifically farmers past retirement age—asset rich yet invariably income poor given the continuing low commodity prices, drought, OJD, and the list goes on. My office has been in touch today with the National Farmers Federation to discuss this bill. They agree that by reducing the gifting provisions farmers will suffer. Yet, as the bill has not received much publicity, the federation was not even aware of its debate today.
I am sure most National Party members in this place, like me, have a file full of letters from farmers in their electorates pointing out how the social security asset test already does not adequately treat their family farm asset. One such letter I recently received from an aged farming couple eloquently explained their plight. I might say that that farming couple were in the seat of Gwydir, the seat of the Deputy Prime Minister. They had farmed their property throughout their life. They had no children to pass the property on to and so access the pension under the Retirement Assistance for Farmers scheme. I cannot recall their exact income, but it was well below that for the pension cut-off, yet they could not access the pension because of the supposed value of their farm. I recall that it was the electorate of the member for Gwydir. It may refer to one other case. I could stand corrected, but I am happy to provide the details.
I say `supposed value' because they like many others in their area know they are highly unlikely to sell their properties for the amount Centrelink values them at. In their area, with the rural decline, we have the bizarre situation of very high valuations for properties because of Pitt Street farmers investing in the area but a high degree of difficulty selling properties at the same time, especially if, as is the case on the Tablelands at the moment, it is unfortunate enough to have ovine Johne's suspect status. Because these properties do not show a profit as farming enterprises, the main people who seem interested in buying them, on the Tablelands particularly, are Pitt Street farmers who do it for all the right reasons—to reduce their tax by negatively gearing into a loss making venture.
Those letters from my constituents point out the inequity of the asset test. In this particular case I am citing, while their farm was counted, the principal family residence in the leafy suburbs of Sydney of their Pitt Street counterparts were not only exempt from the asset test but also exempt from capital gains tax. The irony inherent in all of this is that your Pitt Street farmer is going to benefit with their mansions being capital gains tax exempt as well as getting the tax benefits of investing in 
 a rural property for the specific purpose of making a deductible loss. I should put on the record my concern that the current rate of investment in the grape growing wine industry is such that one wonders how productive, from a wine point of view, a lot of this investment will be and how many smaller genuine boutique wine producers, if you like, are going to be left high and dry by not only the new WET tax but also the oversupply of grapes that I fear will be around in the not too distant future.
As I said, you can have a million dollar house or unit in Mosman or Woollahra that would be snapped up tomorrow and still be entitled to the pension, yet if you have a farm of the same value in Calare which you could not sell in a year for the price it is valued at you miss out. It does not matter if your farm is as dear to your heart as your home. Farms are not only counted under the pension asset test but, depending on how the rollover relief rules apply to you and when the property was purchased, you will pay tax on it when you sell it as well.
I concede that the government has taken some steps in the direction of dealing with the rural decline and the problems faced by the ageing farm population. I did welcome at the time the Retirement Assistance for Farmers scheme, but it became more and more apparent that it only scratches the surface of the problem. It has proved to be extremely hard to access with only a fraction of the take-up expected because of the rigid criteria, but there is nothing in RAFS for those farmers with children who do not want to carry on the farming business or those who do not have children at all.
While the government could have come in here with a bill addressing these types of concerns, all it has come up with instead is this penny pinching one. If, as the government claims, it is anomalous to have a $10,000 gifting rate because it is higher than a maximum pension rate, surely if the government is fair dinkum it should be going the whole way. If $10,000 is anomalous, isn't $5,000 still half an anomaly? I ask why members of the National Party have not come in here and justified this bill and stood up for 
 their so-called constituencies. Perhaps they have not even taken the time to look at how it will impact on their constituencies. They, not me, could have pointed out that what this bill will do is deny many farmers access to some small mercies which might have made their retirement years after a lifetime of paying their dues just a little easier.
Yet among the National Party, only the then minister, the member for Wide Bay, spoke to the bill. He could come up only with these arguments about alleged anomalies with the current gifting provisions. Perhaps the other members have not even thought about who will bear the brunt of this bill. I can certainly show them a couple of cases of those who will be affected. For all these reasons, I condemn the bill.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (DISPOSAL OF ASSETS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—The Social Security Amendment (Disposal of Assets) Bill 1999  halves the amount of assets that a pensioner may give away in each year without affecting their pension from $10,000 to $5,000. This bill will penalise pensioners who are forced from time to time to assist in a family crisis by providing financial assistance to sons and daughters who may have found themselves in some sort of financial difficulty. The government is seeking to have these changes applied retrospectively from 1 July 1999. The bill also changes the definition of a year from pension year to financial year. Currently, the pension year refers to the anniversary of the date the income support recipient commenced receiving a payment.
In introducing this bill on 30 June, the then Minister for Community Services, Warren Truss, gave no specific reasons for the introduction of the bill other than to say:
The government is committed to the effective delivery of its assistance measures, and part of this involves encouraging more responsible attitudes in the community.
This legislation continues the policies of this Howard government of hitting the battlers so that they can continue to produce a budget surplus and appear to be good economic managers to the financial controllers of this world. If we look at the legislative record of this coalition government, we see that it is 
 aimed continually at winding back the financial support that medium to low income earners have either built up for themselves or was provided by previous Labor governments.
For example, we have seen the coalition's attempt to force older people to sell their family homes to pay for nursing home accommodation. We have seen them forcing unemployed people over 55 to access superannuation entitlements before becoming entitled to unemployment benefits. We have seen them reduce unemployment benefits for 17- and 18-year-olds, forcing the burden back onto low income families. We have seen them producing a budget surplus by cutting spending on education, health and social welfare. And now, before this House, they are saying that they are going to provide more jobs, but they will be creating job insecurity and low wage growth and reducing conditions for the average Australian worker, as is intended in the second wave of industrial relations legislation. We now have the daddy of all economic rationalist policies in this International Year of Older Persons: they are reducing the amount that older Australians can gift to family members.
This legislation is restricting the ability of older Australians to assist their children or grandchildren during their developing years while continuing their education or establishing a home. Labor is strongly in support of bringing accountability into the social security system. We would strongly oppose high income earners simply placing their wealth in low or no income producing assets so as to receive social security benefits. The current arrangements should remain that allow parents or grandparents to assist their offspring in financial difficulties relating to medical treatment, education, starting a business or buying a family home. Families are all about helping each other.
As if this coalition government has not hurt older Australians enough, in addition to the general pattern of its policies of taking from low income people, it has been specifically petty in dealing with older people since coming to office. We have seen the abolition of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program; the removal of free hearing aids and hearing 
 services for health care cardholders; a cut in the number of financial information service officers by some 25 per cent and the introduction of nursing home fees; deemed interest rates on bank accounts of less than $2,000; an increase in the cost of life saving medicines; the removal of the earning credit scheme; the removal of the rent assistance for shared renters; the tightening of the Pension Advance Scheme; the scrapping of the Home Equity Conversion Scheme; and, of course, now we have the GST. In fact, the GST could be renamed the `disposal of assets tax', as this will be the effect that it will have on the assets of older Australians. The GST will affect the ability of older Australians to accumulate financial assets. It will ensure that low income people have less opportunity to accumulate financial assets, and the assets that they do accumulate will be eaten into to make ends meet. It is likely that the full impact of the GST will not be known until well after its introduction date of 1 July 2000.
This is really worrying low income people. What will be the long-term impact of the unknown aspect of the GST? It is predicted that pensioners and self-funded retirees will be substantially worse off under the coalition-Democrat tax package. Compensation for the tax will likely be eroded over time and in fact merge into normal pension increases. After a number of years, pensions would be no higher than if a GST had not been introduced. Most social commentators recommended exemptions from the GST rather than compensation as the best means of protecting pensioners and low income people. The fact that the coalition-Democrat package has gone for the latter means that pensioners will have to tighten their belts even further when the GST is introduced in mid-2000.
In the Sydney Morning Herald  on Monday, 31 May, in an article by Tom Allard under the headline `Pensioners fear benefits losses', concern is expressed as to how pensioners will fare under the GST. The article states:
A boost to social security payments and the removal of food from the GST net has done little to convince pensioners and welfare groups that the poor will be better off over the longer term of tax reform. The Brotherhood of St Laurence Director of Social Action and Research, Ms Alison 
 McClelland, said the compromise deal finalised on Friday was `not as good as it could have been'. . . `There's great danger down the track that any gains could be eroded,' she said, noting the retention of many state taxes would penalise the poor.
And in the same article:
The head of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, Mrs Nora Maguire, said ""It's only a 0.5% improvement for pensioners. All it means is it will take a bit longer for the compensation to be eroded.""
That is the very important point that I think this government should take on board: `All it means is it will take a bit longer for the compensation to be eroded.' Then there was a media release from ACOSS headed `Tax package will widen inequality and is still not acceptable'. I quote:
After careful analysis, the Australian Council of Social Service has concluded that the new Government/Democrats tax package is still fundamentally unfair and is unacceptable.
Michael Raper, ACOSS president, is quoted in the media release as saying:
While the revised package is fairer than the original because it gives a little more to pensioners, unemployed people and low and middle income Australians it still gives too much to the well-off.
The package will therefore widen the gap between rich and poor and the whole nation will suffer from greater division between the haves and the have-nots.
Concern has been expressed about the retention of the many state taxes and their impact on the poor. Already, bank fees are set to rise when the GST is introduced next year. A media report also indicated this:
The Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr David Murray, signalled fee increases last week and his chief financial officer, Mr Michael Ullmer, did not back away from that stance yesterday.
`The very fact of a G.S.T. prima facie—the bulk of it not being recoverable by banks—must lead to an increase in revenue to cover the increased tax,' Mr Michael Ullmer said.
In the same article, the Executive Director of the Australian Bankers Association, Mr Tony Aveling, said that the original $260 million cost to the industry of the GST had increased since the deal with the Australian Democrats and the decision to defer the abolition of bank taxes. The article states:
""The likelihood is that at least some of that will be passed on to consumers,"" he said. ""But the abolition of the financial institutions duty in July 2001 would cancel out the higher fees.""
However, in the meantime consumers, including pensioners, will have to carry the increased bank charges.
On top of this, the government has shown appalling timing in introducing this legislation right in the middle of the International Year of Older Persons. You would have thought this caring coalition government would have introduced some legislation during the International Year of Older Persons that resulted in some benefit to older people. But no, all of its decisions and legislation regarding older people are designed to make life harder for these people. In fact, the only attempt to introduce a debate on issues relating to the International Year of Older Persons was the private member's motion that I put on the Notice Paper and which was debated on 31 May.
This private member's motion referred to issues relating to the employment of people in the latter period of their working life. This issue goes directly to the issue in this legislation, and that is the ability of people to accumulate sufficient assets to provide for their needs and perhaps for their family in retirement. The motion also gave members of this parliament the opportunity of raising general issues relating to older people. But the time allocated for this debate was less than usually applies in debates of private members business. If I recall correctly, there were three speakers, each of five minutes duration, compared with the usual time allotted to private members business of up to 30 minutes. I would say that the government and the parliament have given very little consideration in this International Year of Older Persons to the issues affecting older people.
On that occasion, I spoke about the government's decision in the 1996 budget to force unemployed people over 55 to run down their superannuation entitlements before having access to unemployment assistance. That decision directly impacts upon the legislation before the parliament today be 
 cause it is a retrospective tax on the assets of older Australians. In that debate, I said:
What has not helped these people is the decision in the 1996 budget to remove the exemption in the social security means test for superannuation and rollover benefits for unemployed people between the age of 55 and the aged pension. Fifty-five seems to be the age that a lot of employers think is a good age to ease older persons out of the work force. However, many people in this particular age group still have financial commitments—children at school, mortgages and various other debts arising from supporting a family.
The shadow minister, the member for Lilley, has drawn attention in his speech to the appalling policy process that this government obviously engaged in when it was drafting legislation such as this. None of the various bodies that represent older people—such as the National Seniors Association, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation and Welfare Rights—was consulted prior to presenting this legislation. The member for Calare has reminded this House that the National Farmers Federation, which also clearly have some concerns about how this legislation will affect people in rural areas, were not aware that this bill was being debated today. The government has not consulted very widely at all on this particular issue.
Once again, the government is moving quickly to close the gap, even though this bill still has to be debated in the Senate. It has set a retrospective operating date of 1 July this year. From this date, any pensioner who gifts over $5,000 to assist their family will have their pension reduced. Of concern to all in this parliament is the advice that this bill and its schedules refer to a bill or act that simply does not exist. The explanatory memorandum to this bill drew attention to this:
New item 127 provides that, where this Act commences on or after 1 July 1999, amounts paid prior to royal assent under the existing disposal rules are protected from recovery insofar as the provisions of this act are concerned.
We are advised that the proposed item 127 refers not to this bill but to a bill or act named `Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security—Disposal of Assets) Bill 1999'. Such an act does not exist and there is no bill by this name before the parliament. 
What on earth is happening to this ministry? The minister wants to retrospectively nobble the pensioners from helping their families and then presents a bill that refers to legislation that does not exist. Clearly, the intention to nobble had far higher priority in the mind of the minister than the need to properly draft this bill. The attitude of this government towards our older persons borders on the offensive as they take every policy decision they can that severely affects the financial wellbeing of persons who deserve much better.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—The purpose of the Social Security Amendment (Disposal of Assets) Bill 1999  is to reduce the amount of assets that a pensioner may give away each year without that gift affecting their pension. The allowable amount of gift in any one year will be reduced from $10,000 to $5,000. Within the Social Security Act, the provisions of the assets test rules mean that an unapproved gift, for pension criteria purposes, will be deemed to be still held by the particular pensioner for five years after that gift has been made. Many pensioners find themselves in the position of wanting to help family members in times of financial or other crises, and we on this side of the House do not believe that the $10,000 limit has been or is unduly generous.
In my opinion, this is just another example of this government tightening up on rules that affect our older citizens. Unfortunately, we have seen many examples of this over the past three years or so, and here we see yet another. The government says that it has to do this because some financial advisers are apparently directing recipients of part or full pensions to lighten their bank accounts to ensure that they continue to receive the maximum pension entitlement. I am not one for a moment to support the falsifying of any financial situation merely to receive what you do not really need. The big question here is: where is the evidence of overwhelming rorting? What number of pensioners are giving away, year after year, $10,000 after $10,000 merely so that their assets or income 
 test remains favourable by that whisker required?
The truth is that there can be no evidence. We have not had it displayed by the minister, and I am sure that, if it were there, we would have seen it. Again and again, the government has unfortunately displayed an attitude towards those in our community who rely on assistance—the unemployed, the elderly, the ill and those with a disability—that they have to prove their honesty or their need. Until then, the government will assume that the majority of them are rorters and cheaters, and they will be treated accordingly—and coincidentally, at the same time, savings appear to be made. But when we look at the estimated savings predicted through this measure—$766,000 in 1999-2000, $1.9 million in 2000-01, $3.1 million in 2001-02 and $4.4 million in 2002-03—I have to question the effect that this will have on the genuine cases out there balanced against these small savings, small in the grand scheme of things.
As for the retrospectivity of the bill, I know that the measure was announced in the budget, but nothing is a sure thing until this parliament passes the legislation. I was interested to hear the shadow minister in his address to the House on this bill draw attention to this measure—this mean-spirited piece of legislation that has been presented by the department in its own publication, Age Pension News, as a law. What audacity and what respect for the processes that we are all in here participating in! What really concerns me the most is the impact that this will have on those who, through much difficulty, are in a position to offer some assistance to their family and who also happen to qualify for a pension at the same time. I know of quite a few people—and I am sure that many members in this place do also—who proudly and quietly step in when family are in a spot of bother, when they face a crisis and need a hand. Family is something we often hear of from that lot opposite. Family is something that we should promote and reward when they stick together.
We agree with those sentiments. But under this rule, if you are in a family where the older members need the support of a pension 
 and your family finds that a crisis is facing you—an illness of a child, an accident affecting the main breadwinner, financial pressures through unemployment or any other of these many examples—your family is going to be told that they can assist only to the tune of $5,000 in one year maximum before they themselves are financially affected. As I said earlier, I am not in favour of allowing people to falsely manipulate their financial circumstances to receive what they do not need, but I do believe that the previous gifting limit of $10,000 a year was adequate. As I also said earlier, no evidence has been put forward either that $10,000 was proving problematic or that there had been massive rorting to necessitate this legislative change.
What I think has necessitated this change is unfortunately the mean-spirited, small-minded, suspicious approach of this government. You cannot, on the one hand, demand that families look after their own—as in the youth allowance legislation to name one good example—and then, on the other hand, remove some of the ability for family to support family as you are doing in this legislation. You cannot continue to claim that you are a government for the families of Australia—warm, fuzzy, feelgood words that we hear constantly—while at the same time we see deeds like this. An amount of $5,000 in one year is not a great lot of money. Some funeral expenses perhaps? Some money towards some favourite grandchild's first car? Some support for a young student needing help with living expenses? A couple of grandchildren who happen to get married in the one year? Maybe, unfortunately, a grandchild born with an illness or disability and the family needing some financial help? There are many reasons why someone may wish to assist their family.
We must keep in mind those poor folk who work in the Centrelink offices and who will now have some additional tasks to do in keeping tabs on when that $5,000 limit is reached. How are they are going to tell and counsel those who may have gifted over $5,000 between 1 July and whenever this pathetic piece of legislation sees the legal light of day that they have to lose some of 
 their pension retrospectively? All I can say is, `That's a really nice one, Minister.'
Is it really worth suggesting a rethink on this issue? Yes, it is. I always like to believe in the commonsense and the fairness of those opposite. I say to them: do rethink this, it is not good policy and it is just so unfair and needless. Offhand, I can think of at least half a dozen families in my electorate whose members I have come to know through unfortunate circumstances having driven them into my office over, say, the last 12 months. In every case they have relied upon the assistance of older members of their families. Unfortunately, in some cases those older members have not been in a position to offer them anywhere near $10,000, even though some of them have.
The point is, as I said a moment ago, you cannot bring one piece of legislation into this House which demands that family look after family and another piece that demeans that same theory. The $10,000 limit has proven adequate. It has not, to my knowledge—nor to the minister's knowledge because he has not come clean on it—been something that has been overrorted. Considering the amount of administration it will take and the minor, meagre amount of money in the grand budget scheme of things it will save, I would really like the minister to come clean about the motive for this. The motive is pretty pathetic.
If families are in a position to offer this sort of assistance, they should be able to do so without this bind being put upon them. They should be able to be free within those limits that have been placed there—limits which appear to have been working quite well—for that to continue. There are members on the other side of the House whom I know, those I work with on committees and those I have got to know through the processes of this place, who I truly do not believe would be very much in agreement with this if they were to look upon it in relation to their own electorates. I give them all the power of my encouragement to have the ability and the courage to stand up and say within their own party room, `Minister, this is quite dumb, this is stupid.' In the meantime, I will continue to 
 join with my colleagues in opposing what I think is really dumb public policy.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—The opposition will not be opposing the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  which is now before the House. This legislation seeks to make a series of amendments to nine pieces of legislation that come within the ambit of this area of portfolio responsibility. These vary from amendments of a minor technical nature to amendments of more substance which are aimed at improving the efficiency of existing legislation and consistency of application and, in one particular case, amendments which relate to what are considered by some to be very important philosophical issues, which I will refer to later in my consideration of this bill.
For the public record, the nine acts amended by this legislation are the Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991, the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987, the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 1996, the National Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Act 1992, the Primary Industry Council Act 1991, the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980.
Before I discuss this legislation in detail, may I offer my congratulations to the member for Wide Bay for his elevation to the agriculture portfolio. I have not had the opportunity to do so before on the floor of the House, and I thought it appropriate that I take the opportunity to do so during the consideration of the first bill that the minister brings into the parliament in his new responsibility. I think it is an honour for anyone, from any party, to serve the farmers, the foresters and the fishermen throughout Australia in the capacity of Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.
While it is the task of the opposition to create as many headaches as possible for the minister of the day, I am sure that, among the many headaches that we on this side of the House will be creating for the minister, the honourable member will derive a large amount of enjoyment from the privileged position he now enjoys as the minister for agriculture. I note that the minister has just come into the House.
Having said that, it is incumbent on me to say that it is our intention on this side of the House to retire this government at the earliest electoral opportunity. We will attempt to do that, Minister, without extreme prejudice in a manner which I am sure you understand fully and are familiar with, because the issues of the day that you are confronting—and your department and your constituency are confronting—are substantial. They are quite enormous.
The rural sector is an agricultural exporting sector; 80 per cent of its output finds its way into the international marketplace. It is a 
 sector that must deal with low commodity prices which in many cases have historically trended down. Farmers must contend with the fluctuating exchange rates in our financial sector, the vagaries of our climate and a general decline in rural communities, while at the same time trying to sustain a productive agricultural base in the sector. It demands not only a degree of sophistication from those farmers and other producers down the chain but also a fairly sophisticated response from government. Therefore, I wish the minister well.
I hope that the minister is able to achieve a degree of balance between his family and his ministerial responsibilities, because it is very important at this point for the rural sector to have an active minister in the bowels of government where senior members of the Liberal coalition really pay no heed and where the urban lawyers and stockbrokers in the Liberal Party really do not have the interests of farmers and their families at heart. I notice that the parliamentary secretary at the table, Mr Slipper, is having a gentle laugh at that. Of course, we know that the honourable parliamentary secretary has had a foot on both sides of the fence, so to speak. But I do wish the minister well, and I hope, as I said, he achieves a good balance between the responsibilities of his family and the demands of ministerial office.
As far as this omnibus bill is concerned, I note that the amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987, the Farm Household Support Act 1992 and the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 1996 are mainly technical amendments. They are there to correct minor errors in those acts. They are part of the normal ongoing tidying up process that relates to all legislation in this parliament and do not require extensive discussion here.
Schedule 1 of this bill relates to amendments to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994. As I understand it, the main thrust of the government's proposal is to amend the act to require persons who are objecting to a decision by the Registrar of Plant Breeder's Rights to lodge a fee before the objection is considered. It is also to require the unsuccess 
 ful party to any registration dispute to bear the cost of any test planting ordered by the registrar, and to allow the registrar to recover the cost of any test planting undertaken on behalf of another country.
The Plant Breeder's Rights Act was legislation enacted while Labor was in power. While the issue of PBR is not one that consistently headlines the rural press or the general media in the community, it is an issue of considerable complexity involving important philosophical and, I would say, commercial considerations. The act was conceived to provide commercial protection to breeders who had invested their money, skill and efforts to the development of new plant varieties and to provide a regulatory framework in which such claims could be scientifically tested and assessed. At the time, Australia had fallen behind its competitors in this area of development and the act was seen as an important mechanism to encourage private investment activity in such research in the face of declining public investment by state governments and other public institutions.
But there has always remained a tension between the commercial imperative in this area of the agriculture portfolio and the need to protect the public interest and common property rights that we all enjoy. Therefore, in our great democracy, we strive for balance between the pursuit of legitimate private interests and the maintenance of public good. Part of that process is to ensure that those who seek to garner profit from elements of the public domain justify in a transparent way the claims that they make with regard to the development of new varieties of plants. An equally important part of that process is to ensure that those individuals and organisations who have legitimate interests in contesting these claims are able to do so without undue impediment.
The amendments relating to the introduction of fees and the awarding of costs are intended to bring this part of the legislation into broad line with the principles that apply in other legislative areas. While the opposition has no argument with that principle, we would view with real concern any attempt to stifle the process of legitimate objection to the granting 
 of plant breeders' rights by individuals or organisations within the larger community. I have no quarrel with any objective to maintain the disincentive for frivolous and vexatious claims, as stated on page 2 of the explanatory memorandum, which was circulated to this House with the act. However, the proper operation of this legislation must at the end of the day ensure that adequate balance is maintained between the private and the public interest.
As an opposition, we will be monitoring the operations of these amendments very closely and we reserve our right at a future stage to revisit this legislation to ensure that our objectives are adequately met and to exercise the normal prerogatives of an opposition should we find that this is not so.
The amendment also ensures that the costs associated with any test growing conducted on behalf of another country here in Australia can be recovered in full by the appropriate authorities. This is a sensible amendment. The Australian growing conditions are conducive to the testing of certain varieties, and this provision may well assist plant breeders in Australia to gain access to other markets. It is an amendment that we generally support.
Moving on to schedule 2 of this act, amendments are being made to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to allow for uniformity in levy collection techniques and to generally improve the efficiency of collection of levies and export charges. In particular, these amendments incorporate settlement agents and solicitors into the legislation as collectors of levies and charges. The opposition does not have any objection to the amendments that are being proposed in this schedule. I have already mentioned the minor technical amendments to three acts which form the basis of schedule 3 of this act.
Let me now turn to schedule 4 which amends the Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Act 1992. This amendment replaces the name of the National Landcare Advisory Committee in the legislation with the Australian Landcare Council. The aim of that committee—now renamed the Australian Landcare Council—is to advise the 
 minister on natural resource management issues. The structure and functions of the old committee remain unchanged. I note that the chair of the Australian Landcare Council, as it will be renamed, is a former member of this House—I think he was the honourable member for Murray—Bruce Lloyd. Bruce is held in quite high esteem, I think, on both sides of the House and has taken an active interest in landcare issues over a long period. He pursues his chairmanship of that council with a degree of impartiality that we appreciate.
In the course of the last parliament, I did have cause to meet the chairman of the old committee and the new Australian Landcare Council on my travels as Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition. I happened to meet him in Darwin on one occasion when the committee was meeting there, as it does in rural areas. At that point in time, he offered the good assistance of his officers to brief the opposition on matters relating to landcare, and I did appreciate his gestures.
The landcare movement is one of Labor's great rural initiatives. It is worth going over some of the objectives of that program because it does occupy a central place in the agriculture portfolio, and will over the next decade. One of the major objectives of that program is to facilitate the development and implementation of integrated approaches to national resource management for the purpose of achieving efficient, sustainable and equitable management of natural resources in Australia, consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. Another objective is to promote community, industry and government partnerships in the management of natural resources in Australia and to enhance the long-term productivity of natural resources in Australia.
There are some great strengths of this great Labor initiative. It has brought the focus of resources within the Commonwealth on the problem of sustainable management of our natural resources. But one of the enduring benefits of the Landcare program is the way it has engendered partnerships in communities all across Australia. It has been a major agent in changing the culture of farming practice, 
 and I would say changing the culture of farming in Australia. One of the important things that it has done is it has brought quite disparate elements within the community together to grapple with some of the great problems that we face in maintaining the productivity of our agricultural base. Environmentalists, unionists, general members of the community, members of industry, members of local government, farmers, their organisations and women's networks have all been brought in under the umbrella of the landcare movement.
It is pleasing to see that the government has continued funding of the initiative. I do not endorse the particular source of the funds. They could have come out of general revenue, not from flogging off our great communications assets. There are many in rural Australia who would agree with me on that point. They would agree with me on two points. Firstly, they would agree that it was a great Labor initiative and worth continuing. Secondly, they would roundly condemn the government for flogging off one of Australia's great communications assets to continue the process of funding these sorts of initiatives. I would just say to the minister that the landcare network is very important to farmers in the communities, and I am sure that, as he moves about the rural sector as I do, he will gain an appreciation of that.
There is a concern in the rural communities at the moment about the future of landcare coordinators and the funding of those coordinators in rural communities. There is a degree of funding uncertainty, and I think the government ought to clarify that for those communities at the earliest opportunity.
I was recently in the minister's home state in central west Queensland and had cause to meet with farmers who are members of the Aramac Landcare Group who have a problem with the prickly acacia, as the minister would be aware. Of course, if we are going to come to terms with the problems that are posed in these very fragile environments by these noxious weeds that are spreading at an alarming rate and threatening the livelihoods of farmers and the communities which sustain them, these landcare groups are going to be 
 very important indeed in assisting government and opposition in formulating national strategies that have bipartisan support that can address some of these very substantial issues.
Schedule 5 of the act amends the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991. There are provisions under that act that allow for the establishment of a Grains Industry Council to advise the government on the strategic direction of the grains industry, following the privatisation of the Australian Wheat Board. This amendment removes that provision. Those industry councils were very important and broad sources of advice to government. I certainly hope that the minister has some other framework in mind that will deliver to him the appropriate advice from a broad cross-section of operators within the grains industry because it is, I would say, one of the most important primary industries in the sector and one on which the growth of Australian exports and the survival of many rural communities depend quite considerably.
Schedule 6 of this legislation amends the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. The name of the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council is changed to the National Rural Advisory Council. This occurs in light of the government's wind down of the Rural Adjustment Scheme, and the functions of the council are changed to remove reference to the scheme. Its primary role will now be to advise the minister on exceptional circumstances, payments and adjustment issues generally. This body, the new council, will advise the minister on rural adjustment matters, regional issues, matters relating to the declarations of exceptional circumstances and, of course, training issues as they relate to the rural sector.
I note that in the explanatory memorandum there is a requirement that this body report to the minister on any other matters that the minister requests advice on or information about. That is a fairly broad brief for anybody, I might say, and I hope the members of that committee are not shaking in their boots tonight over that broad provision in this legislation.
I think it is important that, in the face of the government's abandonment of the regional 
 development program in its first term of office, it does keep a handle on regional issues, particularly regional development issues. We were concerned at the time—and we expressed those concerns publicly both in this House and in the general community—that the government had abolished that regional development program. It took us a long time to persuade the bureaucracy, especially Treasury and Finance, that it was appropriate to develop a program of this type and to fund it out of general revenue, and it was disappointing that the government saw fit in its first term of office to abolish that program.
The rural sector has undergone enormous structural change over the past 15 years in response to both macro and micro economic pressures that have been brought to bear on the sector. We have seen significant changes to production techniques, the adoption of new technologies, the greater use of capital technologies on farm and, in the broad sense, a greater deregulation of markets. Those adjustment pressures are certainly not going to abate. The global pressures on the rural sector are immense, and both sides of the House note the importance of the forthcoming WTO round to the agriculture sector in this country. It is absolutely essential that we leave greater access to overseas markets so that not only do our primary producers survive but those who are employed in the value adding chain are able to maintain their employment in those firms operating in the sector.
I might make some reference to schedule 7 of this legislation which relates to amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980. The bill amends sections of the act dealing with inspection powers and record keeping in order to make prosecutions for misleading labelling easier. The proposed amendments do not impose new compliance measures but seek to clarify provisions which have made enforcement difficult and thus jeopardise Australia's ability to meet its international obligations under the EU-Australia wine agreement.
I want to make a passing point here about the issue of new compliance measures and costs on industry. We certainly agree with this amendment because it was done after con 
 siderable consultation with the industry and the government was seeking to not impose any more compliance burdens on the wine industry. But we do note that next year the government is going to impose a GST, a wine equalisation tax—which has the industry up in arms—and generally a new tax on the farming community, which the National Farmers Federation has stated will significantly increase compliance costs and burdens for the farming community.
We have always held the view that, when the government articulated the benefits of the GST to the rural sector, it overstated the benefits that would flow to the sector. It has always been our job to clean-up the mess left by Liberal and National Party governments and, as time pans out over the next five years, we will have to wind back and roll back the GST and once again put the rural sector in a more advantageous position than it will be with the introduction of this tax.
In conclusion, might I congratulate the wine industry on its recent export achievement. It passed the $1 billion export mark well ahead of schedule and it certainly earned the congratulations of all in this House for that magnificent effort. In 1997-98, over 50 per cent of our wine exports went to the European Union. The substance of this amendment will assist the wine industry in sustaining and improving its access to that market. I note also that the industry now exports 35 per cent of its production, and that percentage is rising.
I must say that, when I came to this portfolio and reviewed the rural industries that comprise the sector, this was one industry that really stood out—stood out in its ability to plan, to articulate a vision, to give a framework for new entrants coming into the industry and to encourage them to invest. It set out very clearly the goals that the industry needed to achieve. I note that it reached the export sales target in July 1999, which I think was five months ahead of the time it had—
—Eighteen actually.
—I am sorry; I stand corrected. I thought it was five months, but 18 months is even better, isn't it, Minister? It is a very significant achievement by the indus 
 try. It has come about by an industry developing a vision for itself—a vision of where it wants to go, giving encouragement to new entrants and investors, being export oriented, seeking to skill up those participants in the industry and investing in new technologies to the point where Australia is acknowledged to be a world leader in new wine techniques and new wine technology. It is an enormous achievement. It is a great achievement. It is an industry that is of vital significance to rural communities because of its linkages with rural tourism. I congratulate the industry on its achievement. I conclude my remarks by saying that we do not seek to oppose elements of this legislation, but there are some provisions in it and we will be watching the operation of those amendments very closely.",REPS,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,1999-08-23,"—Whilst I note the bipartisan attitude of the member for Corio, I will have to pass up his offer to right the agricultural industry when the Labor Party returns to power, and may that not be in my lifetime. I remember when Labor were in power and the favours they did us as farmers. Was it 22 per cent interest rates? I think it might have been. I think that probably caused more pain and grief in the rural sector than some of the horrific droughts which I worked through with previous ministers for agriculture and primary industries, Bob Collins and Simon Crean. To his credit, Bob Collins worked with primary industry and had a decent understanding of it being a producer himself. But there would be many out there who would dread the thought of returning to Labor and returning to the sort of economic management we saw.
Whilst on the issue of economic management, I pass over the highly important subject of low interest rates and turn to the introduction of a new tax system. I again correct the member for Corio by saying that in my experience and in the conversations I have had with the NFF—and I do happen to know the NFF reasonably intimately—they are looking forward to the introduction of a GST. They are looking forward to a reduction in wholesale sales tax. They are looking forward to lower diesel costs. Those are the sorts of things that the Labor Party opposed. I can 
 assure the House that the rural sector is sitting very comfortably with the coalition government at the moment and the reforms we have introduced, the economic management we have in place and the opportunities we are providing for the future.
As has been said about the  Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 , it covers a range of areas such as amendments to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act; the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act; the Natural Resource Management (Financial Assistance) Act; the Primary Industry Councils Act, an area in which I have a particular interest; the Rural Adjustment Act; and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act. These amendments in the main bring about fairness, conformity, uniformity and equity.
When we introduced the Plant Breeder's Rights Act we did so with the best intent of ensuring that the Plant Variety Rights Act was replaced with an act which would encourage the greater use of plant breeder's rights here in Australia. Plant breeder's rights are fundamental to ensuring that we get better varieties here to give our farmers a greater competitive edge and to ensure that we are able to compete on an unlevel playing field in the international marketplace. These proposed transitional arrangements contained under the amendments relate to affected applicants who, with the introduction of that new act, lost the opportunity to keep their applications relevant. These transitional arrangements look at reinstating those applications and, in doing so, will hopefully restore some of the fairness that was lost.
The purpose of the amendments to section 37 are twofold and cover the area of recovery of costs associated with testing a new plant variety when conducted at the request of another country. This again is an issue of fairness, of ensuring the integrity of the act and of ensuring that there is the opportunity for plant variety rights to be protected. Australia is one of approximately 43 countries which are members of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants. It is important that our acts work with regard to that undertaking. The amendment also has 
 the provision of sheeting home to the unsuccessful party in such a request for a test the cost of that test. This brings about even further equity because, whilst removing the opportunity for frivolous claims, it ensures that the party who is proved to be right is not subjected to the costs of that appeal. Again, as I have said, this will bring about a fairer approach to those participating under this legislation.
Some other changes have been introduced, and I will speak briefly about those which relate to the issue of record keeping in the PBR Office. Under the amendments, we are going to allow a single hard copy of the register to be maintained. This is just simply commonsense and is a cost-effective way of ensuring that records are kept, thus protecting the rights of the plant breeders while at the same time not fostering a bureaucratic industry. Section 21 extends the allowable time in which the PBR Office must be notified and respond when rights to a variety are assigned to another person. Amendments to subsection 80(2) clarify the time, manner and circumstances in which fees imposed under the PBR Act are paid to the Commonwealth and may be specified in the regulation. These changes are fundamental to cost savings in administration and are seen as merely a tidying up of an act which has already brought significant change in the way plant breeding operates here. They have wide industry support and, as I say, bring conformity to the 1991 convention of UPOV.
I will move to the issue of the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 and the amendments under that act. The basic aim is to rationalise levy and charge collection and make provision for the efficient and effective collection of primary industries levies and charges. Of course, these levies are a very important part of research. They play an important part in ensuring that our industry is able not only to control its destiny but also to remain competitive into the future. A number of areas have caused concern to those in charge of administering the act. Take the horticultural industry, for example. There have been instances, particularly in the area of horticulture in wholesale produce markets, 
 where intermediaries have taken the opportunity to urge the seller of the produce to either carry the burden of the levy or perhaps shun lodgment altogether. That obviously leaves those intermediaries and dealers in horticulture in the wholesale sense who abide by the act and pay their levies at a distinct disadvantage. Under these changes, we are aiming to tighten up the procedure and bring fairness in that area.
There is also some concern in the livestock industry, where sales of properties are conducted on a walk-in, walk-out basis. For those who are uninitiated, a walk-in, walk-out sale means just that. The buyer walks in, puts his money on the table and the seller walks out, basically leaving all plant and stock as well as the property there. In those situations, some anomalies have arisen in terms of the correct levies being paid on those stock. It is hoped that through the amendments that we are introducing here those loopholes will be tightened up. There has been some confusion in the area of processing as to who is actually responsible for the collection of the levy. The amendments that we have put in place define the proprietor of the processing establishment as the person legally responsible for the collection of the fee.
There are also some changes in regard to the rights relating to authorised persons. Whilst some may see this as an infringement on privacy, they are really there only to ensure that the act is carried out in an unimpeded, economical and efficient way. The area of resource management has been covered. As the member for Corio said, it really relates only to a name change. The changing of the National Landcare Advisory Committee to the Australian Landcare Council is aimed at better reflecting the independent status of that committee.
I noted some concern from the member for Corio about the consultative arrangements between the grains industry and the government. Many people have been involved in the grains industry and have led it at a state and national level. I am honoured to have been one of those. I will say, but perhaps I have a biased view, that that industry has spent a great deal of time in consultation with 
 government, with processors, with marketers, with handlers and, most importantly, with growers. One of my fonder memories as President of the Grains Council of Australia was of travelling Australia—there were some 22 grower meetings over three weeks—explaining the changes to growers and listening to their views on the changes that we saw as perhaps fitting in the new wheat marketing organisation, now known as the AWB.
During that process, we saw the introduction of the Grains Industry Council, which was intended to provide a forum of representation to the main sectors of the industry. But, as we showed through practical experience rather than bureaucratic imposition, the best way to have that interface is to actually get out there and do it. As the instigator of the strategic planning units, we also worked at ensuring that we consulted all sections of the industry. I can assure members opposite that that strategic planning process worked very well. We not only consulted those people directly involved in the industry but even went to the extent of contacting customers overseas. I am not sure how one could improve on the process. Over time it has certainly demonstrated that the concept of councils consulting with government and industry was basically not relevant. We saw this with the only other council that was in place, the Pig Industry Council, and that has also been abolished.
It has been five years since the Grains Industry Council was first given life. During that period, I have watched organisations like the Grains Industry Council move from strength to strength. Under its current solid leadership of John Lush and Bruce McClelland from Queensland, I have absolute faith that the body will continue, along with its associations at a state level and its affiliations with various marketing and processing bodies, to ensure that the interests of primary producers are taken into account.
One of the things that the member for Corio did get right was that rural industry, like practically every industry in Australia, is subject to continuous structural change. That structural change was assisted by the Rural Adjustment Scheme and by changes intro 
 duced by the member for Hotham and Senator Bob Collins during their tenures as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, but with a change of government and the advent of a new minister it was time to take a fresh approach. There has been a significant change of direction in the way that rural industry has needed to be guided and assisted and, whilst the Rural Adjustment Scheme did an excellent job, the government's Agriculture—Advancing Australia package has taken the next step.
In that change, there has been a redefining of the roles of the Rural Adjustment Scheme. Under this amendment to the Rural Adjustment Act, we will be looking at changing the name of RASAC, the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, to the National Rural Adjustment Advisory Council. Time moves on, and the needs of agriculture move with it. There is a far greater awareness in agriculture in 1999 of the need for things like strategic planning and greater education and training amongst those people who participate in that industry. To refer again to the NFF, there are some quite compelling statistics about the success of farmers and managers who have undergone basic training and skills upgrades in comparison to their colleagues.
The new Advancing Australia package is all about ensuring that we build on that new understanding. The role of the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council has changed significantly too. It will continue in its traditional role of advising on exceptional circumstances declaration, a process introduced by the previous Labor government—one which I have a great deal of support for. But the role and the experience now contained in what will be known as the National Rural Adjustment Advisory Council should be put to good use in advising on areas of rural adjustment generally, on regional issues and on the training issues that have now become so important in rural industry, particularly through the Farm Business Improvement Program. In the end, if you have that sort of intellectual base, you should draw on it for agricultural and rural issues generally.
Those changes will see the National Rural Adjustment Advisory Council play a pivotal 
 role in the future of agriculture and will be the fundamental parts of the Advancing Australia package, the most important of which is the area of the Farm Management Deposit Scheme. That is a great scheme introduced by the current government which will allow farmers to put money away in good times in preparation for those inevitable droughts, floods or commodity price drops. There are also other components such as the training packages and the restart scheme. If there is one weakness in that scheme, it is the Retiring Farmer Assistance scheme, which has been an abysmal failure. That, however, is under review. Hopefully, the new minister will be able to put in place a scheme which allows people of retirement age to pass on their assets to the next generation and allow that generation to prosper and make their future in agriculture.
In concluding, it would be remiss of me not to talk for a moment about one of the great success industries of Australian agriculture, and that is the wine industry. As the member for Corio said, it has undergone absolutely formidable growth in the past 15 or so years. It has grown since 1985-86 from an industry that was exporting $21 million worth of wine to an industry that is now at the door of exporting $1 billion worth of wine. The amendments that we have outlined to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation are merely to bring about a regime which will allow us to maintain the Australian wine industry's reputation for producing a world-class product by ensuring that false claims are not made about wine. This will ensure that correct records are kept and that the nature of these records is such that an unbroken audit trail is established from the grape to the sale of the product.
All in all, this is a broad range of amendments which will allow rural industry to continue only to prosper as it has done under the last four years of the coalition government. This government will introduce many other programs to ensure that rural industry prospers but, in looking back over the last four years and to see the turnaround in economic terms, the way in our government is addressing the issues of trade and competi 
 tiveness and the way we are moving to ensure that our producers have access to the latest varieties and the latest technologies—and the tax incentives to take up those technologies—I can only say that, while the coalition stays in government, rural industry will be the better for it.",REPS,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—At least the honourable member for Groom is not a lawyer or stockbroker, those who normally make up rural policy for the Liberal Party. He does come from out there towards the west of Queensland. He mentioned trade before he sat down. I remind him that the Tasmanian salmon industry, which is a nice big trading area for Tasmania, is not doing very well under his government. He might like to take that on board.
The  Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  makes some minor technical amendments to a number of acts. It covers a number of areas that include the Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991, the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987, the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 1996, the National Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Act 1992, the Primary Industries Council Act 1991, the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1990.
As the legislation covers a large number of areas, I would like to point out a few things about some of the minor amendments. I had a briefing on the amendments to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act. The amendments are to allow persons who are objecting to a decision by the committee who registers the plants the right to pay a fee before the objection can be considered and to bear the cost of any test plantings. This is because, if there is an objection, it can be quite costly to redo tests that prove individual plants, where trialling and a considerable amount of time getting them to grow are involved. Any particular plant takes a period of time and I understand that the cost is between $1,500 and $3,000. If a party is concerned to the extent that they believe a retrial is required, then it is appro 
 priate that whoever is in the right should not foot the bill. If the appealer is right, the costs should be awarded to the person who is registering the plant.
I do not think this should be seen from our side as preventing people, where it gets too costly, from having a right to a retrial or seeking some redress where they think they have been wrongly done by. By the same token, countries that are trying to sell a variety into Australia as a separate plant entity or phenotype should prove conclusively that their variety is different from any grown here. The tests sought to prove this should be charged to the country that is seeking entry. All this might become unnecessary, however, once genetically modified material enters the market. Plants that come under the plant breeder's rights legislation are distinguished by their look, colour, shape, shade, height or whatever—in other words, by the expression of their genetic material or phenotype. Once genetics come into it, it passes over to Genemac, another body that patents genetic material.
There is also a public interest problem in the legislation which has been partly addressed, but it really requires someone who is keen to keep their slightly altered plant to have it registered so that they can put their name to it. For any ordinary gardener or horticulturalist, this can be expensive if they are developing a number of lines. It is also expensive for a person who wishes to have a plant of that variety because the costs of registration must be passed on. I am told that plants you discover or identify as new in the bush are not considered in this way. Plants have to be modified in some way before they come under this legislation. Perhaps that is not much comfort for some but, as I said, I think this particular part of this legislation will probably become irrelevant in a year or two as the argument on genetically modified material comes into the registration field.
I want to comment on the changes to the Rural Adjustment Act, whose name this bill is merely changing. The Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council played a useful role and it seems that it is now part of another package and is to be changed merely because 
 it was put in place by the last government. This will confuse people and is unnecessary, being done because of politics rather than out of any necessity to change the name. They have, I believe, downgraded that Rural Adjustment Scheme and taken a different direction, but I think that it is a lesser scheme than the one that existed under the Labor government. Probably that is why they want to change the name of it or try to rebadge it. It probably does not serve any purpose. I understand from the shadow minister when he was speaking that the council can now report to the minister on anything it wishes or anything that he asks it to report on and, as he said, it is a pretty broad brief.
I would also like to mention the amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 which are to amend sections of the act dealing with inspection powers and record keeping in order to make prosecutions for misleading labelling easier. I am told that these do not impose new compliance measures but seek to clarify provisions which have made enforcement difficult and thus jeopardised Australia's ability to meet its international obligations under the EU-Australia wine agreement. The definitions being looked at are: `examinable document', which is amended to include all documents relevant to establishing the truthfulness of a claim made on a label, and `wine premises', as including anywhere it is reasonable to assume that wine or examinable documents may be located.
This is supposed to make existing record requirements explainable in more detail; thus the need for the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation to establish whether a wine is a blend or a single wine in order to prove that an offence has been removed. On face value this may look very simple and as if it will assist the wine industry. But I have a concern that it may be used against the small wine grower. If it is to allow wine growers to be clear regarding locally blended wines, that is fine. However, if it is to allow overseas wine to be blended with Australian wine, without having to spell it out in more detail, then I would have problems with it.
I still believe that the small wine growers of Australia are facing an enormous burden not only from a bad tax treatment but also, once the GST comes in, from being on the losing end of the deal. Also, I believe that the large winemakers of Australia get a very easy run at the expense of the smaller ones. As I have said previously, there are now two Australian wine industries: one is at the large end and is made up of four or so wineries, and the other is at the very small end and is made up of numerous small wineries, many of which are very important in assisting the tourist industry in regional Australia.
In Tasmania, wine is a relatively young industry. Many of our growers have been in the experimental phase and have not been marketing much of their product. Therefore, all the effort and ingenuity that has been put into Tasmania over the years is now being thrown away because with price the big players can just walk all over our growers. As we get into the new tax regime, it will be even worse for those smaller players.
Many of our people at the small end have invested thousands in setting up a viable small business with good markets and good export potential. But they must have some incentive, some assistance to make it worth while. Why else would they really bother getting involved in this area? The tax scheme this government is putting in place will do nothing for this growing industry, even though it is producing lots of jobs in rural areas. This government has no interest in small business and small growers in regional areas, and the way it treats the wine industry is a prime example of this. I do not believe that this government has an interest in any of the small players in the business. It is just open slather, with the big players calling the tune when it comes to lobbying government. This applies in all sorts of areas that cover rural pursuits. Australia is not in a good position to fight some of the competitive overseas arguments if these industries are being held back by government impositions, such as unfair taxes.
I am not sure why we are bothering to change the name of the National Landcare Advisory Committee. It is still an advisory 
 body and still carries out the same functions. This is probably just another change to confuse people and an attempt by the government to put its own stamp on it. It is certainly nothing new, but I suppose this government wants to be able to say in a few months time that it has set up a new landcare body. So we will be coming back and saying to those opposite, `Sorry, landcare was a Labor initiative, and a very good one at that. So you want to try to claim some credit for it yourselves; go on and try, but it won't wash.' Those opposite will put a new name on it and try to rebadge it, but I do not think it will work. I think you would have been better off just getting on and funding it properly and stop imposing so much paperwork on the people who are involved in the landcare area. We then would get even better results at the grassroots level.
I will just digress a little. I am not quite sure how farming awards in Australia get funded—and I am sure that they are not funded by primary industry levies and charges—but I would like to mention two of my constituents who have achieved a remarkable success in the Australian Prime Lamb of the Year Award. This was the first time that Graham and Cath Tole had entered their lambs in this competition. They did so because they wanted to assess how their stock compared with other stock on the mainland of Australia and to benchmark their flock. They were surprised to learn that they were the best, and they won the award hands down. It was a marvellous effort. It was a particular achievement for Tasmanian farmers who have little to compare their stock with. Graham and Cath Tole are fine farmers, fine Tasmanians and fine people, and it is a pleasure to know them.
We might be isolated in Tasmania, but it can lead to better practice of our producers with their continual striving to achieve more and something better. Of course, in the Tasmanian situation, one always has to try to be a little better, a little further in front because we are an island and, because of that, have extra burdens.
Mr Kerr interjecting—
—My colleague has interjected that we are better. We can be better. In many regards we are better, but we also have a lot of burdens placed on us which we have to overcome. But congratulations to Graham and Cath Tole on their very successful win competing against the whole of Australia.
Levies and charges can often be part of the promotional and marketing aspect of various industries that come under this particular series of bills. These charges are regulated by the industries and move towards self-help in those industries for developing markets, both within Australia and overseas. It seems that this government is trying to say that it has renewed Australian agriculture, but it seems that it is only continuing in the direction laid down during a very fertile period of Labor in office.
We opened markets that were not there before. We encouraged farmers to look beyond the farm gate and to get into measures that could not only influence the outcome but set the direction for their industry. This could be with their own newly developed products or a refinement of existing ones, but we encouraged them to constantly look ahead. There was benchmarking, there was world best practice and there has been a move towards brand names rather than commodities—and that is the future of primary industry and things we produce. We must add value to those commodities and get the brand names out into the world market.
This is a direction in which Australia must move if country people are to survive, and it cannot be done in isolation from the rest of the community. If we are to help our primary producers, it must be through the development of infrastructure that helps the individual prepare for the world market. That infrastructure can mean transport, communications or the existence of local services such as shops, banks, schools, et cetera. In this way, busy producers will not be required to go out of their area and waste valuable time. It is time that we stop separating our primary producers from the rest of their communities and help them be a part of the survival of the small communities by providing the necessary infrastructure for all to remain there.
On the surface this bill is merely a method of changing a few names and other minor stuff. However, in order to get proper assistance for the wine industry, when are we going to start tackling problems like produce dumping? When are the finance companies and banks going to give people in rural and regional areas a chance to invest in their communities without penalising them?
As I said earlier on, this government's rural and regional policy has usually been made by the stockbrokers and lawyers of the Liberal Party. They are the ones that have been setting out where they want rural policy to go. Some of those members sitting on the government's back bench ought to start taking up some issues about regional Australia and start putting them into their policy areas. They failed dismally in the last government and have also failed so far in this one. The member for Barker and the member for Groom who spoke before me do not seem to be having too much luck making any inroads in getting the government to spend a bit of money in regional Australia and to put in some infrastructure.
We are continuing to see Telstra sold off, with lost opportunities there for the people in rural Australia. There is a need to get people out there on to the Net so that they are able to use the valuable information that can come to them and they are able to seek information very quickly. It is essential for the future of rural Australia that people be able to undertake education and training using modern communications. This government has a few little schemes floating around that are funded out of some of the money from the sale of Telstra, but it really is not fair dinkum about bringing all those communities out there up to date and allowing them to compete on an equal playing field with even the rest of Australia, let alone the rest of the world.
So those backbenchers have a fair way to go. This sort of name changing exercise is doing little for the real issues of the day. We will support this bill, but it does not really amount to very much for regional Australia.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,1999-08-23,"—I congratulate the previous speakers for their 
 contributions on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 . I note the general bipartisan agreement of the opposition, as indicated by the member for Corio and the member for Lyons, and accept they will always say that their programs were better and that they will always do better when they get back in government.
I found it interesting that the well researched contribution from the member for Lyons noted the phenotype schedule for PBR varieties. Phenotypes are all about visual and productive characteristics and, for all intents and purposes, it is quite a satisfactory area for judgment. However, I can see into the future where genotypes with DNA testing will become an issue and will cause further amendments to this sort of legislation.
I noted that the member for Lyons talked in jest about stockbrokers and lawyers making agricultural policy for the Liberal Party and, frankly, that is absolute rot. It shows a complete lack of understanding of how agricultural policy takes effect and how it is produced in the Liberal Party. We in the Liberal Party take a very strong interest in the agropolitics groups throughout the country. I know, for instance, in South Australia that the South Australian Farmers Federation and the National Farmers Federation have a very strong input and influence on our agricultural policy.
The  Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  is a very broad bill in that it contains about six different types of amendments. First, the bill contains amendments to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994, Rural Adjustment Act 1992, Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980, Primary Industry Councils Act 1991, Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Act 1992 and Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1981. However, I wish to speak on two of those issues only. Many of the previous speakers have spoken to the minor amendments, but I wish to speak on the amendments to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994 and on the amendments to the Rural adjustment Act 1992.
Firstly, dealing with the amendments to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act, as a primary producer myself I have many years of hands- 
on experience in seed production. For instance, my farm produces approximately 100 tonnes of lucerne seed annually, and the bulk of this is exported to markets in South America, Europe and the Middle East. I have a fair bit of experience on plant breeder's rights varieties—or PBR varieties, as we all know them. In seed production, I feel pretty well qualified to speak in this chamber on behalf of the seed producers not only in my electorate of Barker but also Australia wide.
The PBR system is a successful one that has worked well for seed producers for many years, because producers are guaranteed prices and markets, and the seed buyer is guaranteed the produce to sell. In my farming operation, I grow the PBR lucerne varieties of Quadrella, Sequel, Septre, Pioneer L69 and Pioneer L5939. They are grown under conditions specified by quarantine regulations to ensure quality in terms of germination, purity and absence of weeds. In fact, Quadrella was first grown in the Keith area and was the first lucerne variety in Australia grown under PBR—or, as it was then, PVR—legislation. So the Keith area has certainly got more experience in PBR varieties, especially of lucerne, than has any other area of Australia, if not the world.
In the Keith district alone, where I have been farming for the past five years, 80 per cent of Australia's lucerne seed is produced; and PBR varieties play a very important part in the production of lucerne seed. In fact, it could be argued that the Keith district on an area basis produces more lucerne than any other area of the world; so we could actually claim to be the lucerne capital of the world. As I said earlier, many of those varieties are PBR.
Without this type of legislation, primary producers would not have the capabilities to provide incentives for breeding new varieties or investing in new technologies, such as genetic engineering or genetic modification. Of course, the plant breeder's rights used to be known as plant variety rights or PVR. However, since plants cannot possess a legal right, it was more appropriately renamed the Plant Breeder's Rights Act. This was why the PBR Act was introduced—to replace the 
 previous Plant Varieties Act of 1987, which reduced the contract period for many varieties from six years to four years.
These changes would have been made to ensure greater purity of sample, because cross-pollination over six years could mean at least twice the impurity of samples over four years—although at this point I must emphasise that purity, even after 10 years or more, is still quite acceptable. In fact, one could actually argue that, after 10 years, the persistence and longevity of those varieties could be better identified and bred.
Following the introduction of the PBR Act of 1994 by the previous Labor government, many applicants applied—only to find out that their allowable period for prior sale had expired up to two years earlier. The proposed transitional arrangement will allow affected applicants to have their applications reinstated by making claims within six months of the amendment's commencement. This will apply to varieties first sold overseas between 10 November 1988 and 9 November 1990. Certainly, Quadrella, as a lucerne variety, would come into that and there would be quite a few producers in the Keith area who would be covered by that.
The purpose of the amendments to section 37 is twofold. Firstly, they ensure cost recovery by the Commonwealth for the testing of new plant varieties conducted at the request of another country, even if no application is lodged for the variety in Australia. This might apply to a lucerne variety such as Pioneer L5939, which is not sold in Australia but is grown here for export to other countries where it is better suited to the climate and environment.
Secondly, the act alters the way in which test costs are covered when there is an objection to an application. As previous speakers said, the proposed amendment ensures that the unsuccessful party will bear the costs of test growing, which is a financial barrier to a successful objection, but this amendment will also be a financial barrier to frivolous claims. So, just as in any legal case, you have a judgment to make about whether you should make an objection. Under the present situation, frivolous claims can be made and there 
 is no protection for the person who wants to register that phenotype.
It is also proposed that a single hard copy of the register of varieties also be included on the Internet. This will save the significant cost of the requirement to maintain a copy of the register—which, I have to say, as a small seed producer myself, is hardly ever used, if at all. It seems that we have had a fairly high cost for very little use, and so it will put it on one register which is easily accessible on the Internet and is still available to be asked for by any breeder or anyone involved in the industry.
The amendments to subsection 21 extend the time in which the PBR offices must be notified when variety rights are transferred. These are certainly in line with standard business procedure, and I certainly think that they would not cause any problems to anyone involved in this industry. These amendments have wide industry support and have been solidly endorsed by the PBR Advisory Committee, which is made up of breeders, users and consumers. Certainly, in speaking to the people in my district who have a very strong involvement with this, I know that they certainly have no problems with it and in fact welcome it very strongly.
I also wish to comment on another part of the bill that deals with the amendment to the Rural Adjustment Act of 1992. As many members would know, the Rural Adjustment Scheme of 1992 was, to put it bluntly, pretty useless. In fact, it was about as useful as a wheel on a walking stick. It was basically a welfare program. It did not actually promote any effective farming operations in Australia and really did not put people on the right track.
As many members would know, the Rural Adjustment Scheme effectively ceased to operate 13 months ago, on 1 July 1998, and was replaced by the government's Agriculture—Advancing Australia, or the AAA package. As I said, the Rural Adjustment Scheme was not effective in fostering profitable productivity measures in the farm sector, as identified in the 1997 review, so it was wound down and replaced with a more effective program. This AAA program is indeed 
 AAA in comparison with the Rural Adjustment Scheme in its effectiveness in increasing the profitability, competitiveness and sustainability of the farm sector and encouraging self-sufficiency and innovation.
Some of these initiatives include the Farm Business Improvement Program—well known as FarmBis—which in a rural electorate such as Barker is proving to be both popular and effective, because it provides financial assistance towards training in financial planning, risk management and resource management. I certainly know from my own experiences that farming operations—whether they be stud cattle, stud sheep or commercial operations—are certainly taking to this part of the program with great endeavour.
Then there is the Farm Management Deposit Scheme, which is a management tool to reduce financial risk, with saving initiatives and tax concessions. This allows farmers to help themselves. Then there is the Farm Family Restart Scheme, which provides a safety net for struggling farmers with adjustment assistance for those wishing to leave the industry. Hopefully—and I have no doubt that it will—this will also reduce the high suicide rate that is often associated with the decline of a family farm after many generations. This is a serious thing, because often they might be the fourth, fifth or sixth generation farmer, and they see themselves as failures. We, as a government, can assist them to leave the industry with dignity, to give them counselling so that they do not go down that track of rural suicide which, unfortunately, is one of the biggest problems that we see in rural areas. So I am certainly very pleased that the Farm Family Restart Scheme is up and running, and I am pleased to be part of a government that is putting that forward.
Then there is the retiring farmers assistance package, which provides a three-year window of opportunity until 14 September in the year 2000. Qualifying age pensioner farmers who wish to transfer the legal title of the family farm to the younger generation will be able to do so without affecting their pension eligibility. That is pretty important because, unfortunately, our farming generation has tended to age in the last 20 years. It can be 
 said that the average age of farmers is 60 to 61. But if we can encourage that transition from the patriarch—or in some cases the matriarch—to the next generation, I think we will see innovation and new ideas. If we can encourage that by ensuring that they are no longer ineligible for the pension, I think that is a good thing. These amendments are necessary. Most of them are very minor but very sensible, and certainly I support their passing.",REPS,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—I will not hold up the House for a long period, but I want to comment on an aspect of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  that concerns the amendments that propose that there be a new advisory council to deal with matters relating to declarations of exceptional circumstances. I wish to raise the issue of the government's decision to request that the application for exceptional circumstances for chicken farmers on the New South Wales Central Coast be withdrawn and perhaps resubmitted at a later date.
I am pleased that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will be summing up soon. He might have an opportunity to respond to some of these matters or perhaps he could take them on notice and provide me with a letter in reply. Either way, I seek his assistance in undertaking an urgent review of the decision not to grant an expeditious agreement to the application for exceptional circumstances by these farmers.
I am sure you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, that a few months ago we had an outbreak of a virulent strain of newcastle disease on the New South Wales Central Coast. We previously had a less virulent strain break out in Western Sydney and, unfortunately, a second outbreak of this less virulent form of newcastle disease has again taken place in Western Sydney. But the strain that was discovered on the New South Wales Central Coast was so virulent that the authorities decided that two million chickens needed to be killed. Up to 900 people from the various emergency services organisations were deployed to ensure that strict quarantine was imposed on that part of the New South Wales 
 Central Coast. That meant not only the expenditure of a very large sum of money by the government to mobilise those emergency services staff to impose the quarantine but also the loss of access to income for a period of six months, nine months, up to a year, for the chicken growers and for the contractors who work for the chicken growers.
The difficulty at the moment is that the message that the local chicken growers are receiving from the authorities is that this application for exceptional circumstances will not be determined until at least the new year. Many of these chicken farmers are in dire financial straits. They are grateful for the assistance that has been provided to date—there has been some assistance provided by the federal government in various decisions—but many of these families have never been dependent on social security in the past. They are facing very difficult financial circumstances at the moment, and they are seeking from the government a reconsideration of that decision not to grant exceptional circumstances.
The exceptional circumstances provisions are there to help farmers who are affected by drought, flood or bushfires. I argue very strongly that the outbreak of newcastle disease on the New South Wales Central Coast meets the requirements for exceptional circumstances. It was a rare, unforeseen and severe catastrophe for those farmers, for those families. There is no way in the world that anyone could argue that it is common for there to be a spontaneous mutation of the commonly found but non-virulent newcastle disease into the rare virulent form of newcastle disease.
On the first ground, it is clear that this will be a rare event—and please God that we do not get these outbreaks continuing to occur. It certainly was unforeseen because we have never had this strain of newcastle disease in Australia before and it has certainly been severe. For these chicken farmers it has meant they have had no income for a period of six months and that could go to 12 months or more. This not only affects the chicken growers, it affects the contractors and the staff who are employed by the chicken growers. It 
 affects the contractors who do work for the chicken growers and, for the New South Wales Central Coast, it means that there is about $20 million of income that is not getting ploughed into the Central Coast economy because of this dire outbreak of disease in the Mangrove Mountain area.
This affects the constituents of the member for Robertson more than it does my constituents—although, there are a small number of my constituents who are directly affected by this outbreak—but large numbers of the residents of Dobell are employed directly or indirectly through the money spent by people involved in the chicken growing industry. The Saturday before last the member for Robertson and I had the privilege of attending the Mangrove Mountain Recovery Committee's discussions on ways that they can help the community recover from the outbreak of this disease. I certainly picked up a very strong message from the chicken farmers at that meeting that they want the government to make a decision on this application for exceptional circumstances now rather than have it deferred for another period of three months, six months, nine months—who knows how long.
I understand that some members of the government are claiming that this decision that no decision be made is supported by my state Labor colleague in New South Wales. That claim has been made. When it was passed on to me, I immediately rang Mr Amery and his office denied completely any suggestion that the New South Wales state government supports deferral of the decision on the application for exceptional circumstances. Even if the state Labor government were agreeing to defer this, it is an issue that should go beyond party politics. We should be prepared for the federal government to treat the chicken farmers who have been hit by this rare, unforeseen and severe catastrophe on the New South Wales Central Coast in the same way as we would treat those affected by flood, drought or bushfire, because they are also rare, unforeseen and severe.
These people and their families have been badly damaged by the outbreak of this disease 
 and the imposition of this quarantine. The least we can do is ensure that these farmers are treated in the same way as those who grow other crops. I appeal to the minister for agriculture to agree to an urgent review of the decision not to grant exceptional circumstances and I would be grateful if he could respond verbally now. I know a detailed written application was submitted to the government. If he is not prepared to respond tonight, I understand and I would be more than happy for him to take this on notice and provide me with a response in writing.",REPS,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Truss, Warren, MP",NP,1999-08-23,"—Firstly, I thank all of those who have contributed to the debate on this legislation, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 . I want to thank the honourable member for Corio for his kind comments on my appointment as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. As he rightly points out, this is the first piece of legislation I have had to deal with in this portfolio. Indeed, it is a piece of legislation that was introduced by my predecessor and I merely have the honour to respond to the debate tonight and complete its passage. As has been mentioned by a number of speakers, it is a relatively non-controversial omnibus piece of legislation which makes improvements in a number of areas of primary industry legislation.
I also express to the member for Corio my wish that we can work cooperatively together. I am more than happy to always provide to the opposition appropriate briefings on issues that are of importance and to make sure that the opposition have access to the necessary information to come to a position on legislation before the House. I also compliment the members for Groom and Barker on their very knowledgeable contribution on these issues. They both have a long history of association with the issues under consideration in this bill and I found their comments very helpful. I also recognise the contribution by the member for Lyons and, more recently, the member for Dobell who raised the issue of the crisis confronting a number of chicken growers in 
 the Mangrove Mountain area in New South Wales.
I certainly recognise the difficulties they face. Their plight has been the focus of considerable attention. Newcastle disease is one of the most hated and horrible diseases that can confront the chicken industry and, for that matter, almost any of the animal raising industries in the world. Indeed, as a nation, we have always prided ourselves on the absence of newcastle disease. It has been used as a reason why we should not be too liberal in allowing imports into this country, so it really strikes hard at our nation as a whole when the disease is discovered not once but three times in various mutations in Australia. It is our view that it is a local mutation—if that is any comfort—but that, nonetheless, it is a matter of great importance to the chicken industry and, for that matter, all those who care about the wildlife of our nation, because there is this great capacity for it to spread to other bird species.
There is in place a national program involving the states and the Commonwealth to address these sorts of issues. The key is obviously to make sure the disease does not spread and that it is wiped out as quickly as possible. The state government, in this case the New South Wales government, takes the lead but the Commonwealth has been very supportive of New South Wales in this quite horrible task of having to kill and dispose of close to two million birds. We estimate that that operation will cost around $10 million—so it is no insignificant amount—but it is something that had to be done for the sake of the industry.
I am conscious also, though, that the effect not only is on the chicken industry of the nation but also falls particularly heavily on those farmers whose livestock have to be destroyed. The member for Robertson has been especially active in drawing to my attention, to my predecessor's attention and to the Prime Minister's attention the needs of the farmers in his particular area, and I note that some farmers also come from the electorate of the member for Dobell.
The government has taken a number of initiatives. When it was clear that many of 
 these farmers might not readily qualify for Farm Family Restart or other social security type measures available, the government took a quite unprecedented step in making ex gratia payments available to the farmers, irrespective of their assets. That was a much appreciated gesture.
Some 95 farmers have benefited as a result, but those payments were made available only until the quarantine was lifted. Gradually, and now in most cases, the quarantine has been lifted. Farmers have generally received one or two payments after that period, but the government's commitment concluded once the quarantine on the farm was lifted. I understand there might still be one or two farmers left who are receiving the benefits because their quarantine has not been lifted, but that is only a relatively short-term thing for them as well.
The honourable member for Dobell is correct in saying that the New South Wales government has lodged an application—I think it would be fair to describe it as that—for exceptional circumstances declaration for these particular producers. The exceptional circumstances provisions were introduced by this government to extend upon the previous arrangement which basically applied to little more than drought. There is now a wide range of incidents that can lead to a triggering of an application for exceptional circumstances, and it is certainly not out of the question that a newcastle disease outbreak of this nature could be sufficient to qualify for exceptional circumstances.
But there are a number of criteria, and these criteria were agreed between the Commonwealth and the state agricultural ministers, including Mr Amery, at the ARMCANZ meeting in March this year, and they were reaffirmed at the latest ARMCANZ meeting. I accept that there has been some misunderstanding, if I may put the most charitable interpretation on it, amongst some of the states of all political persuasions as to the kinds of circumstances which might lead to an exceptional circumstance of declaration. Perhaps there has been an overlooking on occasions of what the criteria actually are.
It is not meant to be something that will turn up quite often. It is meant to be only in exceptional circumstances. So one would expect that all other kinds of possible areas of assistance would have been exhausted first. In this case, the arrangements for the eradication of disease were obviously triggered and considerable expenditure was incurred in that regard. In some other cases there is a natural disaster relief declaration, and that is a more appropriate means of dealing with the issue.
In this case, there was a request also for exceptional circumstances, but amongst the criteria it not only has to be a severe and unforeseen event but also has to have a long-term impact—at least 12 months or more—on the producers concerned. It is not possible once an event has occurred to make that determination early. That is the reason why there is a suggestion that this matter should be considered in a few months time once it is clear what the level of disadvantage is and how long the effect will be on these producers.
There are a number of other related factors affecting the producers of Mangrove Mountain, including, it seems, undue long delays in some instances in having the farms restocked. I certainly call on the parties involved to not delay unduly in restocking the properties that are cleared of their quarantine requirements. It certainly would be unreasonable to expect the taxpayers to provide assistance where a normal commercial business arrangement has not worked effectively.
Ironically, I met only 10 minutes or so ago with the member for Robertson to further discuss these issues and how the matters might be further progressed. I accept that perhaps there had not been a clear understanding amongst the states about what sorts of circumstances actually trigger exceptional circumstances. I hope that Mr Amery and others, following the last ARMCANZ meeting, now better understand that. I have certainly indicated to him that we are prepared to look at the issue once we are able to establish that all the criteria have been met.
—When? When is the earliest?
—It would seem that it would probably take another three or four months 
 before that situation could be adequately addressed, but that is basically an assessment for Mr Amery to make as to when is the right time to proceed with the further application.
Can I make two other points in the spirit of endeavouring to help the farmers concerned. The first is that, when the ex gratia payments were concluded, Centrelink wrote to all of the farmers concerned and drew to their attention the possibility that they may be eligible for the Farm Family Restart Scheme. You do not require exceptional circumstances declaration to be eligible for Farm Family Restart, and a number of those farmers have now qualified for Farm Family Restart, and that can go on for a 12-month period.
The New South Wales government has also made available a loan scheme—I think it is called the Premier's fund. I am told that many of the farmers are not finding that potential $20,000 loan accessible because the New South Wales government is requiring a first mortgage, which does seem to be a rather tough requirement if it is meant to be a genuine assistance measure for the farmers concerned. Maybe that is another area where the New South Wales government could be of assistance by making that loan assistance more readily available.
I think all members of the House would share in the concerns of the plight of the chicken farmers in that region. I believe the Commonwealth government has been generous in responding to their needs, although I recognise that many of the farmers are going through a difficult period and still face another few months, in some cases, before they will actually start to get a cashflow from chickens being restocked on their property.
In the interim, as I mentioned, I would encourage the farmers concerned to meet the appropriate assets and income tests and to look at the Farm Family Restart Scheme. If farmers are actually choosing to leave their industry—and I am not sure there are any—they may also be eligible for the farm exit package, which is a tax-free payment available to farmers who again meet those criteria. If there are other ways that we can be of assistance, I am talking on a regular basis with the member for Robertson about what 
 we might be able to do in that regard. Assuming the New South Wales government believes that they meet the criteria for exceptional circumstances, we might hear from them again in a few months time and then that application can be dealt with.
Let me remind the House also that the procedure for considering an exceptional circumstance involves an assessment by an independent committee. The Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council deals with these sorts of issues. It includes farmers and a cross-section of the industry, and it basically acts as an independent arbiter to decide whether or not the exceptional circumstances should be granted. I am sorry that I have spent a long time answering that matter, but I am sure it is a matter of interest to the House.
I will turn briefly to a few final comments on the legislation itself. The bill addresses a number of technical issues in the legislation administered by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The amendments to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act will assist applicants who have been affected by the change in 1995 to a four-year rather than a six-year period for prior sales. The amendments will also shift the cost of test growing on to the unsuccessful party rather than, as is the case now, on to the party who has objected to an application. This is obviously a much fairer approach.
The changes proposed to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act will improve how levies are collected. Levy rates will not change. The current provisions will be updated to take account of changing industry practices. Two existing organisations will be renamed. The National Landcare Advisory Committee will become the Australian Landcare Council. The Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council will become the National Rural Advisory Council.
For eight years, the Primary Industry Councils Act has provided for the establishment of a Grains Industry Council. These provisions have been overtaken by reforms in the industry, and it is now appropriate to repeal these provisions. The general power to establish policy advising councils remains.
Amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act will strengthen the integrity of labelling in the industry by allowing authorised inspectors to examine a wide range of records to confirm label claims. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 introduces a number of useful reforms. I commend the bill to the House.

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—The opposition supports the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1999  and the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 . These bills are, in a sense, technical in nature but they do set the scene for very important and substantive changes to our broadcasting arrangements in the coming few months with the conversion of analog television broadcasting to digital broadcasting.
The  Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1999  amends the Television Licence Fees Act 1964, which controls the calculation of television licence fees. The bill introduces a levy on commercial television licence holders for the next three years only in order to recover the cost estimated to be incurred by the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the ABA, in administering the provisions of the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Act 1998, the legislation which sets the framework for the conversion of 
 broadcasting television signals in Australia from analog to digital.
The cost is estimated by the Australian Broadcasting Authority to be $3.41 million over the next three years, which is broken down in the following way: in the 1999-2000 financial year, it is $1.21 million; that figure is replicated in the following financial year; and in the third financial year, 2001-02, it is $0.99 million. Each broadcaster's annual contribution is proposed to be calculated using the following formula: the ABA cost multiplied by the licensee's current fee divided by the total of all current licence fees.
It is expected that this additional levy will represent approximately 0.7 per cent of the total licence fees collected during each annual collection period. The individual licence fees will be calculated on the basis of gross earnings and, as a consequence, the annual licence fees currently collected and the marginal increase of 0.7 per cent will mostly come from metropolitan television licence holders.
In 1997-98, the most immediate preceding financial year, the Commonwealth collected $194.5 million in television broadcasting licence fees. So the ABA's estimated cost of $3.41 million is put in context when you appreciate the amount of broadcasting licence fees which are collected annually by the Commonwealth.
The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) makes technical amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 as a consequence of these temporary changes to the television licence fees regime. The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) will suspend the existing arrangements by which the ABA currently recovers its costs incurred through administering the broadcast regulatory regime from broadcasters through the licence fee system for the duration of the provisions relating to the digital conversion process.
The ABA currently recovers its costs on a fee for service basis, but it has indicated this formula would not be sufficient to recover the $3.41 million necessary to undertake the work required of it during the conversion to digital broadcasting. This measure proposed by the government was announced in the most recent budget. As I indicated at the outset, the 
 opposition supports the passage of both pieces of legislation. They do, as I indicated, set the scene for the conversion of Australia's television industry to digital production and broadcast. The conversion to digital TV sets the scene for serious and important issues which the government, the parliament and the public will need to consider in the course of the next couple of months and potentially into early next year.
The introduction of digital broadcasting in Australia is mandated by the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Act 1998, legislation enacted in the previous parliament prior to the October 1998 election. Amongst other things, the act specifies that broadcasters must commence digital broadcasting by 1 January 2001 in metropolitan areas and have commenced digital broadcasting in all regional areas by 1 January 2004. Broadcasts will be simulcast in both digital and analog format for the first eight years of digital broadcasting. Broadcasters will be required to broadcast a minimum amount of high definition TV broadcasting. Broadcasters will be able to use a proportion of their spectrum for the provision of datacast services but will be required to pay a fee in order to so do.
Broadcasters will not be able to provide multiple channels of broadcast content, multi-channelling, although the national broadcasters are not subject to the absolutism of this provision in recognition of their role in public broadcasting. No new entrants to free-to-air broadcasting will be permitted until the year 2006, domestic content standards will apply to the digital environment, and provision is there for the introduction of a new entrant or a new industry in broadcasting, datacasters.
In general terms, that sets the framework for the introduction of digital TV to Australia. As I have indicated, the framework was set in the conversion to digital act, the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Act 1998, but a series of issues were left to be determined by departmental and agency review, very many of which are currently under way and the important ones of which will be reported to the minister on the current timetable in September. It is currently expect 
 ed that the minister will report to cabinet in September and October for the government to make decisions in respect of these matters before the end of this year, although I notice in a speech made recently by the minister that he adverted to early next year. That is the first time I have seen that particular timetable.
Government decisions, when they are made and announced, will be the subject of intense public and parliamentary scrutiny. As the member for Dobell said, the former Minister for Communications who spoke in my stead when the digital conversion legislation was passing through this House, the devil is very much in the detail. It will be the detail of the government's decision which will be the subject of intense industry, public and parliamentary scrutiny. The difficulty with the devil being in the detail is that often you have to make sure you do not miss the forest for the trees. So I think it is important to have a look at some of the strategic objectives which we want from Australia's media and broadcasting industries before we descend into a consideration of some of those details.
I have argued previously that, if you take a line through Commonwealth public policy in respect of media and broadcasting, you can find a range of long-term objectives which the Commonwealth has generally sought to secure by way of media and broadcasting legislation. They include, in my view, media and broadcasting of high quality; a diversity of information, education and entertainment; a competitive industry with diversity and control of influence; the development and reflection of a sense of Australian identity and character, particularly through the national broadcaster originally and now the national broadcasters, the ABC and SBS; the development of new technology; and a viable, vibrant industry presence leading to jobs and investment. These are important long-term national strategic objectives which I think are important to bear in mind before descending into the detail of the conversion to digital TV through the review process.
What strategic objectives might we try to summarise those as being? Quality and excellence, diversity, competition, national identity, a vibrant national broadcaster or broadcasters, 
 an industry for the next century with jobs, and investment and economic growth that follow those parameters. These are the key strategic objectives which the Australian Labor Party has always found in media broadcasting and policy. I think you can probably find a strand of thought which is consistent with those objectives going through the Commonwealth's public policy approach to media and broadcasting over a long time.
It is very late in the night, Mr Speaker, so I might spend a couple of minutes with some modest and mild criticisms of the government's approach. These are big changes which the conversion to digital legislation sets the scene for, but I am not sure the government has applied all that much strategic thought to it. I am certainly sure the government has not sought to explain or educate the public about the vast series of changes about to be upon us. There has been no focus and no attention on these matters and these issues. I noticed the other day that, when the minister for communications, Senator Alston, had the opportunity at a digital television and datacasting conference in Sydney, all he could say to the audience in the end was, `All I can say is watch this space.' Unfortunately, either at a conference in Sydney or generally, watching this space is not enough.
I do not want my comments to necessarily prejudge any of these issues. We will await the government's decisions in these matters and we will, as I have indicated, scrutinise them very carefully. One of the key things which is now coming to the fore and which I will continue with in my remarks at a later stage is the very key question of affordability and accessibility. If the industry is to prosper and profit and if the community is to benefit from the conversion to digital television, then one thing which we must absolutely make sure of as a parliament and as a community is that these things are affordable and accessible so far as consumers are concerned.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,1999-08-23,"—I rise tonight to report on the passage in the Senate today of a motion from the Australian Labor Party to establish a Senate inquiry into the Brisbane airport master plan for the future construction of a western parallel runway. In doing so, I am honouring a commitment which I gave to a public rally of more than 4,000 Brisbane southside residents in February this year. Labor sought to establish this inquiry earlier this year, but with the loyal vote of Senator Colston the government defeated it. Today, however, the tables were turned and the government was defeated. The inquiry was established. For the first time in the 18-month history of this sorry saga of the Brisbane Airport Corporation master plan, the torch of truth is going to be shone onto the appalling process that has produced the master plan in its current state.
Why has the Senate inquiry become necessary? It is necessary because the Brisbane Airport Corporation has not been even faintly transparent in its dealings with the Brisbane community in the development of a proposal which, at the end of the day, is going to have a profound impact on the livability of many of the suburbs of Brisbane.
It is important to review the history of how we got this far. It began in March 1998 when the Brisbane Airport Corporation delivered their draft master plan. In doing so, and in recommending a parallel runway, they demonstrated three fundamental problems, which have endured until this day: firstly, their master plan did not examine any alternative runway options; secondly, it provided no flight paths for any of the options advanced, including the parallel runway which was their preferred recommendation for the future; and, thirdly, their proposition that if you constructed a western parallel runway it would put all noise, or a substantial part of the noise, out over Moreton Bay remains to this day unproven. These three problems remain until the present time. They have not been resolved.  
After three months of perfunctory public consultation, last year we had 4,000 public objections registered and more than 10,000 
 people signed public petitions, yet still the attitude of the Brisbane Airport Corporation remained unmoved. In July of last year, they submitted a final draft master plan to the minister. In August, the then Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mark Vaile, surprisingly decided to reject the draft master plan only six weeks before the October 1998 election. The reasons given were technical. I would suggest that the reasons were in fact substantially political. Mysteriously, the technical reasons were quickly overcome once the election was held.
In November 1998, the Brisbane Airport Corporation resubmitted their draft master plan to the new Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, for approval. No substantial change was made to the original recommendation. In February 1999, the new minister approved the master plan. Despite my having met with the minister and having requested him to come and look at those parts of Brisbane which would be affected by the recommendations of this plan, he refused to do so. He endorsed this master plan and established two conditions to it: (1) in the future the Brisbane Airport Corporation should look at some other options and (2) they should provide draft flight paths as well.
The next stage in this whole saga will be the development of a master plan. Of course, in the original document, the master plan has suggested that new capacity for Brisbane airport would be needed by about 2006-07, which means that, given a three- or four-year construction period, under the major development plan the final decisions would need to be taken in a year or two's time. Now we have the Brisbane Airport Corporation saying that that timetable is going to blow out and that this new capacity will not be required for quite a number of years into the future. The critical question which remains unanswered for the community of Brisbane is: when precisely will the Brisbane Airport Corporation advance their major development plan? Once it is approved, that is the last stage in the process. Construction then commences.
We get to the very final stage of the process in August of this year when the Brisbane Airport Corporation came out with a new 
 staggered runway proposal. In fact, this is the old parallel runway proposal given a new name. The same three problems which were evidenced with the original proposal of 18 months ago are the same today. No alternative runways or flight paths have been advanced, and the proposition that the bulk of use—in fact, one of the advocates has said 90 per cent of use—of take-offs and landings will be over Moreton Bay again remains unproven. It is for these reasons and these reasons alone that, 18 months into the process, we have been left with no alternative but to advance a Senate inquiry to get to the truth of this matter. We require an independent examination against five sets of criteria of all the runway options which are possible. Until that is done, there will be no rational basis on which to make a decision for the future.
