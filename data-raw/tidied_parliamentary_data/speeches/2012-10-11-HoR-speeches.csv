Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:18):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, and congratulations on your election. I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Clean Energy Amendment (International Emissions Trading and Other Measures) Bill 2012 and seek leave to move government amendments (1) and (2) as circulated together.


Leave granted. 




Mr COMBET:
  by leave—I move:


(1) Schedule 1, page 55 (after line 11), after item 80, insert:




80A  Paragraph 126(2)(a)



Omit ""a particular provision of Division 2 of Part 3 in so far as that provision"", substitute ""Division 2 of Part 3 in so far as that Division"".




80B  Paragraph 126(2)(b)



Omit ""that provision in so far as that provision"", substitute ""that Division in so far as that Division"".




80C  Subsection 126(4)



Omit ""provisional emissions number of the person for the relevant eligible financial year under a particular provision of Division 2 of Part 3 in so far as that provision"", substitute ""total of the provisional emissions numbers of the person for the relevant eligible financial year under Division 2 of Part 3 in so far as that Division"".


(2) Schedule 1, page 55, after proposed item 80C, insert:




80D  Subparagraphs 127(1)(d)(ii) and (iii)



Omit ""a particular provision of Division 2 of Part 3 in so far as that provision"", substitute ""Division 2 of Part 3 in so far as that Division"".


These amendments remove a potential ambiguity in some of the drafting of provisions of the Clean Energy Act 2011 concerning interim emissions numbers. The amendments ensure that there is no ambiguity about the application of the policy behind section 126 of the act. They make it clear that, apart from the specific circumstances set out in section 127 of the Clean Energy Act 2011, all liable entities for facilities will have an interim emissions number in 2012-13 and in subsequent fixed price years and will, therefore, have a provisional surrender obligation in those years.


The government made this policy position plain in paragraph 4.26 of the explanatory memorandum to the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and therefore there is no material policy change. It is simply a clarifying amendment. 


In particular, the two amendments make it clear that an interim emissions number is not dependent on having two provisional emissions numbers arising for a facility under the same provision of the Clean Energy Act 2011 for two consecutive years. Rather, they make it clear that a provisional emissions number for a facility may arise under different provisions of part 3, division 2 of the Clean Energy Act 2011 with respect to those years. I commend the amendments to the House.

Note: The Productivity Minister must cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of Parliament—see section 12 of the Productivity Commission Act 1998.




160C  No limit on Productivity Minister’s powers



      This Division does not limit the Productivity Minister’s powers under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Productivity Commission Act 1998.


When the price on the pollution package was agreed to, it was agreed to as a package. A number of people were coming from a number of different positions, all coming with goodwill, all wanting to see Australia take its first steps towards a clean energy future. As a result, there was a significant amount of negotiation, which is not surprising when you consider the disparate interests that were involved: Labor, the Greens and the rural Independents.


Ultimately there was agreement on the price to be put on pollution, even though people might have started from different positions and preferred a different outcome. There was agreement on the architecture, even though some people might have preferred that things had been a different way. There was agreement on the scope of what would be in and what would be out of this package of legislation, even though some people would have preferred the inclusion of certain kinds of transport, which were ultimately excluded because that was necessary in order to reach an accommodation. Agreement was also reached on compensation, not just to emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries but also to coal fired power stations, even though it was also a contentious subject.


I think that everyone involved in the discussions was and remains agreed on the principle of energy security—that is, it is important that the transition to a clean energy economy be made in a way that does not compromise the energy security of this country. There was debate, however, about the best and most efficient way of making the transition. We as the Greens, along with Professor Garnaut, said publicly that one of the best ways to ensure that the transition, as it affected coal fired power stations, did not disrupt energy security would have been to offer loan guarantees to coal fired power stations, which would have meant that the Commonwealth did not have to expend any money, that security would have been guaranteed and that the stations could have had an orderly transition out of operation as had been intended. But that was not the government's position, and ultimately the package gave what we consider to be quite generous compensation, over and above what we argued was necessary, to coal fired power stations. But we as the Greens agreed to the compensation because, under the energy security heading, was a very important part of the package: the agreement to pay for the closure of around 2,000 megawatts of the dirtiest coal fired power stations in this country.


I read from the clean energy documents, where it is stated under the heading 'Energy security fund':


First, there will be scope for payments for the closure of around 2000 megawatts (MW) of very highly emissions-intensive coal-fired generation capacity by 2020. This will start the process of replacing existing, highly polluting electricity assets with cleaner generation.


They go on to say:


Closing some of our highest-polluting coal-fired generation capacity will make room for investment in lower-pollution plant.


That is right, and it was a key plank of the package which was negotiated. The fact that this plank was included in the package allowed us to sign off on what we felt was overgenerous compensation to coal fired power stations. We did so because, on the one hand, they would be getting the money, but, on the other hand, around 2,000 megawatts of their generating capacity would be closed.


The government has since decided not to proceed with the closure of 2,000 megawatts of the dirtiest power production in this country. Either the government did not proceed because the minister who was responsible, but who is not the minister sitting at the table now, did not have his heart in it, or they did not proceed because—and this is the public justification that is given—to do so would not have represented good value for money. (Extension of time granted)One of the only reasons that the companies which own the coal fired power stations could say there was no economic incentive for them to close the stations is that they are being so generously compensated. A $5.5 billion compensation package is going to these companies—$1 billion in cash and $4½ billion in free permits to come—and that influenced the companies in their discussions with the government on the package. If we accept that the discussions took place in good faith, then the companies went armed with the knowledge of changed international circumstances, a big stack of cash in the pockets and the promise of free permits to come and, as a result, the companies are not now closing the coal fired power stations as envisaged in the promise that the government made to the Australian people in the clean energy package. Even worse, there is the prospect that some of the dirty coal fired power stations, which were meant to transition out of operation as part of the package, will receive windfall profits. In other words, if the package is passed, the cash that they have already received plus the compensation in the form of free permits that they are about to receive might make them financially better off than if the package had not been passed.


Because the government changed the goalposts by taking out one key element of the package, it is important to adjust it, because the package was agreed on through compromise by all sides, and, if one part of it is taken out, we should recalibrate it. One of the best ways of doing so would be by taking this opportunity to say: 'Over the coming years, if these coal fired power stations aren't doing as poorly as might have been thought and if in fact they stand potentially to make a windfall profit, then they have potentially been overcompensated. Let's get the Productivity Commission in to give a genuine review of the adequacy of their compensation.' We accept that the payments in cash have been made—that is done and dusted—but there is no reason that the future $4.5 billion worth of compensation, in the absence of evidence that is absolutely necessary for energy security, needs to go to the companies. In fact, there is now a very strong case that the overcompensation of the companies which own the dirty coal fired power stations is distorting the intention of the legislative package and getting in the way of replacing dirty coal fired power with clean and renewable energy. In the context where the goalposts have been changed, in the context where they might be getting windfall profits that will keep them in business longer than they otherwise would be, in the context where we are not closing 2,000 megawatts of the dirtiest coal fired power, it makes absolute sense to preserve the integrity of the original agreement by having the Productivity Commission review whether or not this compensation is too generous. When one takes the compensation package as a whole, that is $275 per woman, man and child in Australia that is going into the pockets of these dirty coal fired power stations and that could be going to clean and renewable energy. 


I commend this amendment to the House. It is a sensible amendment. One should have no concerns about the Productivity Commission looking at the adequacy of this compensation in the light of changed circumstances.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:30):  The government opposes the amendment put forward by the member for Melbourne because it is economically irresponsible and indeed breaches the agreement that the government entered into with the members of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, and also for the reason that the existing provisions of the legislation in relation to energy security are absolutely fundamental to investment confidence in the sector. 


I have no disrespect whatsoever for the member for Melbourne; I understand his motivations for moving this amendment. But the fact is that, contrary to his assertion, this amendment breaches an agreement that the Greens party reached with the government in the context of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. We entered into that agreement as a package, as he indicated. There have been no changes in the goalposts whatsoever. The government has discharged its obligations under that agreement to the word, and it is unprincipled to come in here and put forward an amendment that breaches that agreement.


The assistance to the generators, the Energy Security Fund payments, was a very important part of the agreement. The government made the decision after years of analysis into how to best transition highly emissions-intensive electricity generators into a cleaner energy environment. Of course, it is a transition that will take some period of time. The current arrangements that are in place are the result of in-depth electricity sector analysis and modelling since 2007, and nothing that has happened since the MPCCC agreement was concluded changes the reality and the conclusions that were reached as a result of that detailed work. 


Since 1 July when the carbon price commenced, the pass-through of carbon costs in the energy market and to household bills reflects exactly the Treasury modelling which informed the decisions on the basis of the Energy Security Fund payments. Advice was taken from key energy market institutions like the Australian Energy Market Operator, who advised that the government's measures, reflected in the MPCCC agreement, reduced the extent of generator financial distress, supported investment confidence in the sector and could be expected to improve reliability and security outcomes in the short term and reduce spot prices and expedite the transition to a lower emissions fleet over the longer term. 


The Energy Security Fund was legislated with the Clean Energy Act, and all the generators have now been awarded certificates of eligibility by the regulator for those Energy Security Fund payments. To interfere with that and to create uncertainty in relation to that would be disruptive to the investors and to the lenders that are engaged in the electricity generation sector. Changes to those legislated entitlements will directly influence investor perceptions of sovereign risk in the energy market. It would increase the risk premiums for clean energy investors. The advice of my department, consistent with the government's assessment, is as follows: proposals to review or change those legislated entitlements will directly influence investor perceptions of sovereign risk. This risk is exactly the type of risk the package was designed to minimise so that energy security is assured until sufficient alternative capacity is available in Australia's electricity markets. Increased risk in the market would also likely push up wholesale electricity prices and result in further cost pressures for electricity consumers unnecessarily. In addition, all investors in the energy market, including investors in clean energy technologies, would face higher costs for financing due to increased risk levels.


The government is not going to entertain the proposition of the Greens, whether it be by amendment or by any other form, for these reasons. It is in bad faith, in the government's judgement, that this has been put forward. It is in breach of the agreement that we reached. I want to make clear to investors in the energy industry that the entitlements that we have legislated through the Energy Security Fund will not be tampered with by the government. We will not entertain this amendment. It is economically irresponsible. We have in place a comprehensive package to secure energy security for Australian households and businesses. This was a policy initiative entirely separate to the issue of the Contract for Closure, which the government discharged. We stand by the package that was legislated and firmly oppose this amendment.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-10-11,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (09:35):  The government created two funds. It created a $2 billion Contract for Closure fund to close brown coal power stations and it created a $5½ billion Energy Security Fund to bail out brown coal power stations. It is not surprising that the smaller fund has failed. It is not surprising that the carbon tax is in chaos. It takes a certain type of genius to create one fund to close brown coal power stations and one fund to bail them out. I would ask the question: is there any other similar example in the western world in the last 20 years of two multibillion-dollar funds designed to do precisely the opposite things? I stand to be corrected but I am not aware of any other pairing of one fund to close power stations and one fund to keep them open. It is a unique policy achievement. 


The member for Casey highlighted to me that the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency raised the issue of sovereign risk. The entire carbon tax and the entire mining tax are about sovereign risk. They are about changing the ground rules in a way that creates uncertainty, that creates higher costs on Australian production, because this is an electricity ta The carbon tax is an electricity tax. Its theory is to close down the power stations; its reality is that, because they are not subject to import competition, the power stations are simply passing on the power price. So mums and dads right now are paying higher power prices.


In New South Wales, 50 per cent of the electricity price rise is coming from the carbon tax. In Victoria, two-thirds of the electricity price rise is coming from the carbon tax. In Western Australia, not 70 per cent but 72 per cent of the price rises are coming from the carbon tax. In the ACT, between 75 and 80 per cent of the price rise is coming from the carbon tax. In western Sydney, 80 per cent of the price rise in electricity is coming from the carbon tax. In Queensland, where Campbell Newman has frozen the bulk of retail tariffs, between 80 and 100 per cent of electricity price rises for the coming year are as a consequence of the carbon tax. So the theory behind these two funds is based on a simple flaw: that the carbon tax would have an impact on the generators. In reality they are passing through the electricity prices, as they were always intended to do.


I just want to make one more comment. Our view is that this motion fails. I respect the views of the member for Melbourne, but this motion fails because the carbon tax, the $2 billion to close brown coal power stations and the $5½ billion to keep them open should all be ditched. Dealing with one part of the three elements of the equation is fundamentally flawed.


But what I do want to acknowledge is the amount of money being given in cash to the largest brown coal generators in Australia. Going from the government's own announcement, there has been: $14.9 million to Alcoa's Anglesea Power Station; $59 million in cash to the Augusta power stations; $8 million in cash to the Collinsville Power Station; $27 million in cash to Green Energy Bricks, which was of course before the second round of bailouts two days before the carbon tax began; $265 million to Hazelwood Power Station in cash; $240 million in cash to Loy Yang A power station; $59 million in cash to Loy Yang B power station through International Power Australia and $57 million in cash through Gippsland Power; $8 million in cash to Redbank Power Station; and $257 million in cash to Yallourn W power station.


So the biggest polluters, according to the government, are getting the biggest cash handouts in Australian history. It is no wonder the Australian people think that this carbon tax is a dud, because the biggest polluters are being given literally $5½ billion in cash and permits and the Australian people are picking up the bill in terms of higher electricity, gas and grocery costs.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (09:40):  I will speak just very briefly on this. There are two issues of risk and principles. When the clean energy package was agreed to, those people who wanted to come and invest in Australia's clean energy future and begin to build the wind farms and solar plants and investigate solar thermal and geothermal took heart from the package. One of the reasons they took heart from the package was that it said around 2,000 megawatts of coal fired power, the equivalent of Hazelwood plus a bit, would be closed, making space for them in the market. Many of them began to see a future in Australia and, in particular, in Victoria for clean and renewable energy.


Not only that but many people in the Latrobe Valley who I have spoken to have said: 'Now we understand where we're going. There is a prospect that some of these stations will be closed and we can begin now to transition out.' The only uncertainty and risk that has been brought in has been of Labor's own making, because it was Labor who decided not to proceed with something it said it was going to do, which is close these coal fired power stations.


On the question of principle, we would not be here making this amendment if Labor had stuck to the agreement and we had seen power stations like Hazelwood close. We would quite happily have said, 'We do not agree with all the other aspects of it, and perhaps there is some overgenerous compensation, but that is the price we pay because there are some things in it that are good for clean and renewable energy.' We wanted to be in a position where there was an orderly replacement of some of the dirtiest coal fired power stations with clean renewable energy. Labor made the first move and pulled out a key plank of the package, and we are responding in what we think is a very reasonable and measured way to restore the integrity of the package.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:42):  Without wishing to prolong the situation, I really do need to place on the record that the government has discharged its obligations that it entered into under the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee agreement. That agreement never guaranteed the closure of 2,000 megawatts of high-emission coal fired electricity generated capacity. It never guaranteed that. The commitment was that there would be a process entered into allowing those generators to tender and enter into a negotiation with the government in an appropriate way for the potential closure of up to 2,000 megawatts of high-emission electricity generating capacity, providing it provided value for taxpayers' money.


The suggestion by the member for Melbourne that the government have not met their commitments is completely wrong and false. We have met the commitments that we entered into. If the Greens did not understand what they were entering into then that is most unfortunate. But, nonetheless, at the end of the process for the discussion and negotiation with the owners of the high-emission electricity generation capacity that had voluntarily come forward and participated in the contract for closure negotiations, the government could not agree with those entities that the values that were being discussed for those assets represented value for taxpayers' money. Indeed, on our calculation the cost of emissions reductions to be achieved, should the government have accepted the valuations of those assets that those companies believed were appropriate, would have vastly exceeded the $23 per tonne carbon price. This is not the sole criterion, but of course it was a consideration in the government's thinking. The fact is that the market will now decide the life of those electricity generators. That was always the position that obtained under the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee agreement and it is the position that the government discharged.


Having said that, it is important also to note that the market has already led to the mothballing, closure or curtailment of hundreds of megawatts of high-emissions electricity generation capacity, such as the Playford B and Northern power stations in South Australia, and the curtailment of significant electricity generation capacity at Energy Brix in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria. I think it is in order of 800 or 900 megawatts of brown coal high-emissions electricity generating capacity that has in fact been curtailed, without the necessity for the government to enter into contract for closure agreements with those particular operators. The market will attend to that issue under a carbon pricing arrangement. The government has met its obligations under the agreement. We therefore reiterate that we oppose the amendment.


Generally, in relation to the issues raised by the shadow minister, the package overall has been very carefully calibrated. There has been years of extensive engagement with stakeholders in every conceivable sector of the economy. It is not at all an issue of sovereign risk. Packages have been carefully designed and modelled in some of the most extensive modelling work ever undertaken by the Commonwealth Treasury and other organisations to ensure that this package will work, that it will lead to a reduction in emissions in our economy over time. We have attended to all of the issues that we believe are appropriate, particularly in the electricity generation sector and particularly in businesses that are in the trade-exposed and emissions-intensive part of the economy.


Furthermore, in relation to the pass-through of carbon pricing into electricity prices, it is of course the case that the majority of the carbon price revenue is being used to implement tax cuts, a tripling of the tax-free threshold, increases in family tax benefits and increases in the pension and other social security payments. Millions of people will be better off as a consequence of this important reform and Australia will play its fair share in global greenhouse gas emission reduction.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (10:30):  I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Malaysia and Sri Lanka from 5 to 14 December 2011, and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted. 




Ms VAMVAKINOU:
  I would like to make some brief comments in relation to the parliamentary delegation's visit to Malaysia and Sri Lanka between 5 and 14 December 2011. Our visit reaffirmed already strong ties with both countries. We share with Malaysia and Sri Lanka membership of the Commonwealth, and we have similar parliamentary systems. We also have frank and constructive dialogues, through parliamentary exchanges and visits such as the one that was undertaken by this parliamentary delegation. We were warmly received in each country and had significant access to senior decision makers, local officials and community representatives. The parliaments of both nations were generous with their time and hospitality.


Visits to Malaysia are frequent, as a consequence of the ASEAN bilateral delegation program. Our visit had the following objectives: to renew contacts with Malaysia's parliament and explore further avenues for dialogue and cooperation; to gain an enhanced understanding of multilevel governance and discuss recent political developments; to review the progress of Australia-Malaysia educational cooperation; to consider national and regional efforts to deal with transnational issues, including defence and security, and refugees and asylum seekers; and to explore topical issues concerning trade and investment between Australia and Malaysia. Our visit underlined the multidimensional nature of Malaysia-Australia relations. It also strengthened institutional ties between our two parliaments. In our report, we note our support for freedom of expression in Malaysia's ethnically and religiously diverse society.


Our visit to Sri Lanka was the first official visit by an Australian parliamentary delegation since the military victory by the Sri Lanka Army over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in May 2009. Our visit had the following objectives: to renew links with the parliament and assess progress towards establishing a Parliamentary Select Committee on Devolution; to gain an enhanced understanding of political, economic and social factors associated with reconciliation following the civil conflict; to consider the humanitarian, infrastructure and security aspects of the rehabilitation, resettlement and reconstruction efforts, particularly in relation to persons displaced by the conflict; to visit Australian funded aid projects in the north of the country; and to explore the potential for enhanced trade and investment, including higher education, between Australia and Sri Lanka. Our program included visits to several projects funded by AusAID and other international donors in the northern provinces of Jaffna and Kilinochchi—two provinces particularly affected by the civil war. In our report, we commend these international development projects and support continued development assistance to Sri Lanka.


We appreciated the frank nature of discussions held with ministers, members of parliament and representatives of political parties. The visit gave us a firsthand insight into the current political, economic and social situation in Sri Lanka. It also served to strengthen institutional ties between our parliaments. We concluded that reconciliation is the basis for a durable and sustainable peace, and we support ongoing engagement between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil diaspora here in Australia. We also stress the need to address alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights by all parties to the conflict. This is particularly important to me and other members of the delegation who have large Sri Lankan communities in our electorates. We are fully aware of the concern that our communities have in relation to outstanding issues in Sri Lanka at the moment.


Finally, on behalf of the delegation I would like to thank the member for Grey, in particular, who so ably served as the deputy chair of this delegation. I would like to thank the Malaysian and Sri Lankan parliaments for hosting our visits. I also sincerely thank all those who took time to meet with us. I also recognise, on behalf of the delegation, the support of the Australian missions in Kuala Lumpur and Colombo and all agencies involved in arranging our visit to northern Sri Lanka. Finally, I thank DFAT and AusAID officers here in Canberra for their tremendous support.

The committee has been working very diligently to ensure the efficient publication of papers. We are encouraging the Presiding Officers to give greater consideration to expanding the electronic papers series, where papers will be presented other than to the House and to the other chamber, in electronic form, for distribution. This will result in not only less duplication but certainly greater efficiencies, both in cost and in time. This is something to be encouraged. It is something that the committee has been working on diligently for some time. We have now written to the Presiding Officers, and we seek to expand the electronic paper series come the opening session of the 2013 parliament. On that, I conclude my remarks.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (10:53):  I move:


That this House request the Prime Minister and Treasurer to:


(1) direct the Commonwealth Grants Commission to allocate an annual fixed percentage of Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue directly to the 654 local councils throughout Australia;


(2) include this annual allocation as part of the GST Review currently underway and for implementation through any required legislative or executive government processes; and


(3) consider constitutional recognition of local government only in the event of any successful legal challenge to the direct annual allocation of GST revenue to local councils within Australia.



The SPEAKER:  Is the motion seconded?




Mr Katter:
  I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  I put this motion because local government in Australia is resource deprived, the local road network in Australia is failing—peak engineers groups throughout the country have identified that fact—and the revenue structure to support local government is a problem which needs to be fixed. This motion is just one suggestion to try to start the policy debate. It does not look like the vote is going to go well today, but I hope that we can pretty quickly do something to establish a better revenue flow to local government in Australia, particularly considering the significant failure of the local road network throughout the country.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (10:54):  State governments have taken on responsibility after responsibility. Every time there is an article in the newspaper, they race off and legislate to create greater responsibilities for themselves. But they do not shoulder the responsibilities themselves; they put the responsibilities upon the local authorities. The policing of the pollution act in Queensland is very costly indeed. All of the policing is of the building laws, which the state government has implemented but for which the local authorities have to pick up the bill.


Both the member for Lyne and I have a number of key bridges in our electorates which are falling to pieces, almost to the point where they are becoming dangerous. There is simply no money in north Queensland, where we have very, very limited access to the high-elevation rainforest. One of the Survivor episodes was shot at the Kirrama Range Road to Blencoe Falls because the scenery there is very spectacular, and at the top of the Kirrama Range Road there is a stand of the magnificent Eucalyptus grandis, the biggest tree in Australia. But there is no money to improve access to the Eucalyptus grandisand theBlencoe Falls, two magnificent tourist attractions which are of world standard. The road has fallen to pieces, and it would be very difficult for the local government by itself to restore it. The member for New England often refers to the 'decaying' state governments. I think that that is probably a true characterisation of them, and I most wholeheartedly support the motion put forward by the member for Lyne.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (12:11):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's advisory report, incorporating additional comments, on the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Derivative Transactions) Bill 2012.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms O'NEILL:
  by leave—On 13 September, the House of Representatives referred the Corporations Legislation (Derivative Transactions) Bill 2012 to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services for inquiry and report. As chair of that committee, I am pleased to be able to table the committee's report today.


The committee received 11 submissions and held a public hearing in Sydney on 5 October. The committee extended thanks to all who contributed to the inquiry process.


The proposed legislative measures demonstrate Australia's commitment to uphold the G20 agreement to increase the transparency of, and reduce the risk attached to, the over-the-counter derivatives market.


As this House would be aware, the global financial crisis highlighted a lack of transparency in the OTC derivatives market. International regulators have found that it was this lack of transparency, this lack of regulation, that contributed to the global financial crisis.


The G20 agreed to implement over-the-counter derivatives regulatory reforms by the end of 2012. As a G20 member Australia is committed to implementing the OTC derivative market reforms. The bill before the House delivers on Australia's commitment and will allow Australian regulators to more effectively manage the risks attached to over-the-counter derivative transactions.


The bill will amend the Corporations Act 2001 to introduce a legislative framework that would allow the operational details of the new over-the-counter derivatives scheme to be largely established by subordinate legislation. The evidence before the committee is clear that this structure will allow regulators to readily respond to changes in the OTC derivatives market. The flexibility will mean that regulations can keep pace with market changes and continue to ensure transparency and—very important, in response to the very real lessons that need to be learned from the GFC—this will reduce systemic risk.


In terms of the exercise of delegated authority, submitters to the inquiry raised three areas of concern with the bill. While acknowledging the need for flexibility, some submitters were concerned to ensure that the authority delegated to the responsible minister and to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission is exercised appropriately. To this end, the committee has made three recommendations to provide industry greater guidance on the operation of the new regulatory scheme.


The committee recommended that:


Treasury and ASIC issue guidance material outlining the consultation process for the development of OTC derivatives regulations and rules;


ASIC further release a regulatory guide explaining the derivative transactions and trade repository rules; and


that ASIC report to the committee on the operation of the new OTC derivatives regulatory framework, as part of the committee's ongoing oversight of the commission.


In terms of the electricity sector in particular, three industries also sought exemptions from the new OTC derivatives transaction requirements. Notably, representatives of the electricity sector strongly opposed the application of the new OTC derivatives regulatory requirements to participants in the national electricity market. Representatives put forward several arguments to support the application. In essence, it was put to the committee that the national electricity market is currently sufficiently robust to not present systemic risk to market integrity.


The committee found persuasive the view put forward by Treasury that amending the bill to expressly exclude any sector or class of derivative would not be best practice, particularly in the light of the international regulations and requirements around this issue. Rather, we found that it would limit regulators' capacity to respond appropriately to market changes.


However, I can report that the evidence before the committee was clear that, at this time, the government does not intend to prescribe the electricity sector as a class of derivatives to which the new OTC derivatives framework would apply.


The committee recommended that the Minister for Resources and Energy be consulted prior to making recommendations on rules that would affect the energy sector.


The committee recommends that the bill be passed without amendment.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2012-10-11,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (13:45):  The US presidential election is tightening. Monday's Pew Research Centre poll found 49 per cent of likely voters favoured Republican candidate Mitt Romney and 45 per cent favoured President Barack Obama. Gallop and Rasmussen polls had the candidates level pegging. This is a massive 12-point turnaround from where the polls were a month ago and can be traced back to Mitt Romney's barnstorming performance in the first presidential debate.


What this means is that the presidential race is now game on—anyone can win—which makes the Australian Labor Party's personal and vitriolic attacks on the Republican Party and its candidates all the more damaging and alarming. Let us not forget that Wayne Swan, Treasurer of Australia, called the Republicans 'cranks and crazies'. Foreign Minister Bob Carr in his blog just before entering parliament described Mitt Romney as 'bloodless', former House Speaker and Republican candidate Newt Gingrich as 'the mad professor' and former Republican Senator Rick Santorum as someone who 'lusts for war'. In Carr's words, these 'unworthy opportunists' 'petrified' him. Can you believe it—Australia's foreign minister, our number one diplomat, saying that the man who could very well become the next President of the United States petrifies him.


Let us not forget that, when John Howard made comments about candidate Obama back in 2007, Senator Penny Wong, now finance minister, rushed out a press release saying that risked the strength of the US alliance. Let us hear her say that now—no more double standards from the Labor Party. Forget Bruce Springsteen; we want real politicians who care about the real national interest. Attacking Republicans to shore up your political base is dangerous and against the national interest. (Time expired)

 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  On indulgence, on the matter that the member for Higgins was just addressing—Tomorrow is a very special and a very solemn day in the life of our nation: the 10th anniversary of the Bali bombings. For Australians everywhere, it will be a time for sorrow and reflection, remembrance and resolve. From our official ceremonies in Bali and here in Canberra to beachside gatherings at Coogee and on the Gold Coast, religious services in Melbourne and Perth, a fundraiser for the Burns Unit at Royal Adelaide Hospital and more gatherings, large and small, we will honour those who were lost, embrace those who survived and comfort those who grieve. I hope every Australian finds time tomorrow to reflect on this tragedy, either at one of the public gatherings or alone in the silence of their hearts.


Together we remember a great loss inflicted on our own, 88 Australians taken from us forever; 114 from other countries lost as well; and many more injured and hurt, with so many of their scars, physical and mental, yet to fully heal, if they ever do. We would give everything to erase the events of that night from the pages of history but we cannot.


We will carry the images of Bali on 12 October 2002 all the rest of our days. Its horror and its meaning are imprinted on all of our hearts forever. We will not forget the courage. We will not forget the loss. Tomorrow and always, we will remember.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:02):  I join the Prime Minister in marking tomorrow's anniversary, because, for Australians, 12 October 2002 is a date that will always live in infamy. Eighty-eight Australians died; 202 people were killed in total. The places targeted were picked precisely because they were places frequented by Australians, so this was an attack on Australia. But it was more than that; it was an attack on civilisation. To our credit as a people, we did not lash out in fury at another country or at a particular religion. We worked with Indonesia to bring the perpetrators to justice. We will always be grateful to Indonesia and its people for doing so.


Our country was at its best in the aftermath of the Bali bombings. Of those caught up in the bombings, many were traumatised and all were changed, but not all for the worse. Some have subsequently been involved in magnificent humanitarian work, such as Peter Hughes and David and Clair Marsh.


I look forward to more help in the future for all the victims of terrorism. I also look forward to standing with the Prime Minister in Bali tomorrow to demonstrate our solidarity as Australians and to say to our country's enemies: you can hurt us but you can't break us.

Mr Albanese:
  Speaker, on a point of order: Justice Rares has reserved his opinion in a case which is precisely about whether there has been an abuse of process in the claims made by Mr Ashby in the litigation he made against the Commonwealth, as the first respondent, and the member for Fisher. This is about the exact case where the first respondent was the Commonwealth and the second respondent was the member for Fisher. We have here an attempt to move a motion to discuss the abuse of process which in itself could be regarded as an abuse of process.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order—



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. It is a very serious question, and therefore for me to consider it I probably need to read the motion. As it is very hard to hear motions in this place when everybody else is yelling, I will stop the clock, if we could. I think that is reasonable. For everybody's information, sub judice is a very difficult issue for the parliament. It is a very difficult issue. It does not go to matters that are before the court or public; it is about the impression the parliament makes on the issues and the decision that a judge or jury may make—or in normal circumstances where there may be. So it is upon the parliament to be very cautious in any of these issues. However, I believe that the motion does not affect sub judice. But I will caution everybody in this debate not to overstep that mark in their contributions or I will sit them down. There is a matter before the court. We should all take the issue of sexual harassment very seriously.




Mr Albanese:
  On a point of order, Speaker. Page 298 of House of Representatives Practice states very clearly that a motion may not be brought forward which relates to a matter awaiting or under adjudication by a court of law. In 1995 the Speaker wrote to a member, drawing the member's attention to the fact that certain matters relevant to a notice lodged by the member were sub judice and expressing the view that discussion of the matter should not take place. It is very clear that this is precisely the matter that is before the court.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, on the point of order. If I could make a submission now that the Leader of the House has made two submissions? I did sit down when I was asked to do so.



The SPEAKER:  You did.




Mr Pyne:
  The motion is clearly about the actions of the Attorney-General. It is not about the court case that is currently before the Federal Court. It is about the actions that the Attorney-General undertook, in each of its four parts. Therefore it is entirely within the standing orders. When she discharges her duties, the House is quite entitled to debate those, to question her about them and to move a motion.




Mr Albanese:
  On the point of order, Madam Speaker. It may well be the case that at a point in time the opposition will be able to ask questions of the Attorney, but that time is not while the judge has reserved his opinion. This debate cannot but impact on that decision.



The SPEAKER:  I believe that the motion can be debated but with great caution.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  Standing orders must be suspended so that the Attorney-General can explain her conduct, which is now under a cloud. Serious and legitimate questions are being asked about the Attorney-General's actions in relation to the Ashby-Slipper case. I am conscious—

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (15:18):  I second the motion. What the Attorney has to explain to the House is why she has corrupted the court process by trying to act as a prosecutor rather than as the first law officer of the land. If the Attorney is so opposed to misogyny, why did she lead this attempted cover-up of the SMSs between the former Speaker and Mr Ashby?




Mr Albanese:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Again the Manager of Opposition Business is making allegations about a case that is before the court. He has used terms that are very specific and entirely inappropriate against the Attorney.



The SPEAKER:  I again advise caution.




Mr PYNE:
  Standing orders must be suspended to allow this motion to be debated and passed so that the Attorney can spend 15 minutes—

 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (15:28):  Madam Speaker, on indulgence, while we have been here in question time, it has started to come to public attention that a very young man, a very young soldier, has died as a result of the training accident at Holsworthy, which I am sure people saw the reports of over the course of the week. This is a 22-year-old soldier. The minister has spoken to his opposition counterpart and, if it suits the convenience of the House, he will make a brief statement on indulgence about the death of this young man.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (15:29): It is with great sadness that we learnt of the young soldier who tragically lost his life today. He was one of 18 members of the Army who were involved in a vehicle accident on the Holsworthy range on Monday, 8 October. This young man, Sapper Jordan Ronald Penpraze, enlisted in the Regular Army in April of this year and, after completing his recruit training, commenced his initial employment training in July. He had been in a critical condition since Monday's accident, and earlier today his family made the heartbreaking decision to switch off his life support.


Jordan Ronald Penpraze was born in Mornington, Victoria on 15 August 1990. He enlisted in the Australian Regular Army on 3 April 2012 and, as I said, on completion of his Army recruit training at Kapooka, he marched in to Holdfast Troop, Initial Employment Training Squadron, at the School of Military Engineering on 26 June. On 11 July, he commenced his Royal Australian Engineer Initial Employment Training. During his time in Holdfast Troop, Sapper Penpraze demonstrated his quick thinking when he and another soldier successfully resuscitated an elderly citizen while on local leave in Liverpool. Sapper Penpraze remained with the elderly citizen, maintaining CPR until the ambulance arrived.


Sapper Penpraze was a respected and very well liked member of the troop. He was a quiet and stoic sapper who possessed a determination to perform to the best of his ability. He took on all lessons immediately with maturity and a strong desire for self-improvement. His commitment to his section and his mates saw him complete his work with no reservations or complaints. He would rather take the hard job or the heavy load to spare a mate who was doing it tough. It was this selfless commitment to his mates that made him such a respected member of 3 Troop. 


While Sapper Penpraze completed everything he did to a high standard, he excelled at watermanship, showing his skills with watercraft and a passion for boats. His previous experience allowed him to take on a leadership role during this phase of the course. He maintained this enthusiasm during field training exercises, receiving excellent reports from all field activities.


Sapper Penpraze's very sad death is a reminder to us all that being in the ADF is dangerous, whether in Afghanistan or here at home in training. Our heartfelt condolences go to Sapper Penpraze's family, his friends and his comrades.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (15:32):  I rise on behalf of the coalition to associate ourselves with the fine remarks from Minister Snowdon. It is a reminder that freedom is not free; training for war is tough. Eighteen young soldiers were badly injured when a truck rolled down a steep hill while they were training to defend freedom. Sapper Penpraze was a 22-year-old digger training to be a combat engineer. If you know nothing more about this young Australian soldier, know this: he was training to go into an engineering division that has paid a heavy price in Afghanistan. The toll taken on the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment and the Incident Response Regiment of Special Operations Command has been exacting as they fight the battle against IEDs in Afghanistan. This was the job, this was the unit, this was the career that Sapper Penpraze was going into. He was a fine Australian soldier. We should all remember that this man gave his life while in training to prepare to fight wars in defence of our nation and in defence of freedom. We will remember him.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2012-10-11,"



Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (15:36):  In calling for this discussion of a matter of public importance today—it being the adverse effect of the carbon tax, particularly on senior Australians—I do so wearing my hat as the shadow minister for seniors. There has never been a minister for seniors in this parliament before. We have had ministers for youth, we have had them for children—we have had them for all sorts of groups. But never before have senior Australians been recognised in this way, which was an acknowledgement by the Leader of the Opposition of the importance of this group. For the purposes of the portfolio responsibility, seniors are those people who are over the age of 50 and, in fact, constitute 40 per cent of all voters. It is important to note in this debate that the impact on senior Australians can be particularly cruel, particularly on those who have retired or are on pensions and those who are self-funded retirees, because those people are on fixed incomes and do not have the elasticity of looking forward to an increase in salary to make up for the imposition of the carbon tax.


The carbon tax is essentially a tax on electricity. And it is designed specifically to see people use less electricity. It is designed to lower the standard of living, particularly for those people who cannot afford to meet the increases. The stories that we hear—for instance, of people delivering meals-on-wheels through the winter to people in receipt of the age pension and finding those people in bed, not because they are ill but because they are cold—are true stories. These are people who are forced not to turn on the switch to activate a heater or, in some cases, even lights, to the degree that there have been some suspicious fires that have been caused by people resorting to candles because they felt they could not afford electric light. That is not the Australia that my father and his generation fought in World War II to deliver to this country. The idea that we should not consider having electric light and electric heating as automatic rights in an Australian household is something quite foreign to people who recognise the sacrifice that was made to ensure we lived in a free country.


It is important to realise that the impact of electricity prices, particularly on people who are self-employed or who work in small business, is also very relevant to seniors, because people who are self-employed or work in small business will work much longer than those who work in big business. The fact of the matter is that you can find people who are shopkeepers, accountants or lawyers—people who are maintaining an active work-life well into their 70s and 80s in private practice and yet are being hit very hard by this electricity impost.


I will give you an example of a sole practitioner in a law firm who has a very substantial practice but has just seen a quarterly electricity bill rise from $1,000 to $1,500 for the quarter. And the likelihood of that continuing to rise, of course, under this carbon tax is well known.


Let us look at how it operates, because it is a tax that is both cascading and compounding. It gets into the nooks and crannies of every aspect of your life. Everything we do in a civilised country depends on electricity. It is the difference between a First World country and a Third World country.


When Bob Brown was here and in cahoots with Prime Minister Gillard, they wanted us all to live in a cave with a candle. But now that we have Senator Milne, she would really rather we did without the candle!


The fact of the matter is that your life is meant to become lesser. When the Prime Minister talks about a 'gold standard' for infrastructure to deliver electricity, what on earth is she talking about? Does she want a silver standard? A bronze standard? A lead standard? How many blackouts would be acceptable to her? The fact of the matter is that, on previous occasions, this same Prime Minister has complained about there not being sufficient infrastructure. And yet when the infrastructure is built, in order that communities have electricity and do not have blackouts, it is spurned as being 'gold plated'. Well, there are plenty of instances I can think of in the world of countries where there is simply not enough infrastructure. There are plenty of countries where the elites will take the power and the people will be poor. This is not the sort of country we want here.


But let us look at how this tax works. The tax is imposed on the so-called emitters, or generators, of electricity. It is imposed on the creation of the good, the service, of electricity. On every transaction that occurs between the tax being paid and it being paid by the final consumer, again the tax is paid. So it becomes a tax on a tax on a tax on a tax, and then the GST is paid on it as well. It is quite unlike the GST which, as a value-added tax, has all the taxes paid between the initial creation of the good or service and the final consumer refunded. Consequently, there will be rises that will occur in everything we do.


Prime Minister Gillard says there will be no carbon tax on fuel for the family car. Really? How does she think that the petrol is got from the tank at the service station into the tank of the car? Electricity pumps it. How do you think you pay for it? You go to the cash register, which is driven by electricity. In this building, the lights, the air conditioning—everything about it is driven by electricity. The sewage system, the water system—all driven by electricity. And that is the impost that the carbon tax has put on every aspect of our lives.


Our dependence on refrigeration is well known. You go to the supermarket. You pick up fruit that appears to be fresh and yet you know it has been kept somewhere else in a warehouse under refrigerated circumstances. You take your meat, and you take it for granted; somehow it got from the abattoirs to your supermarket and has been kept cool and fresh and safe—electricity again. And also there are the gases that are used to make that refrigeration work; the escalation in the tax for them has gone through the roof—some people say 290 per cent. So this is an insidious tax that is attacking the very structure of our lives. That includes an impost on the fans in schoolrooms for children and on the buses that take the children to school. Nothing escapes. And yet we have a Prime Minister who stands there as she did today and says, 'No, no; everybody is protected or compensated.' Let us understand. What does compensation do? Compensation is a payment for an injury that the person paying it has caused. This Prime Minister said, six days before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Let us remind ourselves why she said it: because Tony Abbott had been saying throughout the entire election period that, as sure as night follows day, there would be a carbon tax should the Gillard government be re-elected. So she looked straight down the barrel of the camera to refute it. Had she not said that, she would not have been in the position to negotiate to become the Prime Minister, because win she did not. And the Treasurer said it was a hysterical allegation by the opposition. Well, it was not hysterical; it was accurate. The long and the short of it is that we have said we will repeal that tax.


Let us again look at this question of compensation. Treasury calculated that the damage done is $9.90 a week and therefore they will offer compensation of $10.10 a week, saying that people will be 20c a week better off—wow! Anybody who truly believes that Treasury can predict with that degree of accuracy must believe there are fairies at the bottom of the garden.




Mr Billson:
  There's no precision in the budget estimates.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  I am about to pick up on that point made by my friend the shadow minister for small business, who understands very well the impact on small business.




Mr Billson:
  Devastating.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Absolutely. The fact of the matter is: Treasury gets it wrong every year. Every year, the budget is wrong. Six months later, we get supplementary estimates to fix it up. In the case of the budget of this government, it was going to have a $22 billion deficit and it turns out to be $43 billion. So anybody who thinks that they can get it down to a 20c margin, as I said, must believe there are fairies at the bottom of the garden.


This is a punitive, harsh and unfair tax. Because it attacks the disposable income of those on fixed incomes—pensioners, part-pensioners and self-funded retirees—it also has an enormous impact on the retail sector. Research that I had Access Economics do predicted that the silver market would go platinum because of the purchasing power of Australian seniors. When their spending power is diminished or fear is put into their hearts—and the fear comes from the rhetoric of the government, not the warning from the opposition; the government has said that you have got to be fearful because the world is going to come to an end because of climate change unless we have this tax. And yet this tax will not bring the emissions down one bit. In fact, they will be continuing to rise to 2020. So the whole nature of it is fallacious.


We hear the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency shriek and carry on. He is the one who said the seas were going to rise up and houses would fall into the sea. Where did he buy his house? Right on the seaside! The fear campaign and the fearmongering that has gone on in the name of the government, saying, 'Be fearful of climate change; this tax is the answer to it,' is nothing short of a good old furphy. The fact of the matter is it is a punitive tax which is meant to damage people—hence they use the term 'compensation'—and it damages seniors more than ever.


I notice the member for Braddon over there having a yawn. Of course, he would be very bored by the plight of seniors. He would be very bored at their plight and would not give a damn what happened to them. That is way the Labor Party is. You would remember during the 2010 election campaign the Prime Minister said in cabinet—and it was effectively leaked—'Why would we give anything to pensioners? They don't vote for us anyway.' That is the attitude that the government has towards senior Australians—to disparage them and to pretend to have their interests at heart with this ridiculous compensation package. The fact of the matter is that the damage to them will be far, far greater than any compensation that will be paid.


Then we have the flip-flopping that has gone on in the policy. It is $23 a tonne to start with. Then it will go to $29 a tonne and then to $37 a tonne. The government then came in and said: 'We'll get rid of the floor price. We'll tie it all to Europe. But we're not going to change our Treasury modelling. It's still going to come out at $29 a tonne.' That is despite the fact that in Europe it is around $6 a tonne. It is a con. The Australian people are being conned and they are being punished by having their precious electricity, which determines the standard of living that they enjoy, being taken away from them. They are being punished by a government that told an untruth before the election in order to attempt to win government. But win they did not. 


The Prime Minister is there only because she stitched up two deals—one a deal she stitched up with the execution of Kevin Rudd and one a deal she stitched up with the Independents. The Independents are equally complicit in this perpetration of punishment of the people. We in the opposition need to be strong—which we are—and every day bring evidence. The Prime Minister denies that evidence daily. We have noticed that nothing is the Prime Minister's fault. It does not matter what happens, it was not her; it was Tony Abbott, it was the state government or it was somebody else! Even with the unemployment figures today that showed there had been a growth in unemployment, she boldly stood there and said, 'We've created more jobs.' But a rise in unemployment means more jobs disappeared than were created. But of course that is not her fault. She is only standing there. It has got to be somebody else's fault. The day will come when you can no longer call the gender card or the victim card. By pretending to be a victim, the Prime Minister has demeaned every woman in this parliament. We did not come here for it to be said that we cannot do the job and have to be treated differently; we on this side of the parliament came here to say that we are the best people for the job of representing the people and that the ideas that we have are the best ideas to take us into government. We do not wish to be treated as if we are somehow less able and victims of somebody's spiteful words. It is a pathetic thing to say. Could you imagine Angela Merkel making a speech like that or Maggie Thatcher making a speech like that? Of course not. The fact of the matter is: if you take leadership, you must exercise leadership. If you cannot stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. At the end of the day, what we are seeing here is a government which has no purposefulness in order to look after the interests of the people. It wants to punish the people. (Time expired)

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (15:53):  I acknowledge the contribution of the honourable member opposite, the member for Mackellar, not for its comments or arguments about the carbon tax, because there were not any. As to a price on carbon and electricity, she referred to electricity prices, and she referred to the rebuttal by the Prime Minister, the minister responsible and the Treasurer of the statements being made on a continuing basis in this parliament by the opposition.


We saw a prime example of that yesterday, when we saw another illustration of the porkies which seem to float from the other side of the chamber on a regular basis, attempting to mislead the Australian population into believing that somehow or other the price on carbon is responsible for the extraordinary increases in electricity prices across the country, when the opposition know and the community knows, generally speaking, that that is not the case. The facts speak for themselves. When we saw yesterday the opposition table a bill and assert some horrendous increase in electricity price as a result of the price on carbon, we learnt, of course, that the increase on the electricity bill which was presented was almost solely attributable—except for nine per cent, which I think was the figure attributable to the price on carbon—to increased electricity consumption in that household. To come into the parliament and assert that the doubling of the electricity cost to a particular family was the direct result of the price on carbon was disingenuous. It was dishonest. It was untrue. It was a porky.


It is up to the opposition to make the case as to why they believe we should not have a price on carbon, but it is not up to the opposition to strike fear in the hearts of Australians that somehow or other their lives are going to change irreversibly, beyond their control, because of the fact that we have a price on carbon. We were told that it was going to be Armageddon when the price on carbon was introduced. We were told that Whyalla would disappear off the face of the earth. Let me just say that I sit next to Minister Gray, the member for Brand. His mother lives in Whyalla. He tells me, most assuredly, that Whyalla still exists.


I am surprised, therefore, that we have not had an apology from the Leader of the Opposition, because all of these grandiose claims about Armageddon, about how the earth would be flattened by the decisions taken by this government in relation to a price on carbon, have proven to be untrue. Yet we do not see the opposition walking back from the accusations they are making to the community about the impact of the price on carbon on their daily lives.


We ought to know about the electricity prices. We know what has happened to electricity prices in this country, and very little of it has got to do with the price on carbon. We know that, in the last three years, per household, power prices have gone up in New South Wales by 55 per cent; in Victoria by 33 per cent; in Queensland by 39 per cent and in South Australia by 43 per cent. In Western Australia, they have gone up by a whopping $552 per household. It is not the carbon price—it is decisions by state governments.


Yet we did not hear a whimper, not a yelp, from the opposition protesting against the increase in electricity prices in those states when they increased them so markedly, with a dramatic impact on the household budgets of families in those states. It is a shame on the opposition. They need to explain to the Australian community the detail of why prices increase, not come in with some story, which proves to be untrue each time they tell it, that somehow or other it is the carbon price which is responsible for a dramatic increase in electricity prices. It is manifestly untrue. It is an untruth.


We do not see the opposition going out and trying to tell the truth; it is quite the opposite. They are attempting to convince the Australian community that every increase in price that they see on their electricity bill is a result of carbon pricing. They know it is false. We know it is false. But they will not admit it to the Australian community. We have just seen, unfortunately, another example from the member opposite, a person whom I respect—but nevertheless it is up to her to make sure that she tells the truth. Just simply tell the truth. If we all tell the truth in this place about the impact of carbon pricing, there will be no fear in the community about the impact of carbon pricing. There will be no fear because the facts are abundantly clear to all those who take just a moment to have a look at what is happening.


In the context of the carbon price, the government acknowledged that there would be an impact on family budgets. We acknowledged what that impact would be. So we put in place a set of measures to address the additional costs to all Australians across the community, particularly those in need such as aged Australians and veterans. I will give you some of the detail.


As a result of assistance to seniors, 3.4 million pensioners in Australia will receive assistance that more than covers their average expected cost of putting a price on carbon: a real and permanent increase to the pension of around $338 per year for singles and around $510 a year for couples combined. Self-funded retirees with a Commonwealth seniors health card will receive the same support as aged pensioners through extra payments paid with the seniors supplement. Seniors and others with medical conditions who rely on medical treatment that uses more power can get extra help with their bills through the 'essential medical equipment payment' of $140 per year, with over 10,000 payments already made.


Our support is targeted at low- and middle-income families and pensioners who have the least room to move in their family budgets. On average, the expected increase in costs due to a carbon price for a single pensioner will be just $204 per year. With the increase in their pension payments of $338 they will be $134 better off.


Why don't the opposition just simply tell the truth and tell the community that in fact their family budgets will be able to sustain any increases that might come about as a result of the carbon pricing because of these supplements which are being made? On average, the expected increase in costs due to a carbon price for a pensioner couple will be $284 per year. With the increase in their pension payments of $510 per year, they will be $226 better off.


So why are we hearing consistently, day after day after day, representations from the opposition which tell us that that is not the case? It is manifestly untrue. We know that, under the Liberals' plan, they will claw back $300 a year from single pensioners and more than $500 a year from pensioner couples. And the New South Wales and Queensland Liberal governments have finally come clean on their plans to claw back money from public housing tenants to fill their own coffers.


We have already delivered the most historic pension reforms in the 100-year history of the pension system. These reforms have delivered increases of $172 a fortnight for singles and $182 for couples combined, on the maximum rate since 2009. New indexation arrangements mean that pensions are keeping better pace with pensioners' cost of living. That is in addition to those matters which I have referred to earlier.


Let me now go to veterans, because that is an area which I know that the member opposite, the member for Boothby, is interested in. There are 156,000 service pensioners and senior supplement recipients who receive a lump sum of $250 for singles or $190 for each eligible member of a couple. On 14 June this year, 110,000 disability pensioners received a lump sum of up to $380 a week and 92,000 war widows and widowers received a lump sum of $250. The children of veterans who receive fortnightly education allowances are also eligible for clean energy payments.


An ongoing payment, the clean energy supplement, will commence between March 2013 and January 2014, depending on the type of payment received. An essential medical equipment payment of $140 per annum is also available for eligible pensioners, pensioner concession cardholders, health card holders, Commonwealth seniors health card and DVA gold or white card holders to cover the additional costs of running essential medical equipment and medically required heating and/or cooling that arise from the introduction of a carbon price. Additional assistance is available through the family tax benefit, the new low-income supplement and the tax system. The government are more than compensating people for the impacts on their cost of living as a result of carbon pricing. That is clear. Yet, as I said earlier, day after day after day we get the same old drivel coming from the Leader of the Opposition, his frontbenchers and his backbenchers about the impact of the price on carbon. They are going into their communities and telling people untruths, trying to persuade people that somehow or another the world will end as a result of carbon pricing, when they know that it is simply untrue.


I say to members of the opposition: why is it that you cannot fundamentally agree with the facts? Why is it that you cannot agree with the facts—for example, we know that in the case of electricity prices in New South Wales the Treasury estimate for the change in price is 10 per cent. The average increase in regulated prices due to the carbon price is 8.9 per cent. In Queensland, it is 11 per cent—that is, $3.34 a week. In the case of South Australia, it is 4.6 per cent, or $1.47 per week. In Western Australia, it is 9.13 per cent, or $2.50 a week. In Tasmania, it is 5.6 per cent, which is less than $3 a week. Those are the facts, and people are being compensated with a $10 payment. 


How is it that we are left in this position where the opposition masquerade and come in here with these trumped-up claims about the impact of carbon pricing on electricity bills when, as we saw yesterday with this very bill, that they were totally false and totally discredited? I note the observations made by the minister during question time. We did not see the Leader of the Opposition, or the person who raised the question yesterday, come in here and say: 'My apologies. I've misled the parliament and I've misled all those people who may be listening to this broadcast. The fact is that the carbon price did not have the impact that I claimed it would have.' Why didn't they do that? Why can't they just admit the truth? Why can't they deal with the facts instead of making up stories which are so absurdly untrue that their untruth is obvious to the world?


The claims which were made about the end of the world—the Armageddon which would come upon us—after 1 July have been shown to be plainly false. It is obvious to the whole of the Australian community that Whyalla still exists, that the coal industry still exists and that the economy is growing. But this is not what was said. I invite all those people in the community who are worried about the carbon price to go to the words of the Leader of the Opposition and check them against the facts. The facts will tell you that the Leader of the Opposition and all of those behind him are telling giant porkies. (Time expired)

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2012-10-11,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (16:08):  We need to think back to 2007 and remember why Labor was elected then. They were elected in part because they understood how important the issue of the cost of living was to families and to seniors. Everyone would have seen on the TV news the photo opportunities of Kevin Rudd sitting around a table with families to discuss the household bills. There was lots of nodding and lots of empathy. He did it in so many seats. Labor were going to do things: Fuelwatch, which was a failure, and GroceryWatch, which was a failure. Now we have come to a situation where the Labor Party are in complete denial over one of the main concerns—that is, the cost of living—of families and people on fixed incomes, especially seniors. I am talking not just about electricity. We have seen dramatic rises in all utility rates—of water, of electricity and of gas. They keep on going up.


A lot of the government's arguments say, 'It's not all due to the carbon tax,' but there is no doubt that the carbon tax makes the pressure on the cost of living much, much worse. The latest argument from the government is, 'The price rise for electricity is in the order of 10 per cent; the policy is working as planned.' But what that ignores is the enormous pressure that Australian families and Australian seniors are feeling. They are struggling with all the cost-of-living increases under this government. What the government do not get is that, by adding a carbon tax, they have just made the situation much, much worse.


We often hear this phrase, but it is worth hearing it again. Not more than six days before the last election, the Prime Minister of this country clearly misled the Australian people when she stated, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Not one Labor candidate distributed any material about or said that they would be voting for a carbon tax, yet every single one of them did so. We know from Australian political history that any party which goes to an election promising one thing and then doing another will pay a very high price when they next have to face the Australian people. I think about 1993, when Paul Keating said that he was campaigning against a GST and then, in his first budget after the election, he dramatically increased the sales tax on a whole raft of goods. It was, in effect, a GST by stealth. Following that, the Labor members who voted for the increase in sales taxes in 1993 faced the black-and-red ads on TV about how they voted to increase the sales tax on wine, on cars—on everything.


The attitude of the Labor Party seems to be denial: 'What are you complaining about? It's working as we expected.' I think about 1993; I also think about how, in 2001, when the Liberal party were in government, there was a big campaign by the motoring organisations over concerns about the high cost of petrol with the introduction of the GST. We listened to what the community was saying and made some changes because we recognised the pain in the community about the high price of petrol. But we had not taken a policy of making such changes—that is, removing excise and adding the GST—to the electorate, so the situation then was not equivalent to the situation we find now, where a government which was elected promising to do something about the cost of living for families and seniors has done the very opposite.


In my own electorate of Boothby, 18.7 per cent of people are over 65. As I go around the electorate I have a lot to do with people on the age pension, with people who are part pensioners and part self-funded retirees and with people who are self-funded retirees. One of the unfortunate things about the carbon tax is that people on fixed incomes will be hit the hardest. As the cost of living rises under the carbon tax, those people who are on fixed incomes—pensioners and self-funded retirees—will have less money to spend on leisure, less to spend on recreation, less to spend on their grandchildren and less to spend on the essentials of life. There are something like half a million self-funded retirees in Australia. There are 1.2 million age pensioners and there are 880,000 part age pensioners in Australia. They are really the forgotten people in this debate. The Labor Party gave no thought to the impact on seniors of introducing their carbon tax. I regularly see self-funded retirees and pensioners at shopping centres and at my listening posts and, through my surveys, I hear from those who tell me what this tax means to them as they struggle to make ends meet because they see their grocery bills and electricity bills going up and up. Senior Australians have worked hard all their lives. They should not be expected to absorb the cost of the carbon tax on their own when they have already given so much back to our community.


Another one of the lies is that a carbon tax will not work unless it hurts, that that is the way to change behaviour, which the government are so keen to do. So, again, their argument about compensation ignores the fact that you do not need to compensate people if you do not have a carbon tax. That is the simple thing: the compensation is only necessary because of the carbon tax in the first place. 


I also want to go to issues in my electorate of Boothby in South Australia. The Belair Hotel, when they received their first power bill under the carbon tax, saw that their off-peak power rate had increased by 45 per cent due to a carbon adjustment charged by AGL. When the Lakes Resort Hotel in the electorate of Hindmarsh got their first post carbon tax electricity bill it cost them an extra $3½ thousand a month—




Mr Tehan:
  How much?




Dr SOUTHCOTT:
  $3½ thousand a month, due to the carbon adjustment alone. If you are running a hotel there is not much you can do to reduce your electricity. The City of Onkaparinga is a local government area in the electorates of Kingston, Boothby and Mayo. The Mayor of the City of Onkaparinga, Lorraine Rosenberg, has been quoted as stating that the carbon tax will cost ratepayers an extra $800,000 a year. Street lighting makes up 70 per cent of the council's electricity bill. They cannot reduce their usage—they have to keep the lights on at night. They have no choice but to pay more.


Paul Kerin, CEO of South Australia's Independent Essential Services Commission, when asked if repealing the tax would cut electricity prices, responded, 'Yes, and we'd look to make adjustment at that time.' So there you have it, from the CEO of South Australia's Independent Essential Services Commission. If you want to see electricity prices come down, support the coalition and their plan to reduce the carbon tax.


The one thing you have to say about the Labor Party is that they do have extraordinary discipline. We saw it at the start of this week, where they blindly voted to support a situation that was obvious to everyone was unsustainable, and they are now blindly following this same approach, ignoring their voters, ignoring their constituents.

"Lyons, Geoff, MP",ALP,2012-10-11,"



Mr LYONS
 (Bass) (16:18):  I guess I should lay out on the table why we are in this position. One of the major reasons is that the Liberal Party gave their preferences to a member of the Greens, so that is the parliament we are stuck with. It was Liberal preferences that elected the Greens member of parliament, and that is why we are in this situation. 



Opposition members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Rishworth
):  Order! Can members on my left please keep it down.




Mr LYONS:
  The Australian people decide who is in the Australian parliament and the Australian government then have to negotiate. So the Leader of the Opposition lies back in his chair with his feet on the table and his hands behind his head and says, 'You are going to vote for me, aren't you, you Independents, you Greens, because I am the opposition leader now?' That was the difference. The Prime Minister went in and negotiated.


One of the Independents told us that the Leader of the Opposition said, 'I'll give you whatever you like except I won't sell a certain part of my anatomy.' That is the difference. The Prime Minister of Australia went in and genuinely negotiated. Part of this situation was caused by the Liberal preferences going to the Greens—and that is the parliament we have got. The government has been upfront about the carbon price and electricity prices, as they affect all Australians.


Treasury modelling has found that the carbon price would increase household electricity prices by 10 per cent, $3.30 a week on average. The Electricity Regulator determinations have confirmed this. In some cases, the carbon impact has been less than the Treasury's estimates. To meet the impact, the government has provided $10.10 a week on average to households. The opposition should focus on the state Liberal governments, who are lining their pockets with this compensation from those in public housing. It is important to establish these facts because those opposite are engaged in a cowardly campaign of frightening pensioners.


Recently the opposition leader made several misleading claims about an electricity bill from West Australia. The opposition leader told the House there was an $800 increase in just one bill, 70 per cent of which was due to the carbon tax. But, surprise, surprise, when this bill was examined it was clear that the proportion of the increase which was due to the carbon price was a fraction of the claimed 70 per cent. This is lazy, this is deceitful and this treats pensioners disrespectfully, as nothing but fodder for a political scare campaign. If the opposition really cared about pensioners, they would have established the facts about this bill, rather than rushing in here to distort it for political ends.


Those opposite have misled people generally and senior Australians in particular about job losses. Those opposite have misled people about assistance for small business. They have misled people about the strength of our economy. It has been a farce of wrecking balls, cobra strikes, python squeezes, dogs of taxes and octopus embraces. It is time the opposition displayed some integrity and put this discredited scare campaign out of its misery.


The member for Moore is a man of great integrity and a person who in my short time here I have grown to admire for both his words and actions. I think the opposition should take his advice and come up with properly funded policies which look to the future. The opposition leader should get off his downward spiral of negativity by taking advice from the member for Moore.


The carbon price has been in operation for over 100 days. Before it started, the opposition leader made countless dire predictions about its impact. Plague and pestilence were to be brought upon us. Not a single one of those predictions has come to pass. The opposition leader had predicted: Whyalla, Gladstone and the Hunter Valley would all be wiped off the map, but investment is growing—the Mayor of Whyalla says his town is 'kicking goals'; the death of the coal industry, but Australia's exports of thermal coal are forecast to increase by 12 per cent to 165 million tonnes in 2012—in fact, another coal loader has been ordered for Newcastle; the death of the steel industry, yet OneSteel, or Arrium, is now the subject of a takeover bid; and the death of manufacturing, but manufacturing employment has grown by 9,000 jobs since the carbon price began. We know that some areas are doing it tough, and Bass in Tasmania is one of those areas, but that is nothing to do with the carbon price. I believe it is partly because the community, including businesses, have been relying on the pulp mill being built.


The opposition leader predicted the price on carbon would create unimaginable price increases, yet the RBA can find no significant price rises. He also predicted tens of thousands of job losses, but the unemployment rate has dropped from 5.3 per cent to 5.1 per cent. The opposition leader has repeatedly claimed no other country is taking action. But Australia's carbon price will soon be linked to a scheme covering more than 30 other countries, and recently the government of the US state of California—the eighth largest economy in the world—announced that it will be exploring the potential linking of our carbon markets.


Contrary to the opposition leader's fallacious claims, the government's Household Assistance Package, funded by the carbon price, has made millions of people better off. The government has delivered tax cuts, higher family payments, increases in pensions and benefits to millions of households to help with the modest cost-of-living impacts. One million people no longer have to file a tax return because we trebled the tax-free threshold. That is a reform those opposite would never have made. It is only tax cuts for the wealthy that they understand. We know the opposition, when in government, were the highest taxing government as a proportion of GDP in Australia's history.


The opposition leader has trafficked in fiction and, if I can borrow a word from the minister, in a mendacious scare campaign. He continues to do it despite the facts and despite reality. The opposition have misled the people about the strength of our economy. It has been a farce of wrecking balls, cobra strikes, python squeezes, dogs of taxes and octopus embraces.


The carbon price is an essential economic reform. It is vital for our long-term competitiveness. It will allow Australia to play its part in tackling global climate change and at the same time improve our productivity through better use of energy inputs. Numerous economic reports have found that, while taking action has an economic cost, the cost of inaction will be far greater. The cheapest and most efficient way of reducing carbon pollution is to harness the power of the market, to put a price tag on greenhouse gas pollution that creates an incentive to cut that pollution. Every major economy is tackling climate change. Countries are using a mixture of regulation, carbon pricing, renewable energy targets and investment. Ensuring Australia does its fair share in tackling the global problem of climate change, we are doing this at least cost and are in a position to compete and prosper in a low-carbon economy, enhancing the productivity of Australian industry so that we are well placed to take up the growth opportunities that will be available in Asia and beyond over the next decades, which will support all Australians, including senior Australians, into the future.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (16:28):  The carbon tax will have an impact on all Australians. For some individuals, the impact will be very significant, and that will be the case for many of our senior Australians. That is something that is of great concern to me as the member for McPherson, and I know that it is of great concern to many of the seniors that live in my electorate of McPherson on the Gold Coast and also more broadly on the southern Gold Coast. I know that because they come and speak to me about it. They take every opportunity to raise with me their concerns about how they are going to pay their bills into the future and whether they will have enough money to get themselves through their retirement. One of the questions that are at the forefront of their minds is: what will the impact of the carbon tax be on my future?


I think it is important to look at some of the numbers for the seniors that we have here. I should start by saying that the definition of a senior Australian is anyone over the age of 50 years.




Mr Ramsey:
  That's a bit harsh!




Mrs ANDREWS:
  It is very harsh! In my electorate of McPherson, 34.5 per cent of the population are 50 years and over, so they are classified and categorised as seniors.


I recently hosted a seniors forum on the Gold Coast with my friend and colleague the member for Moncrieff. We were fortunate enough to have as our guest speaker of the day the shadow minister for seniors, the member for Mackellar. Debate interrupted.

"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2012-10-11,"



Mr SCHULTZ
 (Hume) (16:30):  I am about to read a very compelling email from a constituent that indicates just what political correctness has done to the family unit in this great country of ours. I quote:


Mr Schultz. I'm a 52 yr old father of four at my wits end. Last week my youngest girl (15) gave birth to a baby boy. We had no Idea she was pregnant and according to the doc she had blocked it from her memory. She told them, not me at the hospital who the father was a 20yr old male. I was told not to intervene as she was in a fragile state and loving my daughter unconditionally I did so. Later I was told after speaking with doctors a doc worker and councilor that my daughter would not have him charged, further they advised her he should be involved in her life. My wife who has spent a week with my daughter in hospital was told she has no say. As parents we have no rights for our baby daughter, the anguish she had to endure alone breaks my heart, three hours I spent trying to help her while she was in so much pain and the shock she went through giving birth. My wife and I raised four great children, we love them dearly and they love us in return. I'm at a loss as to why we were shut out when a snake of a man who was a friend of my eldest daughter and fiance did a thing like this and walks away without penalty. Where are our rights, my daughters rights she is a baby for gods sake. I love my girl and my grandson but their has to be something some avenue we can turn, this bloke is dangerous.


He then went on to send me another email yesterday:


Re my daughter Amy. Said social worker con my daughter without our prior knowledge Whilst talking to Amy totally ignored my wife telling our daughter that it was her sole decision in the matter. Prompted her on more than one occasion that the MAN should be involved in the upbringing of the child. Attempted to invite herself into our home when the district nurses were due Rang to speak to Amy who was busy at the time with the baby wanting to make app to visit I denied her on the basis that my daughter had said (dad can you keep that women away from me). My wife and I are incredulous that this person without forethought presumed that Kath and I were the same as all parents when all people are different and that she could have access to our child after going through a very physical and emotional time without any ok from us after all this is our baby. One final point this lady made my daughter feel insecure not secure in the family and massive friend support she has.


As a result of that, I wrote to three ministers of the Crown at the state level. In particular I wrote to the Hon. Pru Goward, who is the Minister for Family and Community Services, and I said this:


I refer to you the attached correspondence dated 21st September 2012 from—


my constituent in Cowra, New South Wales—


in the Hume Electorate who brings to my attention his grave concerns regarding his underage daughter of 15 years of age giving birth recently to a child fathered by a 20 year old male.


Enquiries made with the NSW Police reveal that, if a complaint is made and is proven, this is a jailable offence under NSW law carrying a substantial penalty by way of a 10-year sentence, could you please confirm this information so that I may advise my constituent.


I would further point-out that the intervention of a Doc's Worker, Councillor & Doctor have not assisted this family in anyway, and may have influenced the 15 year old's decision not to have the adult male charged. This inappropriate interference without full knowledge of the parents may have made the situation worse as this whole affair obviously began when this girl was a 14 year old minor as she is now only 15 and gave birth in mid-September.


I am in contact with the parents and have written permission to pursue the matter vigorously on their behalf.


I have also written to the Attorney General and the police minister and I intend to write to the minister for health in New South Wales to ask why these people employed by the state of New South Wales interfered in and shut down the rights of parents to look after their child, who in fact under the laws of this country is still a minor. I really do despair when these sorts of issues are raised in this politically correct environment that we live in today. They take away the God given right and the appropriate right under our system of democracy for parents to look after, educate and maintain the health of their children. (Time expired)

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (09:30):  I must officially congratulate the member for Hindmarsh on his elevation to Second Deputy Speaker. I will miss him as Chair of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, but I am sure he will be replaced by someone equally capable.


Today I rise to speak about the 10th anniversary of the tragic Bali bombings, which will be commemorated tomorrow. Both here in Australia and in Bali friends, families, survivors and supporters of those who suffered during this cowardly act of terrorism will stand side by side in memory of the tragic event. Two hundred and two people, including 88 Australians and 39 Indonesians, were killed at the Sari Club on the night of 12 October 2002. Even more were injured and airlifted to Australia for treatment. Our Defence Force were instrumental in treating victims on the ground and setting up makeshift hospitals to treat not just Australians but all those injured.


Tomorrow we will be not only remembering the events of 12 October but also celebrating the ever-strengthening relationship between Indonesia and Australia. I have spoken before in this place about a wonderful bilateral organisation that was founded in Perth, Western Australia, in 2008 called the Bali Peace Park organisation. This not-for-profit organisation is supported by Australian federal and state governments to bring together survivors, families, friends and supporters of those affected by the Bali bombings, as well as Balinese and Indonesian government officials. The organisation has a mission statement of 'striving to help build a future without fear by promoting tolerance, understanding and freedom for generations to come'. The Bali Peace Park organisation has helped many Australians and Indonesians come to terms with the horrific terror attacks and move on in cooperation.


Since the organisation's beginning in 2008, I have sought to keep the House up to date with the Bali Peace Park's goal to create a spiritual garden on the Sari Club site for persons to reflect upon and acknowledge the terrorist attack on 12 October 2002. At the moment the site is being used as a makeshift car park and the organisation is in ongoing negotiations with the owners of the land. I wish the organisation every success with these endeavours. I have also had the opportunity to meet with the Governor of Bali, Governor Pastika, and promote the ideals of the Bali Peace Park organisation to him and seek his assistance in reaching the goal of turning the Sari Club site into a memorial, a spiritual garden.


Tomorrow morning I will be attending the peace park's annual dawn service at King's Park in Perth with WA Premier Colin Barnett and many members of the public. The support for this service continues to grow year after year and is a testament to the spirit of the survivors and the supporters.


In closing I would like to acknowledge one of the patrons of the Bali Peace Park, Dr Fiona Wood. Dr Wood pioneered groundbreaking medical technology to treat the burns and save the lives of many injured in the blast. It is people like Dr Wood, our Defence Force and heroic survivors who have pioneered through heartbreak to create a strong and supportive network. They deserve to be celebrated on 12 October each year.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-10-11,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (10:18):  I speak in support of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2012 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2012. This is a miscellaneous bill that deals with a number of issues. Firstly, it extends the Cape York welfare reform trial, and I will talk about that in detail. It extends the Indigenous education payments. Both of these measures are budget measures flowing out of the 2012-13 budget. There are a number of other non-budget changes as a result of this, including changes in relation to disclosure of information and privacy issues under the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. There is a change in relation to child support that fixes up a problem caused by the decision of the Family Court in relation to the payment of child support particularly in circumstances where paternity is disputed and found to be otherwise than that which was expected by both the mother and the father.


There are other minor amendments in relation to the schoolkids bonus and other changes as well in terms of the rounding of payment rates for family assistance and clean energy legislation. In relation to the other minor amendments, the amendments make sure that the schoolkids bonus is consistent with our intended policy. The schoolkids bonus, as you know, is the successor to the education tax refund which we brought in. The schoolkids bonus provides $410 for each child at primary school and $820 a year for each child in high school. It will benefit and has benefited about 11,000 families in the Blair electorate, which is based in Ipswich and the Somerset region. There are 19,400 children who have benefited from that particular piece of legislation. It is a great Labor initiative. It costs a lot of money to raise a child. The Institute of Family Studies indicates that it costs a parent about $1 million to raise a child to 18 years of age, so this will assist parents to meet the needs, to make sure school items are purchased. Not having to wait months to get something back is good policy. 


It is a good initiative of this federal Labor government. I was at one of the biggest primary schools—Raceview State Primary School, where both my daughters attended—in my electorate when we actually brought that in, and was talking to mums and dads as they dropped kids off in relation to changes we were making. There was not a person there I spoke to who was not happy with what we are doing. Sadly, of course, those opposite opposed the legislation when it came into the House. It is one of those things where the other side have the visceral commitment in their DNA to saying no, and sadly they did.


The other aspects of this legislation deal with extending the Cape York Welfare Reform Trial. As chair of House of Representatives Standing Committee on ATSIA, the committee looked at and commented extensively on the work being done by that particular organisation in Queensland. It is a particularly successful organisation and we commented upon that in our recommendations in the Doing time—time for doing report. In fact we recommended to the Commonwealth government in recommendation 38:


… that the Australian Government in partnership with the Queensland Government and the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership extend the funding of the Family Responsibility Commission—


in relation to this particular reform—


until December 2013, pending further evaluation. 


I am pleased to say that the committee noted that in this budget and in the previous budget the Australian government provides $16.1 million to extend the FRC until 31 December 2012. We are of the opinion that it is critical to extend the funding until December 2013 in order to allow the operation to continue and an adequate evaluation in relation to that. I am pleased that this legislation will continue the income management element of the Cape York Welfare Trial for a further 12 months until 31 December 2013.


The background to this reform is really important. It is important to note, and as a Queenslander I am pleased to speak on this bill. The Queensland Family Responsibilities Commission began operating in four communities—Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge—in July 2008. The purpose is to support the restoration of socially responsible standards of behaviour and to assist community members to assume and maintain primary responsibility for the wellbeing of their community, individuals and families. It is about strengthening communities and improving personal resilience. There are a number of objectives in relation to that: to restore social norms and to make sure that the wellbeing of children is promoted. The objectives are about making sure that children go to school—truancy is a problem—and making sure that the norm is not to drink alcohol in the home or to have pornography in the home. There are a range of other things that Commissioner David Glasgow from the Family Responsibilities Commission explained to our inquiry. This has proved to be a successful operation and it has made an impact for good in Queensland in relation to all of those issues.


We have seen improvements as a result with stronger communities in North Queensland. One of the things I was most struck by as we looked at that work done by the FRC was in notification. If a person's child is absent from school three times in a term without reasonable excuse or a person has a child of school age who is not enrolled in school without lawful excuse there are significant consequences that flow. Commissioners are involved, elders are involved and the whole community takes ownership of what is going on. This particular measure in this bill takes up the recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I am pleased to see that the budget measure correlates with the recommendation of the House of Representatives committee.


We are seeking a commitment from the Queensland government to continue funding for the Family Responsibilities Commission including some amendment of Queensland legislation. The Queensland government has not always been generous with its funding of organisations, particularly Indigenous organisations, for those who are suffering homelessness or are at risk of homelessness, for front line services such as family planning, or for tenancy, family support, health and other services in Queensland. In Queensland the attitude is to purge and financially cut off funding. We are hopeful the government will put its money where its mouth is. It talks positively about what is happening and it is about time it put up or shut up. There will be an evaluation of the trial, which, I understand, is currently under way. It will assist us in our efforts in Cape York


The other budget measure in this legislation is for Indigenous education payments. I am pleased to see there is about $16 million in funding for the combined 2012 and 2013 calendar years. A number of the programs relate to improving school attendance and to improving the quality of education and teacher training. They also improve nutrition and make sure that children are more likely to not absent themselves from school but are more likely to be focused on their school achievement and to be focused not just on education in the classroom but on high-quality development on the sporting field as well. Programs such as building a quality workforce talk about the need for teachers in remote Northern Territory schools, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander teachers, to have the skills they need for specialist teaching in intensive numeracy and literacy.


The committee, for its inquiry into language learning in Indigenous communities, went across all of northern Australia and all around the place for 23 public hearings. We went to a place called Utopia Homelands in the Northern Territory. It is a very remote place and you get there by plane. One of the things that struck me as we travelled around Western Australia and the Northern Territory was the need for it to be compulsory for teachers to be trained in English-as-a-second-language education. There needs to be good accreditation and good-quality understanding of first language and the need for bilingual education. We must make sure that those teachers who come from Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane who go into these communities are trained well and understand the Indigenous languages. There are a plethora of recommendations in the report, Our Land Our Languages, to promote that.


Building a quality workforce is one of the initiatives funded in this budget and I applaud the government for it. School nutrition continuation programs are also important. We can see that in the Northern Territory. I have seen that sort of program adopted by Indigenous elders in my community at my old high school, Bundamba State Secondary College, where the Davidson women, elders in the local Ipswich community, have taken the initiative with a number of other Indigenous elders. They call them uncles and aunties in the local community and they do great work making sure that Indigenous kids at Bundamba State Secondary College get to school.


That is a program that has been picked up by places like Ipswich State High and other areas—so Indigenous and non-Indigenous kids are going to school with food in their bellies and are able to improve their educational output and their capacity to learn by the fact that Indigenous and non-Indigenous people are helping to make sure they have good nutrition. This particular program, School Nutrition, provides meals to about 5,000 students, and I am pleased it is being funded in this particular legislation.


The Sporting Chance program is also particularly important. We are very happy to cheer on our Indigenous stars in the AFL and the NRL. We are very happy to cheer them on and assist them at the State of Origin and in other areas of sporting endeavour, whether it is Cathy Freeman, Jonathan Thurston or any other sporting hero, but we need our next champions to come through. I am pleased that the House of Representatives ATSIA committee, which I chair, is looking at the role of sport in Closing the Gap. The Sporting Chance program, under this particular legislation, is using sport and recreation to increase the engagement of Indigenous students in their schooling. Sport has a particular role to play.


I can recall a boy of about 14 years of age in Utopia. He was an AFL champion of the future. He found himself in a position where he was struggling as school. But it was explained to him that his starring on the field was just as important as his starring in the classroom. So what the teacher did was, through this type of program, make sure that he had stars—stars that were listed beside his name when he achieved good things in the classroom. This boy, this great star of the future, was proud of the fact that he starred. His physique was incredible; he is going to be a champion in the AFL for sure, no doubt about it; he was one of the best players in the Northern Territory. He had a sporting chance. Sport was so important to his good education on the team. So that Sporting Chance program is the kind of thing that is important: sport-focused learning and development. There are a number of things like that program that teach initiative in remote areas as well.


In conclusion, there are great improvements in the bill. It fixes a problem in terms of child support where the Family Court has made an order which confused the issue of paternity. I was involved, when I was a lawyer, in those types of cases in the past. They are very complex and very difficult, so we are effectively bringing back what we thought was the longstanding policy that we have in terms of accrediting money in one way or the other, making sure that we do not go through the process of further litigation, which was the consequence of that decision.


There is another amendment in relation to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, enabling SSAT members to release some protected information to relevant authorities where there is risk to life, health or welfare; and improving privacy protection. So this legislation has some really good things in it which will make a difference to people's lives, particularly our Indigenous brothers and sisters. It is not just fixing things up with some technical amendments, overcoming an adverse decision; it will make an appreciable difference to the lives of Indigenous people across the country. I support the bill.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2012-10-11,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (10:33):  In the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2012 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2012, several measures from the 2012 budget are introduced. There are also some non-budget amendments that clarify current policies and improve the operation of existing legislation. Before I speak to those measures, I thank the member for Blair for his excellent contribution to the debate.


The Gillard government provided $11.8 million in the 1012 budget to extend the Cape York welfare reform trial for 12 months to 31 December 2013. Aiming to restore local Indigenous authority, encourage positive behaviours and improve economic and living conditions, the trial is a partnership between the communities of Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge; the Australian government; the Queensland government; and the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership. 


The trial began in July 2008 and has made some positive differences in the lives of Indigenous people in Cape York. The welfare reform communities in the Cape have seen improvements in school attendance, care and protection of children and community safety. A key plank of the Cape York welfare reform is the Family Responsibilities Commission, which is established under Queensland government legislation. Local family responsibility commissioners hold conferences with community members and refer people to support services. When necessary, they arrange income management.


Under the current rules, a person can be subject to income management under the trial only after a decision by the Family Responsibilities Commission made before 1 January 2013. Under this bill, that date is extended to 1 January 2014. The extension provides an opportunity to build upon the success of the initiatives already underway. The Queensland government has also committed to continuing its support for the trial and to introducing legislation to extend the operation of the Family Responsibilities Commission.


This bill provides a significant boost to Indigenous education by amending the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to increase the act's legislative appropriation. The increase will amount to around $16 million combined for the 2012 and 2013 calendar years. This change will allow the continuation of existing initiatives under the act and the commencement of new initiatives announced in the 2012-13 budget.


Among the new initiatives that will be funded by the increased appropriations for 2012 and 2013 are the expansion of the Sporting Chance Program, Teach Remote stage 2, student education trusts delivered as part of the Cape York Welfare Reform Trial and initiatives that support teachers, professional development and frontline services to improve Aboriginal children's access to quality education. Under the existing Sporting Chance Program, sport and recreation are used to increase the engagement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in their schooling. Participation in sporting teams or access to certain intensive high-quality sports-focused learning and development are used to reward students for good school attendance or engagement. New school based sports academies will now be established and operated to deliver the program for secondary school boys. There will be additional programs for secondary school girls.


Additional Commonwealth funded assistance under the Teach Remote stage 2 initiative will help with building a high-status, high-quality, committed and competent teacher workforce in remote Indigenous communities that are under the National Alliance of Remote Indigenous Schools. With additional funding, the student education trusts measure that forms part of the Cape York Welfare Reform Trial will also be extended for 12 months. These trusts are a financial management service that gives parents and caregivers from the remote Indigenous communities in the Cape York area support and encouragement to save for their children's education costs from their early years through to tertiary education.


The bill also introduces some non-budget amendments to clarify current government policies and improve the operation of existing legislation. Some of these make up a package of minor amendments to improve the operation of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in the social security, child support, family assistance and paid parental leave jurisdictions. As an example, some amendments will enable Social Security Appeals Tribunal members to release protected information to relevant authorities in certain circumstances where there is a threat to the life, health or welfare of the person.


Privacy protections for information and documents will also be improved, including allowing the principal member of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to issue a non-disclosure order that applies to any information or documents obtained by a person at any time during the review process. Amendments also extend confidentiality obligations to all people providing services at the hearing of the review. The objective of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal is to provide a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. Amendments clarify that this objective is to be pursued by the principal member in performing his or her functions and using his or her powers under the legislation.


The bill amends the child support legislation to confirm the longstanding policy and administration where the amount payable under a parent's child support assessment is reduced because the court decides that the payer is not a parent of one of the children in their assessment but the payer remains liable for another child in the assessment. Lastly, minor drafting clarifications are made to portfolio legislation, including the schoolkids bonus legislation and the family assistance clean energy legislation consistent with existing policy.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-10-11,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (10:18):  I speak in support of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2012 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2012. This is a miscellaneous bill that deals with a number of issues. Firstly, it extends the Cape York welfare reform trial, and I will talk about that in detail. It extends the Indigenous education payments. Both of these measures are budget measures flowing out of the 2012-13 budget. There are a number of other non-budget changes as a result of this, including changes in relation to disclosure of information and privacy issues under the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. There is a change in relation to child support that fixes up a problem caused by the decision of the Family Court in relation to the payment of child support particularly in circumstances where paternity is disputed and found to be otherwise than that which was expected by both the mother and the father.


There are other minor amendments in relation to the schoolkids bonus and other changes as well in terms of the rounding of payment rates for family assistance and clean energy legislation. In relation to the other minor amendments, the amendments make sure that the schoolkids bonus is consistent with our intended policy. The schoolkids bonus, as you know, is the successor to the education tax refund which we brought in. The schoolkids bonus provides $410 for each child at primary school and $820 a year for each child in high school. It will benefit and has benefited about 11,000 families in the Blair electorate, which is based in Ipswich and the Somerset region. There are 19,400 children who have benefited from that particular piece of legislation. It is a great Labor initiative. It costs a lot of money to raise a child. The Institute of Family Studies indicates that it costs a parent about $1 million to raise a child to 18 years of age, so this will assist parents to meet the needs, to make sure school items are purchased. Not having to wait months to get something back is good policy. 


It is a good initiative of this federal Labor government. I was at one of the biggest primary schools—Raceview State Primary School, where both my daughters attended—in my electorate when we actually brought that in, and was talking to mums and dads as they dropped kids off in relation to changes we were making. There was not a person there I spoke to who was not happy with what we are doing. Sadly, of course, those opposite opposed the legislation when it came into the House. It is one of those things where the other side have the visceral commitment in their DNA to saying no, and sadly they did.


The other aspects of this legislation deal with extending the Cape York Welfare Reform Trial. As chair of House of Representatives Standing Committee on ATSIA, the committee looked at and commented extensively on the work being done by that particular organisation in Queensland. It is a particularly successful organisation and we commented upon that in our recommendations in the Doing time—time for doing report. In fact we recommended to the Commonwealth government in recommendation 38:


… that the Australian Government in partnership with the Queensland Government and the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership extend the funding of the Family Responsibility Commission—


in relation to this particular reform—


until December 2013, pending further evaluation. 


I am pleased to say that the committee noted that in this budget and in the previous budget the Australian government provides $16.1 million to extend the FRC until 31 December 2012. We are of the opinion that it is critical to extend the funding until December 2013 in order to allow the operation to continue and an adequate evaluation in relation to that. I am pleased that this legislation will continue the income management element of the Cape York Welfare Trial for a further 12 months until 31 December 2013.


The background to this reform is really important. It is important to note, and as a Queenslander I am pleased to speak on this bill. The Queensland Family Responsibilities Commission began operating in four communities—Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge—in July 2008. The purpose is to support the restoration of socially responsible standards of behaviour and to assist community members to assume and maintain primary responsibility for the wellbeing of their community, individuals and families. It is about strengthening communities and improving personal resilience. There are a number of objectives in relation to that: to restore social norms and to make sure that the wellbeing of children is promoted. The objectives are about making sure that children go to school—truancy is a problem—and making sure that the norm is not to drink alcohol in the home or to have pornography in the home. There are a range of other things that Commissioner David Glasgow from the Family Responsibilities Commission explained to our inquiry. This has proved to be a successful operation and it has made an impact for good in Queensland in relation to all of those issues.


We have seen improvements as a result with stronger communities in North Queensland. One of the things I was most struck by as we looked at that work done by the FRC was in notification. If a person's child is absent from school three times in a term without reasonable excuse or a person has a child of school age who is not enrolled in school without lawful excuse there are significant consequences that flow. Commissioners are involved, elders are involved and the whole community takes ownership of what is going on. This particular measure in this bill takes up the recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I am pleased to see that the budget measure correlates with the recommendation of the House of Representatives committee.


We are seeking a commitment from the Queensland government to continue funding for the Family Responsibilities Commission including some amendment of Queensland legislation. The Queensland government has not always been generous with its funding of organisations, particularly Indigenous organisations, for those who are suffering homelessness or are at risk of homelessness, for front line services such as family planning, or for tenancy, family support, health and other services in Queensland. In Queensland the attitude is to purge and financially cut off funding. We are hopeful the government will put its money where its mouth is. It talks positively about what is happening and it is about time it put up or shut up. There will be an evaluation of the trial, which, I understand, is currently under way. It will assist us in our efforts in Cape York

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2012-10-11,"



Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (10:41):  Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, let me use this opportunity to congratulate you on your election to the position of Second Deputy Speaker—




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—




Sitting suspended from 
10
:
41
 to 
11
:
08





Mr DANBY:
  I am supporting the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security review on the relisting of five terrorist organisations. As a member of that committee I commend the process that this parliament established under the previous, conservative government—under great pressure from the then numbers in the Senate—for the evaluation of these organisations, one by one, by the parliament rather than under the direct auspices of the Attorney-General. I believe this gives the Australian public a feeling of transparency and ownership of this process, which it deserves, and it makes members of this House cognisant of the activities of these particular organisations—17 organisations in total—which are a threat to the Australian people, as has been shown and as we are about to remember, by the deaths of 88 of our countrymen in Bali as a result of the activities of Jemaah Islamiah. I will come to some of the other organisations in a minute.


I note that the Director-General of Security, Mr Irvine, recently said that some 200 cases are being followed by the Australian security services of people who are coming backwards and forwards to Australia from places like Somalia, Yemen and the AfPak theatre, as they call it, who are a potential threat to Australia. With 200 people like that, the job of making sure nothing untoward happens must be extremely difficult, and I pay tribute to those people who were in the field defending Australian interests, making sure that we remain without attacks on mainland Australia. We have been very fortunate— unlike France, Germany, Britain or the United States—to have avoided such attacks in our country. We have to work very hard to maintain it, including this parliament's supporting the practice of classifying these groups according to objective and rational analysis that we receive—in a bipartisan way and in a way that is transparent to the Australian people through its parliament.


So we are particularly concerned about organisations like al-Shabaab in Somalia, where three Australian citizens affiliated with it have been charged and convicted of terrorist related activities. We have the Hamas Izz ad-Din Qassam brigades, who have killed more than 500 people in 350 attacks since 1993. The activities of Hamas are particularly relevant to Australia, since an Australian citizen was arrested and convicted and is in jail for three years following his attempt to surveil establishments in Israel.


I particularly want to draw the opposition's attention to the fact that the ABC, in what I can only describe as a gutless decision, in reporting this arrest and jailing after an open trial, said that this Australian citizen would be of concern only to Israelis because he was convicted of a terrorist surveillance effort there. Of course, as an Australian citizen, after the three years a person returning to Australia who has been involved in such a focused and important terrorist activity would be of great concern to Australians as well. The fact that the ABC completely refuses to acknowledge that this group is classified by the Australian parliament as a terrorist group is a decision that reflects very poorly on the Managing Director, Mr Scott, and the various program executives who have refused repeated requests from the elected representatives of Australia to include that reference in their news reports. There is also classification of Palestinian Islamic jihad.


But what I want to focus on today is Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Sunni Islamic extremist organisation based in Pakistan that uses violence as its stated objective in uniting the Indian administered Kashmir with Pakistan under a radical interpretation of Islamic law, which would then become part of the wider Caliphate of the Salafist Islamists—that is, people who use the great religion of Islam as a political cause, who abuse that peaceful religion for a political cause. LET is an organisation that is most active in Kashmir. It is a terrorist group that is actively engaged there in preparing and planning attacks, including bombings, and kidnappings against people all over India.


Lashkar-e-Tayyiba has played a role in terrorist attacks that have involved Australians. The murder of two of our countrymen in Mumbai in the attacks on that fine Indian city three years ago is something I particularly want to reflect on. I have been to Mumbai twice since then and stayed at the Taj Hotel, probably as an act of counter-suggestibility. Perhaps I am known for that trait! But I think the jihadist world view would regard India and its success, particularly a great commercial capital like Mumbai, as an affront to their world view.


In fact, as we speak, in the streets of Pakistan, members of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba are openly parading themselves. The founder of the group, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, has held public functions addressing people, supporting the attack on Mumbai and threatening further attacks on India. It is intolerable that the government of Pakistan, which has pledged to crack down on Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, continues to allow this group to openly parade—this despite the fact that it was officially banned in Pakistan in 2002. The group's re-emergence suggests that powerbrokers within the Pakistani security forces are reactivating it so it can continue the turbulence it causes, which they think, in some crazed fashion, benefits Pakistan.


Some in the military in Pakistan view the efforts of President Zardari to forge a rapprochement with India with suspicion. Ending the cold war with their neighbour is something that these people associated with the ISI, the infamous Pakistani intelligence service, would hope to make difficult, because it is not their view.


A number of individuals who have been trained by Lashkar-e-Tayyiba have been arrested in Australia. People from this organisation who have been jailed in other countries have come to Australia, including Willie Brigitte. There are a number of other people who have subsequently been jailed who have been involved in training in Lashkar-e-Tayyiba camps. There was the case in 2006 in the New South Wales Supreme Court where Faheem Khalid Lodhi was convicted of plotting to attack the national electricity supply, trying to get into Holsworthy barracks and onto HMAS Penguin naval base.


In 2009, the Indian newspaper the Calcutta Telegraph reported that the Pakistani American who mapped out the target sites in Mumbai, whose name was Daood Gilani, had gone to India to scope these sites—very much like the Hamas man, an Australian citizen, who was convicted in Israel. He was arrested on federal charges in the United States for committing terrorist acts on overseas targets, including facilities and employees of a Danish newspaper.


So Lashkar-e-Tayyiba remains an active concern to this country. We have a number of people have been arrested who were charged with working with Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. In my view, this is nothing less than a terrorist group run by Pakistan, and I say that completely seriously. Pakistan is allegedly an ally of the United States and Australia, and it gets $2 billion of American taxpayers' money and $119 million of our foreign aid. The leaders of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, as I said, live openly in Pakistan. It is outrageous that Pakistani explosives factories in Lahore are the major source of the improvised explosive devices that kill Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. Let me repeat that: Pakistan is a country that receives $119 million in foreign aid from Australia, but its factories, under the control of the Pakistani state, provide the explosives that are used to kill Australian and American soldiers in Afghanistan. We all have our views on Afghanistan. But we must not let the duplicity of the Pakistani state deter us from our duty. However, it is intolerable that, on top of that, we have this group, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which has repeatedly been involved in terrorist missions and training of people in Australia. I would suggest that, if you look at the five sets of people who have been arrested, charged and convicted in Australia of terrorist crimes, you will find that all of them have a Lashkar-e-Tayyiba training connection. Even worse than that, there were two Australians among the 200 people directly killed by that disgusting terrorist attack on the beautiful Indian city of Mumbai, the symbol of India's progress and commerce.


This is a most important classification today. Following the death of Private Greg Sher at the hands of the Afghan Taliban it has been a part of my duties to work with his dear parents, Felix and Yvonne Sher. I feel this most personally. I know the Australian people do not want terrorism coming to our country. I praise the security services, the armed forces, who keep these people far from our door—and long may it continue. In all of this it is important that the Australian parliament brace up to its duty and see that these groups are classified in a proper, impartial, rational and transparent way so that all Australians can understand why these people are to be arrested and charged if they are involved in such deeds in Australia.


I am particularly concerned about Pakistan's ongoing activities as a country that supports and allows attacks on Australian soldiers and, worse, allows this group to continually train individuals who not only harm Australians overseas in cities like Mumbai but actually try and penetrate Australia. We in the Australian parliament must continually address the Pakistani government and tell its ambassador here how gravely we hold these activities. The provision of aid to Pakistan will one day become an issue if Lashkar-e-Tayyiba is further involved in attacks on Australian citizens. I remember when, under Mr Howard's government, Pakistani President Musharraf came here and in the Great Hall made all his false promises to take all of these issues seriously. We are not fools. Australians may be pleasant people but we hold these issues very gravely and we will hold the Pakistani government and all its agencies to account.


Debate adjourned.

Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (10:41):  Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, let me use this opportunity to congratulate you on your election to the position of Second Deputy Speaker—




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—




Sitting suspended from

Mr DANBY:
  I am supporting the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security review on the relisting of five terrorist organisations. As a member of that committee I commend the process that this parliament established under the previous, conservative government—under great pressure from the then numbers in the Senate—for the evaluation of these organisations, one by one, by the parliament rather than under the direct auspices of the Attorney-General. I believe this gives the Australian public a feeling of transparency and ownership of this process, which it deserves, and it makes members of this House cognisant of the activities of these particular organisations—17 organisations in total—which are a threat to the Australian people, as has been shown and as we are about to remember, by the deaths of 88 of our countrymen in Bali as a result of the activities of Jemaah Islamiah. I will come to some of the other organisations in a minute.


I note that the Director-General of Security, Mr Irvine, recently said that some 200 cases are being followed by the Australian security services of people who are coming backwards and forwards to Australia from places like Somalia, Yemen and the AfPak theatre, as they call it, who are a potential threat to Australia. With 200 people like that, the job of making sure nothing untoward happens must be extremely difficult, and I pay tribute to those people who were in the field defending Australian interests, making sure that we remain without attacks on mainland Australia. We have been very fortunate— unlike France, Germany, Britain or the United States—to have avoided such attacks in our country. We have to work very hard to maintain it, including this parliament's supporting the practice of classifying these groups according to objective and rational analysis that we receive—in a bipartisan way and in a way that is transparent to the Australian people through its parliament.


So we are particularly concerned about organisations like al-Shabaab in Somalia, where three Australian citizens affiliated with it have been charged and convicted of terrorist related activities. We have the Hamas Izz ad-Din Qassam brigades, who have killed more than 500 people in 350 attacks since 1993. The activities of Hamas are particularly relevant to Australia, since an Australian citizen was arrested and convicted and is in jail for three years following his attempt to surveil establishments in Israel.


I particularly want to draw the opposition's attention to the fact that the ABC, in what I can only describe as a gutless decision, in reporting this arrest and jailing after an open trial, said that this Australian citizen would be of concern only to Israelis because he was convicted of a terrorist surveillance effort there. Of course, as an Australian citizen, after the three years a person returning to Australia who has been involved in such a focused and important terrorist activity would be of great concern to Australians as well. The fact that the ABC completely refuses to acknowledge that this group is classified by the Australian parliament as a terrorist group is a decision that reflects very poorly on the Managing Director, Mr Scott, and the various program executives who have refused repeated requests from the elected representatives of Australia to include that reference in their news reports. There is also classification of Palestinian Islamic jihad.


But what I want to focus on today is Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Sunni Islamic extremist organisation based in Pakistan that uses violence as its stated objective in uniting the Indian administered Kashmir with Pakistan under a radical interpretation of Islamic law, which would then become part of the wider Caliphate of the Salafist Islamists—that is, people who use the great religion of Islam as a political cause, who abuse that peaceful religion for a political cause. LET is an organisation that is most active in Kashmir. It is a terrorist group that is actively engaged there in preparing and planning attacks, including bombings, and kidnappings against people all over India.


Lashkar-e-Tayyiba has played a role in terrorist attacks that have involved Australians. The murder of two of our countrymen in Mumbai in the attacks on that fine Indian city three years ago is something I particularly want to reflect on. I have been to Mumbai twice since then and stayed at the Taj Hotel, probably as an act of counter-suggestibility. Perhaps I am known for that trait! But I think the jihadist world view would regard India and its success, particularly a great commercial capital like Mumbai, as an affront to their world view.


In fact, as we speak, in the streets of Pakistan, members of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba are openly parading themselves. The founder of the group, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, has held public functions addressing people, supporting the attack on Mumbai and threatening further attacks on India. It is intolerable that the government of Pakistan, which has pledged to crack down on Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, continues to allow this group to openly parade—this despite the fact that it was officially banned in Pakistan in 2002. The group's re-emergence suggests that powerbrokers within the Pakistani security forces are reactivating it so it can continue the turbulence it causes, which they think, in some crazed fashion, benefits Pakistan.


Some in the military in Pakistan view the efforts of President Zardari to forge a rapprochement with India with suspicion. Ending the cold war with their neighbour is something that these people associated with the ISI, the infamous Pakistani intelligence service, would hope to make difficult, because it is not their view.


A number of individuals who have been trained by Lashkar-e-Tayyiba have been arrested in Australia. People from this organisation who have been jailed in other countries have come to Australia, including Willie Brigitte. There are a number of other people who have subsequently been jailed who have been involved in training in Lashkar-e-Tayyiba camps. There was the case in 2006 in the New South Wales Supreme Court where Faheem Khalid Lodhi was convicted of plotting to attack the national electricity supply, trying to get into Holsworthy barracks and onto HMAS Penguin naval base.


In 2009, the Indian newspaper the Calcutta Telegraph reported that the Pakistani American who mapped out the target sites in Mumbai, whose name was Daood Gilani, had gone to India to scope these sites—very much like the Hamas man, an Australian citizen, who was convicted in Israel. He was arrested on federal charges in the United States for committing terrorist acts on overseas targets, including facilities and employees of a Danish newspaper.


So Lashkar-e-Tayyiba remains an active concern to this country. We have a number of people have been arrested who were charged with working with Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. In my view, this is nothing less than a terrorist group run by Pakistan, and I say that completely seriously. Pakistan is allegedly an ally of the United States and Australia, and it gets $2 billion of American taxpayers' money and $119 million of our foreign aid. The leaders of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, as I said, live openly in Pakistan. It is outrageous that Pakistani explosives factories in Lahore are the major source of the improvised explosive devices that kill Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. Let me repeat that: Pakistan is a country that receives $119 million in foreign aid from Australia, but its factories, under the control of the Pakistani state, provide the explosives that are used to kill Australian and American soldiers in Afghanistan. We all have our views on Afghanistan. But we must not let the duplicity of the Pakistani state deter us from our duty. However, it is intolerable that, on top of that, we have this group, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which has repeatedly been involved in terrorist missions and training of people in Australia. I would suggest that, if you look at the five sets of people who have been arrested, charged and convicted in Australia of terrorist crimes, you will find that all of them have a Lashkar-e-Tayyiba training connection. Even worse than that, there were two Australians among the 200 people directly killed by that disgusting terrorist attack on the beautiful Indian city of Mumbai, the symbol of India's progress and commerce.


This is a most important classification today. Following the death of Private Greg Sher at the hands of the Afghan Taliban it has been a part of my duties to work with his dear parents, Felix and Yvonne Sher. I feel this most personally. I know the Australian people do not want terrorism coming to our country. I praise the security services, the armed forces, who keep these people far from our door—and long may it continue.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2012-10-11,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (12:14):  I rise today in support of a great Queensland company that has been badly let down by the legal system in this country. The company acted within the law, honourably, and despite this is faced with trial by media over the illegal activities and likely corruption of two well-connected Australians, Angus Reed and Matthew Joyce, in Dubai in 2007.


Sunland Group is headquartered on the Gold Coast, an ASX listed property company that has been in business for 29 years, 17 of those as a publicly listed company. Sunland's portfolio includes iconic buildings like the Q1 as well as housing, urban development and residential multistorey throughout Australia and overseas. In 2007, the Dubai waterfront was being developed. Sunland had already acquired property in the area and was seeking more. In what it believed to be a legitimate land deal, Sunland sought board approval for the purchase of the land and proceeded to transact through its lawyers here and overseas for the land purchase. It would be later revealed that, despite their representations otherwise, neither Matthew Joyce or Angus Reed had rights over the land which they sold and that the payments made to them by Sunland were never recorded or correctly reported. 


Despite recent media reports, it needs to be made clear that Sunland is not a party to the Dubai criminal proceedings and the Dubai criminal investigation was not commenced as a result of a complaint made by Sunland against Joyce, Lee, Reed or Brearley. The proceedings were initiated by the Dubai government after an inquiry by the Dubai audit department into an alleged bribe paid by Reed to Joyce. Sunland's only involvement is that the money from which the alleged bribe was paid came from money Sunland paid to Reed's company for development rights Reed said his company held. The Dubai government has said that no such development rights existed. Until Sunland was advised by the Dubai government of this, it had not known that it had been deceived. The Dubai authorities say that Joyce, who was a government official, received approximately $7 million from Reed in connection with a land transaction involving his employer, the Dubai government, where he failed to disclose the payment to his employer. Joyce has been charged with receiving a bribe and Reed is charged with paying it, and with disclosing government secrets and harming Dubai state interests. 


Sunland has taken civil action against Reed and Joyce in Australia to reclaim the moneys paid to Joyce for the land. The complaint is supported by documents prepared by Reed's lawyers which say that Prudentia, Reed's company, has reached agreement with the seller, Joyce's employer, to acquire and develop the property, which Sunland says is a representation that Reed already had an agreement with Nakeel to acquire the plot and upon which it based its reliance on the validity of its rights over the property. 


In Dubai, property is transacted differently than it is in other countries. That is, rather than the full amount, any premium or increased value is paid to the rights holder, who in this case was from all investigations deemed to be Angus Reed through his company Prudentia. It was under this arrangement that Sunland paid nearly $14 million to Reed from which Joyce himself was paid nearly $7 million by Reed. The defendants in Dubai are also charged with defrauding Sunland, but even if the Croft judgment was correct in its finding that Sunland was not deceived, and even if the Dubai court accepted that Sunland was not deceived, the other charges would remain. In particular the charge of bribery would remain, which is a serious crime in Dubai, as it is in Australia. 


In Australia, Justice Croft recently dismissed Sunland's case. He contended that the Dubai proceedings were not considered because he considered the evidence of Reed bribing Joyce to be irrelevant. Sunland, however, maintains that the $7 million bribe is very relevant as it provided a strong motive for Joyce to make the representations alleged by Sunland. There is evidence before the Supreme Court of Victoria that documents relied upon by Joyce and Reed are likely to have been falsified, and also unchallenged expert evidence that one key document relied upon by Joyce and Reed was proven to be a forgery, with a faked signature of a Dubai Waterfront employee. Despite protesting their innocence, at the Victorian trial Joyce and Reed chose not to give any evidence, so their witness statements were never able to be tested in court, and they were never able to be cross-examined about documents relating to Reed paying the bribe to Joyce. In relation to certain documents put in evidence, Joyce and Reed also claimed privilege against self-incrimination. The Australian civil case is going to appeal. In Dubai, the judge recently requested that the prosecutor consider if the charges against Reed and Joyce are sufficient. Last week the charges were upgraded. 


Sunland considers that the reputation of the company and its executives has been attacked in the Australian courts with the ulterior motive of assisting Joyce and Reed in connection with the criminal proceedings in Dubai. I know the Sunland directors well and their integrity is beyond reproach. It then begs this question: why have Sunland and its directors been attacked so viciously through trial by media? It is a great question and is a question that deserves to be answered, because Sunland directors have in my experience been fine, upstanding men, pillars of the community, and deserve every support from the community.
