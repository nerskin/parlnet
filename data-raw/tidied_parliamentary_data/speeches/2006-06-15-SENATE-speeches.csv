"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-06-15,"—I move:
That the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 73 and made under the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980, be disallowed.
I have moved this motion for the disallowance of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1) because they completely disavow the principle set down by the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980—acts that still stand. Furthermore, the primary legislation is currently being considered, so these regulations bring in the intent of the legislation before its proper debate and passage. If you believe in small business operators, you have to allow a place for them to operate. It is no good saying that you must leave it up to the goodwill and trust of the independents’ competition, the major oil companies, to protect the commercial rights of independents, branded operators and franchisees.
These regulations, removing the restrictions on the number of sites the major oil companies can operate from, do not do anything to address the issue that Coles and Woolworths have, in their association with Caltex and Shell, circumvented the intent of the 1980 sites and franchise acts. In fact, the regulations exacerbate the pressure on the independents, branded operators and franchisees by allowing the major oil companies to actively campaign for the soft centre of the market currently protected by the sites and franchise acts. These regulations will allow total vertical integration, and this is never a reason to reduce prices in a marketplace. The fact that this market regulation has been removed is also a major impediment to getting biorenewable fuels onto the market. Independents are by far the most aggressive in this market. This town is a very good example of that. Of the four stations in Canberra that sell biorenewable fuel, E10, three of them are independents.
The change in the regulations will lead to a similar situation to what happened in the United Kingdom, where the independent fuel stations and other small operators were overtaken by the majors, leading to the loss of mum-and-dad operators, who had been beneficiaries of the profit generated from the fuel retailing trade. The closure of regional fuel stations, as happened in the UK, is another consequence of such regulations and one that should be a major concern for those who represent regional areas. The report by the All-Party Parliamentary Small Shops Group in the UK, High Street Britain: 2015, concluded that independent petrol stations were ‘very unlikely to survive’ in this market.
The argument will be put by some that none of the majors wishes to take over the independent, branded operator and franchisee share, but that is a counterintuitive argument to why they are busting their boilers to get these regulations through. The majors have offered no alternative plan as to how they will protect the independent, branded operator or franchisee sector of the market, which will be vulnerable to the regulatory change. We do not have the power under other mechanisms, such as section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, to protect them. If we let this regulatory instrument stand, we will be saying that the purity of a half-regulated market, which it is, is more important than participation by a wide cross-section of retailers. We will look rather hypocritical if we later endorse strict restrictions on who operates where and why in the cross-media ownerships laws.
I suppose it is who has the greater push in Canberra, and it is not the mum and dad operations when up against the might of motor oil companies. I understand that the conservative parties have a reason to say they promote the objectives of big business. I look forward to observing how this chamber will deal with the opportunity that has arisen to protect small family operations from the larger major oil companies. Maybe I am disconnected from this issue in Canberra, but that hardly explains those who have come to my office and lobbied absolutely vehemently to have these protections in place. These people are from organisations such as the NRMA, the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, the Motor Trades Association of Queensland, the Motor Trades Association of Australia, the Service Station Association, Renewable Fuels of Australia and myriad smaller organisations and operators.
So I am of the strong belief that I am representing key small business organisations that The Nationals in Queensland said we would represent at the election when we gave the promise that we would stand against the overcentralisation of the retail market. What this regulation does is bring about the oligopoly of retailing, which will be held by four oil majors in conjunction with Coles and Woolworths. They have an obligation to extract the best return for their shareholders, so relying on their good will in respect of the rights of independent, branded and franchisee sites to participate in the fuel market is against both their corporate responsibility and their optimum specific return on capital.
If the major oil companies get total control of a retail market, they have a corporate responsibility to exploit it so as to get the best return for their shareholders. If I were a shareholder of theirs I would expect absolutely nothing less. This was understood clearly in 1980 when the coalition government brought about the sites and franchise acts. It has always been the intent of the conservative side of politics to protect small business operators. The issue remains the same, but we are now changing. We are moving that which the coalition government set out to protect in 1980.
Since the repeal of this legislation allows the major oil companies the keys to complete control of the retail sector—and experience elsewhere, such as in the UK, says that this is what they will achieve—then naturally enough you are giving the oil majors the chance to put their margins up and maintain them there in the long term. In the current fuel price environment, I do not know whether that is what the public wants or will find palatable, that we are passing a piece of legislation that will give complete vertical integration and market control to the major oil companies, which are already exploiting their position in the market in such a way to extract a return that has brought about an up to 300 per cent increase in their parent company’s share price in the United States. I refer there to Chevron.
The 130,000 retail outlets represented by the Motor Trades Association of Australia have unanimously supported my position. That accounts for $113 billion in turnover annually. Ninety-five per cent of these outlets have less than five employees, which means they are the quintessential small business, non-unionised workforce and, as displayed by this regulatory change, they are not represented or supported by the major oil companies and those who have the major oil companies’ ear. A couple of nights ago on The 7.30 report was a Mr Jim Lamb, who represents only a handful of stations. He is the sole independent I have found who is on the side of this regulation change. I understand what he and all independents fear about the security of price and supply. They live by what the major oil companies supply them. Unfortunately, you do not have to worry about supply if you do not have a site to operate from.
Now, with your supplier also becoming your major competitor in the retail market, all I can say to you is good luck in the long term, especially if your site comes up for renewal. You have to remember that a lot of these sites are on three- by three- by three-year leases. At the end of these three-year leases, the oil companies have the ability to walk in and say: ‘We’re not renewing any more. It is not an obligation. The sites and franchise acts are finished. We’re going to take it over.’ They will know where the volume of fuel is going and they will know the margin they can extract. It will be an absolute fait accompli that they will go through their business plan to find those sites that are currently under lease. People say that there is a greater strengthening in the lease conditions, but there is only a strengthening in the lease conditions if they choose to renew your lease. If they do not renew your lease, they kick you out.
There is nothing in this that guarantees the price for those independents left in the market—which they are buying out—to allow them to compete with the major retailers of fuel. The major retailers of fuel will become the major oil companies. The major oil companies are not going to be selling a product to their competitors at a price that makes them uncompetitive. They will have a competitive advantage because they will be both the supplier and the retailer. There is nothing in this oil code that talks about any protections—no ombudsman or ACCC oversight—in how those oil companies will deal with their independent, branded and franchisee operations. Some will pose the position that the ACCC has an oversight; it has no oversight. The ACCC cannot go on a fishing expedition to find problems, nor can they demand information and, even if they do, they cannot come to a binding resolution.
The restriction on the number of sites that the major oil companies could operate from made it essential in the past to supply independent, branded and franchisee sites. Without these sites, their refineries could not operate at optimum capacity. Now, in the long term—not tomorrow, but in the long term—the major oil companies will be able to meet their optimum capacity without utilising independent, branded or franchisee sites. There is no intention to build new refineries, so there is a limited amount of fuel for the market, and you cannot supply fuel you do not have.
So when the major oil companies tell you that they will be supplying all their sites first and that if there is something left over you can have it at their price—their price they decide to sell to you, which will not be the price they are supplying themselves—they will be telling you the truth. There is nothing in this legislation that can stop that from happening. You may have an instance where they say, ‘There is no fuel for you.’ They will say, ‘If we had it, we would give it to you, but it’s all gone.’ They will be telling you the truth. You as an independent, branded or franchisee site will have a major supply crisis because you will not be able to obtain your fuel at a price that will keep you in the market.
Furthermore, certain independent branded or franchisee sites will be an inconvenience, so they will not attain the discounts on terminal gate price that the company owned sites can avail themselves of. This legislation talks about terminal gate price. Terminal gate price is very handy, but very few fuel stations buy it at terminal gate price. Everybody receives it at a discount and a variant amount of discount to the terminal gate price, and the discounts are not disclosed. If I want to put you out of business, I will sell it to you at the terminal gate price, because you will probably be the only one in the market buying it at that price. It will become inconvenient to supply these sites out in regional areas and, when they do supply them, they will supply them at a price that will mean it is unviable for them to stay open. They will not get the travelling trade. When they do not get the travelling trade and therefore close down, that becomes yet another service that is removed from small regional towns to add to the banks, railway stations and post offices that have been removed. In these small regional towns, you will get nothing for your house or very little for your house, so you cannot move unless you want to walk away with little or nothing. Now you have a real impediment on your freedom of movement if you choose to stay or have to stay, as opposed to the impediments that are currently on you in leaving.
What I am saying would be grandstanding and emotive if it was not for the findings of the All-Party Parliamentary Small Shops Group inquiry report entitled High street Britain: 2015 that was carried out in the UK. I would like to comment on some of this inquiry’s findings. Amongst its many observations on the disappearance of the traditional local small shops and independent convenience stores, it also reported on the use of discounts by petrol forecourts and argued that this could be considered to be predatory pricing. The report stated that it believed that the big four, which would be the same big four as here, sell fuel below cost until local competition can no longer sustain the loss margins. This is followed by a sharp rise in price at the multiple retailers’ forecourts. ‘Forecourt’ is their word for petrol station.
This is exactly what I predict will happen in Australia. We are talking about the same companies, the same environment. In fact, it will be exacerbated in Australia because of the distances. The Association of Convenience Stores contends that even superficial research into local markets illustrates that price flexing by a major retailer in towns in close proximity to each other exists. Between 1991 and 2004 in the UK, 8,380 forecourts, or service stations, have gone out of business, with hypermarkets—that is, major supermarkets—now selling over 30 per cent of the fuel sold in the UK despite only operating from 10 per cent of the sites. In Australia, the major supermarkets sell well in excess of 50 per cent of the fuel, so our position is worse than that of the UK’s before we exacerbate it further by this regulatory change.
The report stated that the cessation of trading by small retailers close to national multiples seems inevitable. An example of this is found in Cupar, a town in Scotland which, prior to Tesco—a large multiple retailer—had four petrol stations. Now they only have one. We already have issues in regional areas of Queensland relating to the closure or intended closure of fuel retailing outlets. That is a huge inconvenience for the people who live in those towns, because it is a fundamental of life. How are you going to fuel your car when there is not a petrol station in your town? To people who say that is not going to happen, where is the protection in this regulation? There is no protection. There is no intention to give protection, so we have to accept the consequences that are going to flow from this. Every time you go to a regional area and the people say: ‘We had a town. We had a fuel station. Now we just have houses and a pub,’—the pub will probably survive—that is a consequence of this change that we are about to bring about. It is a consequence for which the conservative government in 1980 realised they had to put in a protection mechanism against.
The evidence in this report is a recent and concrete example of the impact of small business operators being pushed out of the market, which in turn affects competition and, as a result in the case of the UK, led to a rise in the price of fuel for consumers. Under the reform processes that are being put forward, starting with the changes in these regulations, Australia runs the very real risk of mirroring what has occurred in the UK. The short-term benefits shall last till independents disappear. Then the long-term malady will be incurable. You will not be able to get independents back into the market once they are gone, nor will there be the political will to do so. The capacity that we need now to get biorenewable fuels into the market will be gone. Why would the major oil companies want to sell a competing product in ethanol? What would possess them to sell their competing product? What would possess them to supply their competition with fuel?
Whether you are considering the future of small businesses—and I made a clear statement in Queensland that I was going to Canberra to represent the interests of small businesses—or the future of services in small towns, I ask this chamber to strongly consider the implications of this regulation in the way you are about to vote. The consequences of this will be that we will have exacerbated the problems that are currently being experienced in regional areas and, in the long term, we will be leading to an oligopoly in how fuel is marketed. If we had changes to section 46 or something so that we could go out there with some form of protection, we could do it, but we do not have those section 46 changes. We have no mechanism for protecting them, so I will not support this regulatory change.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL MARKETING SITES AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2006 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,15,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-06-15,"—With great respect to my friend and coalition colleague Senator Joyce, I regret to inform him that the government opposes his motion for disallowance, while respecting his right to move this motion—one of the great things about our side of politics. On 30 March this year, the minister whom I represent in this chamber, Ian Macfarlane, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, announced in his second reading of the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 that he would be amending the Petroleum Marketing Retail Sites Regulations 1981, consistent with the government’s downstream petroleum reform package. That package provides a uniform regulatory environment for industry participants through the introduction of the oil code, which has been worked up in full consultation with the industry, under section 51AE of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and, at the same time, repealing the old Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act and the sites act. I remind the Senate that this package has been government policy for quite some years. In fact, I spent three years as industry minister seeking to have this package adopted—regrettably, to no avail—and it is well beyond time that it was implemented. I think it is an essential reform.
The aim of the oil code that we have developed is to provide industry participants with a national approach to terminal gate pricing, fairer contractual arrangements and access to a downstream petroleum dispute resolution scheme. Development of the code, as I said before, does follow very extensive consultation with industry, industry associations, consumer groups, state and territory agencies and relevant Australian government agencies.
Senator Joyce’s disallowance motion seeks remove the oil majors as prescribed corporations and suspends the oil majors reporting and compliance obligations under the existing sites act. The amendment to the regulations prevents market uncertainty and breaches of the act, while the repeal bill is under the consideration of the parliament—in other words, this amendment is an essential mechanism to ensuring proper consideration of this repeal bill without undue intervention, interference or uncertainty for the industry itself. Under the existing legislative framework, the oil majors may temporarily operate a retail site for a period of up to eight months while they determine the best business structure for the site. Under the existing sites act, to temporarily operate a site the franchisor must have a good faith intention to either dispose of or franchise a site at the end of this temporary eight-month operation period.
The introduction of the government’s bill to repeal the sites and franchise acts has the effect of reducing the ability of the oil majors to meet that intent in good faith. It actually prevents them from making use of these temporary operation provisions because they could not, knowing our repeal bill is there, meet that good faith requirement. Had the government not made an amendment to these regulations, for which there is a motion seeking its disallowance, the oil majors would have had to re-enter nine-year franchise agreements, close retail sites or enter into arrangements with third parties, even if a different business structure would clearly be more appropriate and knowing, of course, the government’s intent to repeal the whole structure.
We are committed, as I said before, to repealing the sites and franchise acts and to the introduction of the oil code, and I think we have gone now to at least three elections with that as our clear policy. The regulation that has been promulgated is entirely consistent with this aim of the government to introduce a more effective regulatory regime, to allow all industry participants to respond and adapt to changes in the retail petroleum marketing industry without distorting or reducing levels of competition. It is our strong view that the proposed reforms to Australia’s petrol retail sector will increase competition, not reduce it. I remind senators that many in this place and in the other place have publicly supported the repeal of the sites act, including, I understand, the Leader of the Opposition.
The sites and franchise acts are consistently acknowledged by industry and, indeed, the opposition as being outdated and redundant. Under the current restrictive regime, approximately one-third of the nation’s service stations have closed. The ample supply of petrol that fuelled the rise of the independents no longer exists. Greater demand for fuel in the Asian region and cleaner Australian fuel standards have had the effect of changing the market quite significantly. Shell and Caltex have divested much of their direct retailing to Coles and Woolworths. The reality under the existing arrangements with the sites and franchise acts is that Coles and Woolworths now have around 50 per cent of the petrol retail market. Really the sites act has effectively been rendered redundant. The government, quite clearly and simply, want to achieve a level playing field for all petrol retailers to ensure that we do have a competitive market. We are very committed to having a competitive market. That is what we believe our package is all about given the current realities of petrol retailing.
In terms of the independent sector, the government’s proposed oil code, which, as I say, has taken an enormous amount of time, effort and consultation to develop, will strengthen the position of independent retailers through better representation and access to a fairer dispute resolution process. It will be backed by changes to the Trade Practices Act. Maximum competition remains the greatest guarantee of the lowest priced petrol and that means ensuring that oil companies and the independent sector can compete on level terms with the supermarket chains.
In relation to Senator Joyce’s proposed disallowance, existing franchisees are unaffected by the change coming about as a result of the regulation that we have introduced. Current franchise agreements continue to be covered by the franchise act, including all terms, conditions and renewals. If franchise agreements have ended and the parties negotiate and enter into new franchise agreements, they will need to comply with the existing franchise act. For other market participants such as commission agents, their agreements will be covered by the oil code once it comes into effect, if indeed this parliament so deems, including preservation of tenure for agreements entered into before the commencement of the oil code. Disallowance of this regulation in our view will serve no purpose. It will not result in any changes to the government’s downstream petroleum reform package, which we remain committed to, and it will only cause further uncertainty for the oil majors and their franchisees, who are small businesses in many cases. It will reimpose compliance costs on the oil majors that may well end up being reflected at the pump.
Should the disallowance motion itself be successful, it is our estimation that BP will be the major most immediately affected. Rather than signing nine-year franchise agreements, which may prove to be an uneconomic business model, it may well have to choose to close sites or enter into third-party arrangements outside of the constraints of the sites act. BP does want to run more of the sites it already owns, yet it is restricted by the current law to operating just 87 petrol stations around Australia. It is our view that that restriction does not augur well for BP’s clear, articulated and welcome strategy to offer consumers greater access to biofuels. While we understand and respect Senator Joyce’s very strong commitment to small business in this country, we do not think disallowance will do anything to assist small business operators in this industry. The government’s position on balance is very much, regrettably, in the circumstances, that we oppose the disallowance motion moved by Senator Joyce.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL MARKETING SITES AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2006 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,15,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-15,"—Senator Joyce has moved a motion to disallow the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1) made under the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980. This motion is directly related to the government’s proposal to repeal the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 and Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 and replace them with a mandatory oil code under the Trade Practices Act.
In our view, there are two issues before us. One is the question of whether these regulations effectively put the cart before the horse, in that they have been put into law prior to the passage of the bills which would make them valid and reasonable. The second issue is whether this is an incomplete package, in that it is not accompanied by appropriate underpinnings, an appropriate safety net and appropriate protections for small businesses, who will be more disadvantaged than they are at present.
In that regard, I note the remarks made by the opposition revenue spokesperson, Mr Fitzgibbon, as reported by AAP on Wednesday, 14 June 2006:
The Regulation has the effect of repealing the Sites Act before the Parliament considers the merits of the repeal bill. This is an unacceptable abuse of power and an attack on parliamentary democracy.
The government is proposing to repeal the sites act, thereby allowing the oil majors to directly operate all retail sites owned by them. As an interim measure, the government has sought to remove the oil majors from the operation of the sites act through these regulations. By seeking to relieve the oil majors of their obligations under the sites act, the government is pre-empting the parliamentary debate regarding whether or not the sites act itself should be repealed and whether the repeal proposal is complete and adequate in its form. These regulations should therefore be opposed as they are contrary to the parliamentary intention behind the existing law and they represent a blatant attempt to pre-empt parliament’s decision as to whether or not to repeal the sites act, as proposed by the government.
The reason the government are taking this route is that it is an extraparliamentary way of getting around the parliament in a circumstance where they fear that those coalition members who feel strongly about small business might torpedo their proposed legislation. That is not the way to conduct a parliamentary democracy. Coalition members do not seek to oppose or irritate the government on a whim; they seek to do so because they recognise that they have a concern with respect to their constituency. It is a valid concern, and they have the courage therefore to address that concern. Whether I or anyone else happen to agree fully or not with the particular issue at hand, it is a mistake for Liberal and National members, both frontbench and backbench, to allow this kind of practice or procedure to be accepted or entrenched. The proper way for these things to be resolved is, firstly, for them to be raised within the party room of the parties concerned and, secondly, for them to be brought before the parliament for final resolution.
I and many others object to this regulation coming up prior to the enabling legislation, because it is a profound, regrettable, undemocratic and nasty abuse of process. It is nasty because it will not recognise the validity of opinions held very strongly by literally thousands of small business owners and employees and by those parliamentarians who seek to represent them. My party and I strongly object to this on the basis of an abuse of process.
The second issue is whether there is sufficient underpinning for small business in this package. In his remarks, Senator Joyce specifically referred to the section 46 amendments, which small business at large, many academics, many professionals, many businesspeople and many parliamentarians have been urging on the Treasurer and the government. There is a remarkable thing about this. The Senate Economics References Committee in March 2004 conducted an inquiry into the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business. That inquiry was chaired by a senator who is present in the chamber today, Senator Stephens, who I thought did a very creditable job in conducting that inquiry and was very ably assisted by all the members of the committee, of whom I numbered one.
That committee produced 17 recommendations. Although there was a minority report which dissented from a number of the recommendations in the majority report—and which was principally authored by someone who deserves to be regarded as expert in this field; namely, Senator George Brandis from Queensland—the Liberal Party members of that committee supported a series of recommendations in the majority report. The government, subsequently, accepted those recommendations in the Australian government response to the Senate inquiry.
That response indicates that the government accept that there are a number of areas that deserve to be amended to assist small business in competing more fairly and more ably in the marketplace. So the recommendations were considered by a Senate committee, a number of them were accepted by the government experts on that committee and they were then accepted by the government. That was two years ago, and they are still not part of a package available to the parliament to underpin a change in law which manifestly will enable big business operators to compete in this industry in a more effective manner but does not provide any assistance at all for small competitors, small individuals and small business people who are faced with this changed environment.
It should be noted—and the minister mentioned it briefly—that major corporations like BP, Caltex and others support those proposed bills and they oppose this disallowance motion. They have a legitimate case to make. In contrast, the Motor Trades Association and small business owners oppose the bill in its current form and support the disallowance motion. So you have a clear cleavage in the market. My question to the government is: instead of saying you will fall only on the side of the one party, which is all you are doing, and instead of being the big business lapdogs that you appear to be, why don’t you match your proposals with those which you have already accepted in the government response and provide some leverage for small business in these circumstances? That is the problem with what you are putting forward. Both the reality and the perception are that this is biased, one-sided and just not fair.
The central issue is not whether the franchise and sites acts should remain but, rather, that the post-repeal environment allows sufficient opportunity for small business and independent fuel operators to remain competitive and not be driven out by the oil majors and the supermarket chains. That requires: firstly, the strongest possible oil code, to ensure that small business and independent fuel operators have continued access to suppliers of fuel products—at prices and under terms and conditions that enable them to compete in the market; and, secondly, that an effective Trade Practices Act ensures that small business and independent fuel operators cannot be driven out by anticompetitive practices by the oil majors or supermarkets.
It is not my view that it is anticompetitive that those practices are possible. It is the view of a Senate committee which has majority support for all of its recommendations and unanimous support for a number of its recommendations, which the government have accepted. Those potential anticompetitive practices should be addressed. For an effective Trade Practices Act, one of the most important things a government could do would be to implement the recommendations from the Senate inquiry. In my view it would be preferable to implement all 17 of them, but at least they should implement those that they have accepted. Two years later, they will not do it. Why won’t they do it? It is not because they do not agree with them, but because big business pressure is telling them not to. That is just not acceptable for a government which claim to govern for all Australians and for all businesses.
Those recommendations would assist the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in more effectively dealing with potential abuses of market power and unconscionable conduct by the oil majors and the supermarkets. Under the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980, oil majors have been restricted to operating only five per cent of service stations. The original policy objective was to prevent the vertical integration of oil companies all the way through to the final consumer. By restricting the number of service stations that the oil majors operated, smaller business operators were to be given the opportunity to participate in the retail fuel market. That would have led to greater price competition to the benefit of consumers as the oil majors could not—because of section 48 of the Trade Practices Act, which prohibits resale price maintenance—directly set the retail price at sites operated by these small businesses.
The Democrats recognise that the market has moved on. We understand that. We understand that it is necessary to reform and change the legislation governing this industry. So we are in a situation which, as I read it, is exactly that of the Labor Party opposition: if the government showed some good faith and moved towards recommendations and the simultaneous implementation of changes to the Trade Practices Act, we could consider this legislation favourably. The ALP minority report of the recent Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 stated:
Ideally, the Government should commit to immediately legislating the following recommendations of the Senate Committee in relation to s46 of the TPA:
I note that Mr Fitzgibbon listed those recommendations in his earlier remarks.
The issue is that you cannot have one set of changes which are not simultaneous, contiguous or coincident with changes which would assist small business in general through general competitions law. For decades, the Australian Democrats have argued that a strong small business sector is essential to the economic and social health of Australia—that small business has a value of itself. That is a very important statement. We do not see small business just as an economic mechanism. We see it as a fundamental part of our social fabric. That needs to be understood by the coalition. You cannot regard these matters purely in economic rationalist terms or purely under economic criteria. You have to recognise that there is a value to this country in keeping small business in business.
I do not want to see a service station market reduced further with respect to its independent participation than it is at present. If my memory is correct, we have come down from something like 30-odd thousand independent service station operators to around 8,000 now. That is a market rationalisation of huge scope and nature. In many respects, it is inevitable. It is the nature of the modern world that there is an increasing concentration of market power in fewer hands. It is the nature of our changing world environment. But it should not mean the total destruction of the small competitors, and, if we can do anything to retain small business as a viable, effective and meaningful contributor to our economic and social health, we should do so. That is why I consistently say that small business has a value of itself.
Our views on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill are necessarily coloured by that perspective. We, the Democrats, strongly support the workings of a free and fair market, as evidenced by our work on corporations, trade practices and tax law. But we have long been concerned that a weak Trade Practices Act does not deliver sufficiently fair competition for small business with sufficiently adequate protections from predatory pricing and the abuse of market power. We need to understand in this country that we have a weak Trade Practices Act compared with international trends in legislation.
In that respect we set great store on recommendations in the majority report, which we support, of the Senate Economics References Committee of March 2004, titled The effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business. If those 17 recommendations were implemented—that cover the misuse of market power, unconscionable conduct, collective bargaining, creeping acquisitions, divestiture and the power and resources of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission—then free and fair competition would be greatly strengthened in Australia. Further, there would then be less of a case—and that is an important point—for industry specific regulation in any industry if the general law was so strengthened.
The Democrats opposed the earlier version of this bill, arguing that stronger trade practices powers were first required to address the abuse of market power and to introduce the threat of divestiture on over-mighty corporations. We said then that Trade Practices Act reform was a precondition to considering whether this industry regulation could be lifted or modified. That is still our position, but at least offer us those things that the government have said they would accept with respect to changes to the Trade Practices Act following that Senate committee in 2004—two years ago. This is a government that can produce terror legislation in 24 hours but takes over two years to even drag themselves into the parliament to discuss Trade Practices Act reform. What is the matter with them? Does it not matter to them that the small business community feels strongly about this?
I have argued again and again—and I will repeat some of my remarks that I have made before—that the thing that is missing in our laws is the flip side of the merger and acquisition power. Workplace, tax, corporations, finance and trade practices laws are the main laws affecting the functioning of the market and the regulation of the behaviour of corporations. In matters of competition and consumer interest, all over the world the law restrains great commercial power because of the known abuse of power that often accompanies it. When it comes to the size and behaviour of corporations, the Trade Practices Act 1974 is Australia’s prime protective device, yet the act is weaker and more deficient in its protective capabilities in comparison with legislation in countries like the United Kingdom and the United States.
I have said before that big business roars approval at the dynamism of the American market but fiercely condemns a major contributor to that dynamism—and that is the effects of antitrust or divestiture laws. We need those regulatory tools in Australia. Balanced divestiture laws are the corollary of balanced merger laws. We do not have effective divestiture laws, and it is to me a strange and illogical policy that can prevent mergers to maintain effective competition but cannot require divesture also to maintain effective competition.
As in Australia, many markets are experiencing oligopolisation, which is a concentration of power in the hands of a small number of competitors, this is partly a natural result of economies of scale—the big get bigger and as they do they develop the ability to operate more cheaply and efficiently. Over time the smaller players are forced out of the market. That is the way of the market and it is valuable while it promotes efficiency, innovation and competition—but only up to a point. Eventually the destruction of competitors results in the destruction of competition, or the predatory intimidation of competitors reduces effective competition. Where that has occurred or will occur the state must intervene to save the market from eating itself.
By its very nature, power to order divestiture should be regarded as largely a reserve power as international precedents indicate it would be seldom employed. It should be used rarely and used responsibly. Its great virtue is as a cautionary power making oligopolies careful of abusing their market power. It will be used only when necessary to maintain or restore competition.
I am repeating remarks I have made again and again simply because they are remarks that need to be made again and again—until the government of the day eventually gets the point that its Trade Practices Act must be strengthened so that the economic health of Australia is assured and recognised in an appropriate manner. The Australian Democrats do accept that there is a need to update the regulation governing the petroleum sector but we are not content that the package of measures that accompanies it has yet been put before the parliament.
 (Senator Watson)—As there is only slightly over a minute to go I will not call the next speaker, Senator Stephens, at her request so she can have a complete speech after the Senate resumes. The Senate will pause for two minutes. Thank you.

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2006-06-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked today relating to skills shortages and to detention practices.
Today we heard a lot more about the migration bill. I want to address the article by Greg Sheridan in the Australian today, which is titled ‘PM bungles response to Papuan asylum-seekers’. I most certainly agree with that headline but do not agree with too much else that follows. He correctly points out that the Labor Party instituted mandatory detention in remote camps for all asylum seekers, and the Labor Party, indeed, continues to support mandatory detention.
Mr Sheridan then goes on to support the Pacific solution by the Howard government and said that the Pacific solution did stop the flow of boats. What he does do, quite erroneously, is equate the Pacific solution with mandatory detention, when in fact sending the asylum seekers offshore was an expensive, difficult and, ultimately, unsuccessful way to deal with asylum seekers. What was successful—and the minister referred to it today in relation to Mr Beazley’s comments—was talking to governments in the region, such as the Indonesian government, and cooperating to get illegal immigration and people-smuggling stopped. That is what stopped the boats coming to Australia. That is what was responsible for stopping those boats and for stopping illegal immigration.
Mr Sheridan does not distinguish the fact that those initial asylum seekers had stopped in a first country and were then coming to Australia as a second country of asylum. He goes on to talk about the West Papuans as though Australia is not the first country of asylum. He talks about setting up a path of easy illegal immigration for those Papuans and refuses to recognise that, if they were illegal, they would have been returned. In fact, Australia found that 42 of them were genuine refugees. They remained in Australia because they came to Australia as their first country of refuge. If there is persecution in any country and people make it to Australia, why would we not consider taking them, instead of sending them offshore to an island and insisting they be sent to a third country?
Here again Mr Sheridan’s comments are not accurate. He is saying that if they are found to be refugees they will be taken into Australia or anywhere else. But the minister has made it quite clear that she will be seeking a third country, and the likelihood is that those genuine refugees will be held on Nauru indefinitely while there is a vain search for a third country. Why indeed, seeing Australia as the wealthy nation that it is, seeking immigrants, would any third country take West Papuan refugees instead of letting Australia take refugees? For Mr Sheridan to go on and talk about the Labor Party being xenophobic on this issue is quite wrong. As the minister rightly pointed out, Mr Beazley talked about cooperating with the Indonesian government to deal with illegal asylum seekers. Now he is saying that in this case we should not dance to the tune of the Indonesian government. I do not see why that is a xenophobic response. It is a recognition of the true difference between the original asylum seekers and refugees who are coming in from West Papua.
The government is trying, as Mr Sheridan suggests, to say that this is part of its normal border protection policy. It is not an extension of the border protection policy; it is excising our whole country in order to keep out possibly genuine refugees who have managed to make it to Australia. Mr Sheridan talks about walking over the border to Papua New Guinea; that is just a nonsense, and he should know that. (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2006-06-15,"—I also rise to speak on the answers provided by Minister Vanstone. Firstly I would like to clarify a couple of points for the honourable senator on the other side of the chamber. People arriving by sea in Australia under this proposed legislation will still be eligible to make visa applications, but they will be processed offshore. The intention of this legislation is very clear. People found to be refugees will remain offshore while their resettlement is arranged. Under the existing provisions, the minister has a non-compellable power to allow a person to make a valid visa application in Australia. Senator Hurley has talked extensively about an article by Mr Greg Sheridan; I am not aware that he is a member of this government, but he is certainly welcome to put forward his beliefs about this law. We will continue to meet our international obligations under the refugee policy, and any claims to refugee status will be properly assessed at an offshore location, as I have mentioned, in accordance with the refugees convention.
The minister touched on the hypotheticals, and a number of them were raised in the question. If third party countries are needed to be contacted we will deal with that when the situation arises. I think this is an extension of the most successful border protection policy that has ever been introduced in Australia. The Australian government has taken several opportunities to brief the United Nations Human Rights Commission on the operation of the proposed new arrangements and will continue to do this as the proposals are further articulated.
The minister talked extensively about our relationship to the international community, and as Australians we have a right to determine on our terms who is an eligible refugee in this country and who is authorised to stay here. The appropriate solution clarifies the situation so that people do not take unnecessary risks attempting to reach the mainland of Australia with a view to getting treatment that is perceived to be more favourable. This is a simple, consistent exercise that the government is proposing in the interests of a fair and balanced process, ensuring that all refugee applications and asylum seekers are treated equally, irrespective of where they land. It is consistent with what is good for our nation and our region, and it fosters international goodwill amongst our very near neighbours. In concluding, I would like to say that the people who arrive here in Australia and seek asylum will be processed in accordance with our international commitments. Those people who are found to be genuine asylum seekers will be processed according to our laws.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Migration</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,19,1
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2006-06-15,"—I rise this afternoon to take note of answers given by Senator Vanstone today in question time. What emerged today in question time, from the questions that were asked by my colleagues, was that the Prime Minister and Minister Vanstone seem to have quite different views about the cause of this legislation that is before us, namely the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. Yesterday Mr Howard was asked in question time by my colleague Mr Burke why it is that he will not listen to Australian parliamentarians as much as he listened to Indonesian parliamentarians when he initiated this bill. Mr Howard’s response was:
These policies have nothing to do with listening to Indonesian politicians.
It seems that Senator Vanstone has a different view on this. She was asked last night by Kerry O’Brien on The 7.30 Report:
... it’s also absolutely true and irrefutable that this bill has only been written as a result of Indonesia’s outcry at Australia’s acceptance of 42 Papuan refugees. Is that not the fact?
To that the minister, Senator Vanstone, replied:
Well, I think, as you say, it is indisputable we’ve taken into account the concerns of Indonesia.
So there seems to be a difference of opinion going on here between the Prime Minister and Minister Vanstone as to the influence of the Indonesian government in proposing that the law that we have before us be introduced into this parliament. I think it is becoming more and more evident that it was in fact only as a consequence of the Indonesian protests that this law was introduced into the parliament. During an interview yesterday, in which he talked about what kind of signal this sends out into the international community, my colleague Mr Burke said:
The only signal it will send to the region is kick up a big enough fuss and you’ll be able to get Australia to change its laws and that simply results in new claims, new levels of ambit. What we’ve sent as a message to Indonesia is, if you object to our laws, we won’t treat you the way you treat us. We won’t simply explain our laws and say, well, we have our own legal system. Instead, if you complain enough, withdraw your ambassador, complain, we’ll actually offer to change our domestic legislation to try to win your favour back. Now, the message that that sends to the region is a really disturbing one and I don’t know of any other country around that’s willing to change its domestic law to try to fix what essentially is a foreign policy issue.
I think that really captures exactly what has happened here. What kind of signal are we sending out to the international community? It is: if you do not like the way our law is operating on your nationals, all you need to do is come to us and speak to the Prime Minister, the minister for immigration or the Attorney-General and we will do whatever it is that you would like us to do to change our laws in order to accommodate your position and that of your nationals.
What this approach completely seems to ignore is that, when you are sending that kind of signal, it is not just about sending a signal to Indonesia to let them know that we are their friends and are prepared to be friendly neighbours to them. This law is not just about a signal; it is going to actually affect real people and real lives. People are going to be hurt by this law. It might not be a huge number of people but that, nevertheless, will be no consolation to those individuals. People are going to have their lives wrecked by this law. They are going to pay the price with their sanity. We have seen on many occasions just how poor mental health provisions can be within detention centres, particularly when associated with long-term detention and particularly when it involves children. Of course it is important that we have good relations with Indonesia, but diplomatic solutions should not be forged by changing Australian law, particularly when it results in a contravention of our international refugee obligations as this law does and will.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Migration</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,19,1
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-06-15,"—I rise to take note of answers given to questions asked of Senator Vanstone today. I note that those opposite seem very concerned about the offshore processing strategy carried out at Nauru. I think that I might be able to enlighten them on what is really happening.
Why is it important that we have the offshore processing strategy? I will describe what happens. The two offshore processing centre sites on Nauru have been critical to the success of our offshore processing. They have served Australia well. To ensure efficient and cost-effective operation of offshore processing, the offshore processing centres will be consolidated on Nauru through closing one site and maintaining the other in a state of high readiness. This reflects recent changes to processing arrangements for unauthorised boat arrivals.
Maintaining the Nauru offshore processing centre is an important part of the government’s approach to the management of unauthorised boat arrivals. The people who will benefit from this are the people of Australia, as it represents a significant saving in revenue. The initiative and the savings measure under this government will return to government some $33.8 million over four years. In what we have done in the past, Australia has maintained two offshore processing centre sites on Nauru and another on Manus Island. Manus will be retained as a contingency facility in case it is needed. The savings are ongoing and will be reviewed in the 2007-08 budget.
On the number of people that can be handled at Nauru, the capacity of the new facility will be reduced from the previous 1,500 to around 500, which will make it far more comfortable for people who happen to be there. Nauru will have a capacity of up to 100 people immediately, with a further 400 places to be available very soon. Unauthorised arrivals to Nauru are accommodated under Nauruan visa arrangements. Those visa arrangements have allowed open-centre arrangements. Informal advice from the government of Nauru is that similar conditions would apply to women, children and family units in any future case load transferred to Nauru for processing but that single males would be subject to closed-centre arrangements. Women and children will be able to move freely at any time during the day.
The reason that Nauru is preferable to Christmas Island is that the facility on Christmas Island has not been completed and is not expected to be commissioned until mid-2007 at the earliest. The government will consider how it uses offshore processing centres, including Christmas Island, in light of circumstances that exist at that time. It is important to remember that Australia received nearly 9,000 unauthorised sea arrivals in the two-year period to June 2001, so it is important to maintain contingency capacity. The reason that Nauru is preferable to Manus is that the memorandum of understanding provides for a total of 2,500 places in Manus or Nauru until June 2007. The government has not ruled out sending unauthorised arrivals to either Manus or Nauru. Manus has been mothballed since 2003. Nauru was more recently in operation, and its continued operation is welcomed by the Nauruan government.
I think it is very important that I mention to those opposite the mental health team which is going to visit Nauru. Senator Amanda Vanstone announced on 13 June that an independent group of mental health experts would visit Nauru to assess the two remaining residents of the offshore processing centre. She said that she is very concerned about the mental health of the two Iraqi men on Nauru following a recent clinical assessment done by International Organisation for Migration medical staff. She has asked the department to organise a mental health assessment team from Australia to go to Nauru to interview and assess these men and provide a report on the options to manage their mental health while they remain there. As they are subject to adverse security assessments, the Australian government will not be bringing them to Australia. (Time expired)

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2006-06-15,"—I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Vanstone during question time today in relation to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report on provisions of the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006, tabled on Monday, and statements made by the minister.
The government does not want to proceed with the recommendations of this report. It wants the bill to go through this parliament without adopting the recommendations. That is clear. We have a government-dominated Senate inquiry which considered the government’s proposal to process all unauthorised boat arrivals at offshore detention centres. The government-dominated committee received 136 submissions and held a public hearing before preparing its report. The recommendations contained in the report received unanimous support from the committee members. But now the government does not want to adopt the committee’s No. 1 recommendation, which is:
In light of the limited information available to the committee, the committee recommends that the Bill should not proceed.
This is the simple and clear recommendation of the committee: that the bill should not proceed. Why does the government not want to adopt the recommendation? One cannot help but wonder about the discussion that may have taken place last night, or perhaps even this morning, between Prime Minister Howard and his Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Vanstone. Was it a discussion about why, according to the government, this bill must proceed, how much significance should be given to appeasing Indonesia and how much the people of Australia should be told about its elected government appeasing the Indonesian government?
It seems that the Prime Minister and his immigration minister have different points of view, because yesterday in the House of Representatives Prime Minister Howard was asked a question by Labor’s immigration spokesperson, Tony Burke, about the government’s intention not to adopt the committee’s recommendation. The question read, in part:
... why won’t the Prime Minister listen to Australian parliamentarians as much as he has listened to Indonesian parliamentarians?
The Prime Minister’s response was:
These policies have nothing to do with listening to Indonesian politicians.
That is not the view of everyone in the government, and some of them are even prepared to go on the record. Last night, only hours after the Prime Minister’s statement to parliament during question time, his Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Vanstone, appeared on the ABC’s The 7.30 Report, saying:
Well, I think, as you say, it is indisputable we’ve taken into account the concerns of Indonesia.
Here is a further quote from Minister Vanstone:
Yes, we are taking into account what the Indonesians want because they’re very helpful to us on border protection.
Well, that is a revelation. The government is changing our laws because Indonesia wants it to. The immigration minister has admitted that Indonesia has influenced this legislation. This morning in an interview on AM, this question was put to the minister:
... Australia is listening to Indonesia, but does the release of Abu Bakar Bashir indicate that Indonesia wouldn’t listen to Australia in this way?
The minister’s response was that we have to follow our law, they have to follow their law. That is the point, Minister. The Howard government, through this bill, is making changes to our law. You even reiterated this in the interview when you said it is a change to our policy. There was no demand for these changes from Australia. But on 15 May, one month before the tabling of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s report, the Indonesian foreign minister stated that he had been assured by Australia that Australia would not accept individuals processed on Nauru even if determined to be refugees and that this ‘solved the issue’. Following the meeting, Minister Downer said Indonesia was ‘pleased with the Australian government’s changes to processing of asylum seekers who arrive by sea’. Under the proposed changes made by this bill, refugees could be held indefinitely. (Time expired)

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2006-06-15,"—I seek leave to make a clarification in relation to an answer I gave in question time today.
Leave granted.
—In question time today I indicated to an opposition senator that the limitation for the minimum salary level for 457 visas being based on a 38-hour week had gone to the Governor-General yesterday. I gave that advice on the basis of an email that was received in my office at 1.26 pm today. It is every minister’s dream—or I should say ‘nightmare’—to get subsequent advice during question time! Anyway, that is what happened.
There were 457 visa regulations that went to Exco yesterday. I know that because I was there. That is how I know that Dr Marie Bashir is the acting Governor-General. However, those regulations do not relate to the 38-hour week basis being made crystal clear. That will be done by a Gazette notice, which is in my office. The regulations that went to the Governor-General yesterday are a further indication—and I might take the opportunity of indicating what they are about—in relation to the minimum salary level to make sure that the maximum number of people can get advantage from the increase.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-06-15,"—I present the government’s response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on its inquiry into Australia’s maritime strategy, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE


AUSTRALIA’S MARITIME STRATEGY


RECOMMENDATION 1:

The committee recommends that the Government develop a national security strategy (NSS) which addresses Australia’s key interests such as, but not limited to:
economic;
business;
leisure/tourism;
diplomatic and trade;
social and cultural;
transnational crime;
illegal migration;
population policy;
the protection of critical infrastructure such as water, power;
transport and information communications;
environmental; and
defence and security.
The NSS should clearly articulate and demonstrate that there is a coherent and coordinated approach by Government to securing our national interests. (paragraph 3.28)

Government Response:

The Government keeps, and will continue to keep, its security policy framework and settings under review. The current strategy for managing national security is set out in a series of policy documents. These include policy documents from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Advancing the National Interest: Australia’s Foreign and Trade Policy Paper, Transnational Terrorism: The Threat to Australia, and Weapons of Mass Destruction: Australia’s Role in Fighting Proliferation—Practical responses to new challenges) and Defence (Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force), and two strategic reviews (Australia’s National Security: A Defence Update 2003 and Australia’s National Security: A Defence Update 2005). Protecting Australia Against Terrorism: Australia’s National Counter-Terrorism Policy and Arrangements, released by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the National Counter-Terrorism Plan are the primary documents on Australia’s national counter-terrorism policy and arrangements, and set out collaborative arrangements between the Commonwealth and States and Territories for preventing, preparing for and responding to terrorist incidents within Australia. The Government notes the recommendation to develop a national security strategy. The Government regularly considers national security issues in the National Security Committee of Cabinet, to ensure a coherent, whole-of-government focus. To foster interagency coordination and a stronger whole-of-government focus on national security issues, the National Security Division was established in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in July 2003.
In addition, there is a network of formal Inter-Departmental Committees that provides a venue for inter-departmental coordination of agencies with national security responsibilities.

Recommendation 2:

The committee recommends that the Defence Minister develop a new Defence White Paper for issue during 2005-06. From the introduction of this White Paper, a new Defence White Paper should be developed every four years through a rolling four year program. The proposed new White Paper should re-emphasise the point that Australia’s defence policy is ultimately defensive. The committee would envisage that ‘power projection ashore’ would relate to instances where Australian forces, as part of coalitions, have been requested to assist with the affairs in other nations. The Government, in developing the new White Paper, should take into account the conclusions made by the committee including:
Australia’s strategic objectives be the defence of Australia and its direct approaches together with greater focus on, and acquisition of, capabilities to operate in the region and globally in defence of our non-territorial interests;
clear articulation of why Australia’s security is interrelated with regional and global security;
the continuation of the commitment to ‘self-reliance’ in those situations where Australia has least discretion to act;
focusing on measures that will enhance interoperability with Australia’s allies such as the US; and
developing and implementing a maritime strategy which includes the elements of sea denial, sea control and power projection ashore. (paragraph 4.124)

Government Response:

On releasing Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force, the Government undertook to review our defence posture periodically to ensure Australia continues to have the appropriate mix of concepts, capabilities and forces to meet any changes to the strategic environment. In response to the attacks of September 2001 and October 2002, a review of Defence strategy, in the form of Australia’s National Security: A Defence Update 2003 was undertaken. This review, and the subsequent one undertaken in 2005, confirmed that the principles set out in the 2000 White Paper remain sound. Defence 2000, the Defence Update 2003, and the Defence Update 2005 include the Government’s position on the issues raised in the committee’s recommendation.
The Government does not agree with the recommendation that White Papers be developed every four years. The Government will continue to implement Defence 2000 and will maintain an up-to-date strategic assessment to inform changes in our capability priorities, defence planning and wider national security requirements. It will, from time to time, continue to provide public updates of its strategic assessment of our security environment and the policy priorities that flow from this.

Recommendation 3

The Department of Defence should make a statement, subject to security requirements, outlining the Army sustainment model and providing the Parliament with reassurances that the model will be effective and will meet contingencies consistent with guidance provided in the 2000 Defence White Paper. (paragraph 5.46)

Government Response:

The Army Sustainment Model is a tool that will enable the Army to more accurately determine the capability and resources required to meet Government requirements. This includes the strategic direction issued in the 2000 Defence White Paper to sustain a brigade deployed on operations for extended periods and, at the same time, maintain at least a battalion group available for deployment elsewhere. The additional 1,485 personnel to be recruited under the Hardened and Networked Army plan will make the Army more capable of sustaining deployed forces.

Recommendation 4

The Minister for Defence should make a statement outlining Army Reserves policy focusing on Reserve:
training;
effectiveness;
equipment and capabilities;
readiness;
transition to new functions;
blending with regular units; and
detailed cost data. (paragraph 5.47)

Government Response:

In recent years, the Government has clearly articulated its support for the three Service Reserves in policy documents such as Defence 2000 and in a range of new and amended Defence legislation to strengthen the reserve components of the ADF and increase the circumstances in which they can be employed. This has included a plan to deploy Reserves on Australian Navy Ships as Transit Security Elements, the introduction of workplace guidelines enabling Defence reservists to be released for training and operations, the establishment of the ADF Reserves Employer Support Payment Scheme and the establishment of the Reserve Response Force. The Defence Update 2005 and Hardened and Networked Army announcement included plans to refine the role of the Army Reserve to provide a focus on high readiness individuals and small teams to contribute to operational deployments. Approximately 2,800 high readiness Reservists will be made available to support the Army’s front line deployable units. Additionally, in the Defence Update 2005 the Government directed the ADF to further develop active reserves with specific roles and tasks to support Australia’s domestic security.

Recommendation 5

The committee recommends that the Department of Defence review the number of air-to-air refuelling (AAR) aircraft that it will need to mount effective operations. The committee is of the view that Defence may require more AARs than has currently been planned. (paragraph 5.72)

Government Response:

The Government does not agree that further review of the number of air-to-air refuelling (AAR) aircraft required to mount effective operations is required, as detailed analysis was completed as part of the process to acquire the AAR aircraft.
The number of AAR aircraft being acquired has been determined based on assessment of what would be needed to support credible contingencies.

Recommendation 6

The committee recommends that the Department of Defence continues to examine air combat capabilities in the region and the cost of ongoing upgrades to the F/A-18A versus its fatigue and ageing. If the F-35 will not be available by 2012 then the Government should give cost details of prolonging the lifespan of the F/A-18A, and provide details on the range of options to maintain air superiority in the region. (paragraph 5.73)

Government Response:

As part of its responsibilities for national security, the Government is continuing to examine regional combat capabilities, including air combat capabilities. The Defence Capability Plan includes funding to maintain the F/A-18A and F-111 capability as required. The requirement to extend the capability will be determined when the Government makes its decision on the F-35, although the DCP contains provision—for the upgrade for the F/A-18 as contingency funding in the event that the introduction into service of the F-35 is delayed.

Recommendation 7

The committee recommends that the Minister for Defence by 2006 make a statement clarifying Australia’s strike capability in the light of its decision to retire early the F-111. (paragraph 5.74)

Government Response:

The Government clearly articulated the reasons for its decision to retire the F-111 early in the Defence Capability Review. The F-111 will not be retired until a range of capability enhancements are in place to ensure that the Air Force has a strong and effective land and maritime strike capability. These capability enhancements include AEW&C and new A330 tanker aircraft entering service, the systems upgrade of the F/A-18 aircraft including its all-weather weapon capability.

Recommendation 8

The Government’s decision to purchase three air warfare destroyers for delivery by about 2013 is supported. The Department of Defence, however, should explain how adequate air protection will be provided to land and naval forces before the air warfare destroyers are delivered in 2013. (paragraph 5.90)

Government Response:

The Government will protect its land and naval forces prior to the delivery of the air warfare destroyers through three key upgrades. Project SEA 1390 will upgrade the weapons and radar systems of the FFG class. Project Sea 1448 will upgrade the self-defence capabilities of the ANZAC class. Joint Project 2089 will improve the ADF’s information exchange capability in a joint context through the provision of Link 16 and Variable Message Format information protocols to the ANZAC, upgraded F/A-18 and Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter platforms.

Recommendation 9

If in 2006 the Government confirms that it will purchase the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) then it should consider purchasing some short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35 variants for the provision of organic air cover as part of regional operations. (paragraph 5.91)

Government Response:

The CTOL variant of the F-35 is the focus of Defence planning and analysis. This is because the CTOL is seen as providing the most cost-effective option to meet Australia’s future air combat requirements. The Government plans to make a decision on the acquisition of the F-35 in 2008.

Recommendation 10

The committee recommends that the Government outline its progress with joint operations and regional cooperation initiatives which seek to enhance the security and protection of vessels using sea lines of communication (SLOCs). (paragraph 6.37)

Government Response:

The ADF conducts a number of joint operations and regional cooperation initiatives to enhance the security and protection of vessels using sea lines of communication. The ADF maintains a regular series of maritime exercises with South-East Asian nations that aim to both increase the ADF’s interoperability with regional armed forces for maritime operations, and to improve the capability of regional nations’ maritime forces to contribute to regional security.
The ADF also maintains a regular series of bilateral and multilateral maritime exercises within the Asia Pacific region that aim both to increase the ADF’s interoperability with regional armed forces for maritime operations, and to improve the capability of regional nations’ maritime forces to contribute to regional security. These exercises develop the capabilities of Australia and its neighbours.
The ADF is involved in conferences in various countries in the Asia Pacific region, which address regional maritime security. The Five Power Defence Arrangement (FPDA) countries have moved to expand the focus of the arrangements to look at cooperating on threats such as terrorism and maritime security. A combined FPDA exercise held in September 2004 included a maritime interception activity.

Recommendation 11

The committee recommends that when the Department of Defence develops a new Defence White Paper, it should ensure that the maritime strategy includes clear and explicit reference to Australia’s Oceans Policy and explains its interrelationship with Defence policy. (paragraph 6.38)

Government Response:

The Government notes the committee’s recommendation.

Recommendation 12

The committee recommends that the Government provide a report to Parliament outlining its progress with helping to develop a regional Oceans Policy. (paragraph 6.39)

Government Response:

The Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy (PIROP) was endorsed by Pacific Islands Forum leaders in August 2002. The PIROP is the first such regional policy in the world, and encompasses the region of small island developing states in the Pacific—namely Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.
The vision of the Policy encourages the entire region to strive for “a healthy ocean that sustains the livelihoods and aspirations of Pacific Islands communities”. The five Guiding Principles of the PIROP are:
Improving our Understanding of the Ocean
Sustainably Developing and Managing the use of Ocean Resources
Maintaining the Health Of the Ocean
Promoting the Peaceful Use of the Ocean
Creating Partnerships and Promoting Co-Operation
Australia strongly supported the development of this Policy by providing to the Pacific Region significant information, advice and experience from the development of Australia’s Oceans Policy.
The implementation of the PIROP is also strongly supported by Australia, and assistance with the development of the PIROP and its implementation strategy was a key partnership initiative between Australia and the Pacific region from the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Australia has contributed AUD$40,000, as well as logistical support and policy advice, to the Secretariat of the Pacific Community to support this initiative.
Australia is continuing to work with the region toward the realisation of PIROP goals. In February 2004, officials from the National Oceans Office, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Department of the Environment and Heritage attended the Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Forum in Suva, Fiji. The meeting was attended by approximately 200 participants, including government representatives from Pacific Island countries and territories, conservation NGOs, regional agencies, industry and academics.
The Forum discussed a range of possible elements for potential inclusion in a final implementation strategy, and agreed a process for drafting a framework for implementing the Policy. This process is currently under way. Australia is pursuing an implementation plan which is easy to use, clearly outlines priority actions and how they will be achieved, identifies funding sources, and includes reference to existing regional programs and activities. At the recent 2004 Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ meeting, leaders noted the progress in implementing the Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy.

Recommendation 13

The committee recommends that the Government, as a matter of urgency, respond to the measures proposed by the Independent Review of Australian Shipping, and state whether or not it intends to introduce an Australian Shipping policy. (paragraph 6.75)

Government Response:

The Government has set out the key elements of its approach to shipping policy, in 2004 at the Natship conference in Melbourne. While this policy speech touched on many of the issues raised by the Independent Review of Australian Shipping (IRAS), a review commissioned by the shipping industry for the industry, the Government will not be responding to it formally.
The Government believes that the best way it can support any industry is to maintain Australia’s strong domestic economy.
Australia’s international trade must continue to have access to internationally competitive shipping. IRAS has acknowledged that shipping arrangements that would make our exports uncompetitive would be against the wider national interest. While it is essential for Australia’s economic future, it does create challenges for Australian shipping operators.
The Government will continue to supplement coastal shipping for Australian industries by issuing permits for foreign ships in accordance with the established regulatory provisions. However, this will only be done in those cases where no Australian licensed ship is available.
In summary, the Government’s shipping policy continues to be a blend of providing shippers with access to competitive shipping and a level of preference for the local industry in the coastal trades.
The Government is committed to enforcing the highest standards of maritime safety, security and environmental protection. It has emphasised that it will never reduce Australia’s strict safety, security and environmental standards. Australia’s port state control system is world class and will continue that way and Australia has met the 1 July 2004 international deadline for security plans to be approved and in place.
The Government has also made it clear that if there are any security concerns about any ship, its crew or cargo, we will place additional security measures on that ship or require it to leave Australian waters.

Recommendation 14

The committee recommends that, as part of the next Defence White Paper, the Department of Defence outline the role of merchant shipping and its support for defence objectives. (paragraph 6.76)

Government Response:

In developing a new Defence White Paper, the Government will consider a wide range of security issues, including other national policies that have implications for national security.
Australia’s strategic circumstances and current and proposed force structures do not rely on the existence of a merchant marine fleet. Our experience in recent operations has been to contract for these services, and there are a large number of providers ready and able to undertake this role. Our access to such capabilities meets our current needs and is expected to meet operational needs in the foreseeable future.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title>",Committees,22,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-06-15,"—I present the government’s response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on its inquiry into Australia’s maritime strategy, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE


AUSTRALIA’S MARITIME STRATEGY


RECOMMENDATION 1:

The committee recommends that the Government develop a national security strategy (NSS) which addresses Australia’s key interests such as, but not limited to:
economic;
business;
leisure/tourism;
diplomatic and trade;
social and cultural;
transnational crime;
illegal migration;
population policy;
the protection of critical infrastructure such as water, power;
transport and information communications;
environmental; and
defence and security.
The NSS should clearly articulate and demonstrate that there is a coherent and coordinated approach by Government to securing our national interests. (paragraph 3.28)

Government Response:

The Government keeps, and will continue to keep, its security policy framework and settings under review. The current strategy for managing national security is set out in a series of policy documents. These include policy documents from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Advancing the National Interest: Australia’s Foreign and Trade Policy Paper, Transnational Terrorism: The Threat to Australia, and Weapons of Mass Destruction: Australia’s Role in Fighting Proliferation—Practical responses to new challenges) and Defence (Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force), and two strategic reviews (Australia’s National Security: A Defence Update 2003 and Australia’s National Security: A Defence Update 2005). Protecting Australia Against Terrorism: Australia’s National Counter-Terrorism Policy and Arrangements, released by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the National Counter-Terrorism Plan are the primary documents on Australia’s national counter-terrorism policy and arrangements, and set out collaborative arrangements between the Commonwealth and States and Territories for preventing, preparing for and responding to terrorist incidents within Australia. The Government notes the recommendation to develop a national security strategy. The Government regularly considers national security issues in the National Security Committee of Cabinet, to ensure a coherent, whole-of-government focus. To foster interagency coordination and a stronger whole-of-government focus on national security issues, the National Security Division was established in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in July 2003.
In addition, there is a network of formal Inter-Departmental Committees that provides a venue for inter-departmental coordination of agencies with national security responsibilities.

Recommendation 2:

The committee recommends that the Defence Minister develop a new Defence White Paper for issue during 2005-06. From the introduction of this White Paper, a new Defence White Paper should be developed every four years through a rolling four year program. The proposed new White Paper should re-emphasise the point that Australia’s defence policy is ultimately defensive. The committee would envisage that ‘power projection ashore’ would relate to instances where Australian forces, as part of coalitions, have been requested to assist with the affairs in other nations. The Government, in developing the new White Paper, should take into account the conclusions made by the committee including:
Australia’s strategic objectives be the defence of Australia and its direct approaches together with greater focus on, and acquisition of, capabilities to operate in the region and globally in defence of our non-territorial interests;
clear articulation of why Australia’s security is interrelated with regional and global security;
the continuation of the commitment to ‘self-reliance’ in those situations where Australia has least discretion to act;
focusing on measures that will enhance interoperability with Australia’s allies such as the US; and
developing and implementing a maritime strategy which includes the elements of sea denial, sea control and power projection ashore. (paragraph 4.124)

Government Response:

On releasing Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force, the Government undertook to review our defence posture periodically to ensure Australia continues to have the appropriate mix of concepts, capabilities and forces to meet any changes to the strategic environment. In response to the attacks of September 2001 and October 2002, a review of Defence strategy, in the form of Australia’s National Security: A Defence Update 2003 was undertaken. This review, and the subsequent one undertaken in 2005, confirmed that the principles set out in the 2000 White Paper remain sound. Defence 2000, the Defence Update 2003, and the Defence Update 2005 include the Government’s position on the issues raised in the committee’s recommendation.
The Government does not agree with the recommendation that White Papers be developed every four years. The Government will continue to implement Defence 2000 and will maintain an up-to-date strategic assessment to inform changes in our capability priorities, defence planning and wider national security requirements. It will, from time to time, continue to provide public updates of its strategic assessment of our security environment and the policy priorities that flow from this.

Recommendation 3

The Department of Defence should make a statement, subject to security requirements, outlining the Army sustainment model and providing the Parliament with reassurances that the model will be effective and will meet contingencies consistent with guidance provided in the 2000 Defence White Paper. (paragraph 5.46)

Government Response:

The Army Sustainment Model is a tool that will enable the Army to more accurately determine the capability and resources required to meet Government requirements. This includes the strategic direction issued in the 2000 Defence White Paper to sustain a brigade deployed on operations for extended periods and, at the same time, maintain at least a battalion group available for deployment elsewhere. The additional 1,485 personnel to be recruited under the Hardened and Networked Army plan will make the Army more capable of sustaining deployed forces.

Recommendation 4

The Minister for Defence should make a statement outlining Army Reserves policy focusing on Reserve:
training;
effectiveness;
equipment and capabilities;
readiness;
transition to new functions;
blending with regular units; and
detailed cost data. (paragraph 5.47)

Government Response:

In recent years, the Government has clearly articulated its support for the three Service Reserves in policy documents such as Defence 2000 and in a range of new and amended Defence legislation to strengthen the reserve components of the ADF and increase the circumstances in which they can be employed. This has included a plan to deploy Reserves on Australian Navy Ships as Transit Security Elements, the introduction of workplace guidelines enabling Defence reservists to be released for training and operations, the establishment of the ADF Reserves Employer Support Payment Scheme and the establishment of the Reserve Response Force. The Defence Update 2005 and Hardened and Networked Army announcement included plans to refine the role of the Army Reserve to provide a focus on high readiness individuals and small teams to contribute to operational deployments. Approximately 2,800 high readiness Reservists will be made available to support the Army’s front line deployable units. Additionally, in the Defence Update 2005 the Government directed the ADF to further develop active reserves with specific roles and tasks to support Australia’s domestic security.

Recommendation 5

The committee recommends that the Department of Defence review the number of air-to-air refuelling (AAR) aircraft that it will need to mount effective operations. The committee is of the view that Defence may require more AARs than has currently been planned. (paragraph 5.72)

Government Response:

The Government does not agree that further review of the number of air-to-air refuelling (AAR) aircraft required to mount effective operations is required, as detailed analysis was completed as part of the process to acquire the AAR aircraft.
The number of AAR aircraft being acquired has been determined based on assessment of what would be needed to support credible contingencies.

Recommendation 6

The committee recommends that the Department of Defence continues to examine air combat capabilities in the region and the cost of ongoing upgrades to the F/A-18A versus its fatigue and ageing. If the F-35 will not be available by 2012 then the Government should give cost details of prolonging the lifespan of the F/A-18A, and provide details on the range of options to maintain air superiority in the region. (paragraph 5.73)

Government Response:

As part of its responsibilities for national security, the Government is continuing to examine regional combat capabilities, including air combat capabilities. The Defence Capability Plan includes funding to maintain the F/A-18A and F-111 capability as required. The requirement to extend the capability will be determined when the Government makes its decision on the F-35, although the DCP contains provision—for the upgrade for the F/A-18 as contingency funding in the event that the introduction into service of the F-35 is delayed.

Recommendation 7

The committee recommends that the Minister for Defence by 2006 make a statement clarifying Australia’s strike capability in the light of its decision to retire early the F-111. (paragraph 5.74)

Government Response:

The Government clearly articulated the reasons for its decision to retire the F-111 early in the Defence Capability Review. The F-111 will not be retired until a range of capability enhancements are in place to ensure that the Air Force has a strong and effective land and maritime strike capability. These capability enhancements include AEW&C and new A330 tanker aircraft entering service, the systems upgrade of the F/A-18 aircraft including its all-weather weapon capability.

Recommendation 8

The Government’s decision to purchase three air warfare destroyers for delivery by about 2013 is supported. The Department of Defence, however, should explain how adequate air protection will be provided to land and naval forces before the air warfare destroyers are delivered in 2013. (paragraph 5.90)

Government Response:

The Government will protect its land and naval forces prior to the delivery of the air warfare destroyers through three key upgrades. Project SEA 1390 will upgrade the weapons and radar systems of the FFG class. Project Sea 1448 will upgrade the self-defence capabilities of the ANZAC class. Joint Project 2089 will improve the ADF’s information exchange capability in a joint context through the provision of Link 16 and Variable Message Format information protocols to the ANZAC, upgraded F/A-18 and Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter platforms.

Recommendation 9

If in 2006 the Government confirms that it will purchase the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) then it should consider purchasing some short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35 variants for the provision of organic air cover as part of regional operations. (paragraph 5.91)

Government Response:

The CTOL variant of the F-35 is the focus of Defence planning and analysis. This is because the CTOL is seen as providing the most cost-effective option to meet Australia’s future air combat requirements. The Government plans to make a decision on the acquisition of the F-35 in 2008.

Recommendation 10

The committee recommends that the Government outline its progress with joint operations and regional cooperation initiatives which seek to enhance the security and protection of vessels using sea lines of communication (SLOCs). (paragraph 6.37)

Government Response:

The ADF conducts a number of joint operations and regional cooperation initiatives to enhance the security and protection of vessels using sea lines of communication. The ADF maintains a regular series of maritime exercises with South-East Asian nations that aim to both increase the ADF’s interoperability with regional armed forces for maritime operations, and to improve the capability of regional nations’ maritime forces to contribute to regional security.
The ADF also maintains a regular series of bilateral and multilateral maritime exercises within the Asia Pacific region that aim both to increase the ADF’s interoperability with regional armed forces for maritime operations, and to improve the capability of regional nations’ maritime forces to contribute to regional security. These exercises develop the capabilities of Australia and its neighbours.
The ADF is involved in conferences in various countries in the Asia Pacific region, which address regional maritime security. The Five Power Defence Arrangement (FPDA) countries have moved to expand the focus of the arrangements to look at cooperating on threats such as terrorism and maritime security. A combined FPDA exercise held in September 2004 included a maritime interception activity.

Recommendation 11

The committee recommends that when the Department of Defence develops a new Defence White Paper, it should ensure that the maritime strategy includes clear and explicit reference to Australia’s Oceans Policy and explains its interrelationship with Defence policy. (paragraph 6.38)

Government Response:

The Government notes the committee’s recommendation.

Recommendation 12

The committee recommends that the Government provide a report to Parliament outlining its progress with helping to develop a regional Oceans Policy. (paragraph 6.39)

Government Response:

The Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy (PIROP) was endorsed by Pacific Islands Forum leaders in August 2002. The PIROP is the first such regional policy in the world, and encompasses the region of small island developing states in the Pacific—namely Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2006-06-15,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Turkey and Ireland, which took place from 16 to 28 October 2005. I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The delegation conducted a successful and enjoyable visit to Turkey and Ireland, meeting all its agreed aims and objectives. I thank my fellow delegation members: Senator Stephens, the deputy leader of the delegation, who is Irish-born, which made her an instant celebrity in Ireland; and Senators Andrew Bartlett and Gavin Marshall, together with Mr Kerry Bartlett and Mr Phil Barresi from the House of Representatives. The camaraderie between members of the delegation made this a very enjoyable group to lead and it contributed to the overall success of the delegation’s visit.
Prior to departure, the delegation received very valuable and comprehensive briefings from the Irish Ambassador, Mr Declan Kelly, and the Turkish Ambassador, Mr Tansu Okandan. While Mr Okandan has now completed his posting to Australia, the delegation was pleased to meet his replacement, Mr Murat Ersavci, at a formal reception hosted by the Australian Ambassador, Ms Jean Dunn, while in Ankara.
Australia enjoys a strong and friendly relationship with Turkey. While the relationship has a strong foundation with the events of Gallipoli, and the shared experience which played such an important role in the developing nationhood of both countries, recent high-level visits to both countries have seen a broadening in the scope of the relationship. Prime Minister Howard visited Turkey in April 2005, and this was reciprocated by Prime Minister Erdogan who, accompanied by senior ministers, visited Australia in December 2005. These and other ministerial and high-level visits have led to many developments, including enhanced trade opportunities, agricultural cooperation, a work and holiday visa arrangement, defence cooperation and dialogue on a range of international, political and security issues.
Before commencing its formal program, the delegation visited Kemal Ataturk’s mausoleum and participated in a wreath-laying ceremony. The delegation held a number of valuable meetings with members of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, including Minister Osman Pepe, who has visited Australia, the chairmen and members of a number of parliamentary committees, and the Turkish-Australian Parliamentary Friendship Group.
Prospects for trade and opportunities for an increased business relationship with Australia and Australian companies were discussed with members of the Ankara Chamber of Commerce, as well as at meetings with the governorships of Istanbul and Canakkale. Austrade now operates a post in Istanbul and, with the work of Senior Trade Commissioner Damian Fisher, a number of key growth areas have been identified as providing opportunities for Australian companies—including infrastructure programs, oil and gas production, education and training, information and communication technologies, and health care and medical products. The delegation also met members of the Istanbul arts and cultural community with Mr Fisher, and discussed opportunities for cultural exchange and film and project investment.
The delegation felt honoured and was deeply moved by visiting the sites at Anzac Cove, Lone Pine and other places that play such an important role in our national history. It is truly difficult to grasp the enormity of the courage and the sacrifice that was displayed in gaining, and ultimately losing, such small areas of land. Gallipoli Peninsula Peace Park, which includes not just Anzac Cove but other sites of importance to the Turks and the British, is now attracting an increasing number of visitors, and that has resulted in the need for development to improve access and facilities.
The Australian embassy had compiled a most valuable and interesting program of meetings and visits in Turkey. On behalf of the delegation, I particularly thank Ambassador Jean Dunn for her wise advice and assistance at formal meetings and for hosting the delegation. I also thank Mr Brian Dunn for his support of the accompanying spouses and all the embassy staff, but especially Libby Petrovic and Elif Wade, who capably and professionally assisted the delegation to ensure that the visit ran smoothly.
The program for the visit to Ireland was organised by the Irish Parliamentary Association and consisted of a busy schedule, with a balance of official meetings, interesting and informative visits and social occasions. I particularly thank Dr Rory O’Hanlon, the Ceann Comhairle or Speaker, who provided so much of his valuable time to be with the delegation at official and social occasions, including hosting a visit to his home county of Monaghan. I also thank Mr Seamus Pattison, the Deputy Speaker, for the visit to County Kilkenny. To Cait Hayes and Jackie Leavy of the Irish Parliamentary Association office goes our special gratitude for accompanying the delegation and ensuring that the visit was a success. Cait and her staff certainly exemplify the famous generosity and warmth of Irish hospitality.
The relationship between Ireland and Australia is based on an old friendship that arises from over 30 per cent of Australians claiming some Irish ancestry. Many of the people that the delegation met had visited Australia, had family in Australia or had children who worked or studied in Australia. In the case of Senator Stephens, many of her family still remain in Ireland.
The delegation was able to discuss a range of international and domestic economic, social and political issues with political leaders, including their gracious and charming President, Mary McAlese; Mary Harney, the Tainaiste or Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Children; Senator Rory Kiely, the Cathaoirleach or Chairperson of the Senate; leaders of the main political parties; and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The economic growth in Ireland in recent years was reinforced through visits to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and the International Financial Services Centre, which has attracted major global banks and insurance companies to locate in Ireland. Science Foundation Ireland also successfully attracts international and local researchers by investing in academic researchers and teams who can generate new knowledge and leading-edge technologies in fields underpinning biotechnology, information and communications technologies and emerging opportunities.
The delegation visited the Australian Studies Centre at the University College of Dublin. This centre offers courses in Australian history to undergraduates. It also conducts Australian studies research seminars and occasional conferences, although it does not have the funding or resources to support other projects such as a visiting speakers program. The centre plays a valuable role in providing a background on Australia and Australian history to students who, upon graduation, will enter influential fields within the commercial, legal and political arenas. The delegation was pleased to be able to gain an appreciation not just of the pride with which their links to Australia are held but also of Irish rural life through visiting and meeting with people outside the capital city and experiencing the diversity that is Ireland’s culture and heritage.
I also thank Elton Humphrey, the secretary of the delegation, for his dedication, for making sure that everything was done for us as delegation members and for the efficient manner in which he conducted himself. He made our trip more enjoyable. Finally, I should mention the accompanying spouses, because this was, it is fair to say, a very happy delegation, due in no small part to Senator Stephens’s husband, Bob, who, being the only male spouse, was a very good shopping companion of my wife, Anne, and Kerry Bartlett’s wife, Christine. They contributed very much to the success of this visit. Their contribution, both in Turkey and in Ireland, added to the impact of the visit of this delegation to both countries. I thank them for their contribution on what I think has been a worthwhile exercise.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to Turkey and Ireland</title>,Delegation Reports,26,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-06-15,"—I would like to speak very briefly in support of the comments by Senator Ferguson. It was a great privilege to participate in the parliamentary delegation to Turkey and to Ireland. For me, it was a very special trip to Ireland because, as Senator Ferguson said, I was a celebrity wherever I went as soon as they realised I was born there. It was very special.
One of the most moving experiences that any delegation can have is to visit Canakkale to look at the graveyards there. It makes you appreciate the significance of the whole Anzac story. That was certainly the case for the delegation this time. I join with Senator Ferguson in thanking Her Excellency Ambassador Dunn and her husband, and all the embassy staff in Turkey. They did an amazing job. They kept us on our toes. We were briefed extensively on cultural, economic and political issues. We were there at a time when there was a heightened security alert, and we got to understand what the impacts of that were on the country, and that was very significant and very important for us to understand.
I want to speak briefly today, because I know we have a lot of business ahead of us. I want to make some comments about the trip to Ireland and the fact that for me it was very significant. We went back to where I was born, Wicklow. That was an emotional experience, but it was also fascinating to be able to show the delegation where I was born and the people who are so significant to me. We were able, by visiting Wicklow jail, to make a very concrete connection between our earlier visit to County Monaghan and the Carrickmacross poorhouse in County Monaghan, which was where many people gave up everything and then finally were accepted on ships for Australia. It was where a lot of Australia’s Irish immigrants came from. To see that and then the Wicklow jail, which is a very significant historic jail, demonstrated the connections with Australia. It was graphically demonstrated as well, as we had a re-enactment of floggings and drama to get us into the atmosphere. That was very significant.
Most significant too, though, was the engagement that we had with the members of the Irish parliament. We met members of all parties and had side meetings. We had a meeting with Fianna Fail, Fine Gael, the Greens and the Labour Party. Some of us met with some Sinn Fein members, which was also very important. Listening to the political dynamics of what is going on in Ireland was very significant as well. That is something you do not get to do very often and it was much appreciated.
We were very well looked after by Dr Rory O’Hanlon. We were overwhelmed by his hospitality. First of all, informally, when we arrived in Ireland very late one evening—I think it was almost midnight by the time we got to the motel—there was Dr O’Hanlon waiting to greet us officially. Not only did he do that and meet us the next day but he also picked me up for mass at 7 o’clock on the Sunday morning. It was just lovely to do that and to experience an Irish mass. It is exactly the same as a mass in Australia, I have to say, but it was beautiful, and it was very thoughtful of him and his wife. Then I went back to his house and actually had morning tea with him—that was an extraordinary personal gesture that he made.
He looked after us so well during the delegation. On the final evening we had a dinner. I just felt that it was such an extraordinary experience that I wanted to express my appreciation for all that had been done. So I did, in Gaelic. I would actually like to put on the parliamentary record what I said in Gaelic, if I may. What I said on behalf of all of the delegation members was:
Ta athas an domhan ar an toscaireacht a bheith anseo inniu_go haraithe me fhein, mar ta me arais i mo thir dhuchais.
Rugadh I gCill Maintain me agus ce go bfhuil conai orm anois san Astrail, mothaim go bfhuil me abaile abhus in Eirinn.
Is cuis bhroduil idom a bheith libh mar ionaidhi de mo thir nua, an Astrail
-tir in a rinne munitir na h Eireann sar-obhair o bunaoidh i nios mo na dha chead bliain o shoin.
Basically, what I said on behalf of us all was that our delegation was delighted to be there and that I was especially pleased to be back in Ireland. I was born in Wicklow and, even though I live in Australia, I still felt very much at home in Ireland. I was very proud to be there that day as a representative of Australia, a country to which Irish people had made such a huge contribution since its foundation over 200 years ago. It was a wonderful trip. I concur with Senator Ferguson. The company was fantastic, the support we had from everyone was wonderful and I think we all learned immensely. I think we did something good about strengthening the relationship between Australia and those two countries.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to Turkey and Ireland</title>,Delegation Reports,26,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-06-15,"—This disallowance motion regarding the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Regulations 2006 relates to the government’s downstream petroleum reform package and the introduction of the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006, which has the effect of repealing the 1980 sites and franchise acts.
As part of the process of introducing the reform package, the government has made regulations to omit regulation 3 of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Regulations 1981. The effect of this amendment is to suspend the reporting and compliance obligations that currently apply to the major oil companies under the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act. This act is therefore effectively inoperative unless the regulations are subsequently withdrawn or disallowed. That is the context of the disallowance motion standing in the name of Senator Joyce.
Labor is supporting this disallowance on the government regulation. It has the effect of removing the four major oil companies from the scope of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act. Labor’s principal argument with the government on this issue is one of process, not substance. Before I go to the issue of substance, I want to reiterate the point that the regulation has the effect of repealing the sites act before the parliament has had the opportunity to consider the merits of the repeal bill. We on this side of the chamber see this as an unacceptable abuse of power and an attack on parliamentary democracy. Labor is very concerned about when the government might choose to use this method next: perhaps on matters of national security or immigration. Who knows? But on the substance of this issue, which is where we really do feel at odds with the government, Labor is prepared to repeal the sites act provided that the government strengthens section 46 of the Trade Practices Act to maximise competition by protecting small and independent petrol station owners. We heard from Senator Joyce this morning how important it is to do that.
While Labor and the government disagree on the scope of the amendments necessary to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, the government has not even agreed to bring forward the amendments it said it would in response to the March 2004 recommendations of the Senate committee. When the Senate Economics Legislation Committee considered the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006, Labor senators, in our additional remarks, called again for those recommendations in relation to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act to be brought on as part of the oil code and the new bill.
Senator Joyce certainly acknowledged section 46 in his speech today, but it is our argument that he needs to do much more than support the disallowance. He must call for reform of section 46 to be included as part of the government’s reform package. I must say that on process the government has got into a mess of its own making. Despite Senator Minchin’s contribution this morning, when he tried to defend the process, the problem is quite simply that the government has had three years to reform the 26-year-old regime which regulates the retail petrol industry. Because it has been incapable of producing an acceptable model, it wants to repeal the sites act through the back door. To do so would offend the rights of the parliament and would risk putting upward pressure on petrol prices.
The government should immediately bring on the repeal bill for debate. We have asked for it, we have prepared for it and we are ready to support it—but only if we can actually see it, and the proposed oil code—so that we can see whether the government is prepared to strengthen section 46 of the Trade Practices Act to maximise competition by protecting small and independent petrol station owners. Instead, the government has sought to undermine the sites act and the will of the parliament by undeclaring, by regulation, the major petrol retailers from the operation of the sites act.
Labor cannot support this late and unilateral act, which does not provide the Trade Practices Act protection that small service station owners need. It does not even meet the need for improved Trade Practices Act protection that the government has accepted is necessary. That is why Labor is supporting this disallowance motion. In doing so, Labor appreciates this puts one of the major retailers, BP, in an unenviable position. BP has many licence agreements with small service station owners that are due for renewal. If the sites act is not repealed, BP may be forced to enter into new five-year licence agreements in order to continue supply to the motoring public. Clearly, BP would prefer not to be forced into this position in relation to some licences. But BP’s problem is entirely of the government’s making. It could have fixed it two years ago. The government’s actions in undeclaring the major petrol retailers are simply not appropriate, for both process and substantive reasons. They are not even consistent with the government’s stated policy.
Petrol market reform is about enhancing competition and putting downward pressure on petrol prices. As it stands, the government’s package could lead to the demise of many independents, a reduction in competition and higher petrol prices. Senator Joyce went to that issue very clearly in his contribution to this debate. To resolve this matter once and for all, the government should bring on the legislation to repeal the sites act and the amendments to the Trade Practices Act. Only this would give operators in the market the certainty and protection they need. The government could easily achieve this before the parliament rises next week.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL MARKETING SITES AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2006 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,30,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-06-15,"—We have heard today the debate with respect to regulations that get rid of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980. A couple of clear issues have been illustrated throughout the debate. What has happened with these regulations is that the intent of a piece of legislation that has not yet been debated is about to be put into place. This Senate has not had the chance to debate the issue that there has been a regulatory change that has brought about the intent of a piece of legislation that we have not yet had a chance to see.
Going back to the issue, everyone acknowledges that the current oil code is flawed. There is no argument that the current oil code is flawed. The problem with the current oil code has been brought about by Coles and Woolworths circumventing the intent of the 1980 act. However, there is nothing in this regulation or the proposed legislation that deals with the fact that Coles and Woolworths have circumvented the intent of the act. We have basically found the people who have broken the intent of the act and let them off the hook. We have done nothing to actually address the problem. Instead, in some obscure piece of logic, rather than addressing the problem we are going to affect an innocent third party in this: the independent branded and franchisees, the mum-and-dad operators. They are going to have to suffer the slings and arrows of the fact that Coles and Woolworths have circumvented the intent of the act.
The intent of 1980, when the coalition government initially brought in this piece of legislation, is still as good now as it was then. The world has not changed that much in 26 years. The government’s intent then was to keep wider participation in the retail market to prevent vertical integration. And now we are about to bring in a piece of legislation that is going to bring a narrower participation in the retail market and create vertical integration. I do not see the logic of how we have managed to do that complete 180-degree turn on what has always been a strong small business intent.
A lot of people have had to deal with the bluff of the major oil companies. We have had the major oil companies saying, ‘If this doesn’t go through, we’re going to pull out of Australia; the world will collapse.’ I think that is a load of rubbish. They have been doing very well for themselves and they will continue to do very well for themselves—and we want them to do very well for themselves. But it is a sign of the sorts of tactics they use, the standover tactics: ‘You’—that is, the parliament of Australia—‘will do this or else.’ I take with a grain of salt the predictions by one oil company in particular, which said to my office that they had an intention, if this did not go through, to leave Australia. How ridiculous is that?
I also acknowledge that in the National Party we have a clear intention to try to get ethanol out into the market. Everyone clearly states that, if this goes through in its current form, it is going to be an inhibitor to getting ethanol out into the market. Getting a biorenewable fuel alternative out into the market that basically makes Australia a benefactor of the biorenewable fuel industry rather than a casualty of it will be affected by the fact that the independents are not in the market. They will be under undue pressure because of this, because all of a sudden you are going to have the supplier of the independents’ product also being a competitor in the retail market. We have some obscure belief that somehow their major competitor is going to look after them. Of course they are not. As soon as they prove themselves a viable threat, they are going to put them out of business. Since the Boral case and the running down of the predatory pricing laws, they have every ability to do that. That is another issue that connected to this.
I agree with Senator Bartlett and Senator Stephens that we should be dealing with section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. That is a big issue and it needs to be brought forward. It is a protection for small business. There is a government approved form of section 46. It has been there since 2004. It is just languishing; it is just sitting there. That piece of legislation should be enacted. It should be brought forward. I do not think even the oil companies would have a problem with that. If it were brought forward, we would have a mitigating circumstance that would allow a more relevant roll-out of this piece of legislation.
But this regulation is all one way. The way it goes, it is all in the favour of the incumbent oligopoly of the four major oil companies and Coles and Woolworths. Cole and Woolworths are, by default, Caltex and Shell. Sometimes they pose; Caltex and Shell will say, ‘We can’t do anything about Coles and Woolworths.’ Of course not! They are moving so much product through them that they do not want to do anything about them. They have managed to get about 52 per cent of the retail market in fuel, which links up with their control of the retail market in a whole range of other fields. Of course they are quite happy to move that product.
Then they put their hand on their heart and say, ‘We will deal with ethanol when it has a competitive advantage.’ The fact that ethanol is at about 80c at the terminal gate price and fuel is at about $1.40 does not seem to strike a chord. Of course there is an absolute competitive advantage of about 60c a litre to get ethanol out into the market, but they do not want to do it, because it does not fit their corporate plan. It does not fit their plan to roll out an alternative product to the product they are selling and they control from the oilwell to the bowser.
One of the main mechanisms that we have to do it in this nation is the independents. A clear example of that is here in Canberra. Four sites sell ethanol. Three of them are independent. And what are we going to do? We are going to pass a piece of legislation that those three independents say will work directly against their future in the market. We are passing a piece of legislation that does not promote ethanol; it inhibits it. You cannot say you want to promote a product if you are trying to get it off the market by taking away your mechanism of retailing it. That is another issue. The major oil companies’ move to not be proactive in pushing for the government’s policy of getting a biorenewable fuel industry off the ground will be enhanced because of the continued enactment of this regulatory instrument.
We have heard a lot today that there will be a strengthening of the lease agreements for these new franchisees and branded operators. But of course that avoids the crucial issue: that is only if the oil company chooses to renew them. It is like me saying to you: ‘I’m going to offer you a great deal on the lease of your house, if I choose to lease it to you. But, when there is a commercial advantage of me not leasing it to you, I’m not going to do it.’ The oil companies are not going to be renewing leases if they can make a greater margin out of operating it themselves. But, in these three by three by three year leases which have been talked about today, at the completion of that term they have two choices: to take over the site and operate it themselves or to lease it on to someone else under these new leasing arrangements.
That is the choice, and they can choose not to renew it. They can choose just to say: ‘We’ve thought about it. We don’t have to pay you anything for it. You’re out of there and we’re in there tomorrow.’ There is no protection against that. There is no mitigating measure against that. The protection in the past was exactly this regulatory instrument. They had to deal with it. They had to get their product moving. To get their product moving, they had to have the sites out there, and they were not allowed to own more than five per cent of sites. Now they are allowed to own the whole lot. There is nothing stopping them. The reason they are so absolutely enthusiastic about getting this through, and I know they have been lobbying in the corridors here flat out, is that that is exactly what they intend to do—take over these sites.
Who is going to suffer from that? In the short term it is going to be the mum-and-dad operators, the small businesses that we in this chamber are supposed to represent. They are the people that we are supposed to be looking after. They are the people who do not have the capacity or the lobbying ability to gather together in big numbers; put together a huge budget to come here and knock down every door; be the benefactors, if they have to be, of political parties; and do whatever else to achieve their objectives. Mum-and-dad operators do not have that capacity. What they have is the hope and the sense of goodwill that this place will protect their interests. That is not going to happen with this regulation going through.
We are going to make a clear statement today with this regulatory instrument about whether or not we believe there should be a protection for the smaller operators in the Australian market in general. There is no section 46 to go hand in hand with this. There is no section of the market that is going to be quarantined either volumetrically or by site numbers for smaller operators. It will be a further inhibitor on rolling ethanol out, yet we say that is what we want to do. I do not know how we are going to do it. Twenty million litres a year—that is how pathetic it is—is what the major oil companies have managed from 2001 to now, the year of our Lord 2006. They are managing to put 20 million litres into the fuel that we utilise. Their target is 350 million litres by about 2010. They are actually going down; they are not going up. They are putting less out, not more. They are going backwards in achieving their objectives. Even 350 million litres is only 0.7 of one per cent. It is so small. It is three-fifths of five-eighths of very little at all.
How are we going to try and deal with that? We are going to force them by giving them greater power to not achieve the objective that the Australian government has asked them to achieve. It is going to be interesting. In the future we are going to have major arterial roads with strangulated sites. That means sites on both the left- and the right-hand sides of the road owned and financed by the major oil companies. They are going to have the capacity to move huge volumes of fuel and they are going to have a close proximity to the refining capacity. It is a very efficient way to move the product. The purpose of the retailing arm is to move product. The margin is not made in Australia; it is made overseas. The purpose of the retailing arm in Australia is to move product. So you are going to have strangulated sites on the major arterial roads, and that is going to lead to the most efficient utilisation of refining capacity. There are no intended new refineries in Australia, so the refining capacity will have an absolute horizon of product that they can move.
When they move that refining capacity to the strangulated sites and the major sites they will own and control themselves, you will be left with other remote regional sites which will be very much at the bottom of the pecking order. There is nothing in this about guaranteeing supply. If they say they do not have the product, that is it—they do not have it. And they will probably be telling the truth—they will not have it. They will have utilised it in their own sites. They also, by the way, have a way of getting around that. They have categorisation of product. They have branded product for themselves and other product. Once the other product, which goes off to the independents, is out, that is it; it is game over. So you are going to have small town operators which they always had to rely on the past to get product out basically being left with a completely unaffordable product, which means they cannot pick up the passing trade, which means they are not a viable concern, which means they close down. When they close down, that is yet another service that gets removed from these areas.
I know this is an issue that does not ring bells. It is not going to claim the collective psyche of the Australian people like other issues. It is maybe a little bit dry. But the issue comes down to this—it will affect us all in the long term. In the long term, once there is vertical control, not only will you extract a greater margin on the product you sell—that is, not only will you put up the price of fuel—but you will have a commercial and corporate obligation to do exactly that. You have an obligation to get the best return for your shareholders. So, if there is the capacity for you to raise the price, that is exactly what you are going to do. Of course that is exactly what is going to happen here, and it is exactly what happened in the UK. But we all think there is something remarkable about Australia: ‘No, it’s not going to happen here. It happens everywhere else but it won’t happen here.’ Of course it will happen here. Look at the history and ask, ‘What was one of the greatest mechanisms of forcing a reduction in prices?’ Lo and behold, it was the independents. What are we going to do? We are going to take the independents out of the market.
In the short term it always comes to back to this: the purpose of the economy is not to create the lowest price product for the end consumer, but that is a consequence of a good economy and it has happened here; the purpose of the economy is to create the greatest connection between the wealth of our nation and its people. It does that primarily through small business, primarily by giving the people of Australia the ability to buy and sell a product in a retail fashion, and that is being lost in this nation. We have 73 per cent of the retail market controlled by Coles and Woolworths. They are the largest outlets for liquor, the largest holders of gambling licences and the largest retailers of fuel. These are two organisations. This is also an exacerbation of that process.
It is an issue that might be dry, it might be about a regulatory instrument and it might not have claimed the Australian psyche, but it is extremely important to where we go as a nation. We have heard, and I agree, that this would never be tolerated in the United States; there is no way in the world. They have antitrust legislation. The bastion of free market democracy would not tolerate this. We would, but they would not, and there is a reason for that—they believe that the American people have a right to participate in the wealth of America. It is fundamental. If you read Jefferson, he will tell you all about it. But we are moving away from that.
So there are other sides to this debate beyond the dry and dogmatic, beyond saying: ‘This is just a change in a regulatory instrument. It does not mean very much. It’s not that important. I don’t know what Senator Joyce is banging on about.’ There is a clear outcome for this and a clear reason. In this chamber we have to grab the agenda for small business again. We have to recognise the fact that they are not going to be knocking down the doors of this place. They do not have the capacity to do that. Today the Motor Trades of Australia body passed a unanimous resolution with the 130,000 members supporting that we find some protection for them, supporting that this regulatory instrument in its current form is a bad outcome for them.
It is interesting where the inspiration for this came from. I remember during the first campaign driving up the road at Gin Gin, I think it was, near Bundaberg, and stopping at a small petrol station to grab a sandwich. We introduced ourselves to the owners and said g’day to them—trying to collect their votes, as you all know you try to do. The owner almost jumped the counter just to explain the absolute frustration of his life, the fact that the corporate service station up the road was able to sell fuel at a price he could not possibly buy it at. Yet this is supposed to be a free market, an unregulated market. They were being forced out of a job. I thought about that. You can just walk out the door, think, ‘I’m not going to get his vote,’ and forget about it or you can try to follow the issue through and try to progress the issue. You can have it stored in the back of your mind that this is something that, if you ever got the chance to deal with it, you would deal with. Today is the chance to deal with that issue. I imagine I am going to fail, but the point is you give it your best shot and have a go.
I suppose it will come down to the vote. I implore people just to think about this. Think about this if you think about regional towns. Think about this if you think about small business. Think about this if you think about how our nation is developing—whether we are disenfranchising the Australian people from the wealth of their own nation, whether we are creating the overcentralisation and greater corporatisation of our nation, whether we are creating a mechanism where we are all going to end up as middle managers in business but never owning the business, whether we are creating a nation where what you achieve in life is to go up three or four floors in the building in which you work but you are never going to own the building. If you want to own the building then you have to create the environment for small business to prosper.
My colleagues, that is the issue and one item that we need to address. If we had section 46 on the table, then I suppose you could let this through. But it is not on the table. There is no prospect that we can see for that coming out. We are having the agenda run by people who are not in favour of small business.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL MARKETING SITES AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2006 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,30,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-06-15,"—by leave—I apologise to the Senate for missing my place in the speakers queue. I would just like to congratulate Senator Joyce for the effort and research that he has put into this disallowance motion. The Greens support the position that he has put, and we do so for a number of reasons. The first one, which is highly significant, is in terms of procedure. It is totally inappropriate parliamentary procedure to bring in regulations before the parliament has had a chance to deal with the legislation that will govern petroleum retail into the future. It is bad process.
It was interesting to me that, in the energy efficiency opportunities consultation process, big business—the 200 largest energy users in the country—were not prepared to see the legislation come into the parliament until they had seen the regulations. But here, when the boot is on the other foot, big business is very happy to see the regulation come in before there has been any debate on the principle concerning the repeal bills and the proposed oil code. I am not prepared to do that. I think it is grossly unfair to small business in this country that we would have a situation where regulations pre-empt the decision of the parliament, because nobody can know at this point what the decision of the parliament is going to be. Secondly, the effect of this regulation would be to remove the four major oil companies from the provisions of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act, as I indicated, before the legislation and regulations are in. I understand why they want to do it. I understand that the entry of the supermarkets has created a perverse effect with regard to the petroleum retail industry. But that is not an excuse for dealing with the situation in this way.
The Greens will consider the repeal bill and the proposed oil code in the future provided that the government strengthens section 46 of the Trade Practices Act so that there is clear evidence of the way in which the government intends to protect small and independent retailers. We certainly take the point that, as Senator Joyce has outlined and as the Motor Trades Association has said, the service station operators looking at the proposed code as it now stands believe it is defective because it will not ensure a level playing field allowing small service station operators to be able to compete fairly in the market with the large supermarkets and oil companies.
Finally, I support Senator Joyce’s interest in maintaining a distribution network for alternative fuels into the future. He is right in saying that independent operators are our best hope in that regard. We know that 61 per cent of greenhouse gases are generated from the transport sector. I think there is a very important role for alternative fuels to play, not only in rural regeneration and jobs but in meeting our greenhouse gas emission targets. I am as keen as anyone to see a distribution network maintain jobs in rural areas and for small businesses to maintain their position in the market.
To that end, the Greens support the disallowance. As I indicated, we will consider the repeal bill and the proposed oil code into the future, because we certainly do not like the fact that the supermarkets have 73 per cent of the market. The situation as it is is unsatisfactory. We do want to support small business. We do want to support the roll-out of alternative fuels. We want to make sure that fairness is the principle that operates and not just effective competition for the majors in the retail petroleum trade.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL MARKETING SITES AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2006 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,30,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-15,"—I would like to seek leave to speak to the matter. I was also caught by an unanticipated collapse in the speakers list.
Leave granted.
—In other circumstances I possibly would have let things slide, but I did particularly want to put a few things on the record from a personal point of view and specifically as a senator for Queensland. I also am prepared to support this disallowance of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), although not for all of the same reasons that have been put forward by Senator Milne and Senator Joyce. I think there are other factors and I take a different view on some of the issues involved in this matter.
It is a difficult issue and it is, as I think Senator Stephens said, a situation of the government’s making, and it is an unfortunate one where we have regulation in place in anticipation of legislation repealing the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act but the bill to do that is not before the Senate. It is still before the House of Representatives and indeed, as I understand it, it is not even likely to be debated by the House of Representatives before the parliament rises next week.
I could see the rationale if there were a range of leases coming up. A brief exemption from the cap under the existing act in anticipation of the bill being debated might then be tenable because it does put BP—and it is predominantly BP we are talking about—in a difficult situation. It is the only oil major at the moment, as I understand it, which is operating at the cap of allowable sites under the existing act. But when the legislation is so far off in the distance it does make it difficult. You basically have a regulation that negates the existing law indefinitely. If there was a sunset clause in the existing regulation, then it may be more acceptable. We would all know how long we had before the legislation had to be debated. But there is no sunset clause. That is a serious problem that the government themselves have created.
The fact that this regulation exempts or makes the existing act not operational in respect of the cap has an extra problematic aspect in that the oil code is not operational as yet. That has not been gazetted so even the protections, such as they are, under the new oil code—and there are a range of opinions about how effective the new oil code may be—do not apply as the new oil code is not yet in place. That also creates a problem, particularly in terms of the very serious issue of subverting the will of the parliament, even if it was the parliament of the 1980s that passed these acts back in the Fraser era.
Nonetheless, I want to indicate that I also support the intent of my colleague Senator Murray and Senator Joyce—and others who have mentioned it—about the desirability of bringing on some of the changes of the Trade Practices Act that were reflected in recommendations of a previous Senate committee report—recommendations that were also supported by government senators. The committee was chaired by Senator Brandis as I recall. I believe the government have indicated their preparedness or their support for a number of those recommendations—indeed most of them—but as I seem to find myself saying repeatedly in this place about a range of issues, it is one thing to say you support a matter and it is another thing to actually do something about it. We have not seen any sign at all of movement from the Treasurer’s office about any changes coming forward. It is a problematic situation when we have a regulation that links to an act that has not appeared, which in turn relates to concerns that many in this place have regarding recommended reforms of the Trade Practices Act which also have not appeared yet. Unfortunately, these are not all coming together at once. They are coming together in different stages and we cannot see what the final total outcome might be. That is the reason it is appropriate to support this disallowance at this time.
However, I want to say a couple of other things. It is important to emphasise the role that the major oil companies can play and, indeed, to some extent are already playing in the roll-out of alternative fuels—biofuels and ethanol. I do not believe that it will be a range of small independent operators that are likely to be able to really break the back of getting ethanol or other biofuels into the market in a big way; it will need to have the involvement of one or more of the major oil companies. As I mentioned before, it is BP that is affected by this regulation. It also happens to be BP that has done the most that I am aware of—I am not saying that others have not done anything—in relation to producing and rolling out ethanol in recent years. In my own state of Queensland, BP has a refinery in Brisbane at Bulwer Island and BP also owns a significant number of sites in Brisbane, where I live. While I appreciate the importance of having competition in regional areas and the importance of trying to maintain petrol prices that are reasonable, it is also important to have an effectively operating market in the major cities as well. It does need to be acknowledged that if major oil companies want to go further, and BP for example wants to take biofuels further, then market reform is likely to be essential for them to be able to do so.
The Democrats have a record as strong as anybody in supporting small business. But the fact is that small business and independent operators in the petrol station field have been declining dramatically under the existing system for many years and they are particularly being crunched at the moment, as we all know, by Coles and Woolies. They are doing that in conjunction with some of the other major oil companies who have basically just gone around the existing act. The fact is the existing act’s time has passed us by. The market has changed so much that the act is not functioning. Ironically, it is allowing people like Coles and Woolies to exert unfair competitive practices and preventing the oil companies from providing competition to those retailers. Coles and Woolies are doing quite well on their own in eliminating independent players from the market wherever they think there is a market opportunity to do so; where they do not, they will leave them alone.
So a huge decline in the number of independent retailers has occurred under the existing system. It is likely to continue to occur wherever there is an opportunity for the major retailers to maintain pressure on them. Whether or not you have one or two more oil companies, such as BP, in there is not likely to make any difference. I do think it is important that independents have a level playing field, and the existing system does not provide that. That is why Trade Practices Act reforms are important and, I would also say, why a good oil code—I will not pass opinion on whether the oil code that is coming in is good or not—is important.
I have heard all the talk about small retailers and independent retailers being important to maintain lower petrol prices. If we are talking about protecting small retailers and doing everything we can to keep them in business no matter what, then—sorry to suddenly sound like an economic rationalist—it will probably actually mean higher petrol prices. That may be a good thing from an environmental point of view, I hasten to add, but I do think we need to be realistic about what the impact of what we are doing will be.
I did want to indicate that wider aspect of the debate, particularly because the regulations do specifically affect my own state of Queensland quite significantly. I know that Senator Joyce, along with the Democrats, has been pushing biofuels and ethanol very strongly. Indeed, I have to say the Democrats have been doing so for much longer, going way back even before I was in this place to the early 1990s, when very significant initiatives were introduced, because of agreements reached with the Democrats, to provide assistance to starting up ethanol in this country—assistance, I might add, that was completely annihilated by the Howard government when they first came into office in 1996 and totally undid that work. Now we have to start up again because of the actions of the Howard government, having lost 10 years and, as Senator Murray said, with $25 million down the drain. We lost a significant start-up in developing an ethanol industry because of the Howard government’s actions 10 years ago. So our record on biofuels and ethanol is second to none in this place.
I do believe that the major companies have a significant role to play in expanding the use of biofuels. This is not a promotional spiel for BP, but BP have not just made nice sounds about this but done something, unlike the Howard government. They have developed a roll-out of ethanol. They have already sold significant amounts of their E10 blend, through their own service stations in Australia. If they are able to roll that out through a larger number of stations through market reform, then that will lead to an expansion of the availability of ethanol. BP have also—and this is already on the public record—announced that they will be creating biofuels at their Bulwer Island refinery in Brisbane. It is a biofuel made out of tallow, so it actually creates a bit of a problem for me as a vegetarian: I do not like the idea of pouring dead cows into my petrol tank. I will not get into an argument about what should and should not be defined as a biofuel, but this is nonetheless a biofuel: it is renewable and you can put it in a tank and run your car on it. Vegetarians around the country will have ethical crises as a consequence, but that is another matter.
—It puts a tiger in your tank!
—A dead cow in your tank is not quite a tiger, Senator Murray, but I suppose it is getting there! So, significant amounts of biofuel are being developed at the Bulwer Island refinery in my home town of Brisbane. The CSR refinery at Sarina, near Mackay in Queensland, has a significant ethanol contract, as does the BP plant in Perth, which happens to be in my colleague Senator Murray’s home state.
Again, on a side issue, BP is the company that has produced Opal fuel, which is a very effective replacement fuel for remote communities to combat petrol sniffing. There are also market risks and price risks involved in developing that fuel, and there are cost issues in expanding its production. You cannot divorce those factors from the constraints that are placed on BP by the current inefficiencies of the existing sites legislation.
I say all that to put the debate in a broader context and to signal to others who, like me, have an interest in increasing the use of biofuels and ethanol, particularly in Queensland, that there is a direct link between the major players, who have to have a role in that, and current laws, which actually impede that. There are also related issues, as I stated at the start of my speech, such as the lack of progress with regard to Trade Practices Act reform. That is a much wider issue than just assisting small business and independent operators of petrol stations; it is important across the board. I completely understand and support the attempt to use this legislation and this situation to try to increase the pressure on the government to back up their words by taking some action for a change in this area—action for which there is widespread support and, I might say, almost universal support, at least verbally, from people on all sides of this chamber.
The primary legislation is still in the House of Representatives and has not yet been debated. If this disallowance motion is defeated, which I suspect it will be—just—then that still leaves us in this undesirable situation where the existing law is basically being negated via regulation which has no sunset clause on it. The oil code is not even operational, and there is even less incentive for the government to move on its repeal of the sites act, let alone the Trade Practices Act. That is an undesirable situation for pretty much everybody, whether it is the independent service station operators, the major oil companies or anybody else, because nobody knows what is going to happen. It is all just going to sit there pending, hanging over everybody, and it is not going to be resolved. That will create a situation of uncertainty for all players, and I think that is undesirable.
I have indicated here, on the record, my wider views about some of these issues. If the government would show some genuineness on this issue and even progress debate on the primary legislation and move it forward, then I might have a stronger belief that they are genuine about that they are doing. We also need to see some movement from the Treasurer, of course. From experience on a whole range of issues, that is an area where movement seems to be difficult to get. I do not want to add yet another element to the debate but, as I mentioned earlier today, this is a Treasurer who was willing to leave major reforms to choice of superannuation completely off to one side and not progress it at all for years purely because the government were not interested in moving at all to address discrimination within superannuation laws against same-sex couples. We have a Treasurer with a record of not even being willing to progress his own policy initiatives in a major area like choice of superannuation purely because of stubbornness about the important but nonetheless much smaller issue of removing some discrimination. So I do not hold my breath for movement from the Treasurer on this, but I really do hope that he does move.
With regard to that issue, we all have an interest in trying to maintain at least a fair playing field for small operators—the mum and dad operators, as Senator Joyce called them. I guess after today’s vote we will not have dad and dad operators or mum and mum operators; we are stuck with only mum and dad operators. But it is important to ensure that all small businesses get a fair go. As I said, the way the market has developed, a lot of them have been pushed out of business as it is, and that situation and those pressures on them are going to continue regardless of what happens. That is an existing situation and a reality that people have to deal with, but the continuing uncertainty about the future in this whole area is a problem for everybody from all sides of the debate. It is problem that only the government can resolve, and they can resolve it by actually doing something for a change, rather than just using a mechanism like this regulation to circumvent everything and make no progress on the core issues involved.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Joyce’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL MARKETING SITES AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2006 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,30,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2006-06-15,"—I am in the middle of my contribution to this disallowance motion moved by Senator Wong. Before I continue on from where I left off yesterday before the debate was interrupted, I could probably draw a comparison between this disallowance motion and the vote that we just took on the disallowance motion moved by Senator Joyce.
Senator Joyce argued that there was a fundamental injustice in expecting small business to be able to negotiate appropriately and effectively with big business. He recognised that there was an imbalance of power in those relationships and that the small operators, the people with lesser bargaining power, needed some protection from the government. Labor supports Senator Joyce on that because Labor believes that there is imbalance in the power relationships in contractual arrangements. But the same principle applies in the Work Choices regulations and the Work Choices bill. If he is concerned about the power imbalance of a small business compared to a big business, he should also be concerned about the power imbalance of a worker trying to negotiate with big business or a small business. The principle is exactly the same.
An individual worker, like a small business, does not have equal bargaining power when negotiating with big business or a worker does not have equal negotiating power when they have to negotiate as an individual with an employer. So I invite Senator Joyce on the same principle that Labor joined him on, which Labor supports, to join with Labor, the Democrats and the Greens when we move to the other side of the house for the vote to support Labor’s disallowance motion on the Work Choices regulations.
The people who are going to be hurt most in the initial stages of Work Choices are low-income earners and families in particular. I noticed Senator Fielding also joined with Labor, Senator Joyce and the minor parties on the previous disallowance motion—again, I expect for the same principle: that there is an imbalance and the mums and dads’ businesses, which Senator Joyce passionately talked about—and quite rightly so—will also be affected. That is the same proposition that Labor puts before the Senate on the disallowance of these bills: families and family members will be hurt and they will be hurt significantly by the Work Choices legislation and the regulations that underpin that legislation. So I extend the same invitation to Senator Fielding to join with Labor and the other parties in supporting this disallowance for the same principal reasons that we all supported the previous disallowance.
Yesterday when I was interrupted I was in the middle of a quote from Justice Giudice, who is the president of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That was following on from a number of examples I was giving about the damage that Work Choices would do to Australian workers. I will continue on from where I left off. Justice Giudice says:
This will be accompanied by a slowdown in the rate of growth of minimum wages—that is what the Fair Pay Commission is for. If those things are going to occur, they will probably have to be accompanied by a reduction in social welfare otherwise the incentive to work will reduce.
I do not want to leave you in any doubt that these are very significant changes.
He also said:
The absence of protection for collective bargaining rights was a political area of real conflict and real difficulty.
Of course, he, like the 151 academics I talked about and everybody else, apart from the vested interests of employers, said the same things about the impact of the Work Choices bill and the underpinning regulations, which Labor is seeking to disallow today.
This legislation is unfair and it achieves this unfairness through three areas—and I am not sure whether I am going to have the time to go into the detail of all of them. It restricts the ability of workers to collectively organise to try and bring back the balance of negotiating power with employers to create a more even balance. It introduces Australian workplace agreements, which have priority now in terms of agreement making in this country in industrial relations. It pits an individual worker against an employer. We say that that is an unfair balance. It does not give workers the proper ability to negotiate on equal terms with employers with respect to their employment conditions. The third way it achieves this unfairness is by the removal of unfair dismissal protection. Regardless of any opportunity that you may have to try and negotiate improved wages and conditions without protection from dismissal for unfair reasons, you become incredibly vulnerable in the workplace. AWAs are nothing more than a means to cut wages and conditions and undermine decency and fairness in our workplaces.
 The choice that the government likes to champion is no choice at all. The choice workers in this country now have under Work Choices is the choice to take it or to leave it. The Prime Minister’s response to that choice is: if workers do not like it, they can simply go and find another job. That is not a real opportunity for most working Australians. That is not a real choice. People need to work. People need to hang on to their jobs. When they are confronted with a choice of take it or leave it in respect of AWAs that strip away their so-called protected award conditions, AWAs that may give them no wage increase during the life of the agreement and AWAs that in fact may even cut their existing wages, they have the choice of: do you want a job or not? People in regional areas, people with families who have to make mortgage payments, people with kids who have to be put through school and people with bills to pay on a week-to-week basis, sometimes a day-to-day basis, do not have the luxury of saying, ‘Well, I won’t take that job. I will simply leave it and hunt around for another job.’ That is no choice for Australian workers, but that is how these regulations underpin this evil and pernicious legislation, which will drive down the wages of millions of working Australians and damage family structures in this country.
How are workers expected to negotiate their own terms and conditions of employment? We have workers at all sorts of different levels. Workers, as individuals, do not have, as we know, equal bargaining power with employers. There is a basic inequity in the bargaining relationship. The capacity of people to negotiate varies across the spectrum. We have people of varying ages. How do we expect people out of school negotiating their employment conditions at their first job, when they have had no experience in the workforce, to adequately negotiate with a multinational company that might have an army of professional human resource managers who negotiate industrial agreements? People with varying education standards—with low levels of education or with very little English—will have to try to negotiate employment conditions by themselves. Employers have the resources of human resource management and the resources and the ability to actually say, ‘Take it or leave it’ and produce an agreement to put in front of people. We have people who will not have the knowledge or the understanding of these laws, these complicated laws, which now run to 1,800 pages of legal jargon and technical detail. We are expecting workers across the spectrum to have a full grasp of that sort of legislation. It is a ridiculous scenario, but this government would have us believe it is a fair and equitable system. Well, it is not and we know it is not and no-one, apart from the vested interests of employers and this government, says it is a good system. No-one else says it at all.
Work Choices and these underpinning regulations that come into effect on 27 March have already led to a massive diminution of working conditions. We found that out in the estimates hearings just recently. For the first month after the introduction of Work Choices, what did we find? We were told that 6,340 workplace agreements were lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate during that month, covering 10,257 employees. In the snapshot of the first month—before employers had really had an opportunity to get into these laws—the initial results were all bad; they were all down. What did we see? Sixteen per cent of all AWAs removed every single so-called protected award condition. Every AWA removed at least one so-called protected award condition. In regard to the three most commonly excluded protected award conditions, we saw that 64 per cent of AWAs removed annual leave loading from agreements; 63 per cent of all AWAs removed penalty rates; and, in terms of people who are required to work shiftwork, 52 per cent of agreements that had shiftwork provisions in them removed shift loading penalties. So people are working whatever hours across the board and they are getting no shift penalty loadings—no reward.
Some people in the government would have us believe that you have to agree to sign away those protected award conditions. This is where the government fails to understand the basic reality in the workplace. Do you really expect anyone to believe that people have been happy to sign away all these protected award conditions? Of course that is not what is happening. What is happening is that agreements are being put in front of people on a take it or leave it basis with those provisions already removed. It is not about agreement. Sure, the government will say, ‘The worker has to sign on to it.’ Again, that demonstrates its absolute ignorance about what really happens in the workplace, because people are not willingly negotiating away these conditions; they are being told, ‘Take the job on these conditions: sign here or go elsewhere.’ That is the choice that is being put in front of Australian workers and that is what the statistics show is happening.
The government will say, ‘Yes, but some of those conditions might have been negotiated away for more money.’ What have we seen? We have seen in the case of Spotlight, for instance, that penalty rates were negotiated away for 2c more an hour. It may be true. We are not able to break down some of those statistics. Some of the agreements may give even a slightly higher wage increase for trading away your penalty rates. I do not know. That information will come out over time. But what I can also tell you—and this was confirmed by the Office of the Employment Advocate—is that 22 per cent of all AWAs provided for no wage increase at all. Do you really think people are willingly entering into agreements that remove their penalty rates, remove their shift loadings and do not even provide for all public holidays? In fact, only 59 per cent of AWAs provided for gazetted public holidays. I remember Senator Joyce feeling very strongly about this issue. Only 59 per cent of AWAs signed after Work Choices in the month of April actually provided for gazetted public holidays. This is a disgraceful outcome. It is only the tip of the iceberg.
This is the opportunity that employers have been waiting for to rip off wages and conditions. They and the government have been running this mantra that this sort of flexibility will improve productivity. What a nonsense! The government do not seem to understand the difference between profitability and productivity. How does removing penalty rates for a hospitality worker increase productivity? If they serve the same amount of meals, if they have to carry the same amount of plates and if they have to do the same amount of work, how does cutting out their shift loadings, annual leave loading and penalty rates increase productivity? It does not; it increases profitability. We are happy for companies to be profitable. We want companies to be profitable, but we do not want those increases in profits to be at the expense of the pockets, the wages and conditions, of ordinary working Australians who are mostly in the low-paid, low-skilled areas. That is the picture that is being painted here by the Office of the Employment Advocate’s own figures that we identified in Senate estimates.
None of these outcomes surprise me. It is what everyone who has any basic understanding about workplace relations predicted would happen. It is what happens when workers are subject to duress. It is duress that is being applied in the workplace. This applies not only to new employees who are applying for a job and get presented with an agreement which they have no input into negotiating and who are told: ‘Sign here; take it or leave it,’ but also to existing employees, who are also being put under duress. How do we know that? Because we see it. The reports come out. They are publicised in the papers. People ring us. People ring their unions. It is well known. We have seen people being sacked for smirking. If you are in a workplace and your employer wants to take away your penalty rates, annual leave loading and shift loading, they present you with a new AWA. It does not matter whether there is an existing agreement in place or not. You get presented with an AWA and you say, ‘I don’t really want to take a wage cut, thanks very much.’ The next thing you know, you can be sacked for any reason as long as it is not an unlawful discriminatory reason, which is a small, narrow group of events based around discrimination. You get told: ‘If you want to continue to work here and if you want a wage increase, you will sign this AWA and, if you resist, I will find some reason to get rid of you whenever I like, whether it be for smirking, chewing gum or because I don’t like the look of you. I can simply sack you and you have no legal recourse.’",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS REGULATIONS 2006</title>,<title>Motion for disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,31,1
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-06-15,"—I rise to speak in support of Labor’s disallowance motion for the regulations to this evil and disgusting act. The many reasons that these regulations should be disallowed have been touched on in contributions from senators on the issue of industrial relations in recent days. In fact, Senator McGauran spent a large part of a speech on Tuesday defending the act these regulations have been drafted under and chiding me about my use of what he called ‘all the old language of Labor’. He then went on to talk about me and my cudgel. While I am somewhat disconcerted by Senator McGauran’s interest in my cudgel, I am more than happy to take to him with it.
Senator McGauran is the star of one of my favourite political cartoons by David Rowe. I want to paint the picture for you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The setting is in Collins Street, Melbourne. Far away in the distance, a farmer can be seen calling out after lost stock. ‘Julian! Julian!’ he cries. Back on Collins Street, the Treasurer stands clearly uncomfortable and somewhat disgusted. An eager pig wearing an Akubra with ‘McGauran’ written on the side is vigorously adjoined to the Treasurer’s leg in a most unseemly way. I imagine Senator McGauran choked on his latte as he read the Financial Review that day.
When Senator McGauran finally got around to talking about something other than me and my cudgel, he asked rhetorically: ‘Why would we’—the Howard government—‘jeopardise a 16.8 per cent rise in wages?’ I know Senator McGauran’s sheltered and privileged upbringing has given him a limited understanding of the real world, but the answer to that question is simple. It is because the Howard government hates working people, especially those who dare to stand together in union in the face of the greed and mismanagement of their bosses. The Howard government not only threatened the rise in wages they pretend to be responsible for but they also outright opposed these pay raises at every step of the way.
Over its 10 years in office, the Howard government has opposed every minimum wage outcome awarded by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. If the Howard government had had its way, the 1.6 million Australian employees on the minimum wage would be $44 a week, or $2,300 a year, worse off. That is the Howard government’s guarantee—that is the Howard government’s record. That is why the Howard government removed the ability of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to set the minimum wage and why these regulations, and the substantive act the regulations are drafted under, give this power to the new so-called Fair Pay Commission.
The only reason I can imagine why the Howard government would want to change the way the minimum wage is set is that it thinks this new body will be closer to the government’s low-wage agenda than the AIRC was. Des Moore, the Director of the Institute for Private Enterprise, was right when, in a speech on 3 December 2005, he said:
This new legislation is shot full of contradictions that, on the one hand, purport to “allow Australia’s employers and employees the freedom and the choice to sit down and work out the arrangements that best suit them” but, on the other hand, continues to severely constrain that freedom.
The Work Choices act and regulations contain a list of prohibited content. Apparently, Australian companies need to be protected from the possibility that they might want to make an agreement with their workers on some matters. The regulations prohibit the provision of payroll deduction facilities for union dues. I did not realise that Australian companies needed the Howard government to legislate to protect them from the possibility that they might want to agree to provide their workforces with payroll deductions for union fees. I did not realise that Australian companies needed the Howard government to legislate to prevent them from agreeing to send their workforce to union training.
The CFMEU, in my home state of Western Australia, set up the Construction Skills Training Centre in Welshpool. It is very highly regarded by its clients and provides quality training to workers. But, apparently, Australian companies need to be protected from themselves, just in case they might have the strange idea that training centres like the Construction Skills Training Centre in Welshpool might assist their workforce to be safer and more productive. The Howard government has sent a very clear message to the companies of Australia: ‘You can choose to bargain but only on our terms. You can choose to bargain on those terms we want you to bargain on, but you cannot choose to bargain about issues we prohibit.’
Senator McGauran might be uncomfortable with my ‘old language of Labor’, but I suspect that is because he is only comfortable with the 19th century language of the master-servant relationship—language such as, ‘I’ll take tea in the drawing room, James,’ or, ‘Jeeves, saddle my steed and fetch me my riding crop.’ The likes of Senator McGauran are only comfortable when they have someone meek and submissive to order around, and that is why they hate proud and independent trade unionists so much. These regulations are about giving bosses the riding crop to whip their workers into line. That is why I oppose them and that is why they need to be disallowed.

Question put:
That the motion (Senator Joyce’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL MARKETING SITES AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2006 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,32,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-06-15,"—The Greens will be supporting this motion to disallow the Workplace Relations Regulations 2006. In our contributions to the debate when the Work Choices bill passed through the Senate last year, we made clear our principal concerns.
We asked the government to provide evidence that these reforms would increase productivity, which it could not do satisfactorily. We looked to the statistics on industrial disputes, but these showed that such actions had been falling steadily for decades. We produced research that suggested that young people in particular would find themselves engaged in a highly unequal bargaining position with their employers.
We were particularly concerned by research undertaken on the impacts of the so-called reforms undertaken in Western Australia by the Court government—reforms that depressed the minimum wage and made it less than in the rest of the country, disadvantaged women and low-skilled workers, and accelerated the race to the bottom. These dubious reforms were repealed by Labor after they attained government in 2001. By most conventional measures, the state economy is now one of the leaders of the nation.
We suspected that the federal government’s real agenda was to drive down the minimum wage and make it easier for companies to treat their workforces more like disposable components. It looked as though the less industrial bargaining power you had in this brave new world of Work Choices the harder life was about to get for you. The government insisted that we had nothing to worry about and pushed the bill through this place with a minimum of scrutiny and very little tolerance for any reasoned debate or amendment by the minor parties. Of course, that was with the exception of Senator Joyce’s amendment to save Christmas—and that turned out to be a farce, didn’t it?
Seven months later, we are unfortunately seeing many of our predictions being borne out. The new laws are being used punitively against workers by some businesses. Other businesses are being forced, through competitive forces, to take what they probably consider to be unsavoury measures to cut wages and dismiss workers. In other words, we are starting the race to the bottom, just as we saw in Western Australia. During the debate last time, some depressing cases from Western Australia were articulated, particularly cases involving the cleaning industry and security guards.
I emphasise that we do not believe that all businesses wish to treat their workforces in this way, but already a number of businesses are treating their workforces with contempt. The media is full of stories of workers who have been subjected to what I believe are very discriminatory and unfair practices. We warned of a race to the bottom, and by golly it has started.
We can now move beyond predictions and theories and look at what is happening on the ground. As other senators have pointed out during this debate, the results of the first month’s survey of contracts examined by the Office of the Employment Advocate are very clear and depressing. Every contract surveyed has abolished at least one award condition. One in six have abolished all award conditions apart from the mandatory five. Sixty per cent have wiped out leave loading, and 63 per cent have abolished penalty rates. Right up until the release of this survey, Kevin Andrews was insisting that the vast majority of new contracts would not affect penalty rates and overtime.
Statistics have been described as ‘human beings with the tears wiped off’. We now have a number of very clear case studies showing how Work Choices is being applied on the ground. The first to feel the impacts were the workers at the Cowra abattoir. On 30 and 31 March this year, 29 workers were sacked. They were invited to reapply for 20 of the jobs they had just lost, at a wage cut of $180 a week. The Office of Workplace Services, OWS, began an investigation which Kevin Andrews suggested was proof that there were still protections for workers.
As the first cab off the rank, the blowtorch of media and—very gladly—union scrutiny was applied, and the company backed down, despite later confirmation that they had been fully within their rights. At the end of May, a copy of the OWS report was leaked to the media, and it established once and for all that, under Work Choices, it is entirely lawful to sack workers and rehire them on lower pay and lesser conditions. A handful of ministers were the only people who were surprised that this could occur.
Workers in other cases can hardly expect this kind of profile. Most cases will slip under the radar, which is presumably exactly what the government is hoping for. The key message is that what happened at Cowra was not an abuse of the Work Choices law, or a mischievous application, or an accident. The laws are being used precisely as the government intended.
Around 400,000 people leave study and enter the Australian workforce every year. Next year’s young entrants to the workforce are going to find that they are playing on a field that is very much tilted against them. The no disadvantage test is gone, and they will be pressured into accepting lesser conditions and lower pay just to get a toehold in the workforce. This can be as simple as demanding that young workers pay for their own uniforms. In Western Australia there are cases where young people have been forced to work basically for free for five or six weeks while they pay for their work uniform. This is in part-time positions.
Unions South Australia has reported that a third of young people are pressured to work unpaid overtime, and up to 43 per cent are pressured to work while sick. These are people without training in industrial law or negotiating skills. They have been abandoned by this government. Senators may be aware of the case of the 16-year-old worker in a juice bar who was made redundant one day, when her employer went into administration, and was offered her old job back, by the new owner, the next day. The new AWA amounted to a $5 an hour pay cut. Instead of rolling over, she contacted her union, and the government’s own Office of Workplace Services stepped in. Ultimately the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission ruled that the company had acted unlawfully. This is just the tip of the iceberg. How many kids out there would just knuckle under if they were told that they had to cop a pay cut or go and look for another job? I suspect that most young people do not know their rights and are not experienced in the big wide world, and they would not have sought that sort of redress.
We also have strong concerns about how women are being disadvantaged by these laws. In the government’s single-minded drive to sign everyone up to AWAs, it seems to have missed the fact that, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data from May 2004, non-managerial workers on AWAs were earning two per cent less than their coworkers on registered collective agreements. For women on AWAs, hourly earnings were some 11 per cent less than for women on collective agreements.
The Coffs Harbour Spotlight workers were in the media this month, when they were offered a 2c an hour pay rise in exchange for shift penalties and other benefits worth $90 a week. Those are the kinds of choices we are talking about in Work Choices. There is a lot to be said about how the government has handled the Spotlight scandal—because it is a scandal. It has positively celebrated the result as a win for the economy. The fact is that most of the Spotlight workers are women. Most of the people in retail, clerical and community services are women. Women are more likely to be employed in these lower paid segments of the workforce—precisely the sectors that will be hardest hit by the regulations we are confronted with today.
ABS figures from April of this year show that, across all industries, women still earn 20 per cent less than men in Australia. Over the last 20 years, improvements to the award system have slowly been closing this gap. In gutting the award system and instituting the law of the jungle, the government is putting even these meagre improvements at risk.
One area which has attracted very little attention is the fact that, by making the details of employment contracts private matters, we will soon have no way of tracking sex discrimination in pay and conditions. I strongly suspect that Work Choices will act to widen the gender pay gap, but I do not see how the ABS is going to be able to follow the trends if the terms and conditions within AWAs remain a strictly private matter.
On 1 April this year it was reported that a single mother was given 10 minutes to leave her child-care job of nearly five years. No reasons were given and, under these laws, no reasons were necessary. The child-care centre in question had fewer than 100 employees, so job security has gone out the window in that workplace.
The media is littered with these sorts of terribly sad human stories. There is the case of the office worker in a doctor’s surgery who was sacked on the spot for not immediately signing up to an agreement presented to her. It would have forced her to work in a different office than the one she had been working in for 20 years. Before she had even been given the opportunity to query the new arrangements, she had been fired. A week earlier, it would have been unlawful. But, with Work Choices coming into effect, she had no choice in the new Work Choices environment.
When is it going to sink in, even for a government obsessed with economic rationalism, that these personal stories have huge implications for the economy? People with no job security are less likely to apply for or receive a home loan. People without job security delay major purchases and delay starting families. In its zest to work through the big business shopping list that it is obviously working through and ticking off—‘Done that!’—and trading it off for a hugely insecure and politically powerless workforce, the government is undermining everything it claims to be working towards: a stronger economy. These sorts of effects will ultimately destabilise the economy.
The government appears to have not learned a thing in the seven months since it rammed Work Choices through the parliament. The strategy is clearly to simply crash through and hope for the best, and try and persuade people that their personal hardship and insecurity is necessary for the good of the economy. The Greens’ stand on industrial relations is based on the simple fact that the economy is there to serve people—and not the other way around. These regulations are putting the finishing touches on a process that should never have been set in motion. For this reason we do not support these regulations.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS REGULATIONS 2006</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,33,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2006-06-15,"—In closing the debate, there are a number of matters I want to remind the chamber about before we vote on these regulations. The first is that we have the opportunity to consider, when we are voting on these, precisely what some of the known impacts of Work Choices, the government’s extreme industrial relations legislation, have been since it has been enacted. We know, for example, that the majority of Australian workplace agreements entered into since this legislation came into effect abolish penalty rates. I think all of them abolish some of the protected conditions. We know, for example, that Australian workers have been asked to trade away penalty rates, leave loading, shift loadings and rostering certainty for the princely sum of 2c an hour—entirely legal under this government’s legislation. We also know that it is legal, according to advice from the government’s own department in the context of a highly publicised case, that it is legal for an employer to dismiss people and then re-engage others on lower wages and conditions.
We also know that AWAs—I think it is the 2004 or 2005 figures, but I might stand corrected—have demonstrably reduced the wage increases offered to those workers under them. Particularly, we are concerned about working women in this country. On the most recent figures, non-managerial female employees earned on average 11 per cent less when they were on an Australian workplace agreement.
A great many things that a great many people said would come to pass have started to come to pass since this legislation has been in place. We have an opportunity today, when voting on these regulations, to bear in mind exactly what is happening, particularly to lower paid workers and employees with little bargaining power, and, more importantly, just how invasive and intrusive this legislation is and the extent to which it is intended to drive down wages and conditions in Australia.
Senator Siewert raised the issue of the cleaning industry. I want to talk very briefly about a campaign which the LHMU, the union which covers cleaners, is running with its members to try to improve wages and conditions for cleaners. We often do not notice—certainly in Parliament House—who cleans our offices. We do not necessarily think about what their pay and conditions are, nor about the hours they work. The fact is that a great many cleaners in this country do work for extraordinarily low wages. Most of them are on casual arrangements or are precariously employed. A lot of them are not permanently employed and a lot of them do not have access to the entitlements which permanent employment brings.
When I spoke to a group of cleaners in Adelaide not long ago, cleaners from all over the city—almost all of them women, and a lot of them women from non-English-speaking backgrounds—about the Work Choices legislation, I asked them: ‘Do you think you’re going to have a better chance negotiating better pay and conditions by negotiating individually with your employer with fewer minimum statutory conditions and award conditions under the government’s Work Choices?’ Every one of them said no and thought it was ridiculous. They thought it was ridiculous because they know what the reality of their working life is. They already have low wages and conditions which are problematic. But they know that they are not going to get better wages and conditions by negotiating individually with their employer without the protection of the many award conditions and without the involvement of their trade union.
For this group of women, these cleaners, the government’s rhetoric around the choice and opportunity is frankly nothing more than a joke, just as the government’s rhetoric about higher wages is no more than a joke to those employees at Spotlight who were asked to trade away penalty rates, rostering certainty and shift loadings for 2c an hour. That is the reality of Work Choices. We know what some of the effects are. We have the opportunity today to disallow this complex array of regulations that are associated with this legislation, and I urge the Senate to so do.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Wong’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS REGULATIONS 2006</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,33,1
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-06-15,"—I rise this evening to speak about the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006. This is a part of a very important step forward for modern Australia. The government is continuing to strengthen Australia’s economy as part of a long-term plan for the future. Figures released last week show that over 1.8 million jobs have been created since the coalition was elected in 1996, with unemployment falling to 4.9 per cent, the lowest level since 1976. There are now a record 10.1 million Australians in work.
These increased opportunities have not happened by accident. They have occurred as a direct result of the coalition’s disciplined economic management over the past 10 years. I have previously given my support to this bill and was pleased when it received passage through parliament as I believe that these changes are crucial in building a progressive and responsive social wage system for this nation. To ensure the changes contained within the bill are applied in a consistent manner and the intention of the changes are realised, a few additional amendments are required to take place. These amendments are of a technical and somewhat minor nature but are imperative to achieving the outcome this government has worked so hard towards implementing.
These amendments include terminology changes and changes to ensure consistent treatment of similar groups of income support recipients, most notably principal carers. Principal carers can be parents with a dependent child, registered foster carers, registered distance educators, recognised home schoolers and those caring for a disabled child. From 1 July 2006 people claiming parenting payment will only be able to qualify for payment if they have a child under eight years of age if the person is single, and six years of age if the person is partnered. After this time, people will be able to claim and, if eligible, receive another income support payment such as Newstart allowance or youth allowance.
To ensure consistent treatment between principal carers receiving parenting payment, Newstart and youth allowance, this bill amends the Social Security Act so principal carers who qualify for youth allowance or Newstart allowance will be exempt from the newly arrived resident waiting period of 104 weeks. A person will not have to meet the 104-week rule if the person: is the principal carer of one or more children; is not a member of a couple; is not undertaking full-time study; is not a new apprentice; and, at the start of the person’s current period of Australian residence, was not a lone parent. To clarify further: a lone parent is a person who is not a member of a couple and who has a dependent child. This rule is similar to the exception provided to newly arrived resident parents who qualify for parenting payment when, following their Australian residency, they become single.
Single principal carer parents who are in the unenviable position where they are grieving the death of a child will continue to receive the same rate of Newstart allowance or youth allowance, whichever they are currently entitled to receive, for another 14 weeks. So, for 14 weeks after this sad event has taken place, when the parent is going through the difficult task of informing the rest of the family and making funeral arrangements, they will be able to access benefits and concessions and their rate of payment will not decrease or cease altogether. These concessions include the telephone allowance, which I am sure all senators understand would be a necessary tool during this uneasy time. They would also still have access to the pensioner concession card.
If a partnered parenting payment recipient is incapacitated due to illness or injury, for example, they may be eligible for temporary exemption from their participation requirements, which from 1 July 2006 will be 15 hours per week. During this time, where they are still looking after their family and trying to get themselves back on track, they will have access to the pharmaceutical allowance. The extension of the pharmaceutical allowance will provide a consistent approach between all activity tested income recipients. This is an example of a government which understands the special circumstances some parents find themselves in. The parents want to engage in the workforce but circumstances beyond their control mean that they cannot fulfil their obligations.
Similarly, individuals who are caring for a child, or children, or a relative are to have no participation requirements for up to 13 weeks. This is not based on whether they are a parent but the fact that they have special circumstances that temporarily limit their capacity to look for work. Under Welfare to Work, the existing rules around foster carer exemptions will make some allowance for family carers who are principal carers, be it of their child or the child of a relative. This allowance will be made through the guide to the Social Security Act and will identify the circumstance where a family carer may be treated as a foster carer.
From 1 July 2006 a new higher rate of mobility allowance will be available to certain income support recipients with disabilities to assist them to participate in the workforce. Currently, people receiving Newstart allowance, youth allowance and disability support pension can qualify for an advance payment of mobility allowance. This advance is for a period of 26 weeks. During this period no further mobility allowance is payable. This bill makes amendments to ensure that people who qualify for the new, higher rate of mobility allowance during the time when a lower rate advance period is being paid can acquit the advance period earlier. The number of days that remain of the 26-week advance period would be offset against those already incurred to find the new, correct rate of payment.
I would like to reinforce the three principles that underline the welfare to work measures: people who have the capacity and are available to work should do so; the best form of family income comes from a job rather than welfare; and services provided to people who have an obligation to seek work should focus on getting them into work as soon as possible. It is important that we support those people who find themselves temporarily out of work and help those who want to work find employment. It is important that we iron out these technical issues now to ensure that the welfare to work measures achieve the twin goals of lifting workforce participation and reducing welfare dependency while maintaining a strong safety net for those who need it. I support these necessary amendments contained within the bill.
I would like to continue and mention the latest figures which show the Australian government’s employment service providers have achieved a record number of jobs for the unemployed. Over the past year Job Network members have placed more than 640,000 people into jobs—30 per cent of those were long-term positions for disadvantaged job seekers. The coalition government has created more than twice as many full-time jobs in the last year than Labor did in the last six years. There has never been a better time to find a job in Australia, as unemployment has dropped to less than five per cent, and many of these jobs are in the retail, hospitality and manufacturing sectors where people can train on the job.
Our Job Network members have had an outstanding success finding jobs for single parents, the long-term unemployed and people with a disability, and we expect this success to continue. Over 90 per cent of those on parenting payments are women, many of whom have volunteered to go back to work even though they remain eligible for welfare. In the past 12 months alone there have been 44,900 jobs found for job seekers receiving a parenting payment, which is a new annual record. More than 11,000 job seekers receiving the disability support pension were placed in a job—a 45 per cent increase over the numbers of the previous year and a new annual record. Currently only those able to work for more than 30 hours a week in open employment are required to look for work. After 1 July 2006 those able to work at least 15 hours a week will be supported back to part-time work where suitable jobs are available.
In the past year, to April 2006, more than one million new vacancies were lodged on the Job Network national vacancy database, an increase of four per cent on the previous 12 months. We expect this figure to continue to increase as more employers become aware of the advantages of creating a flexible workplace and the availability of highly productive employees who have been long-term unemployed or are parents, people with a disability or mature age people. In the past year, nearly 100,000 people who have been unemployed for over 12 months were placed into a position and more than five per cent of these are long-term placements.",SENATE,<title>EMPLOYMENT AND WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE TO WORK AND OTHER MEASURES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-06-15,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions and especially Senator Judith Adams for the very well considered contribution that she has just made. I understand that Senators Evans and Stephens were in fact on the speakers list but kindly dropped off to assist the management of time in this chamber, and I want to place on record my thanks and the government’s thanks for that.
This Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 will ensure that the policy intention of the welfare to work changes contained in the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Act 2005 are fully realised and consistently applied. Terminology and provisions in the social security law need to be replaced, amended or repealed to clarify the policy intention in relation to certain welfare to work measures. These measures build consistency across working age payments. These include allowing partner allowance recipients who have a temporary incapacity exemption to have access to the pharmaceutical allowance and allowing single principal carer parents who are bereaving the death of a child and are receiving Newstart allowance or youth allowance to continue to receive the same rate they were receiving before their child died for another 14 weeks after the death of the child.
This bill demonstrates the government’s commitment to giving people of working age every opportunity to move from welfare dependency into work. These reforms recognise the fact that the best form of welfare is a job. For the first time the Social Security Act will provide for the assessment of people based on their capacity and availability to work. This is a significant shift from the old paradigm where people were assessed first and foremost on their incapacity or lack of availability to work. This approach has led to a situation where many Australians of working age have been condemned to a life on welfare. Our community should never presume that working age people on income support do not have the same desire that other Australians of working age have to succeed in life and participate in our nation’s prosperity when, in fact, most people on income support are keen to work and to find a job to match their capabilities. The government will preserve a well-targeted social safety net while at the same time encourage working age people to find jobs and remain employed. The government is strongly committed to these principles. With record economic and employment growth, there has never been a better time to provide the necessary assistance and support for people of working age to enter the labour force and secure paid employment.
There are also a number of important reasons for seeking to increase labour force participation. These include the need to address the issue of a rapidly ageing population and the current skilled and unskilled labour shortages in which business is struggling to fill vacancies and satisfy demand for goods and services. Without action now, Australia could face a shortage of nearly 200,000 workers over the next five years. With a record unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent—and that is a record low, the lowest rate in 30 years—there is now an increased opportunity for all to participate in the economic and social life of Australia.
The challenge of implementing welfare reform is to obtain the right balance between obligations and support. This must be accompanied by appropriate incentives and support mechanisms to ensure that job seekers continue to be able to be provided with services and support. These will go a long way to helping job seekers prepare for work, find a job and stay employed. The government believes that its reforms strike this balance. The majority of Australians would agree that it is not unreasonable to expect those people who are available and capable of work to participate in the workforce. The economic and social arguments for such reform are both compelling and necessary. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-06-15,"—I thank senators for their support of this legislation. I will make a couple of points in closing the debate. The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Subscription Television Drama and Community Broadcasting Licences) Bill 2006 amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the BCA, to increase flexibility in the operation of the 10 per cent requirement for new spending on drama on subscription television. The bill amends the BCA to allow preproduction expenditure on script development to be claimed in the financial year it is incurred rather than when principal photography commences. It also provides that expenditure in excess of the annual 10 per cent quota be carried forward to the next year to encourage a higher level of investment.
The Australian Communications and Media Authority, the ACMA, is provided with a discretion to deal with changes in the corporate arrangements of community broadcasting licensees, without putting those licences at risk. The bill also makes a minor amendment to the definition of drama program and has retrospective application from 1 January 2006. The proposed amendments have the support of the subscription television broadcasting sector and the production industry. Those are the comments I would like to make to close the debate.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-06-15,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2006 amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals and their families. The dependent child-student component of the family threshold will also be increased. The increases are in line with movements in the consumer price index. This bill also increases the Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners below age pension age so that they do not have a Medicare levy liability where they do not have an income tax liability. The A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Act 1999 will also increase the Medicare levy surcharge low-income threshold in line with movements in the CPI. The individual threshold will be increased from $15,902 to $16,284, while the level of the family income threshold will also rise from $26,834 to $27,478. That threshold will also be increased by a further $2,523 for each dependent child or student. This bill also proposes to increase the threshold amount for pensioners below age pension age, so that pensioners who face no income tax liability will not have a Medicare levy liability. The threshold amount for pensioners who are under age pension age will also go up from $19,252 to $19,583.
The Medicare levy also applies at a reduced rate to taxpayers with taxable incomes above the threshold amount but not more than the phase-in limit. For 2005-06 the rate of the Medicare levy payable in these circumstances is limited to 20 per cent of the excess over the threshold amount that is relevant to the particular person. The phase-in limit for individuals is increased from $17,191 to $17,604. Pensioners who are under age pension age will have an increase in the phase-in limit from $20,812 to $21,170. There is no phase-in limit for families as the figure changes with the number of dependants. Instead, there is a formula that limits the levy payable by persons with families to 20 per cent for 2005-06 of the amount of family income that exceeds their family income threshold, and this range is increased for dependants.
A Medicare levy surcharge of one per cent applies on taxable income in certain cases where taxpayers do not have private patient hospital cover. The surcharge of one per cent also applies to the reportable fringe benefits in certain cases where taxpayers do not have private patient hospital cover. However, a family member who would otherwise be liable for the surcharge is not required to pay the surcharge where the total of that person’s taxable income and reportable fringe benefits do not exceed the individual low-income thresholds. Unlike the Medicare levy, there is no shading-in of the surcharge above the threshold amount. References to the individual low-income threshold amounts of $15,902 in the Medicare levy surcharge provisions in respect of surcharge on a taxable income are also being increased to $16,284. References to the individual low-income threshold amount of $15,902 in the Medicare levy surcharge provisions of the bill in respect of surcharge on reportable fringe benefits are also being increased to $16,284. On that basis, Labor is supporting the bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1

Section 7 of the Medicare Levy Act says no Medicare levy is payable where a taxpayer has a taxable income at or below the taxable threshold amount. The bill increases the low-income thresholds for individuals and families in line with the movements of CPI from $15,902 to $16,284 and increases the threshold under which the Medicare levy for pensioners below pension age is not payable. There is no medical care liability where such persons do not have an income tax liability.
Senator Stephens has covered the bill adequately. I indicate that the Democrats do support the bill, but I want to take the opportunity during the debate on the second reading of this bill to draw the attention of the chamber to a problem. I have known about this problem, but I was reminded of it by a summary in the Age on Saturday, 10 June 2006 entitled ‘The state of gay rights in Australia’. Under the heading ‘Medicare levy and safety nets’ it said:
The Medicare Levy surcharge affects same-sex couples differently due to the Medicare Levy Act’s definition of couples. This means that the surcharge is calculated at a higher rate for gay couples.
My party and many parliamentarians from all parties were very pleased to hear the Prime Minister the other week comment that he was not in favour of discrimination that acted to the detriment of Australians. He was specifically being asked about the situation for same-sex couples. I thought that this should be an occasion for the Senate to ask the government if they would advise the Senate of this particular issue.
I move the second reading amendment standing in my name on sheet 4963:
At the end of the motion, add:
         “but the Senate requests that the Government;
              (a)    report to the Senate not later than the first sitting day of 2007, on the costs and ramifications of adjusting the Medicare Levy surcharge to ensure that it affects or is calculated for same-sex couples on the same basis as mixed-sex couples; and
              (b)    provide a statement of the Government’s policy position in relation to that issue”.
It is a simple request. It requires a simple response. This would be the cost, and this is the government’s policy. As a courtesy and due to the fact that it is non-controversial legislation, I will take the votes on the voices.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-06-15,"—I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 2) Bill 2006. This bill amends various sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and has six schedules. Before turning to the bill, I would like to make some comments with regard to the taxation aspects of the budget. Labor is concerned that the extraordinary budget spending spree has been financed by Treasury projections of company tax revenue, which itself has had to be revised upwards by $40 billion since December. This government has revenue exceeding a quarter of GDP. The Treasurer can now gloat that he is the highest taxing treasurer in the history of the Commonwealth. This enormous tax take is based on the assumption that corporate tax revenue will grow greater than company profit. Concerns have been raised that the accelerator is not sustainable. Access Economics has argued:
Funding a Budget on such a speculative assumption is an enormous policy gamble.
Last year in the budget, company tax was $40 billion. However, for this year it is estimated at $50 billion, increasing to $6l billion over the forward estimates. The $40 billion parameter revision in the last four months is quite extraordinary. It shows that there is enormous scope for error in these estimates. If there is scope for error on the upside, why not on the downside when commodity prices fall as the Treasurer accepts that they will?
There is a real risk that company tax revenue will collapse and the current tax cuts and family tax measures will have to be continually financed from a rapidly eroding tax base. It was not responsible of the government to engage in this sort of extraordinary spending when there is still considerable uncertainty in relation to the company tax revenue projections. The same uncertainties also apply to the petroleum rent resource tax, which is now predicted to blow out to $4 billion in 2009-10. Labor does, however, support many of the tax measures in the bill and will not oppose any measure, subject to the caveat that the relevant legislation adequately represents the policy intent.
I now turn to the schedules to the bill. Schedule 1 will see ex gratia lump sum payments of either $40,000 or $10,000 made to aircraft maintenance personnel working on F111 fuel storage upgrades. These one-off payments are being made to certain personnel who experienced a unique working environment in the maintenance of F111 aircraft fuel tanks. This measure follows concerns about adverse health effects of the aircraft maintenance personnel working on those F111 fuel storage upgrades. The government does not accept liability, but seeks to legislate to create certainty that any payments received will be tax-free in the hands of the beneficiaries. As capital items, they should not be assessable but could potentially be deemed as income in kind, as they relate to employment under section 26(e). While such special interest group legislation tends to add to the complexity of the tax laws, the opposition supports this measure.
Schedule 2 will add two organisations as deductible gift recipients, thus allowing donations to be tax deductible. The first recipient is Playgroup Victoria Inc., an organisation that offers valuable support to parents. Playgroups facilitate positive learning and social experiences for children, families and carers. The St Michael’s Church restoration fund is the other recipient. St Michael’s Uniting Church in Melbourne is raising money for urgent restoration and critical repair work required to preserve the church building.
Schedule 3 will ensure the cost base for capital gains tax is extended to correct a previous error. The Tax Law Improvement Project was the government’s notoriously unsuccessful attempt to simplify the tax act. In what has become a familiar story under the Howard government, it actually resulted in a much larger act. The government is now seeking to correct an anomaly that was created as part of this process. The cost base for capital gains tax was adjusted in the 1997 act to include options for the disposal of assets and issuing of shares. However, it has now come to light that this has excluded certain types of options, most commonly those related to the issue of options in a unit trust. These options, and any payment to exercise them, are to be included in the capital gains tax cost base.
Do the government read legislation before it is introduced, or are they content to catch the errors after they have hurt small businesses? The number of mistakes this government have been forced to correct suggests that they are asleep at the wheel. Unfortunately, it appears that Minister Dutton is following the worst traditions of his predecessor, Mr Brough, who was notorious for the number of ‘Brough-ups’ in the tax legislation that he introduced. Those errors or corrections came to an impressive list. The current total is approximately 14 in the last 12 months or so.
Schedule 4 of the bill retrospectively allows capital gains tax rollover relief where assets are compulsorily acquired. When an asset is disposed of post May 1985, capital gains tax applies even if the asset is acquired as a result of Commonwealth law. In some cases, where an asset must be disposed of, this means that the pre 1985 GST free treatment is lost. This change ensures that rollover relief is provided where acquisition is compulsory. That means that the GST free treatment will transfer to the new owner if the asset was purchased before the CGT regime applied, and post 1985 assets will not incur capital gains tax until sold. This provision appears to be necessary to ensure compulsory acquisitions occur on just terms. The explanatory memorandum of the bill does not make it clear exactly what type of contracts and acquisitions the bill is intended to cover. It would certainly help the debate if the government disclosed its intentions.
Schedule 5 of the bill narrows the scope of the franking deficits tax. Under the simplified imputation system, a company’s tax transactions operate though a franking account. Payment of tax is a credit, and the franking of a dividend creates a debit to the franking account. To ensure against excessive dividend franking, a franking deficit tax applies if, at the end of the year, the franking account is in deficit. The tax is equal to the deficit. As the deficit tax is simply a bringing forward of a future tax liability, the tax can be offset against future tax liabilities under what is called the ‘franking deficits tax offset’. But this offset could also be a mechanism for excessive franking. To protect against this, where the franking deficit tax liability is greater than 10 per cent of franking credit in a year, the deficit tax offset is reduced by 30 per cent. This can be a harsh provision where the variation in the franking deficit occurs due to something outside the control of the company. The bill narrows the scope under which this reduction in the offset occurs so that, if the deficit is outside the company’s control, the offset is not reduced. The commissioner is given a new discretion to remit a reduction in this offset.
While on the surface this provision appears reasonable, the explanatory memorandum does not outline the cases in which it is expected to occur. There is some reference in the explanatory memorandum that this measure is required in the case of a reduction in PAYE instalments due to some downturn in profit. Again, I call on the minister to provide further explanation of when this provision will apply and to indicate that its introduction has no relation to the extreme industrial relations laws introduced by the Howard government.
Schedule 6 overrides the requirement for a superannuation guarantee contribution to be made to a state fund if an employee nominates another fund. The superannuation choice regime allows an employee to nominate the fund where their superannuation guarantee payments are to be made. However, superannuation guarantee contributions to certain funds are mandated under state law. This schedule overrides such state legislation to specify that, if an employee specifies a fund, no obligation exists upon the employer to make the superannuation guarantee payments mandated under state law.
Labor does not seek to oppose this schedule, as it is necessary for the introduction of the super choice regime. However, Labor must register its concern surrounding the criminal penalties and the compliance burden imposed on small business by this super choice regime. A two-year jail sentence for a discussion with an employee about which fund to choose certainly does not seem fair. These compliance costs hurt small business owners, both in the hip pocket and with the time it takes to complete this government’s red tape.

—Especially from you!
—and she hopes that in the future she can participate more in tax debates.
—She has always been a fan of yours, Senator Murray.
 (Senator Hutchins)—We will see what we can do!
—The purpose of the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 2) Bill 2006 is to implement a number of disparate legislative taxation measures to achieve a range of government policy outcomes. The bill is arranged into seven unrelated schedules with key amendments pertaining to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 and the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. A number of minor technical amendments are also proposed which address a large number of other acts.
Schedule 1 seeks the passage of the government’s ex gratia lump sum payment to maintenance workers involved in the F111 deseal-reseal program. The bill ensures that lump sum payments to Defence Force maintenance workers exposed to chemicals whilst working on F111 fuel tanks are exempt from taxation. This might not otherwise be the case without a specific legislative directive. The payments are valued at either $10,000 or $40,000, depending on the circumstances of each affected employee. According to the government, the payment recognises the difficulties eligible personnel suffered, regardless of whether there are any adverse health impacts.
Schedule 2 adds a further two specific gift recipients to the deductible gift recipient list of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The two additional recipients include Playgroup Victoria Inc. from 24 February 2006 and the St Michaels Church Restoration Fund from 24 February 2006.
Schedule 3 clarifies the capital gains tax treatment of options. This amendment is necessary as there were a number of unintended legislative consequences arising from the rewrite of the capital gains tax provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 as part of the Tax Law Improvement Project. That is, incidentally, a reminder that these acts are so complicated that, even when the experts draft the changes, some years later problems and difficulties can be discovered. The measures in schedule 3 essentially reinstate the position in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in relation to options exercised on or after 27 May 2005, the date of the announcement of this amendment.
Schedule 4 amends the tax laws pertaining to compulsory acquisition. Specifically, the bill seeks to amend subdivision 12B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to extend the circumstances in which a taxpayer may choose to obtain a CGT rollover when an asset is compulsorily acquired. Corresponding changes are made for balancing adjustment offsets under the uniform capital allowance provisions. Notably, the financial impact of schedule 4 is uncertain but is estimated to be at a cost to revenue of approximately $5 million over the forward estimates period.
Schedule 5 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to limit the circumstances in which the franking deficit tax offset is reduced. This measure has retrospective effect as of 1 July 2002, the start of the simplified imputation system.
Schedule 6 extends the super choice legislation provisions to employees currently governed under state law that conflicts with enabling employees to choose their own superannuation fund. The schedule amends the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 by ensuring that employers that are constitutional corporations and who make super guarantee contributions to a fund nominated in a state law do not have to make these contributions to that fund if an employee chooses an alternative fund.
Schedule 7 is the final schedule in this bill and aims to address a number of technical corrections and improvements to taxation legislation. These corrections should improve the useability of the taxation laws in a minor way by fixing errors such as duplications of definitions, missing asterisks from defined terms and incorrect numbering and referencing.
What is the price that can be placed on an individual’s quality of life? As repulsive as this question may be, it forms the basis of schedule 1 of this bill. According to the government, a one-off ex gratia payment of either $10,000 or $40,000 is a fair price to pay. I think that the government is getting a bargain, and I am not alone. According to F111 Deseal/Reseal Support Group president Ian Fraser, ‘Forty thousand dollars for a ruined life is simply not enough.’ Clearly there is no price that can be placed on one’s health and wellbeing. Whilst I appreciate, to an extent, the government’s attempt to address the harm caused to a number of Department of Defence employees in the course of their duty, I must also condemn their corporate style ‘admit no liability’ approach to this matter. Advice from the F111 Deseal/Reseal Support Group indicates that the amounts in question are insufficient to help people battling illnesses due to chemical exposure.
Undoubtedly, Australian government employees deserve better. They deserve more than a one-off payment that, according to the government, is being made regardless of whether there is evidence of an adverse health impact. If there were not an adverse health impact, it is a generous gift. If there is an adverse health impact, the amount is probably far too low. Otherwise stated, the payment does not in any way imply negligence or fault on the part of the government.
Surely Defence personnel who are government employees and are exposed to chemicals that may lead to adverse health effects should receive the best long-term care and support the government can afford. With examples of maltreatment such as this, it comes as no surprise that the Defence Force is battling to achieve its recruitment targets. Its reputation is atrocious on matters like this. If you return dead or injured or if you are injured in the normal course of your work, such as in these cases, the general sense in the community is that you are going to be undercompensated or ‘under cared for’. That is not a good way to encourage recruitment. Whilst I will always support cases that will alleviate some degree of harm caused, the government is capable of far better and the employees in question deserve far better.
Turning to schedule 4: this is a highly technical revision to the timing of balancing adjustment offsets for the uniform capital allowances provisions for compulsory acquisitions. The change enables the deferment of recognising capital gains and is beneficial to affected taxpayers. This is an equitable change, since compulsory acquisitions largely remove control from asset owners, who therefore cannot control the timing and impact of their capital gains tax event.
Schedule 5 is the schedule which affects the franking deficit tax offset. It reduces the number of instances where companies are penalised by way of a reduction in the size of the tax offset they can claim for franking deficit tax to ensure that it only applies in income years where a company has made, directly or indirectly, a franked distribution. This change is in line with the intention behind the reduction in tax offset for excessive franking deficits for companies and ensures that companies that book an excessive franking deficit balance due to the imposition of a penalty or through circumstances outside of the companies’ control are not penalised. While these changes may be seen as a concession to poorly managed companies, they do better restate the intention behind the underlying law and as such should be supported.
The Democrats were key negotiators with the government for the outcomes of the superannuation choice legislation that came into effect last year. This is the topic for schedule 6 of this bill, which extends the choice of superannuation plan option to several groups of employees who, until now, have faced legislative uncertainty over whether they are able to access the benefits of the new federal laws.
Whilst choice of super fund laws have already been enacted, it has been recognised that a number of funds are potentially exempted from these provisions due to monopolistic protections under state law. This includes employees whose superannuation is governed under the following legislation: the New South Wales Coal and Oil Shale Mine Workers (Superannuation) Act 1941, the Queensland Coal and Oil Shale Mine Workers Superannuation Act 1989 and the Western Australian Coal Industry Superannuation Act 1989. The changes proposed in this bill amend the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to effectively override these state powers, and, whilst this may be viewed as yet another example of centralism by the government, they are consistent with the policies and decisions that we support and that were instrumental in establishing super choice. They ensure consistency and have the support of the Democrats. The Democrats support the bill as a whole.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2006 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-06-15,"—I would like to thank Senator Stephens and Senator Murray for their comments concerning this non-controversial legislation. Senator Stephens raised a couple of technical questions, and I undertake that she will be provided with answers to those as soon as possible.
This legislation implements a variety of changes and improvements to the tax laws to provide tax exemptions for the F111 ex gratia lump sum payments, improvements to capital gains tax rules and simplified imputation system changes. This legislation also provides for the specific listing for two funds as deductible gift recipients and makes changes to superannuation rules. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-06-15,"—The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006, which we are considering today, makes a number of amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984. The amendments provide for increased fines and for custodial sentences of up to three years imprisonment for persons caught fishing illegally in those parts of Australia’s territorial sea that are subject to Commonwealth fisheries jurisdiction. The area covered by this legislation is the zone beyond a line three nautical miles from the coast, which represents the state or territory boundary and up to a line 12 nautical miles from the coast, which represents the rest of Australia’s territorial sea. Importantly, this legislation does not and cannot apply to the areas of the Australian fishing zone that lie out beyond the 12 nautical mile boundary of Australia’s territorial sea.
This legislation will therefore not apply to persons caught fishing illegally in the fishing zone between the 12 nautical mile line and the 200 nautical mile limit of our fishing zone. This is because, as a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Australia is prohibited from imposing custodial penalties for foreign fishing offences beyond the 12 nautical mile territorial sea limit. This is not the first time that custodial sentences have been included in Australia’s fishing legislation, but in both the Fisheries Management Act and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act custodial sentences are generally provided only for non-fishing offences such as obstructing a fisheries officer or providing false information.
Labor will be supporting this legislation. We recognise that it is a very small step in the right direction. It will put in place a small additional deterrent for those foreign fishers who are considering fishing in our waters. Evidence was provided during estimates that the vast bulk of sightings by Coastwatch of illegal foreign fishers operating in Australia’s fishing zone are in waters beyond our 12 nautical mile territorial limit and will therefore not be subject to the new custodial provisions contained in this legislation.
The bill before us today is not likely to make a major dent in a problem that has basically been spiralling out of control for many years under a succession of Howard government fisheries ministers. We need to understand the dimensions of this problem. Last year, Coastwatch reported that in the 2004 calendar year there were 8,108 sightings of possible illegal fishing vessels in Australia’s fishing zone. Coastwatch now says that in the 2005 calendar year there were 13,018 sightings. Even if this figure has been inflated as a result of multiple sightings of the same vessel and of including vessels that have been legally transiting through our waters, it is clear that incursions by foreign fishing boats operating illegally in our waters are increasing at an alarming rate.
It is true that over time there has also been an increase in interceptions but, unfortunately, incursions have been increasing far more quickly than apprehensions. Even with the additional funding that was provided in this year’s budget, the government only expects to apprehend an additional 300 illegal foreign fishers a year. We need to put this in perspective. The number of sightings has been increasing by around 5,000 a year in recent years and the government has responded by providing funds to apprehend an additional 300 a year. No wonder this situation is spiralling out of control.
This is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue. It is not just the impact on our fish stocks and on the livelihoods of our fishing families and of fishing communities that we are concerned about. We are concerned also about the risks to our agricultural industries, and to our native flora and fauna, that these incursions pose. We have all seen reports of illegal foreign fishers bringing with them birds, dogs and other animals. We know that these animals are sometimes brought to camps on the Australian mainland. We know that many of these fishers themselves carry diseases such as tuberculosis and that their animals have the potential to carry bird flu, rabies and even foot-and-mouth disease.
But it is not only the quarantine risk that Australian fishers worry about. Australian fishers and officials are concerned that the illegal foreign fishers are becoming increasingly aggressive in the way they operate. Fishers have spoken about waking up at night out at sea and finding foreign fishers on their boat searching for food and water. There is concern about suspected links between some illegal fishers, drug importers and people smugglers.
There is also evidence that these fishers are becoming better organised. The minister himself has pointed to links between the foreign fishers and organised crime figures from Indonesia and elsewhere. Australian fishers and officials have reported that they are seeing more boats from the more distant areas in Indonesia as well as those from closer islands such as Roti who have been fishing in our waters for a very long time. As well, we are seeing bigger boats, ice boats and even mother ships and factory boats.
The changing nature of the problem can be seen in microcosm in the changing nature of the fishers that are being encountered in the so-called MOU box. When the sea boundary with Indonesia was originally negotiated, the MOU box, which lies within Australian waters, was set aside as an area where traditional fishers, principally from the island of Roti, could fish in the traditional way as they had for generations. These days it is not only traditional boats from Roti that are encountered in the MOU box. Today, powerful boats with relatively sophisticated fishing equipment are using the MOU box and, according to Australian fishers, fish stocks in that area have become severely depleted. This highlights the need for better cooperation between the Australian and the Indonesian governments, especially on issues such as who may fish in the MOU box area and other border related issues.
It is clear that illegal incursions in our waters by foreign fishers are out of control—out of the government’s control, certainly. The measures in this bill alone will do little to alter this alarming situation. This is a national problem demanding a coordinated national response. But the opposition is not convinced that we are getting a coordinated response—certainly not the one that is needed.
State and territory officers who are on the front line have reported that information sharing among the various authorities dealing with this problem is not always what it should be. They say there is a particular problem with some Commonwealth agencies who are very reluctant to share vital information. They say that coordination is not always as good as is desirable and the best, most efficient, use is not always made of existing, available equipment and human resources. Better coordination and cooperation between authorities is vital if we are to successfully overcome this problem.
I note that the minister has at last acknowledged the importance of this and that some funds for this purpose were made available in this year’s budget. But acknowledging the problem is not enough. This alone will not ensure better coordination and cooperation between Commonwealth agencies. Labor has long advocated bringing the federal agencies and equipment together in a well-equipped Australian coastguard as the best, most effective way of ensuring a well-resourced and well-coordinated response.
In addition there needs to be a renewed spirit of trust and cooperation between federal and state and territory authorities. On the ground at the local level in many places such cooperation between state and Commonwealth officers is the norm, and at the local level is where it should occur. The problem occurs much higher up the command chain. Ministers in particular have been far too fond of blame shifting and pointing the finger at one another.
We also need to utilise the local knowledge and long experience that lies in local communities, particularly Aboriginal communities, right across Northern Australia. Again, the government has finally come around to at least acknowledging that in many Aboriginal communities lies a wealth of experience that can be better used in surveillance and other activities associated with curbing illegal foreign fishing. But it is a very tentative start. It has become clear that to make the best use of Indigenous expertise a well-funded and well-coordinated program is needed. Aboriginal rangers should have training opportunities available to them that will equip them with skill sets roughly equivalent to those possessed by state or territory fisheries officers or national park service officers. They should also be provided with all the specialised equipment they need to do such a job. Better use should also be made of the resources and expertise of Australian fishers. Again, the government has made some noises in this area, but we have yet to see what, if anything, will happen in practice.
What is needed is a better focused effort from the Commonwealth. Labor believes this would best be done with an Australian coastguard. There needs to be better coordination across all levels of government and with the Indigenous community and Australian fishers. Much work also needs to be done with the Indonesians on issues such as the MOU box and the border and on finding viable alternatives for Indonesian fishers who have been operating in our waters. The legislation before us today has the support of the opposition, but no-one should pretend to believe that it will do more than scratch the surface in deterring illegal fishers from fishing in our waters.
 (Senator Hutchins)—Senator Ian Macdonald, I have Senator Bartlett next on the running sheet.",SENATE,<title>FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FOREIGN FISHING OFFENCES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-15,"—I cannot say I have much enthusiasm to jump Senator Macdonald. I was keen to hear what he had to say about this. But that is all right; I will go first. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006 predominately deals with custodial penalties for foreign fishing offences in those parts of the Australian territorial sea that are within what is known as the Australian fishing zone. As I understand it, the waters that become subject to the proposed custodial penalties as a result of this legislation are those that are between three and 12 nautical miles offshore from the Australian mainland or from most islands, including those in the Torres Strait.
The Democrats, along with, I imagine, pretty much everybody in this parliament, have a concern about illegal fishing in Australian waters, particularly in respect of the environmental impact of uncontrolled or unregulated fishing. We have a concern in some areas, certainly not universally, about the environmental impacts of some legally authorised fishing as well. It is wider than just saying all environmental problems are due to illegal people and everything else is fine. Nonetheless, illegal fishing is a significant problem and one that does need to be dealt with more effectively. It is, of course, almost impossible to eliminate. I think we need to acknowledge and be realistic about that. But at the same time we need to do all that is reasonably possible to reduce its impact and extent.
The main aspect of this legislation is to deal with bringing in custodial penalties. That is an aspect that I have mixed views on in relation to the people that are likely to be predominantly caught by it and also how much actual practical benefit it will bring, purely based on a cost-benefit analysis and leaving aside the human consequences for those that get caught. There is also the issue of the disparity that will still be in place. These penalties will not apply for those areas outside the Australian fishing zone, further out into the exclusive economic zone, the EEZ, which goes out to 200 nautical miles. Custodial penalties will not apply in those areas because that would be not in compliance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Article 73 of that convention requires that:
Coastal State penalties for violations of fisheries laws ... may not include imprisonment—
for areas in the EEZ—
in the absence of agreements to the contrary by the States concerned ...
I did find it interesting to discover when looking at this area that we do not have such an agreement with Indonesia. I am a bit perplexed about why that is. I am sure Senator Macdonald, with his experience in this, would be able to tell us why. It is obviously crucial for us in making significant progress in reducing illegal fishing in Australian waters to have as much cooperation as possible from Indonesia in particular and also from some other countries in the region, most notably PNG, and further afield. But Indonesia is critical in this regard.
An aspect that also concerns me is that predominantly it will be poorer Indonesian fishing folk who will be likely to be caught up in the custodial aspects of this legislation. I am not convinced that locking up a lot of not terribly well-off Indonesian fishermen is necessarily going to lead to a dramatic increase in the environmental benefit, not just from the Australian point of view—environmental benefit is from everybody’s point of view. I note the comments made by Mr Wilson Tuckey, the member for O’Connor, in the other place in his speech on this legislation. He said:
… for the lesser individual, the crewman, this process of incarceration has not worked.
We do currently have scope for incarceration in some state waters, out to the three-mile limit. As I said, there are already some crewmen locked up as a result of fishing offences. I note Mr Tuckey’s view that that has not worked. I presume when he says that it has not worked he means that it has not provided an adequate disincentive to have a significant impact in reducing the extent of illegal fishing. I certainly find that a useful assessment of his. If that is the case, as he states, then I am not sure that expanding the number of people likely to be locked up or the length of time they are likely to be locked up for will be a net positive gain for Australia.
Leaving aside an examination of the human impact of locking up some of the poorer people and looking at it in terms of a purely dispassionate cost-benefit analysis of the extra expense to Australia of imprisoning people—which is usually not that cheap—and the overall net gain, as a consequence of that, with regard to reduced problems from illegal fishing, I am not necessarily convinced that that is the best way for our resources to be devoted. I am not just saying, ‘It’s terrible to lock people up and we shouldn’t do it,’ although I am not saying it is good to lock people up either; I am also saying that I am not convinced that being more hardline with imprisonment is the best way to direct our resources.
Clearly that is not the only area to which we are directing our resources, and I am not suggesting that it is; I am merely expressing my lack of certainty that this will be a particularly useful piece of legislation or the best way to direct our resources. I am sure it will be useful in a political sense. It is always useful to governments, when there is an issue of people infringing on an area, to say: ‘We’re going to be tough on this. We’re going to lock people up. We’re going to take a more hardline approach.’ When looking at the federal parliamentary arena, I often get the sense that, whilst in the broad, most people prefer to have the more national scope for taking on issues compared to the restrictions of people in the state parliamentary arena, sometimes there is a bit of wistfulness from some that they do not really get as much chance to jump on the law-and-order bandwagon as much as their state colleagues.
I occasionally see that they would love more of a chance to jump on the law-and-order bandwagon, do some chest beating and say: ‘We’re being tough on this. We’re locking people up.’ Obviously there is still some scope to do that, as we all know. Those chances are often taken wherever possible. It seems to be an almost irresistible instinct of politicians at all levels, wherever they can, to jump on the law-and-order bandwagon as a way of looking like they are tackling a problem. Again, I am not saying that such approaches are ineffective all the time. But I can certainly say that there are many times when they are not effective—sometimes they are completely counterproductive. I think we could be much more judicious with regard to that.
So there may be some political benefit in looking tougher in this area. I am not convinced that it will actually have a positive benefit in the area we are trying to deal with. It seems perplexing to me that there appears to be such a difficulty in detecting illegal fishing—and not just the act of illegal fishing. There are numerous reports—sufficiently numerous so that I find it difficult to believe that they are all made up—of many illegal fishing people stopping on Australian soil for a break, to recuperate and the like, before going back out to sea. Obviously there are issues there in terms of quarantine and other matters, but for me it is more a somewhat sad irony, I suppose. For all the farcical ranting that we have about border security and asylum seekers—who, of course, have nothing to do with border security at all because they pose no challenge to our security—we are somehow incapable of stopping fishing people from getting to Australia. And we are incapable of stopping them illegally operating in Australian waters. But as soon as there are refugees on these boats, we have the Navy at our disposal to go charging all around the place trying to stop them getting here.
Maybe if the fisheries department just pretended that these were not fishing people, that they were refugees, then they would be able to detect them all immediately. We seem to be quite happy to lock up refugees for many years at a time, certainly much longer than we lock up fishing people, so I am amazed that the fisheries department has not taken that approach. They might suddenly find themselves more able to detect all of these fishing people in Australian waters. It is astonishing that there can be literally thousands of illegal fishing vessels in Australian waters that we are not able to detect but, as soon as there are asylum seekers on a vessel, the Navy gets called out.
We have all of those resources used to grab a few refugees who present no threat to Australia at all, who do not challenge our borders and who do not impact on border security, but we cannot use those resources to deal with what is a threat to some extent. It is not a border security threat in any true meaning of the words—not that this government worries about the true meanings of words, of course—but there are certainly threats with regard to quarantine and impact on the environment, and to some extent there are economic threats. We do not have the resources available for that, but we can bring out the Navy to deal with asylum seekers.
I guess that shows the reality of this government’s priorities. But a bit of legislation saying that we are being tougher by locking up a few poor fishermen is not necessarily an adequate response, from my point of view. I suggest we redivert some of the literally hundreds of millions of dollars that have gone into intercepting asylum seekers and put that towards intercepting and dealing with fishing vessels. I am sure that when Senator Ian Macdonald was the relevant minister he would have loved to have had a few extra hundred million dollars to deal with this issue rather than them being diverted to deal with asylum seekers. It is a bit of a shame that we have those distorted priorities, but I guess that is a reality we have been living with in the political arena in Australia for some years.
To conclude, on behalf of the Democrats I voice my scepticism about how effective this will be and I reinforce the point and join with all speakers, I suspect, in this debate in seeking to ensure we have more effective activities to reduce the amount of illegal fishing in Australian waters. It is important that we do have more successes in that regard. I do not dispute that other resources have been put into this area, some of which have had some effect. However, more needs to be done in that respect and I would suggest that there are better ways of directing resources than will be taken up as a consequence of legislation like this.",SENATE,<title>FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FOREIGN FISHING OFFENCES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-06-15,"—I wish to speak briefly on the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006 to explain why I was reluctant to let it go through as non-controversial legislation without making some comment. First, I would like to acknowledge the offer of the briefing and the briefing that we received from the minister’s office. It was very helpful in assisting us to understand some of the issues that I had about the legislation.
People in this chamber are probably well aware that the Greens have been concerned about illegal fishing and the depletion of our oceans for a very, very long time. We have no argument with the government’s rationale for taking action to prevent illegal fishing in Australian waters. As I have said, people are well aware that we have had concerns about this for a long time. The scale of quarantine risk and the depletion of fishing grounds are now recognised by everybody from Indigenous people fishing their traditional waters to state and territory fisheries officers, the Commonwealth fisheries agencies and commercial operators who are now confronting this issue on a daily basis. So on this basis I believe the need for action is noncontroversial.
There is evidence that the rapid increase in illegal fishing activity to our north is being driven by the collapse of fisheries in Indonesia brought on, at least in part, by the same industrial fishing fleets and illegal operators that are now pushing south towards Australia. But I do not believe that just throwing people in jail is the answer. I do understand that the government is taking other actions, and I will go into that area later. I am deeply interested in knowing what else the government is doing to deter the large-scale operators other than simply increasing the penalties for a large number of impoverished fishermen and fisher-people who are moving further and further south from their traditional fishing grounds.
The passage of this bill will certainly enable the government to say it is taking strong action against illegal fishing, but it does raise many questions. How many people does the government anticipate are likely to be charged under this new regime? Does the minister acknowledge that the number of people in detention could quickly become very large unless other elements of the government’s strategy prove to be successful and are implemented at the same time? Where, and for how long, will people be detained while their cases are pending? What will be the impact on the various state court and prison systems of the potentially large numbers of non-English speaking Indonesian villagers who will be moving through our judicial system?
As I have said, the Greens support sensible measures to protect the Australian marine environment and the industries that depend on it. I am aware that the government does have other actions that it is taking, although it seems to me at the moment that this legislation to throw people in jail seems to be dominating the headlines. I have mentioned elements of this plan before. The Australian Marine Conservation Society, for example, has published a very thorough and well thought out plan or concept of what needs to be put in place to deal with illegal fishing, such as to start with a better understanding of our seas and the impact of illegal fishing.
I would like to point here to the fact that we do not have a thorough understanding of that marine environment, our seas, and the impact illegal fishing is having. For example, during estimates I asked the Department of the Environment and Heritage’s Marine Division some questions about sharks. I asked if the department acknowledges that the true status of most shark populations in Australian waters is unknown, and the answer was yes. I asked if they acknowledge that the most basic biological information is missing for almost all species of shark, and the answer was yes. I asked the department if they acknowledged that the knowledge of habitat preferences and other ecological requirements is poor or unknown, and they answered yes.
Then I asked if they were aware that there is inadequate monitoring, enforcement and research programs specifically designed for sharks, and they said no. If they have already acknowledged that we have a poor understanding of their status, their biological information and their habitat preferences and other ecological requirements, I really do fail to see how they can then say that monitoring, enforcement and research programs specifically designed for sharks are adequate.
I also asked them if they believe that there is widespread concern about the apparent decline in shark numbers, and they answered yes. When I asked whether the National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks has been reviewed they said no. I am deeply concerned about those responses. I was very pleased that they were actually honest enough to admit that there were concerns about the knowledge of our shark populations, but I am deeply concerned that they could not answer that further action is being taken.
We have not yet fulfilled the first point of the Australian Marine Conservation Society’s 10-point plan—that first dot point. They also believe that we need to adopt a shared sea approach, which means working with our northern neighbours to protect our shared resources and seas. They also believe that we need to establish marine protected areas across the Arafura and Timor seas. I believe that an essential approach to managing our fisheries is to have a comprehensive, adequate and representative marine reserve system. We need to protect the species that are already threatened by fishing impacts.
Again, I come back to the information I have just supplied about sharks. We are not adequately protecting those sharks and we do not know enough about them yet. The AMCS also believe we need to improve the food security and livelihoods of coastal and Indigenous peoples. Again, there is much work that we could do in that area. We also need to recognise the rights of Indonesian coastal indigenous communities in the Arafura and Timor seas.
The AMCS also suggest, and this is an area they have talked about before, in point No. 6:

Breaking the illegal fishing trade cycle using international trade measures.
I believe that this is an area that is not being explored enough and that we need to take a much more lateral approach to using international trade measures. No. 8 in their suggested approach is ‘establishing a collaborative and comprehensive fisheries management framework’ for our northern waters, and I am aware that negotiations are going on between our governments on this very important issue. No. 9 is:

Implementing monitoring, compliance and surveillance operations.
Obviously, a large part of the work that the Australian government has been focusing on is surveillance operations, so we are starting to take care of that part. Point No. 10 recommends:

Building capacity of coastal and Indigenous communities to tackle illegal fishing.
I am pleased that money has been invested in helping our northern Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to tackle illegal fishing and that their important role has been recognised. However, I do not believe that all of the elements of this plan are being implemented. It would be very encouraging to see the government take a much more comprehensive approach to this important issue. I am concerned that what does appear to come out in a lot of the rhetoric is that the government is taking the path of least resistance.
While I agree that penalties need to be put in place, it cannot be the only egg in the basket. As I said, a much more comprehensive approach needs to be taken. Just heavily pushing the ‘lock ‘em up’ approach is not going to solve the problem. Also, while I think that we may agree to disagree with the government, I do not believe that the threat of jail in Australia will necessarily act as a deterrent when fisherpeople are trying to earn some money to support their families and put food on their tables. Instead of what is a significant push for jailing fisherpeople, I very strongly believe that we need to be tackling the Mr Bigs of this industry.
This will come as a surprise to many in this place, and it may be the one and only time it ever happens, but like Senator Bartlett I am going to quote Wilson Tuckey. He may not really like being quoted by a Greens senator, but here we go.
—I think his endorsement is in doubt!
—Absolutely! His endorsement is in grave doubt now!
—Kiss of death!
—Yes! In his remarks on this bill in the other place, he pointed out that it is not satisfactory to simply jail indigenous fishermen—he said ‘fishermen’; I tend to use ‘fisherpeople’ or ‘fishers’—while leaving the organisers untouched. I could not agree more. This is an extremely complex and difficult issue. There is no one simple answer and, while I do not think the government believes there is one simple answer, I am afraid that that is the message that is being sent. It requires a complex, careful response. As I have articulated and as the Australian Marine Conservation Society has very clearly pointed out, we are not going to solve this problem if we rely on just locking people up.
We need to look at the causes of this problem. We need to be investing in our near neighbours to increase their capacity to repair the reefs and to share some of our knowledge and expertise in fishing. I believe and acknowledge that Australia has some of the greatest fishing expertise and best fisheries management practices in the world. We lead the world in marine protected areas—do not take that as meaning that I think there are enough, because there are not—but it has to be acknowledged that we lead the world in trying to put in place marine protected areas. Do not rest on your laurels; we still have a comprehensive system to roll out by the year 2012 to meet obligations and commitments this government has made. We need to share that knowledge with our northern neighbours. We have to tackle this in a comprehensive way and we have to acknowledge it is going to take time. It is going to take time to repair reefs, to develop capacity, to find alternative industries for our northern neighbours and to develop the necessary protocols and regional fishing organisations. We are in this for the long haul: there are no short-term answers and we need a comprehensive approach.",SENATE,<title>FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FOREIGN FISHING OFFENCES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2006-06-15,"—I must say I am delighted to see such interest in the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006 and in fisheries management generally. I also have to say that, broadly speaking, I agree with what Senator Siewert and Senator Bartlett said in their comments on this bill. A lot of the things that they were both urging the government to do are things that the government has in place or has in mind, things that will happen in the fullness of time. I think the contributions by the last two speakers have been useful in that regard, and they did in fact recognise some of the good work that the government has been doing in recent years.
I am rather proud of my own involvement in this. About five years ago, when I first came to the fisheries portfolio, the rape of the patagonian toothfish in the Southern Ocean was in its prime and there was a lot of illegal activity in the north. Nothing had been done in the Labor years; I recall that no-one cared about illegal fishing anywhere then. In fact, illegal fishermen and boat people used to land on the shores of Darwin Harbour and catch a taxi into town. That is what the protection was like back in Labor’s time. Of course, things have changed considerably in the last five years. The patagonian toothfish, which was under severe pressure, has now, at least in Australian waters, been given some protection. I have to acknowledge an environment group in Tasmania, Isofish and its organiser, Alistair Graham, with whom I worked very closely when I was parliamentary secretary for the environment; we actually put in place some programs then to track the criminals around the world.
Over the years, the government has put a lot of money into the fight against the patagonian toothfish pirates in our territorial seas, particularly around Heard and McDonald Islands. I have to say with some pride—touch wood—that we have cleaned the pirates out of Australian waters insofar as the rape of the patagonian toothfish species is concerned. It is still a problem on the high seas. Several years ago, Australia took a leading role in forming an international task force to try and address illegal fishing on the high seas. Patagonian toothfish were our real interest, but other nations came together to join Australia and the United Kingdom in the High Seas Task Force that took forward a lot of measures to address illegal fishing on the high seas.
Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, the high seas have always been seen as the domain of the world at large. Nobody owned the high seas, so you could ply the high seas without particular rules and regulations. I guess that was good one, two or three centuries ago but, nowadays, when the marine environment is so fragile and precious, we have to look at some regimentation of the high seas. The High Seas Task Force, of which Australia was an initial member and a leading force in, pushed the envelope regarding what could be done on the high seas.
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was to be reviewed this year. I must say that I have lost track of what exactly happened to it. I hope to be going to the UN in a couple of weeks time to see what happened with that. One of the things that I thought the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea—which I will refer to as UNCLOS hereafter—should look at were regulations and rules on the high seas insofar as the environment and fisheries management are concerned. People who understand the UN system tell me that changing UNCLOS will take something like 20 to 50 years, and that is why the High Seas Task Force was trying to find new, different and immediate ways of addressing those problems.
Both Senator Siewert and Senator Bartlett again mentioned concerns about incarcerations. This is a good measure. This is a step in the right direction. It was initiated just before Christmas, and instructions were given to the departmental people to address this by bringing in legislation to correct the problem. Curiously enough, the idea came to us from the Indonesians, who explained to us that this is what they did with their illegal fishing coming from the Philippines in the north. I have to say with some embarrassment that the penny dropped. It had never been suggested by us prior to that, but it became very obvious that we should introduce this measure, and I am pleased to see the bill before the parliament today. It will be a step in the right direction. It will not make a great deal of difference to incarceration. Already, we incarcerate for fishing penalties through a backdoor method. Fishermen are fined and they have little prospect of paying the fine, so they are jailed by the state courts for non-payment of the fine—for contempt of court—rather than for the fishing offence.
Regarding the problems that Senator Siewert and Senator Bartlett mentioned about where to house the incarcerated people and how to deal with them, over the last few years both the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Customs people have got that down to a very fine art. It works very well and very humanely, and there are processes in place which deal with the real culprits—the captains and the senior fishing masters. The junior crew are usually sent straight back. This bill will not make a great deal of difference there, but it does give us the laws to arrest at first instance in the three to 12 nautical mile area. Quite rightly, people say as I do that illegal fishers should not be getting into the 12 nautical mile area, because, if they are into the 12 nautical mile area, they are almost on the coast. We really have to protect our borders at the border of the exclusive economic zone, at the 200 nautical mile mark.
In the last four budgets—it might even be five—additional money each year has gone into the fight against illegal fishing. I am very proud. Senator Ellison and Senator Abetz have continued that work and money continues to flow to help in the fight against illegal fishing. Senator O’Brien continues to make political points without being terribly helpful with the problem. He keeps talking about this ridiculous idea of a coastguard. Obviously, he does not really understand it, although we have tried to explain it time and time again. The arrangement we have now maximises the resources that Australia puts into the fight. The Navy, the Army, the Air Force, Customs, Coastwatch and the states all combine in the fight against illegal fishing. You get the maximum bang for your buck with the maximum use of resources. Australia, quite obviously, does not have the resources of the United States or the United Kingdom, but we do very well.
Senator O’Brien continues to make the political point of there being 12,000 or 15,000 sightings. Sure, there are a lot of sightings, but do you know why? It is because there is a lot of activity out there looking for illegal fishing boats these days. Years ago, you did not have many sightings but you then had few people out there looking for them. The increase in surveillance that we have had in recent years has meant that there has been an increase in sightings. I continue to say, regarding the raw figure that Senator O’Brien quotes with some relish—you would think he is almost delighted that, because these people are coming in, he can make a political point—that many of the sightings are sightings of the same vessel two, three, four and even five times over. The real number is not quite that. But let us not argue about the figures; there are still a lot of illegal fishing vessels coming from Indonesia—far too many.
Bear in mind also that this has been happening for about 10,000 years. The Indonesians have always fished off the north-west coast of Western Australia and in the Gulf of Carpentaria, but it has become a real problem in the recent past to the extent that it is now affecting Australia’s very careful management of the fisheries in those areas. But we have to address the problem. The only way I can see that you will ever address the Indonesian fishing problem is not just by continuing to put money into our gunboats, not only putting money into increased surveillance and enforcement, not only empowering Aboriginal communities—which I am delighted to say we have worked on very closely in the last couple of years; that program is coming into place and it can be increased—but we also have to get the Indonesians on side.
Perhaps this is not the right time of the cycle to be saying this, but I have always thought that we need to be very close to the Indonesians. I know some in this chamber and in this parliament like to criticise the Indonesians, indirectly—if not directly. I think that is foolish. Indonesia is our biggest neighbour: some 200 million-plus people. I often make the point that I live closer to the Indonesian capital than I live to the Australian capital.

Senator Webber interjecting—

—And you do too; you live much closer to the Indonesian capital. We have to be good neighbours to the Indonesians, and they have to be good neighbours to us. I am sure they want to be. In my visit with the foreign minister, Mr Wirajuda, and the fisheries minister, Mr Freddy Numberi, before Christmas to discuss these issues, both these quite senior ministers indicated that they wanted to be good friends with Australia across a wide range of areas. If the fisheries issue was a needle in that relationship, they wanted to fix it up. They were both very keen do to that. A number of initiatives arose from that meeting and from a previous meeting between Mr Downer and the foreign minister. It is perhaps too much to say that we got a signed agreement, but there was a general understanding that we would have to have joint patrols along the EEZ line and, more importantly, we would have get the Indonesians on side to look for the Mr Bigs and do the sorts of things that Senator Bartlett and Senator Siewert have been, rightly, saying we need to do.
We need to track where the money is coming from to support the transport of the fish once it is brought to shore. We need people on the ground in Indonesia following those things through, seeing where the money is coming from and going to. We cannot do that. It is a sovereign country, so we can only do it if we have the Indonesians on side. I am delighted to say that in those general discussions there was a broad agreement that Indonesia would help.
We also raised the issue that I think Senator Bartlett referred to, that UNCLOS prevents the jailing of people on the high seas without agreement—I emphasise the UNCLOS terminology of ‘without agreement’. I think it is essential that we get agreement from the Indonesian government that we and they can both—it has to be a two-way street—jail in the first instance illegal fishermen apprehended on the seas between the 13-nautical mile and the 200-nautical mile area. If we got the agreement of the Indonesian government and we were able to form a treaty along those lines, we would be able to jail in the first instance.
As I said before, jailing probably is not the best outcome; prevention is the best outcome. Again, I think Senator Siewert or Senator Bartlett may have raised this issue. If they have not, others have said to me over a number of years: ‘These Indonesians are poor. You bring them in and put them in an Australian jail. They get a fresh set of clothes. They get the best toiletries. They get a health check they’ve probably never had in their own country. They actually get paid in some of the state jails and they actually go home having had a good look at another country free of charge and perhaps with more money in their pocket than they have ever had before.’ There are people who doubt the effectiveness of jailing.
We have to prevent them from coming and we cannot do that by ourselves. All the money in our budget would not provide us with enough gunboats and warships to do that. We have to get the Indonesian government on side and we have to work very cooperatively with them at the marine border, the EEZ line. We also have to get the support of the Indonesian government to do the work in the fishing ports in Indonesia.
We are doing a lot of work. We are doing it with the Indonesians and we have done some of this in the past. We have sent out a lot of information to Indonesian fishermen advising them what is permitted and what is not permitted, but more needs to be done. It can only be done if the Indonesian government are totally on side. I think there is a desire for them to do that and it is something the Australian government should be pursuing very forcibly.
At the estimates committees I asked the officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade whether this action was proceeding, and they assured me that it was, although I was not overly confident at the tone of their responses. I am sure that the wheels move slowly but—and perhaps Senator Abetz may be able to update us on this; my information is a little dated these days, although it is dated back to estimates committee insofar as that is concerned—it is essential that we work very closely with the Indonesian government.
I want to challenge a couple of the issues raised by other speakers. Senator Siewert, again, in spite of what I think are your party’s crazy ideas in many areas of public debate, in the area of fisheries management and fisheries protection, we have been fairly closely aligned. Your knowledge and interest in this area is something that I have appreciated. You should be aware, however, that Australia was one of the first signatories to the international plan of action on sharks. We have a plan of action and we are carefully pursuing it. Some of the state governments were a little recalcitrant coming into that plan. We eventually got them there. We are doing a lot of work in international trade measures and, in many instances, we have done that in very close cooperation with some of the environment NGOs around the world. Australia, as you rightly say—
—You should take up whales.
—I was always able to avoid the whale thing because whales are not fish; they are mammals, and it was not really within our purview—
—Senator Campbell is doing a good job.
—Senator Abetz is quite right: Senator Campbell is doing a marvellous job. Even those of you who do not appreciate Senator Campbell’s skills would have to accept that he is doing a magnificent job in trying to gather support against the Japanese. I do not think that anyone can criticise Australia in relation to our approach to whaling internationally.
There are always these sorts of comments, ‘You send gunboats down to protect Australia’s waters insofar as fishing is concerned; why don’t you do it with whaling?’ The simple answer is: where we protect patagonian toothfish with gunboats, we do the same for whaling because it is within Australia’s exclusive economic zone. Once outside that zone, we cannot help with patagonian toothfish and we cannot help with whaling either. It is the high seas, and it concerns the issue I mentioned before that really does need to be addressed at an international level. It is something that Australia has actually started that 50-year journey to try and address.
Senator Siewert mentioned regional fisheries management organisations, and I think she mentioned that Australia is at the forefront of activity to establish regional fisheries management organisations in our sphere of influence. The most recent has been the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Management Commission, chaired, I might say, very well by an Australian official, Mr Glenn Hurry. That is an organisation into which we and some of the environmental NGOs have put a lot of effort. We are now getting that new RFMO across the southern Pacific Ocean. There is work being done in the south-west Indian Ocean. Australia has been instrumental in getting the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission operational—I have often described it as being dysfunctional. We have actually achieved something along the line of getting that organisation functional and operating as it needs to operate to stop the huge overcatch of tuna in the Indian Ocean that will see the destruction of the species if the IOTC cannot address the issues.
There are a few other areas about which I want to take particular issue with Senator O’Brien. He talked about information sharing with the states. I wish Senator Abetz well in dealing with the states. He seems to have got off to a slightly better start than I did. I invited the Western Australian minister here on three occasions. On two occasions, he made the agreement to come but just did not bother to turn up, and then he criticised us for not sharing information with them. And information which did go to some of the states ended up in the newspapers, particularly that rag from Western Australia, the West Australian, where secret operations were printed on the front page. Why would you share information with these sort of people?
We have come a long way, but there is still a long way to go. This particular bill before the Senate today is another step in the journey that the Australian government is taking to beat illegal fishing whenever it occurs and to look after the marine environment. I certainly commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FOREIGN FISHING OFFENCES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-06-15,"—The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006 is the latest move by the Howard government to deal with the scourge of illegal fishing in Australian waters. There are many people in Australia who have been asking the Australian government for years to take decisive action to deal with illegal fishing. This is not something that took place overnight. Consider these figures: between 1 January 2003 and 31 March 2004, there were 1,588 sightings of possible illegal fishing vessels in Australian waters; in the calendar year 2004, there were 8,108 sightings of possible illegal fishing vessels; and in the calendar year 2005, this had jumped to 13,018 sightings. In 2003, we would have had perhaps an average of 132 sightings per month, in 2004 that had jumped to 675 sightings per month and last year that had reached the truly staggering figure of 1,084 sightings per month. At this stage, we have not been provided with any information about the number of sightings so far for this year. We can only hope that there has been a decrease.
The fishing industry, especially in Western Australia, has been raising this issue with governments for years. State and territory ministers have been raising the issue with the Commonwealth for years. I am sure that the Commonwealth agencies and departments such as Coastwatch, Customs, AFMA and the Navy have been reporting this surge of illegal fishing. Time and time again, we were assured by the Commonwealth government that they were winning the battle against illegal fishing. An almost tenfold increase in monthly sightings in a two-year period does not suggest that we are winning that battle. The surge in illegal fishing seems to actually be suggesting that we have lost the battle. It seems to be suggesting that we have run up the white flag, surrendered our sovereignty and declared that everything is going okay. The previous minister for fisheries, Senator Ian Macdonald, put out press release after press release saying that we were winning the battle—I have been told that this ran to some 150 individual press releases. It is a significant admission of failure that during that time we saw monthly sightings increase nearly tenfold. With the appointment of the new fisheries minister and a range of new budget initiatives to the tune of over $300 million, we are now seriously expected to believe that we are now winning the battle.
People would be more than justified in being cynical in response to the government’s latest announcements on dealing with illegal fishing. Illegal fishing affects this country in numerous ways. Firstly, our fishing resources have been ravaged by illegal fishers, putting at risk the Australian industry and Australian jobs. As I have heard people from the fishing industry say time and time again: ‘We are sticking to our quotas based on the best science available to ensure a sustainable industry. We are sticking with the government’s rules, yet we think they are letting the stocks be destroyed by illegal fishing.’
Although it may not be as significant an industry as some others in my home state of Western Australia, fishing is still a significant employer and earner of export income. We cannot expect our Australian fishing industry to comply with the rules when we do not protect the fishery in the first place. There is a fundamental flaw in the logic of sustainable resource management when it only applies to those people who are operating legally. A sustainable catch determined by the best data available is meaningless when our fish stocks are being pilfered by illegal foreign fishing.
Secondly, there is an incredible risk to the viability of Indigenous communities who are reliant on the sea for their livelihoods. Labor members and senators have recently travelled to communities such as One Arm Point in Western Australia and Maningrida in the Northern Territory. While there, they were shown the damage being done to Indigenous economic self-determination by illegal fishing. For the government to talk about economic self-sufficiency for Indigenous communities and then act inadequately to combat illegal fishing would be seen by many as a disgrace. There is no point advocating economic self-sufficiency when we fail to protect that resource. Trochus shell harvesting is at risk of collapse for the Indigenous community at One Arm Point, because we as a nation have failed to protect the reefs from pillaging by foreign fishing.
Thirdly, there is a risk to the biodiversity of our country. There are numerous reports of illegal fishing vessels arriving in Australia, landing and setting up camps. These vessels are not only carrying crews but in some cases animals, such as chickens, dogs and even one report of monkeys. Given the efforts we make in this country to protect our biodiversity through stringent quarantine systems, it is somewhat disheartening to realise that we are not doing enough to prevent foreign vessels carrying animals from landing in Australia. It is no good only enforcing Australian quarantine regulations at our major cities and towns when we fail to protect ourselves around the entire country.
It is not just the risk of the introduction of pests and disease that is affecting our biodiversity. Illegal fishing is killing anything and everything that can be used as bait. One of the officials of the Western Australian fisheries department told the Labor members and senators that, when fisheries officers were examining overhead photos, they could not work out what the circular patterns were in the water. Upon investigating, they realised that turtles had been staked through one of their flippers and left tethered to an outcropping or pole. Once their fishing was finished, the illegal fishers would then return, grab the turtles and go home.
I am not using these examples as a means of demonising illegal foreign fishing vessels and their crews; I am demonstrating that these problems have arisen because we have let it get to this stage. Where once most foreign fishing vessels were only operating in very limited areas along our northern and western coastlines, the evidence now suggests that they are travelling further and further along our coastline. Reports from representatives of the fishing industry in Western Australia are now suggesting illegal fishing vessels are appearing well down the Pilbara coast. Where only a few years ago most of the incursions were along the Kimberley coast, it is now clear that, as our fishing grounds are being devastated by illegal fishing, they are now travelling further to maintain their catch. There are now also reports of incursions along the Queensland coast.
This legislation will amend the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to provide for increased fines and custodial sentences of up to three years imprisonment for persons caught fishing illegally in those parts of Australia’s territorial waters that are subject to Commonwealth fisheries jurisdiction. These new penalties will apply to fault based indictable offences and not to strict liability offences. The coverage of these changes will apply to that area beyond the three-mile nautical state and territory jurisdiction and the 12-mile Commonwealth jurisdictional limit. Our exclusive economic zone, which extends from 12 nautical miles to its 200-mile limit, is excluded from these provisions because, as a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, we are prohibited from having a custodial penalty regime on fishing offences beyond the 12-mile sea limit. I, like many other Australians, wonder about how this tough new regime is going to work. There may very well be over $300 million allocated over four years but, when there are over 13,000 sightings—over 1,000 a month—I am concerned that, even if we double our apprehension rate, we are still going to face a significant incursion into Australian waters. The member for Flinders in the other place said:
We will destroy the practice of illegal fishing and we will not stop until we have achieved that.
I am not interested in being told that this new package will do that because, like many representatives of the fishing industry in Western Australia, I have heard all of that before. Every time that the issue comes up, the government comes into this place and thunders on about how its latest initiative will solve the problem. Yet the illegal fishing vessels still come.
There is a strategy that should be followed to finally deal with the issue of illegal fishing. Firstly, we must ensure that our national rights and sovereignty are defended to the absolute limits of our capability. We must as a matter of course seize any vessel that is engaged in illegal fishing. Those fishing vessels must be destroyed either at sea or at destruction points on land. Of course there are risks associated with bringing vessels onshore for destruction, specifically the risk of marine pests that may be carried on foreign fishing vessels. However, we must not allow this to deter resolute action. The only way to stop this problem is to destroy the vessel. We must not make the mistake that we made with the administrative forfeiture where we would intercept the vessel at sea, seize the fishing gear and allow the fishing vessel to leave, because, when we do that, they go back to their home ports, take on new fishing gear and return straight back to Australian waters. People in the industry liken this approach to that of Rex Hunt catching fish: catch, kiss and release. It might make a good fishing program on television, but it is a pretty pathetic fishery protection program.
Secondly, we must create a single agency with responsibility for dealing with the problem. The current shared approach of involving numerous government departments, agencies and the defence forces has not worked up until now. A single agency with the jurisdiction to enforce any fishery, customs or quarantine power with dedicated patrol platforms, including aircraft, is needed. There must be one agency that can report back to this parliament and the Australian people about what is being done to deal with illegal fishing. To give some idea of the difficulties that the current multiagency approach provides, you only have to try to find your way through the maze at Senate estimates. To get the complete picture, you have to ask questions of AQIS, Customs, Defence, AFMA, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and sundry other agencies. If the government is serious about smashing illegal fishing, the time has come to put one agency in charge with dedicated patrol platforms to ensure that illegal fishing vessels are intercepted whenever and wherever they are breaking Australian law.
Thirdly, we must accept the reality that some work needs to be done to provide a different form of livelihood for those people engaged in illegal fishing. The bosses who control the illegal fishing industry to our north are making a fortune, but unless we work with the Indonesian government—and I agree with Senator Ian Macdonald—and through agencies like AusAID to develop reasonable alternative jobs then we cannot be surprised that more and more people are prepared to engage in illegal fishing. When you earn a pittance and the opportunity exists to earn a much larger income by engaging in illegal fishing then of course the bosses have no difficulty in sourcing recruits. Imprisonment and other penalties will, of course, make it less attractive. But you have to ask: ‘What would have happened if we had acted sooner rather than later?’ One of the tests of national sovereignty is to be able to defend yourself and your interests. We have failed that test for too long when it comes to illegal fishing.",SENATE,<title>FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FOREIGN FISHING OFFENCES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-06-15,"—The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006 is before the Senate and is part and parcel of a comprehensive suite of activities undertaken by this government to fight the scourge of illegal fishing. The contribution of honourable senators, for which I thank them, has highlighted the difficulty that Australia currently faces. Unfortunately, it seems that some senators opposite revel in the numbers and the difficulties that we as a nation face in that regard, and on occasions they misrepresent that which actually occurs. Just for the record: yes, there were 13,000 sightings last year, but it is accepted by most sensible commentators that the vast majority of those were double, treble and sometimes quadruple sightings.
Even if there were only 1,000 incursions, that would be 1,000 too many. There has been talk about the ‘catch and release’ suggestion, the legislative forfeiture that Senator Webber just referred to. She was at estimates, so she would have heard that the reason for that is largely operational. When you come across a couple of illegal fishing vessels and you only have one vessel to apprehend with, you have a choice. Do you apprehend one vessel and let the other one go, or do you undertake a legislative forfeiture on one and apprehend the other? I think most people would accept that doing the legislative forfeiture on one vessel and catching another is a better result than only catching one vessel. So far this calendar year, we have already apprehended 185 foreign fishing vessels and we have undertaken legislative forfeitures in numbers of, I think, the high 40s. That shows the resolve with which the government is approaching this issue—and that is before the new moneys become available from the budget announcements.
With regard to the MOU box, an area off Western Australia that has specific significance for traditional fishers from Indonesia, a memorandum of understanding exists between Australia and Indonesia. It is not legally binding, but I think we in this place would all agree that it is morally and politically binding. That memorandum of understanding specifically states that only traditional fishers are allowed in that area. ‘Traditional fishers’ means those without a motorised vessel. Therefore, motorised vessels in that area are apprehended and dealt with as though they were in any other part of the Australian fishing zone. This has been raised from time to time by fishers. I am delighted that the Western Australian Fishing Industry Council, after its meeting with Mr Downer, understood and accepted to a large extent that the abolition of the MOU box would, in practical terms, make no difference and the suggestion that the MOU box is being used as an avenue or a safe haven to make incursions into Australian water is incorrect.
Senator O’Brien once again raised the old hoary suggestion of the coastguard. I think the Labor Party are now on about version six of their coastguard. Each time they are challenged about the detail, they run away and decide on a different type of red to paint on the side of the vessels. Other than that, they do not really have much else to offer the Australian people. So the Labor Party decided on a task force to have a look around the country and make some suggestions. Mr Beazley, in his new aggressive, angry Beazley persona, had to indicate to the Australian people that the Labor Party’s policy on illegal fishing would be to sink them at sea. How hairy chested can you get? He said, ‘We would sink their boats at sea.’ When asked about it, he said, ‘Yes, we would take the people off.’ That is a good start. But would you take the fuel, the engines, the fishing nets and the fishing lines off the boats before sinking them? Had I been a journalist, with respect to that great profession, those are the sorts of questions I would have asked Mr Beazley. You would have seen him like a fish on deck, flip-flopping and floundering around, because he would not have known the answers.
If the nets go down with the boats, they will turn into ghost nets and turn our northern waters into a veritable junkyard. Sometimes we sink boats at sea—for safety and other reasons. But, if a boat is in a sufficient state, we try to destroy it on land. The reason for that is that, if you destroy at sea, bits and pieces can still float ashore and be a quarantine risk. We talk to the fishing industry, and they do not really appreciate getting their lines and nets caught up in bits and pieces of sunken Indonesian vessels. Even in the area of fisheries, Mr Beazley finds it difficult to come up with a sensible, comprehensive policy. No wonder he is struggling in other areas, such as workplace relations—but we will not go there this evening.
The package that Senator O’Brien sought to belittle has been welcomed overwhelmingly by the fishing industry, by the Northern Territory News, by the West Australian—what is it called? That is right, the West Australian!
—Yes, the West Australian! I won’t tell them you forgot their name.
—Can I say that Senator Ian Macdonald, who contributed in this debate as well, did a very good job in laying the groundwork for what we are now doing as a government.
We have been told by those on the other side that we should be doing more with the Indonesians. Yes, we should, and that is a good idea. We will always try to do more, but I cannot help but reflect, even in this area of relations with Indonesia. When Mr Howard was first running for the prime ministership in 1996, what was the great throwaway line of the Labor Party? It was that if Mr Howard were to become Prime Minister, we would not be able to have a good relationship with Indonesia. The relationship would be hopeless. Yet today at question time and all this week we have been told that our relationship with Indonesia is so good that we seem to do everything that Indonesia wants. The Labor Party cannot have it both ways on these issues.
I think Senator Bartlett asked why we do not have an agreement with Indonesia under UNCLOS—the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. If two neighbouring countries have an agreement in relation to imprisonment of illegal fishers then you can imprison them. The simple reason that we do not have an agreement is that the Indonesians will not agree. But, as Senator Ian Macdonald indicated, when he was undertaking those discussions with Indonesia, Indonesia revealed that they have in their territorial zone penalties for imprisonment. That is what this bill now does: it imposes the potential for incarceration, subject to judicial discretion, on those caught in the 12 nautical mile zone.
The suggestion was made by one senator—I think it may have been Senator Webber—of what would have happened if we had acted sooner. I simply say that no Labor Party senator has ever suggested that we ought to have this sort of legislation. It is a genuine government initiative, which I am delighted that Labor supports. But it is a bit rich to come in here and say that we should have acted sooner when no Labor senator made the suggestion before we as a government put it on the table.
Senator Bartlett then went on to talk about refugees. I will not dwell on that in any length other than to say that I reject his assertions in relation to the government’s policies. This evening we are dealing with the scourge of illegal fishing.
Can I move to Senator Siewert’s speech. ‘Just throwing people into jail is not the answer’ was one of her comments. I agree. What you need is a comprehensive package, and that is exactly what we are implementing. This is just part of the comprehensive package.
The suggestion was that we should try to target the Mr Bigs. Seizing their assets is exactly what hurts the Mr Bigs, because they are the ones who fund these boats. Sure, there are poor villagers onboard but, if you capture enough of their vessels, the economic viability of the total operation becomes so prejudiced that hopefully they will say that it is no longer economically viable, and as a result they will stay out of our waters. We also intend, as Senator Ian Macdonald indicated, to charge and pursue the masters and captains of the vessels. Juveniles, for example, will be sent home.
Senator Siewert asked—I think rhetorically—how many will be charged under this new law. I tell you what my hope and aspiration is: none, because I would like to think that nobody would ever enter our waters illegally. I think that is a bit of a naive hope, but how many people actually get that close to our shores remains to be seen. I think it will be a major deterrent because there have been reports of Indonesian fishers, in particular, seeking to enter our waters and coming on land or into our inland river system overnight and then going back out during the day. Now, if they are caught close to shore, they will face that extra penalty, and hopefully that will be an extra disincentive for them to come close to shore. What are the impacts going to be? It is hard to tell. I would like to think that this will be a deterrent to Indonesian fishers taking risks close to our shores.
I cannot help myself but mention that Senator Siewert was trying to take issue with the term ‘fisherman’. She is so politically correct that she wants the non-gender based term. But, of course, that is where people in this place and around Australia who are the politically correct mania police, as I call them, just fall over themselves—
—The mania police?
—Their politically correct mania turns them into a police force, and they try to prosecute every potential offence. If you look at the history of the word ‘fisherman’, the ‘man’ bit comes from ‘manus’, the Latin, which is ‘hand’. So really the term is ‘fisherhand’ and therefore it is non-gender-specific and does not refer to the fisherperson’s sex. Nevertheless, if it made Senator Siewert feel somewhat purer for having said that, then I hope that she feels good about that this evening—albeit she is technically incorrect.
I have already thanked Senator Ian Macdonald for his involvement in this issue over many years. He has made a fantastic contribution and I am delighted that I can put that on the record this evening. He asked a few questions about what we are doing in Indonesia. Part and parcel of our new package is $1.2 million which is set aside for a public information campaign in Indonesia to try to dissuade them from undertaking activities, and part of that campaign will warn the villagers of the huge penalties that they now potentially face. Our package also includes an extra $6.4 million for staffing at our embassy in Jakarta.
Senator Webber made a contribution, and I accept her interest in this area, but I think I have already corrected her in relation to the administrative forfeiture matter that she raised. She also suggested that we needed one single approach on this. We do have that in the Joint Offshore Protection Command. When people are out on our waters, we do not want them to be alert only for illegal fishers; we want them to be alert for customs, for quarantine, for illegal immigration and other matters. That is why it is good to have a Joint Offshore Protection Command that takes all these things into account. It shows that the government is able to deal with all these things with the expertise of all those departments.
I think I have dealt with the matters raised by honourable senators during the debate. I thank them for their contribution and their support for this legislation.

Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-06-15,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

The Labor Party welcomes this bill.
It does, after all, implement the policy that the Federal Labor Party and my colleague, the member for Hunter, took to the 2004 election, and I quote:
“In natural gas, industry remains engaged in battle with the ACCC over a range of regulatory issues. Australia still lacks all the necessary ingredients for the development of a mature and fully competitive gas market and yet again, Parer’s recommendations have been ignored.
No initiatives have been taken to tackle the various barriers to enhancing upstream competition and nothing has been done to address regulatory risk, whether real or perceived. ... Labor will retain a strong Gas Code but, consistent with the Parer Review, will pursue two significant changes to provide greater certainty for new investors. We will provide for binding and up front coverage rulings and binding up front agreements locking in key regulatory parameters for extended and agreed periods of time.”
But this bill has been a long time in coming and it still does not go far enough in implementing the many energy market reform measures that still remain outstanding.
The bill will amend Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to provide new incentives for investment in gas pipelines, or more accurately, to remove existing barriers to investment.
There are two mechanisms.
The first is an ability to obtain an upfront ruling on whether full price regulation in the gas access regime should apply to a new pipeline.
If a pipeline does not meet the coverage criteria, it will be granted a full exemption for 15 years—called a binding no-coverage ruling.
The second mechanism is a price regulation exemption, also for 15 years, for new pipelines bringing foreign natural gas to Australian markets, subject to certain obligations.
Both mechanisms involve a prior competition and public interest assessment by the National Competition Council before a final Ministerial decision can be made, and that is a sound accountability mechanism.
They are welcome mechanisms to encourage investment in gas supply and gas transmission infrastructure for Australia’s future.
And they are much needed.
Australia is a gas rich nation with over 140 trillion cubic feet of known reserves and we have been finding gas faster than we have produced it for the last 20 years.
But most of it is remote from markets.
Ninety five per cent of Australia’s natural gas resources are in the remote northwest, but 90% of Australia’s population live on the eastern seaboard and most of the country’s energy-intensive job-creating industries are in the southwest and the east.
I can’t put it more starkly than that.
That is why we need to be thinking about strategic national energy infrastructure today and promoting investment in things like natural gas transmission.
Natural gas is also the best transition fuel for a lower carbon economy with proven reserves more than capable of meeting the nation’s energy growth needs over the next few decades.
We have to get more of it into the energy mix, along with renewables and cleaner coal.
That means:
Enhancing the competitiveness of gas in the domestic market;
Achieving greater interconnection of major supply and demand hubs; and
Expanding domestic gas markets in electricity generation, process energy, gas to liquids and chemicals.
The opening up of new markets for natural gas is critical to underpin the development of remote gas production, processing and pipeline infrastructure for future gas supply security.
Without investment in that infrastructure today, Australia’s gas resources could be too expensive to get to market in the future and be locked away forever or destined only for export markets as LNG.
In Mr Howard’s Australia it’s commercial to get gas to Shanghai but not to Darwin or Sydney.
Nor can we assume that gas exports will necessarily create additional domestic industries or energy infrastructure.
More needs to be done to develop value-adding gas chemicals and gas-to-liquids industries and expand domestic gas infrastructure to complement the LNG industry.
Australia’s competitors in the global gas market, like Qatar, are way ahead of us already.
How do we address this?
Well, this bill goes some of the way towards removing the impediments to increased investment in interconnection and barriers to gas-on-gas competition.
The private sector now owns the majority of Australia’s gas transmission pipelines and substantial private sector investment will be required over the next decade and beyond.
It is in our national interest to encourage, not deter, this investment and that is why the provisions of this bill are welcome.
Whilst pipeline infrastructure developed since the last 1990s (Eastern Gas and SEAGas) ensured continuity of gas supply following the Moomba incident, it is clear that more could and should be done to facilitate linkage of uncommitted gas supplies to markets, improving security and reliability of supply as well as encouraging gas-on-gas competition.
The absence of a carbon price signal is also undermining the competitiveness of gas, thereby holding back demand and investment, and forcing regulatory intervention.
Consequently, in this looming crisis, Labor accepts the need to provide greater certainty for investors as gas plays catch-up in the market.
Regulatory burdens are growing not shrinking, and competition regulators are under increasing pressure to provide long-term income-guarantees for infrastructure investors.
The existing cooperative gas access regime has created barriers to efficient investment in new pipeline infrastructure and this bill will encourage more efficient investment and provide investors with regulatory certainty.
The bill also recognises the additional complexity of international gas infrastructure projects like the PNG gas pipeline and provides investors with regulatory certainty.
Both mechanisms will have a positive impact on securing investment in gas pipeline infrastructure for Australia’s long term energy security needs.
But as I said before, energy market reform is happening too slowly. Let’s look at where COAG has got to so far this year.
Whilst the commitment to progressive national roll out of smart meters from 2007 is to be commended, it is heavily qualified and only time will tell whether the initiative is truly national.
Beyond that, we are promised a recommitment to earlier COAG reform proposals and a new “high level, expert” Energy Reform Implementation Group.
This new committee is due to report back to COAG before the end of 2006 on a range of energy market issues including options for a national grid, structural weaknesses in the electricity market, and financial market measures to support energy markets.
What the communique doesn’t say is that this new committee is the Prime Minister’s latest attempt to address the inertia of his energy Minister, the Ministerial Council of Energy, and the National Electricity Market Ministers Forum on real energy policy issues.
They have done virtually nothing over the last almost five years.
The fact is we are no further advanced on national energy market reform than we were when the Parer review was announced in June 2001 along with the establishment of the MCE and NEM.
The Parer review was released in December 2002 and only a handful of its recommendations have ever been implemented.
It was August 2004 when the Productivity Commission Review of the Gas Access Regime was released and COAG now promises us a response by the end of 2006—a full two and a half years later.
After Parer in 2002, it took until July 2004, with legislation introduced in mid June 2004 at the eleventh hour, to set up the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission, and then it took another year to agree on who would head it, where it would be located, and how it would interface with the ACCC, with operations not actually commencing until July 2005.
This government’s answer to the problem is to go back to June 2001 and make the same mistakes again—a new national body, a review of the same issues, and still no action or leadership.
That’s what is really needed—action and national leadership. Well over a year ago I said, and I’ve said it many times since:
“Internationally competitive supplies of energy are critical to Australia’s global competitiveness in a range of manufacturing and value adding industries and while the success of the reforms of the 1990s cannot be denied, nor can the fact that much more needs to be done.
COAG recognised this by commissioning the Parer Report, but little action has been taken by this government.
The Parer report identified all the deficiencies in our energy markets but barely any of its recommendations have been implemented.
Our electricity and gas sectors remain burdened by excessive regulation, overlaps in regulatory roles, slow and cumbersome code change processes, anti-competitive marketing practices, poor market design and poor, if any, planning mechanisms.
It’s time for this government to get moving on both the Parer recommendations and the Productivity Commission recommendations.”
And I recall that my colleague, the member for Hunter, also said this many times during the course of the last Parliament when he was the Shadow Minister responsible for energy.
Let me say that one of the biggest issues for the natural gas industry is the expansion of its markets.
And this is a big issue for Australians too because natural gas is part of the answer to their concerns about petrol prices and supply security.
Of course the government is out of touch with the triple whammy facing Australians around the kitchen table these days—higher interest rates and mortgage payments, industrial relations changes undermining their wages and conditions, and record high petrol prices.
This government treats tax cuts as “go away” money for motorists worried about petrol prices.
It did nothing in the budget to bolster Australia’s fuel supply security or look to the long term.
And it has done nothing in this bill.
The fact is that without developing alternative fuels industries in Australia, we will increasingly be hostage to supplies from the Middle East, West Africa and Russia.
I don’t need to spell out the implications of that for energy security.
Australians want to know that their governments, and the companies with stewardship of their resources, have a plan to secure their energy supplies for the future at affordable prices.
But there is no plan and they are far from “relaxed and comfortable” about that.
The Howard government has failed Australians by letting the opportunity pass to create the right fiscal and regulatory environment to make gas to liquids a new industry option and a new fuel supply source for Australia.
The answers are there for Mr Howard and Treasurer Costello in Kim Beazley’s Fuels Blueprint just as they were on gas pipeline investment in Labor’s 2004 election policy.
If the government was serious about the gas industry and gas market reform, they could have seriously reviewed the PRRT regime and considered special treatment of capital investment in gas to liquids fuel projects and associated gas production infrastructure.
The Commonwealth could have faced up to some responsibility for resource related infrastructure instead of passing the buck to the States.
Above all, they could have sent a clear signal to Australians that they are interested in their future fuel supply security and to the industry that this should be part of Australia’s national gas strategy.
Australia’s competitors in the gas industry are way ahead of us, particularly in the Middle East where countries like Qatar, already a formidable competitor for the Australian LNG industry, are developing GTL projects making clean transport fuels for the global market.
It is now almost five years since the government’s own GTL Task Force highlighted the potential significance of a GTL industry to Australia’s economy saying it could underwrite offshore gas supply infrastructure to bring forward the possibility of major new domestic gas pipelines to connect the national market, increase domestic gas competition and energise gas exploration.
The potential benefits of course go beyond unlocking new resource wealth and creating new industry, more jobs and more exports—they include the opportunity for Australia to address this most pressing of problems, our future transport fuel security.
But five years later no action has been taken.
There is a long list of failures that I could point to on energy market reform—the issues I’ve discussed today are just some of them.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-06-15,"—The Democrats will be supporting the Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. This bill implements a number of changes, including the Gas Pipelines Access (Commonwealth) Act 1998 and the Trade Practices Act 1974 in relation to the conferral of functions and powers on the National Competition Council and the Commonwealth minister under the cooperative gas access regime. It amends the Trade Practices Act 1974 to accommodate incentives for new pipelines in the cooperative gas access regime which were recently introduced in the South Australian parliament, and it allows the Australian Energy Regulator to apply to the Federal Court for a disconnection order. It amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 and the Trade Practices Act 1974 to correct certain incorrect references in relation to the application of the cooperative electricity regime. Finally, the bill repeals the Pipeline Authority Act 1973.
As I understand it, these amendments have the support of the states and the industry, and I must say that it is good to see the federal government and the states working jointly through the Ministerial Council on Energy to make improvements to the gas regime in Australia. Gas will, of course, play a very important part in the early mix of low-carbon-emitting energy sources as Australia aims to achieve that 60 per cent reduction of 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. However, this is only part of the job that needs to be done with respect to energy reform in Australia, and it is our view that this government has monumentally failed in delivering Australia a sustainable energy policy for the future.
The debate on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change has been around for more than three decades. Over a decade ago, most countries joined an international treaty, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to begin to consider what can be done to reduce global warming and to cope with whatever temperature increases are inevitable. The federal government showed some promise early on with the announcement in late 1997 of the establishment of the mandatory renewable energy target, known as MRET, to help foster the renewable energy industry in Australia. But since then, the government has abandoned any sensible policy on energy. It was not until 2004, less than two years ago, that this government produced an energy white paper—its blueprint of how future energy goals would be met.
The Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee examined the government’s energy white paper in 2005. The report of the Democrats-chaired committee, Lurching forward, looking back, criticised the energy white paper, saying that it did not go far enough and it lacked a viable time frame for success. The paper did not contain effective planning for the future needs of Australia in energy supply, in greenhouse emission reductions or in alternative renewable energy development. The report made a small number of achievable recommendations, none of which, as I understand it, have been implemented.
This government continues to refuse to ratify Kyoto, an international and legally binding agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, and instead opted for the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, which has no price signals, no targets and no real plan for reducing greenhouse emissions. In late 2005 the government signalled it was looking to carbon capture and storage from coal-fired power as a primary means to address greenhouse emissions. Then, of course, earlier this year the government announced major funding for so-called clean coal technology. This is despite evidence that underground storage is expensive and highly risky as the technologies are unproved in the context of stationary energy generation, not expected to be developed and available for implementation until the middle of the next decade and will lead to an increase in energy costs.
And this year the Minister for the Environment and Heritage blocked two wind farms for very suspect, spurious reasons. This action has effectively brought to a halt any further investment in wind power in Australia. The chief executive of ActewAGL, Mr John Mackay, said on ABC radio:
Unless ... Federal Government ... stops playing politics at a local level, any wind farm, including ours, has got to be a doubtful proposition ...
If this was not bad enough, the whole renewable energy industry is under threat because the government continues to refuse to expand or increase the mandatory renewable energy target which it established nine years ago. This was supposed to raise Australia’s renewable energy generation to 12 per cent of the total electricity production, but of course it has gone backwards—it is now, even under MRET, lower than it was before MRET began. That is because, instead of increasing our renewable energy by two per cent progressively, a fixed target of 9,500 gigawatt hours was established, which turned out to be a gross underestimation of what two per cent might look like in 2010.
Only last month the Senate inquired into a government bill that makes minor changes to MRET. Every business and industry representative unequivocally said in their submissions that renewable development had now stalled because sufficient projects already exist to fully deliver the 9,500 gigawatt hour target. All of them called for an increase and an extension to MRET. But the government stubbornly refuses to do anything about this situation, proclaiming how successful it has been.
Then we have, less than four weeks later, the Prime Minister announcing an inquiry into nuclear power. Nuclear energy was not even a vague consideration in the government’s energy white paper, and that was just two years ago. How Australia can possibly plan for a reduction of 60 per cent in our greenhouse emissions by 2050 when it cannot even see two years ahead is anyone’s guess. But now, suddenly, after a visit to the US President, George Bush, our Prime Minister is talking about nuclear power as the way forward to reduce greenhouse emissions. I wish the many much more sound recommendations of the Senate inquiry into greenhouse issues a few years ago had received his undivided attention—the sort of attention that has obviously been paid to our great and powerful friends. Despite empirical evidence showing that nuclear power is not economically, socially or environmentally acceptable as a means to address climate change, our Prime Minister has set up a task force stacked with pro-nuclear members who may compare its viability against coal but not stray beyond that to renewable energies.
We have another bill before the Senate this week, the Fuel Tax Bill 2006, which is part of a package designed by Treasury—which knows so much, of course, about greenhouse—which will destroy the renewable biofuels industry in this country. I should also mention that we have various states implementing their own greenhouse gas abatement price signals and emissions trading schemes because the federal government refuses to establish a national scheme. In fact, there was a scheme put together by the Australian Greenhouse Office some years ago, and that would have provided the groundwork for us to proceed with a national plan. But no, it is not just gathering dust; it is very much in the too-hard and not-to-be-interested-in basket.
All in all, Australia’s approach to climate change is laughable and, frankly, an international embarrassment. If I hear the minister talking about how much has been done to reduce greenhouse gases and mentioning yet again the appliance labelling for water efficiency—which in fact the Democrats pushed the government into doing—as one of the key climate change measures I think I will scream! Climate change and our energy future is a very serious economic, social and environmental issue for Australia, and the federal government has no long-term sustainable plan to address it. The International Energy Agency has concluded that environmental sustainability is Australia’s biggest single energy policy challenge.
The issue of energy is being dealt with in at least six different departments by this government: the Department of the Environment and Heritage; Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources; the Department of Education, Science and Training; the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; Treasury; and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade—and no doubt the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. We have various bodies responsible for research, monitoring and regulation of various energy related areas, such as the Renewable Energy Regulator, the Energy Market Commission, a number of CRCs, NEMMCO, ABARE and Geoscience Australia—and that is just to name a few.
But there appears to be no coordinated, holistic approach to sustainable energy solutions and implementation and no-one is actually delegated to undertaking independent research and public consultation within a national framework. In fact, the only body that was close to understanding those kinds of activities, the Australian Greenhouse Office, once proudly acclaimed on the world stage as the first such department in its own right, was shunted back into the Department of the Environment and Heritage as a mere division. We do not hear very much from the Australian Greenhouse Office now, as a result of that.
Both the Productivity Commission and the Business Council of Australia argue that the current lack of a long-term national policy framework on climate change is impeding investment decisions in Australia’s energy infrastructure. The Australian Conservation Foundation argues:
To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage investment in our energy system we need a strong, nationally consistent policy framework that creates a long-term price signal for greenhouse pollution and consistently supports and drives the development and deployment of new low greenhouse technologies.
That is something the Democrats have been saying for a very long time. We agree that we need this strong, nationally consistent policy framework and we believe that what is sorely needed is an independent body that can plan and coordinate sustainable energy solutions.
To this end I will be moving a second reading amendment to the Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 calling on the government to establish a sustainable energy commission. Australia cannot afford to keep addressing climate change in a piecemeal, faddish way. It is my hope that this evening the Senate, in particular the government members of the Senate, will support this amendment. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
         “but the Senate is of the view that:
         (a)    The Government should establish a Sustainable Energy Commission;
         (b)    The Sustainable Energy Commission should be responsible for:
               (i)    providing leadership and national coordination of sustainable energy policies,
              (ii)    conducting public inquiries and research on sustainable energy options and strategy,
             (iii)    advising government policy makers and stakeholders across government on sustainable energy matters,
             (iv)    monitoring and reporting on progress of sustainable energy policy and industry programs,
              (v)    monitoring international progress on sustainable energy policy, and
             (vi)    educating and disseminating information on sustainable energy”.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-06-15,"—I rise tonight to support the amendment to the Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 moved by Senator Allison for the establishment of a sustainable energy commission for Australia. The issue, as Senator Allison has outlined, is the completely ad hoc manner in which energy is addressed in Australia and indeed how industry is addressed in Australia.
We have no industry policy and no energy policy. We have a policy that simply says: ‘We don’t pick winners of any kind. We just support everything and then something might emerge from the pack.’ Whilst we say we do not support anything, we direct all the subsidies to the industries that we have known for a long time are traditional supporters of and donors to the conservative side of politics. We get the big end of town—the coal industry, the uranium industry and the mining industry generally—all supporting government policy and the government arguing there should be a level playing field when it comes to renewables but never acknowledging the extent of the subsidies that are already there for the mining industry and the oil and gas industry in particular.
The Australian Greenhouse Office has been there in theory. As Senator Allison points out, it is now part of the Department of the Environment and Heritage. That was supposed to coordinate a whole-of-government approach in relation to energy policy, and that has not occurred. In the last few weeks we have seen total confusion. The government talks about energy security. That is a critical issue, even though it was not mentioned by the Treasurer, Peter Costello, in his budget. He did not mention energy security, climate change or oil depletion as challenges to the budget. The budget died on budget night. Is anyone talking about the budget? I do not think so. Since then, the whole debate in Australia has been focused on energy issues.
The issue of energy security is seen by the government simply in terms of, ‘Let’s make sure we’ve got enough energy to support the Australian lifestyle, the Australian way of life.’ The fact is you cannot deal with energy security without dealing with the ramifications of climate change and also the geopolitics. That brings in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, environment and all the sustainability issues. That is what is wrong with the Prime Minister’s whole push on nuclear—it fails to recognise that energy security has national security ramifications.
It was completely laughable to hear Senator Ellison talking about the fact that the government did not consider nuclear reactors as a terrorist threat. It was completely absurd. Given that every other government around the world looking at its energy strategies recognises terrorism as a concern with nuclear power stations, I find it extraordinary that the Australian government, with its supposed interest in national security and terrorism issues, failed to recognise reactors as a potential target.
The other issue with climate change is that it is the biggest national security threat that we face. It is not a security threat in terms of an invasion as such but it has the potential to disrupt the entire region. Imagine if we had abrupt climate change and massive relocation of people. There would be all sorts of issues about water shortages and food scarcity. There would be internal dislocation and movement from the Pacific. New Zealand have made it clear that they will cooperate with a number of Pacific island countries and recognise climate refugees. Australia, of course, are saying not only will they not recognise climate refugees but they will not take even the most basic mitigation measure and ratify the Kyoto protocol.
We need a whole-of-government approach to the issue of energy security, recognising that inherent in that are the issues of sustainability and dealing with climate change. If we actually had that focus, we would recognise that nuclear is a complete nonsense when it comes to energy in Australia because we do not need it, it is too slow, it is too expensive and it will not address the greenhouse gas issue in the time frame that is required. Plus, it is dangerous, which is why President Bush would like to set up a new alliance of nuclear energy supply centres around the world, and he is discussing with our Prime Minister the possibility of Australia becoming one of those nuclear fuel supply centres. That is what this debate is about, and it is about time we had some honesty about that.
It was quite refreshing to hear Senator Minchin today be honest about it and recognise that, as an economic rationalist, as he says he is, there is no way known that nuclear is ever going to be economically viable in the next hundred years in this country, even with a carbon tax. That is getting closer to recognising what the real agenda here is, and that is that the Australian budget and Australian economy are essentially dependent on corporate profits from mining and that this is about the expansion of uranium mining and the export of uranium to China and India. It is as simple as that.
I support the idea of setting up a sustainable energy commission. The UK has its Sustainable Development Commission, which looks at issues in the whole area of sustainability, and we should be doing exactly the same. We need some national coordination in energy policy and we need national coordination and prioritising in industry policy as well. We need stakeholders and the community to be involved in these discussions and we need to have a monitoring of progress on sustainable energy policies. In terms of renewable energy policy, Australia is so far behind it is embarrassing. If you look at the German experience, where they decided to move from nuclear to solar, you will see that they introduced a feed-in law. This excites many Australians when you talk to them about it. The Germans introduced a law which required energy wholesalers to purchase renewable energy from anyone who wanted to sell it to them for a fixed price and for a fixed period of time. The result of that was that people could go to their bank and borrow money in order to cover their roof with photovoltaic cells because the bank could be assured of a fixed return on the amount of energy that was sold into the grid. The result has been that Germany has made a massive shift out of nuclear and into renewable energy, solar in particular, and has created over 150,000 jobs in the process—more jobs than ever they had in the coal industry. What is more, they are generating a whole new industry sector for Germany.
The Chinese are doing the same. They have set a 15 per cent renewable energy target, making Australia’s two per cent look absolutely pitiful and ridiculous. Dr Shi has become Australia’s first solar billionaire as a result of rolling out photovoltaic technology in China—not in Australia, but in China. He has made $1 billion and given money back to Professor Martin Green at the University of New South Wales for his work there because the government does not fund the research work that is required. What an embarrassment. What a shame for this nation. Down here at the ANU we have sliver cell technology, which is reducing the cost of photovoltaics by 75 per cent. That also is a technology that is now being chased by the Germans, the Japanese and the Chinese. If we are not very careful, that technology will head overseas as well. There is example after example of the government just turning its back.
What about solar thermal? That is a fantastic technology. The CRC for coal research, in its recent paper on solar thermal, said that, for an area of 35 square kilometres of Australia, solar thermal could meet all of Australia’s baseload electricity. That is amazing. They say that it can be cost-effective with coal in seven years. Why are we talking about nuclear even for a minute when we have the potential to roll out solar thermal? It is not a pie in the sky. The US already has a 250-megawatt solar thermal station operating as we speak. The advantage of solar thermal is that it can be used in conjunction with coal as a transition strategy that removes the problems of burning coal in power stations and treats coal as a chemical to be used in association with the solar technology so that you get the baseload power.
It is extraordinary to me that we have a government that is so wedded to the dollars from coal and uranium exports and the big end of town, the whole mineral industry, that they are not looking at the clever end. In terms of the low emissions technology fund, it is going to technologies, as Senator Allison said, like carbon capture and storage, that have not been proven. By adopting that strategy, you end up with business as usual: ongoing coal mining and ongoing construction of coal-fired power stations. We have heard a lot from the government, including from the science minister, Minister Bishop, about how nuclear is supposedly cleaner and greener because it is greenhouse friendly.
I want anyone in the government—I do not mind who it is—to tell me: what is the carbon footprint of the Roxby Downs expansion at Olympic Dam? What is not being said is that currently that mine uses about 30 million litres of water a day out of the Great Artesian Basin. The expansion will see it going to about 150 million litres a day. Where are they going to get it from? They cannot get it out of the Murray River and they cannot get it out of the Great Artesian Basin. They are going to have to build a desalination plant in South Australia to desalinate water to send it up to the Olympic Dam site. How are they going to fire the desalination plant? They will either have to go with a coal-fired power station or a gas-fired power station—either way, it is a fossil fuel solution. So much for saying that uranium out of Olympic Dam is somehow going to contribute positively in relation to greenhouse. It is going to make a mega negative contribution to greenhouse—and add to that the costs of the energy involved in processing the uranium and the mining emissions that are going to come from transport fuels.
Then, of course, at the end of the day, if you look at the whole nuclear fuel cycle, you have the decommissioning of the plants. The government could not even put a dollar figure on what it is going to cost to decommission Lucas Heights. If they cannot even do that, why are they having an inquiry into this whole issue? Let us put a dollar value on that before we start, so that we get some real figures out there in this whole energy and policy discussion mix instead of misleading the Australian people into thinking this is something to do with energy security or greenhouse. It is to do with neither. It is simply to do with the government’s relationship with BHP Billiton, the export contract with China and the potential export contract with India, which of course would undermine the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
What is incredibly ironic is that the two wind farms that were signed onto by Roaring Forties in the last week are going to return, on their own, more than half of the dollar value that was expected from the estimated return on the deal from China on the uranium exports. So let’s get real here about the kind of dollars we are talking about, the mess we are going to create for future generations, and the real prospects in terms of which energy sources Australia could employ that would be sustainable, create jobs, strengthen the economy and contribute to our global responsibility on greenhouse gas emissions.
That is why I support Senator Allison’s initiative here in trying to set up a sustainable energy commission that goes across government and stops this ad hoc approach—where the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not realise that climate change is a national security issue, where the industry groups do not have any sense of the potential of these new industries to create jobs and where you have the environment department giving one set of advice in relation to wind farms. We all know full well that the wind farm decisions were based on a promise during the election campaign in a marginal seat that if the people voted for the Liberal Party the minister would stop the wind farm, and that is what happened. Then in Western Australia it is Senator Campbell’s bid to change from the upper house to the lower house and get preselection in that seat that has led to the decision on the West Australian wind farm.
—What a fantasy!
—I am glad that Senator Macdonald thinks it is a fantasy. It is certainly what people think may occur in terms of the member for that particular seat, Wilson Tuckey, and the future preselection to the lower house—but we will see in the course of events what does happen in relation to that. But that is the kind of idiocy that we are getting in climate policy across Australia and the lack of consistency and the lack of actual real concern about sustainability and commitment to it. That is why setting up a sustainable energy commission would be a very good idea, and I commend Senator Allison on this initiative. The Greens will be supporting it.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-06-15,"—I thank the senators for their comments and contributions to the Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2006, not that they had anything to do with the legislation—but we do come to expect that. The bill will in fact amend part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to ensure that two greenfields incentives for the investment in new pipelines—which were passed by the South Australian parliament on 8 June 2006—can function properly. The bill assists with encouraging new pipeline developments to meet Australia’s increasing demands for natural gas.
In relation to Senator Allison’s amendment to the legislation, the government will not be supporting the amendment. In fact, we have a body that looks after the issues that Senator Allison was looking to deal with. That body is the Ministerial Council on Energy which was established in 2001 by the Council of Australian Governments, and that body is the national policy and governance body for the national energy market. That body essentially looks at all of the issues that Senator Allison is addressing in her amendment. We will not be supporting the amendment and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2006-06-15,"—I want to take only a little of the Senate’s time to urge it to support the Australian Trade Commission Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 which makes changes to the governance arrangements of Austrade and which will establish an executive management structure with a CEO directly accountable to the minister and bring the agency under the coverage of the Financial Management and Accountability Act and the Public Service Act. This has happened following the Uhrig report into a number of government statutory authorities and officeholders, and it is part of a long-term approach by the government to have a look at which agencies are better conducted as independent statutory authorities and which should be brought more closely under the department.
I want to use the opportunity to congratulate Austrade on the work it has done over the years. I certainly hope that the new arrangements will be appropriate in continuing to support Australia’s export activities to the world. Over the years Austrade has been in charge of the Export Market Development Grants project, and a lot of Australian exporters have done a lot of work and have been assisted by Austrade. I want to briefly mention Mr Laurie White and his company Austavate International Pty Ltd that has, over many years, done a considerable amount of very good work in promoting Australia’s exports to Asia, and for doing that he has received a number of commendations over a long period of time. He has been very much involved in establishing new industries and exporting Australia’s cleverness, one might call it, to the world.
Mr White is now in semiretirement and I happened to meet him quite by chance a couple of years ago. But he has been working on a project in China. He has made an application for an export market development grant and his application has gone in. I understand those applications are dealt with by the department or Austrade in that they are assessed and, if they are appropriate for funding, they are funded and if they are not appropriate the application is rejected and reasons are given for the rejection.
Unfortunately, in the case of Austavate’s application for an EMDG, the process seems to have gone somewhat awry. On 5 December 2005 there was a routine audit, conducted by a Mr Paul Newby, of the company’s paperwork which would support the EMDG claim. As I said, I understand routine practice is that, following inspection of the papers, the application is either approved or rejected and, if it is rejected, an explanation is given. In this particular instance, this process does not appear to have been followed and there have been a number of unfortunate incidents in the way the application has been dealt with.
On the day following the inspection in Sydney—that is, on 6 December—an inspection in Hong Kong was attempted. Finance inspectors from, I assume, Austrade actually called on the offices of the Hong Kong representative. No appointment had been made, no contact had been made, with the proposed interviewee. He happened to be in mainland China at the time. But these two inspectors came unannounced to interview him. When his brother told the finance inspectors that the man they wanted to interview was in China, they said that they would get back to him. The brother obtained some telephone numbers. Unfortunately, the inspectors did not ring back, so the man to be interviewed actually rang the inspectors and was told that they were returning to Australia the next day and so they could not see him. Since then, these inspectors have demanded that the Hong Kong representative come to Australia to be interviewed with Mr White.
According to my information—and my information comes from Mr RG Strange, an ex trade commissioner and the first chairman of the Export Market Development Grants board; he has given me a complete statement about this—it appears that the processes have been rather inappropriately followed in this matter. I have written to Mr Vaile about the matter and I am sure that Mr Vaile will be pursuing the matter to make sure the application is properly assessed.
As I say, Mr White would like to get the grant, but he is philosophical about it: if he is eligible, he will get it and, if he is not eligible, his application will be rejected and he will be told the reasons for the rejection. But this process where inspectors are attempting to convince Mr White that he should actually withdraw the application, which he refuses to do, all seems to be a bit untoward. Now, it is an area that I am not particularly familiar with, but I have, as I said, referred this to Mr Vaile and I am sure he will fully investigate it.
Of course, it is all relevant to the bill before the chamber at the moment in that we are looking at a new form of operation for Austrade. Austrade has over many years done an excellent job. Its officers are excellent, all working in the interests of Australia. This one little glitch that has been brought to my attention is, I am sure, just that, a glitch, and is not representative of the work that has been done by the Austrade board and the Australian Trade Commission over many years. This bill before us today will bring in a new arrangement for the governance of Austrade, following the Uhrig report on the issue. It is a bill that I think deserves support and I urge the Senate to support it.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TRADE COMMISSION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,43,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-06-15,"—I thank Senator Ian Macdonald for his comments and his generosity about Austrade. I note the questions that he raised and I undertake to ensure that they will be answered in due course, but I also understand that Minister Vaile has indicated that he will give Senator Ian Macdonald some further information.
In the brief summing-up that I would like to do, I make the point that it was a great pleasure for me to be the parliamentary secretary for trade. I got to know Austrade very well in the brief time that I held that position. Austrade has 130 officers in 30 countries around the world. It is the primary facilitator of Australian trade. It is quite frequently the first point of contact with Australia for foreign businesspeople. I do commend the quality of the people, their training and the programs, including the EMDG scheme, which was subject to legislative change earlier this evening.
Austrade are the facilitators of an extremely busy trade agenda; there is no question about that. We are a great export country and we have a great export culture which is being developed and encouraged by Austrade. People like Australians. They like dealing with us and they like to trade with us, and Austrade certainly play a very important role in that. They have of course a very busy agenda in terms of the promotion of the FTAs that have been negotiated over the last couple of years. I think the work that they have done on the US FTA is really quite remarkable. It involved an incredible amount of work in terms of identifying the benefits on a state-by-state basis for Australia and the United States. Austrade is an extremely professional organisation and it has a lot of work to do, of course, in the general trade mix, in connection with the very busy trade policy agenda in which Australia plays a very big part—especially at this time, with the conclusion of the Doha Round of the WTO which I know a lot of senators would be interested in.
This bill that we are dealing with tonight amends the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985 by bringing Austrade under the coverage of both the Financial Management and Accountability Act and the Public Service Act and by establishing an executive management structure, with a CEO directly responsible to the Minister for Trade. I think it is probably appropriate at this time to thank, on behalf of the government, the work that the board of Austrade have done. It is a very professional organisation and it has certainly been helped in that regard by the board, but times have moved on. The amendments in this legislation are in response to the review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders conducted by Mr John Uhrig. He recommended some changes which the government has chosen to accept. The amendments do not impact on Austrade’s functions or Austrade’s delivery of export promotion and facilitation services to Australian business. I commend Austrade and I commend the legislation to the Senate.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-06-15,"—I begin by thanking the participants in the Senate inquiry into the Excise Laws Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, the Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 and the officials who were required to produce the report on such short notice. It is an increasingly common trend that legislation is being referred to committees for consideration without adequate time for witnesses to prepare submissions or for the committee to do justice to the kind of legislation that is being presented.
The report on these bills, which was tabled out of session last night, makes some rather strong conclusions in favour of reform of alcohol taxation. We received quite significant evidence in that inquiry about the need for reform of alcohol taxation, but we were cautioned about doing it in an ad hoc manner. On that basis, for expediency, I indicate that Labor is supporting the government’s amendments to these bills but is not supporting Senator Murray’s amendments, simply because we believe that there needs to be much greater scrutiny and consideration of the proposals that he has put before us.
Although a participant in the inquiry, Labor chose not to make any additional comments to the inquiry report, but I must say that recommendations 2 and 3 of the report, which relate to volumetric taxation of alcohol and excise on low-alcohol products, including some ready-to-drink products, are technically beyond the scope of the terms of reference of the inquiry that Senator Murray initiated. The bills do not propose any change to the excise rate for alcohol products, although some minor definitional issues are addressed. Consequently, any recommendation that seeks to indicate a position in relation to excise rates falls outside the scope of the inquiry report. The bills give effect to the fuel tax bills. They also involve some streamlining of excise customs classifications for alcohol and tobacco and changes to the rate of duty for aviation gasoline, which is in effect a cost recovery measure.
The Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill changes the list of products subject to excise so that only two rates of duty apply: one for aviation fuel and one for other fuels. Excise duty of 38.143c per litre and customs duty at the excise equivalent rate of 38.143c per litre will be applicable to all fuels other than aviation fuels. Relief from the incidence of fuel tax is delivered in the fuel tax bills through a provision for fuel tax credits. The bill proposes a nine per cent reduction in the duty rates for aviation gasoline and kerosene. New arrangements for cost recovery of aviation fuel have also been introduced. The reduction in the duty for aviation gasoline was announced in November 2005 as part of these changes. However, it is not clear why such a reduction is needed, and I pose that question to the minister this evening and invite him to answer it in his summation of the debate on the bills.
Schedule 1 of the bill amends the Excise Act 1901 and makes consequential amendments to a number of other acts to implement measures to streamline existing excise arrangements. It also amends the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Act 2004, adding a new fuel tax to the cleaner fuels grants scheme. Renewable diesel, which is a liquid fuel manufactured from vegetable oils or animal fats through a process of hydrogenation, is added to the definition of ‘cleaner fuel’.
Schedule 2 of the Excise Laws Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 repeals a number of acts. Coal is listed in the excise tariff and has attracted a free rate of duty since 1992. The inclusion of coal in the excise tariff means that it is an excisable product and, therefore, coal producers are required to be licensed as excise manufacturers. Coal is omitted from the excise tariff rather than included at the free rate of excise duty, as in the existing law, the Coal Excise Act, which contains licensing and other requirements. It is repealed as it is no longer considered necessary to impose these requirements on activities involving coal.
The Spirits Act, which provides for controls over the manufacture of spirits, including brandy, whisky, rum and methylated spirits, is repealed on the basis that most of the provisions it contains are adequately covered in the Excise Act or are no longer relevant to the effective management of the alcohol taxation regime. The Distillation Act, which provides controls on the distillation of spirits, including stills, distilleries, licences and fortification of Australian wine, is also repealed.
The Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill amends the Customs Act 1901 in three ways: to strengthen customs control over certain imported goods that are used in the manufacture of excisable goods; to repeal the customs related provisions of the fuel penalty surcharge legislation; and to replicate certain provisions of the Spirits Act 1906, which, again, are to be repealed.
The purpose of the Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to implement changes that are complementary to amendments contained in the Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006. These measures are designed, as the government argues, to strengthen customs control over certain goods that are used in excise manufacture and ensure that excise equivalent goods are subject to the same duty when imported as they would be under the Excise Tariff Act 1921—that is, the same products when manufactured or produced in Australia.
In the House of Representatives, the member for Hunter asked the Assistant Treasurer a number of questions. The minister has answered one of these questions in part. Minister Dutton has not proved very cooperative in answering questions put to him in the parliamentary debate on the bills. So I now ask the minister representing him in this chamber to address these matters. For the record I will put the questions again. The first question is as follows: these bills reduce the customs duty and excise for Avgas and AVTUR by nine per cent. The minister has indicated in the explanatory memoranda to these bills that reduction is part of a change to the cost recovery regime for aviation services. However it is not clear exactly how this reduction in the excise and customs duty operates as part of the new arrangements. So I now ask the minister: what is the cost to revenue of reducing excise and customs duty rates for aviation gas and aviation turbine fuel?
The second question relates to the definition of biodiesel in schedule 1 item 2 of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 and this is quite a significant change. The definition of biodiesel is now to be amended so that biodiesel includes liquid fuels manufactured by chemically altering vegetable oils or animals fats like tallow to form mono-alkyl esters. Labor now seeks information as to whether this change in definition will allow manufacturers to claim that products previously not part of the biodiesel regime will now be able to claim their products as biodiesel products with the consequent concessional excise regime applying. If the definitional change means that some products will be brought into the biodiesel net that were previously excluded, we ask the minister to provide to the Senate details of the products included and the producers of those products, and to indicate to the Senate what discussions have been held with oil companies in relation to this change. We also ask the minister to consult with his colleagues and report back to the Senate about any consultations that have been held with oil producers in relation to this definitional change.
The third question is in relation to how the new customs changes relate to biodiesel and ethanol. Will the minister now inform the Senate what is the precise schedule of changes for reduction of customs changes for these products until the full introduction of the new fuel tax regime? We are seeking a table of annual customs rates for these products up until 2020. The minister has provided details of effective tax rates. We are now seeking the precise schedule for proposed customs and excise rate changes. Given those three important questions, Labor is supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>EXCISE LAWS AMENDMENT (FUEL TAX REFORM AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-15,"—These four bills are being dealt with cognately. Like all customs and excise bills, they are difficult to both read and use. They deal with a variety of matters related to excise and customs. Parts of these four bills directly relate back to the proposals in the white paper, Securing Australia’s Energy Future, that proposed among other things a fuel tax credit scheme to replace the Energy Grants Credits Scheme. These four bills are interlinked in some aspects with the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and its accompanying consequential amendments bill.
The overall Democrat position on these four bills is not significantly affected by our views on the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 to which we are opposed. With respect to all non-fuel aspects of these four bills, the Democrats support them very fully and we support the bill overall. Although I expect they will inevitably fail because the government has not yet, hopefully, accepted low-alcohol wine and low-alcohol RTDs as policy, I will take the opportunity to propose amendments introducing such a regime for RTDs because I know that by doing so it therefore puts a schema in front of the Senate and to the broader community that they are able to consider at their leisure.
This amendment of mine continues previous amendment attempts on the same lines, and I will note for the record that I have been a persistent and consistent advocate, as has my party, for the encouragement of low-alcohol products along the same lines as beer. I am pleased to have noted that the Labor Party is supportive of that approach and I am also very pleased to record that the Liberals on the committee led by the chair, Senator George Brandis, are also of the same opinion.
My colleague and party leader Senator Allison will be dealing with the changes to the excise on fuel and its impact on the fledgling biofuels industry in debate on the Fuel Tax Bill 2006. All I will say is that it is very disappointing that the government has seen fit to disadvantage biofuels, which are just getting started and which could hold a key to help secure Australia’s energy future.
I will briefly outline the four bills dealing first with the Excise Laws Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006. The purpose of this bill is to amend or repeal several acts to effect the government’s proposals with respect to excise contained in the energy white paper and simplify and update legislative requirements relating to excise. The bill prescribes circumstances where excisable and imported inputs that may be used in excise manufacture will be removed. The prescription ability is retained. Fuel blending will be considered blending unless the resulting blend is carved out as per the Excise Act or the Fuel Tax Bill 2006. Regulations can be made to limit movement permissions granted by the commissioner of tax, where duty has not been paid. All excise licences expire and specific requirements on expiry and renewal dates are provided for. I note the government amendments in that respect, and we support those amendments.
Streamlined rules for measuring the volume, weight or alcoholic strength of an excisable good is in the bill. Anyone who possesses a tobacco leaf can be asked to account for it and pay excise duty as if it had been manufactured into excisable tobacco—a good integrity measure. Bottling of duty paid bulk beer is excise manufacture to prevent lower excise liability applying. The concessional spirit scheme is streamlined to reduce administrative burdens on users of concessional spirits and to protect the revenue. Remissions, rebates and refunds are allowed in prescribed circumstances and regulations may be made for and in relation to the Commissioner of Taxation granting approvals in such circumstances. The recovery of debts under section 60 of the Excise Act is covered by the Tax Administration Act 1953, so it is no longer needed as a section. The tax commissioner can direct licence holders to keep, retain and produce records. The bill adds a definition of renewable diesel to mean liquid fuel manufactured from vegetable oil or animal fats by a process of hydrogenation. In noting that point, I recall the somewhat macabre and humorous remark of Senator Bartlett on another bill where he said, ‘They are now replacing a tiger in your tank with a cow in your fuel.’ The bill repeals provisions and certain acts which are redundant or inconsistent with best practice regulation.
Moving to the second bill, the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, the purpose of the bill is to repeal the current excise tariff and replace it with a new one. The new law impacts in the following areas: the excise tariff is streamlined, incorporating a simpler two-tier numbering system, replacing a complex numbering system and disaggregations often based on the prospective use of the product as the basis for the classification; concessional rates of excise duty for burner fuels and free rates of duty for fuels used otherwise than as fuel are no longer available; duty-free treatment for products for use by certain parties is no longer delivered by free rates in the excise tariff; fuel from various non-petroleum sources is captured by the excise tariff—all fuels which can be used in an internal combustion engine should be subject to fuel tax, so the excise tariff captures liquid fuels irrespective of their production, method or feedstock—and a certain product which is recycled for own use is excluded; the tobacco rate will apply to all tobacco products not in stick form, including snuff tobacco—another good integrity and health measure; and certain definitions are clarified and redundant definitions and indexation provisions are omitted. These definitions relate to alcohol and fuel.
The third bill is the Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to strengthen Customs control over certain imported goods that are used in the manufacture of excisable goods, to repeal the customs related provisions of the fuel penalty surcharge legislation and to replicate certain provisions of the Spirits Act 1906, which is to be repealed, as opposed to—what do priests do? I am trying to remember the word for what priests do with people whose heads spin around.
—Exorcise.
—They are exorcising the Spirits Act 1906. Thank you, Senator Brandis.
The fourth bill is the Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to implement changes that are complementary to amendments contained in the above act. This bill amends the Customs Tariff Act by: reducing customs duty applicable to aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene, in line with alterations to the Excise Tariff Act 1921; amending schedules 3, 5 and 6 of the Customs Tariff Act to ensure uniformity of customs duties with excise rates of duty; changing the definition of mead to conform with the definition in the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999—which I wish they had not done, because I think it should have been done volumetrically; aligning the snuff tobacco rate with excise rate and imposing a duty on tobacco leaf of $290.74 per kilogram to protect the revenue—this import duty will not be payable when the tobacco leaf is used in excise manufacture; repealing items 44 and 67 of schedule 4 of the customs tariff that currently allow concessionary importation for excise equivalent goods that are for use in the manufacture of excisable goods; reclassifying biodiesel from chapter 15 to chapter 38 of the customs tariff; and implementing related and consequential amendments to the customs tariff. A fairly formidable list.
Numbers of these changes are administrative and technical and modernise and improve the customs and excise regime, and are to be welcomed as such. The minor changes to tobacco and alcohol are positive from a health, administrative and tax perspective. The real issue of contention with these bills, more so with respect to the fuel tax bills, concerns biofuels and changes to fuel taxes.
As we all know, excise is levied in part to influence consumer behaviour. That is primarily the reason why the excise on cigarettes is so high. It is an attempt to give people a reason to stop smoking, and it has been effective. In case the health benefits are not a call to action, then a hip-pocket shock might do the trick. I am pleased to see in this legislation amendments are proposed to treat all tobacco products in the same way as cigarettes. And I want to compliment the government, as I have in previous debates, for their action in introducing a far better excise regime with respect to tobacco products than we had formerly. This will have an impact on the number of people who roll their own cigarettes, not to mention chewing tobacco, both of which are heavy contributors to the rate of mouth and throat cancer in Australia.
I took the opportunity to refer these bills to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to examine alcohol related issues. The alcohol changes in the bills are supported by the various sectors of the industry, who welcome the streamlining. That was not at issue. The committee reference was, quite frankly, an excuse to address some of the larger issues which sit on the horizon and, because these sorts of bills which affect alcohol only come along once in a while, we had to take the opportunity when it came. I am grateful to both major parties for supporting that reference.
The health professionals and spirits industry have urged the government to continue incremental reform—and that makes a great deal of sense to me, given the high stakes at hand with respect to the industry concerned—in particular, as for low-alcohol beer, to introduce price incentives for low- to mid-strength ready-to-drinks. A great virtue of ready-to-drinks and the reason I and others have strongly supported them is that they are a measured drink and you get away from the barbaric practice of people just sloshing a bit of Coke into a large amount of spirit and not having a measured drink. Health authorities continue to advocate customs and excise tariff changes that embrace volumetric taxation for wine and cider and differential tax rates based on alcohol strength.
As a party, the Democrats continue to be the strongest advocates in parliament for further alcohol tax reform to encourage responsible consumption but, as individuals, I know that there are members of all parties who are very supportive of the view that further alcohol tax reform should encourage responsible consumption. In that respect, I want to put on the record my recognition of the courageous stance—and the man is not without courage in any forum—of the committee chair, Senator George Brandis, who has grasped that nettle and has made recommendations for the government to consider the long-term adoption of a volumetric tax system for all alcohol products and has recommended that the government commence planning and consultations with relevant parties as a step towards this goal. He quite rightly used a long-term approach. It is a difficult issue and needs careful management. His other recommendation in this area was that the government apply the same tax and excise treatment to low- and mid-strength ready-to-drink alcohol products as it applied to similar strength beer products. The tax and excise structure for RTDs should incorporate the three-tiered structure currently applied to beer, with the 1.15 per cent excise-free threshold that applies to beer extended to low- and mid-strength RTDs but not to full-strength RTDs with 3.5 per cent alcohol by volume and above. I thought the chair’s summary of the evidence and the support of the other parties in ensuring a unanimous report was very important, so I express my thanks to you, Sir, for your chairing of that committee.
I have worked long and hard to bring more equity into the way in which alcohol is taxed in Australia, because I have strong connections to the industry and always have. I am very much connected to their economic interests, but I also have a very strong social view, and I think taxation has a major part to play in the way in which responsible consumption can occur. Alcohol is alcohol. It is a basic principle that like goods should be taxed alike. In the case of alcohol, that is volumetrically. Discrimination in tax levels should only occur as a result of sound policy reasons, which have economic and health considerations in this particular case. In the case of alcohol, that requires tax concessions to encourage the consumption of low-alcohol beverages. We have the precedent and we know how well it works and has worked with beer. Economic support for any part of the industry, such as small wine farmers, should be via grants or rebates. It should not be via discriminatory tax exemption. I am supportive of measures to boost the economic circumstances of regional communities through encouraging tourism and through maintaining small business wine farmers on the land, but I do not think it should be done through tax exemptions; I think it should be done through grants or rebates.
One reason excise is levied on alcohol is that the government, health authorities, doctors and the road safety councils around the country all realise that alcohol impacts on the health of our citizens, it contributes to family violence, it contributes to road fatalities and it increases the strain on our health system. So any strategies which can be implemented to limit the abuse or misuse of alcohol consumed should be supported. There is no point in spending money on road safety advertisements about drink driving, healthy eating and drinking habits or on family violence issues if the excise and customs system does not play its part in pricing to affect consumption. As I have said on a number of occasions before, the government’s low-alcohol policy is insufficient, because it only focuses on beer when there are clear opportunities for incentives to encourage low-alcohol ready-to-drink beverages and wines.
As I said earlier, I took the opportunity to refer these bills to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to examine alcohol related issues. In the submission from Beam Global Spirits, they urged the government to provide identical excise tax treatment for RTDs as it currently does to low- and mid-strength beer—that is, low- to mid-strength RTDs should have access to the 1.15 per cent excise-free threshold that is currently available to all beer products, because the effect of that is to lower the price. If you lower the price, you encourage consumption of those low-alcohol products. You might think, ‘They would say that, because it works in their favour.’ Of course it does. They are going to sell more products, but this argument is supported by the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia and many other health bodies which were listed in submissions to us. In their submission, the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia pointed out:
Outside of beer, little incentive exists within the current tax system to manufacture, promote and consume reduced strength alcoholic products.
And that is not a group, as the chair said in his report, that could be seen to have its own bottom line as a motivator.
This approach, advocated by both sides of the argument, is about public health. In Australia, there are more than 3,200 alcohol related deaths per annum. More than 400,000 hospital bed days are taken up with alcohol related illness and an estimated $4.5 billion of taxpayers’ money is spent addressing alcohol related harm. That makes for a very stretched public health system. Many of the submissions to the committee pointed out that, from a public health perspective, the excise and taxation on alcohol should be based on alcohol content and the strength of drinks rather than the cost of manufacture or the method used to produce the alcohol. The policy priority for government should be—and it is not reflected in this new raft of legislation—to introduce excise taxation incentives for the low-alcohol consumption of RTDs and wines.
Although I am supporting the passage of these bills, I still take issue with the wine equalisation tax. I have been against it from the start—although I should note that my party was not—because it has created a low-price cheap alcohol cask market that is at the centre of alcohol abuse and because as a value-added tax it punishes the premium and small business bottled wine sector. The wine industry in Australia has exploded over the last 15 years and now there is a wine glut in Australia where well-known winemakers are being forced to the wall. The way in which the excise has been levied on wine is part of the problem. The way in which excise is levied on premium wines impacts on the ability of that end of the market to do well.
These customs and excise bills yet again do not address the volumetric taxation of wine. Part of the consequences of such a decision by the government is that the economics of the industry are distorted. I notice the government has again been lobbied by the wine industry to provide a bail-out, and that lobbying has been successful. I notice that in legislation soon to be in this place, the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 3) Bill 2006, one of the schedules we will be voting on is to increase the WET producer rebate from $290,000 to $500,000.
That kind of ad hoc approach to industry support seems absurd. Why not create a system in which the wine industry is assisted in a sensible, ongoing way through industry support, rather than distorting the excise system so that wine industry support ends up as a greater priority, and pricing wine casks so that the appalling alcohol abuse in some Indigenous communities, including in my state, can be lessened through price mechanisms. This is further evidence of a short-term approach being taken to a problem, rather than a long-term, considered plan to maintain the viability of the industry.
Once again, I commend the chair of the committee that looked at it for understanding that point and making it in the report. Cheap cask wine is at the centre of alcohol abuse, which in turn is a cause of family and domestic abuse. Price affects alcohol consumption. That is empirically established fact. A simple change in the way the excise is levied has the potential to change consumer habits. The government should take that step, and support it with advertisements, family assistance programs, housing programs, health programs and so on. Volumetric taxation of wine is, in the long term, the way to go. (Time expired)

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2006-06-15,"—Tonight, we are addressing the Excise Laws Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, the Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006. The main part of my speech will address the alcohol excise. These bills form part of a package of legislation required to make changes to customs and excise arrangements, and to replace the current system of fuel tax concessions with a single fuel tax credit system. The overall package will simplify the current system of fuel tax concessions and make it more transparent. I intend to make further comments on these fuel excise initiatives for business in my speech on the Fuel Tax Bill 2006. I understand the government is responding to Senator Brandis’s report on it, and we will see that bill when the government has looked at that.
This package of four bills also brings into effect certain changes for the Australian distilled spirits industry, and I wish to concentrate some of this speech on the aspects of the bills which relate to liquor. I have maintained an interest in this industry over a period of more than 20 years. I have always been a strong advocate of the Queensland sugar industry, and I have spent much of my 23 years in the Senate looking after sugar’s subsidiary value-added industries. You could not get a better example of this type of industry than Bundaberg Rum. Its base is in the electorate of Hinkler, whose political interests are looked after by my good friend and lower house colleague Paul Neville.
Distilled spirits is one of the main tertiary products of the sugar industry, and Bundaberg Rum is a company watched over closely by my National Party colleagues and me. We have implemented many changes after consulting with Bundaberg Rum and the Australian distilled spirits industry through DSICA. This package of bills takes the next step. It repeals the Distillation Act 1901 and the Spirits Act 1906. This outdated legislation is no longer required, because the provisions will be covered by the Excise Act. Early on, however, we did identify one area that the Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia and the Nationals agreed needed to be addressed.
Maturation of Bundaberg Rum and other high-quality distilled spirits in wood makes the spirit taste better. It takes all the biteys out, improves the characteristics and makes it smoother and more mature. We had to make sure the maturation legislation remained. Otherwise, we would have been taking away the current requirement that brandy, whisky and rum be matured for at least two years before they can be marketed as such in Australia. That keeps us up with the world standard. It means that you cannot make raw ethanol spirit from sugar, grains, potatoes—or whatever else contains hydrocarbon in the form of sugar or carbohydrates—and then flavour it artificially and label it rum, whisky or brandy before selling it to Australian consumers on its own or in a ready-to-drink mix.
We have fought to keep the spirit maturation rules in place over many years. In 1979, a similar proposal was rejected, and in 1986 I helped to defeat in the Senate a Hawke government proposal to remove the maturation rules. Former member of the National Party Bryan Conquest and I argued that raw ethanol had significantly lower production costs than Bundaberg Rum and its manufacturers, many of whom would enter the Australian market from overseas, would be able to spend a lot more on advertising and marketing in our domestic market and still provide a product at the same or at a lower price, disadvantaging our domestic producers.
The coalition government have proven that we will fight to maintain and improve our high-quality Australian spirit industry and companies like Bundaberg Rum that invest in and support regional communities and workers. I have asked Paul Neville about it, and he has told me that the Bundaberg Rum distillery employs 56 local workers and is the top tourist attraction in the Bundaberg area. The company is currently undertaking a $24 million expansion plan, which has included putting in new timber maturation vats at a cost of many millions of dollars.
It would have been wrong for us to have allowed such investment to effectively be negated by allowing the importation and sale of lower quality raw ethanol based spirits. I would like to thank the Treasurer, Peter Costello, on this matter. I approached him with the member for Hinkler. He listened and saw what the damage would be if the provision for compulsory maturation were removed and how the product would deteriorate also. The Treasurer moved quickly to assist Bundaberg Rum and the Australian distilled spirits industry by making sure we kept the two-year maturation period in place, and I thank him sincerely on behalf of the Distilled Spirits Industry Council and our friends at Bundaberg Rum.
I note from the submission by the Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee that they are also putting forward a strong case for gaining access to the taxation differential that is applied to low- and mid-strength alcohol beer for their low- and mid-strength alcohol ready-to-drink mixes. I support the detailed supplementary submission by the Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia and their arguments to senators, and I recognise that the submission has been examined closely and addressed by Senator Brandis’s committee. The peak body for our distilled spirits industry has put forward a well-researched and solid case that the government should give ready-to-drink spirit mixes access to the 1.15 per cent by volume excise-free threshold which applies to beer products, as well as the reduced excise rates that apply to packaged and draught low- and mid-strength beer. Recommendation 3 of the committee’s report states:
The Committee recommends the Government apply the same tax and excise treatment to low and mid strength ready-to-drink (RTD) alcohol products as is applied to similar strength beer products. The tax and excise structure for RTDs should incorporate the three tiered structure currently applied to beer, with the 1.15 per cent excise free threshold that applies for beer extended to low and mid strength RTDs but not to full strength (3.5 per cent alcohol by volume and above) RTDs.
I know that the committee’s recommendations will be considered as part of the government’s process, with my support and with Paul Neville’s support. We will certainly back these recommendations.
In the brief time I have left, I want to say that one of these bills contains a provision to make biofuel from tallow. British Petroleum is going to put quite a large plant in Queensland. Biodiesel made from tallow does not really have the properties of true biodiesel or ethanol. This bill deems tallow to be biofuel and biodiesel, with all the excise benefits that are afforded to biodiesel. I am concerned that this biodiesel really is not biodiesel, but we are blessing it and saying, ‘You are biodiesel because the Senate has said you are biodiesel.’
I am concerned that this government has put a target of 350 million litres, which is a very small amount—about 7.5 per cent of our total fuel use—on ethanol and biodiesel. That is an election commitment made by this government. I am concerned that this new biodiesel made from tallow will fill a lot of that 350 million litre target that the government has set and we therefore will not have as much ethanol going into that target. It is a pitifully small target to start with. Flooding the target with this tallow diesel—I will not call it ‘biodiesel’, because it is not, but it is renewable—and giving it the excise benefits concerns me, as there will not be much room for ethanol production in Australia. I want to put that on the record. I am concerned and I have expressed those concerns in various places where we are allowed to give our positions. I will address the other biofuels and the excise in relation to the Fuel Tax Bill 2006, which is a much more important bill as far as biofuels are concerned.
Let me say that the decision we made on Bundaberg Rum—making sure that rum, whisky and brandy would be maturated in oak casks, which take all the bitey things out and make it smooth and mellow—is one that I think is worthwhile pursuing. Some Treasury officials decided that alcohol was alcohol, even if you produce it raw out of ethanol. You could call it what you like and there would be no penalty on calling it rum. You could put a bit of raspberry juice in it and have a raspberry and rum. But it is not raspberry and rum; it is raspberry and ethanol.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-06-15,"—I rise this evening to pay tribute to Clifford Hocking AM, who passed away on Monday, 12 June. He was a shining light in the development of artistic culture in Australia, and his life was devoted to nurturing and supporting Australian and international talent.
Clifford Henry Hocking was born in Melbourne on 9 February 1932 to Olive and Fred Hocking. The youngest of five boys, he grew up in Eaglemont and, from an early age, showed an avid interest in music and books. He spent his early working life at the ABC, then travelled to Europe, Lebanon and India, returning home to set up a record store, Thomas’s, in Exhibition Street, Melbourne, which he ran until 1961. Back in London, he met up with a young Australian actor who was finishing a West End run of Oliver! and wondering what to do next. Hocking suggested a one-man show back in Australia. Between 1962 and 1969, Barry Humphries performed his first one-man shows in three national tours under Clifford Hocking’s management.
In 1965, Clifford joined forces with business partner David Vigo and, in the words of Michael Shmith of the Age, ‘redefined concert presentations and repertoire in Australia’. Over the next 40 years, under the Hocking-Vigo banner, audiences were presented with more than 160 tours of musical groups and more than 40 theatrical productions in 10 different countries. The list of artists is very impressive. It included the Alvin Ailey Dance Company, Blossom Dearie, Cleo Laine, The Chieftains, Elvis Costello, the Harlem Gospel Choir, Jacques Loussier, John Williams, Kate Cerebrano, Max Adrian, Paco Pena, the Peking Opera, Rowan Atkinson, Ravi Shankar, Slava Grigoryan, Stephane Grappelli, Slim Dusty, Stan Getz and the Soweto Gospel Choir—to name but a few.
Clifford was appointed Artistic Director of the Adelaide Festival in 1990 and of the Melbourne International Arts Festival in 1997. He presented the New York City Ballet and the Gate Theatre of Dublin, as well as commissioning the Australian Ballet and the Bangarra Dance Theatre to perform the work Rites to Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring. The Age reported earlier in the week: ‘His festivals set new standards and broke box office records. His ability to marshal programs that were at once diverse and challenging, yet also entertaining, was almost unparalleled.’
In 1990, he was made a member of the Order of Australia, in 1991 he was awarded the first Kenneth Myer Medallion for the Performing Arts, and in 2001 he was awarded the JC Williamson Award in recognition of his outstanding contribution to live entertainment. More recently, as Director of the Harold Mitchell Foundation, he supported a number of artists, including David Tong and his much-loved Australian Youth Orchestra. I understand that only last week Clifford was speaking with great enthusiasm about the foundation’s support for the work of Australian Aboriginal artists to be featured in Jacques Chirac’s new museum in Paris, the Musee du Quai Branly.
We will never know the full extent of Clifford Hocking’s contribution. To quote again from the tribute in the Age, Clifford was:
… such a part of the city’s cultural life that people are finding it hard to believe that he has left the stage.
                  …         …           …
He was inspirational to at least three generations of arts practitioners.
Clifford Hocking was a man with the courage of his convictions, an extraordinary breadth of knowledge, strong business acumen and the profound and intuitive ability to tap into the human spirit and its potential. He was known for having the best address book in the business. He will also be remembered for his towering intellect, his devastating wit, his inspirational prose, his larger than life personality, his insatiable curiosity, and the love of all the good things in life.
Forty-five years of extraordinary artistic discoveries is a record simply unparalled in the arts scene in Australia. We bid farewell to one of the finest and possibly the last of the great international impresarios. This is indeed a great loss to the arts community. My daughter, Nathalie Kemp, worked with him for a period of time and was a great admirer of his work. I am sure that all senators join with me in marking the moment in remembering Clifford Hocking.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Mr Clifford Hocking AM</title>,Adjournment,45,1
