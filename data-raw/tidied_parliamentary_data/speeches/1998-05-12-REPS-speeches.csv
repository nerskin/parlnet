Mr SPEAKER,N/A,1998-05-12,"—I inform the House of the death on Thursday, 9 April 1998, of David Bernard Vigor, a former senator who represented the state of South Australia from 1984 
 to 1987. As a mark of respect to the memory of our former colleague David Vigor, I invite honourable members to rise in their places.
Honourable members having stood in their places—
—I thank the House.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Vigor, David Bernard</title>",Condolences,1,1,speech
"Brereton, Laurie, MP",ALP,1998-05-12,"—My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, following the Indian elections and given the declared intention of the new Indian government to induct nuclear weapons into its military arsenal, what representations did you make to your counterpart Prime Minister Vajpayee registering Australia's absolute opposition to any nuclear tests and warning of the very serious consequences for international security flowing from any such action? ",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>India: Nuclear Tests</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-05-12,"—I am not aware that specific representations were made—
—You should have been.
—on my behalf. The foreign minister will speak for himself in relation to the  Department of Foreign Affairs and the foreign affairs portfolio of the government.
Mr Brereton interjecting—
—But you ask specifically in relation to me; I am giving you the answer.
But let me take the opportunity of endorsing the remarks that were made this morning on the AM program. And it passes strange, after the pathetic response of your foreign minister when you were in government about French nuclear tests, that you should have the audacity to ask me questions about the Indian nuclear tests. It took you ages to respond to tests after they had actually taken place, let alone pre-emptive warnings. It was only as a 
 result of comments that had been made by others on our side of politics that Gareth Evans was finally chased out to say something about French nuclear tests. So I would not start chasing that up.
The foreign minister has already made the position absolutely clear on our behalf, and no doubt the remarks that have been made by the foreign minister on AM this morning will be further amplified by the foreign minister during the course of the day. I understand that he has already spoken to the Indian High Commissioner to state the views of the Australian government.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>India: Nuclear Tests</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-05-12,"—by leave—I move:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith:
That this House censures the government for its failure to hold an independent inquiry into its conduct, and that of associated parties, in relation to waterfront issues, particularly in the light of the growing body of compelling evidence showing:
(1)	 potentially illegal actions in contravention of the Workplace Relations Act, and the potential exposure of the Commonwealth, and all taxpayers, to substantial damages;
(2)	 collusion between the government and Patrick Stevedoring in, and government foreknowledge of, a scheme to sack Patrick's workforce and replace it with an alternative workforce;
(3)	 collusion between the government and principals of Fynwest in, and government foreknowledge of, a scheme to train an alternative workforce, including in Dubai;
(4)	 Patrick's financial support for Fynwest Pty Ltd, despite Mr Chris Corrigan's sworn evidence to the contrary before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission;
(5)	 Mr Corrigan's own acknowledgment, at a meeting with Fynwest principals on 31 January 1998, that the actions being contemplated by the parties were `partly illegal'; and
(6)	 the findings of the High and Federal Courts that there is an arguable case that there has been a conspiracy to break the law.
Mr Speaker, in the course of his remarks today the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said to the House that he regarded the MUA as something like an imprint on the opposition and that, when all else was forgotten, we stood for the MUA on the waterfront. I do not think that on this sorry episode that will be anybody's political epitaph as far as this issue is concerned.
There are several phrases that stand out, but I think that the phrase that will stand out will be that by Mr Corrigan that is stamped on the forehead of the government—`No, no, partly 
 illegal.' That will be the take-out from this particular sorry episode in Australian industrial relations history.
This censure motion is relevant of course on a number of grounds. We have all seen, and the public has had an opportunity to inspect, the public record now in relation to what has been done by this government in cahoots with the owners of Patricks to illegally deprive workers of their right to work. We have all seen that and, whatever the Prime Minister might say, there are ten judges who have come to a conclusion that there is a case to answer as far as these matters are concerned. We have all seen that.
One thing that all Australians including this opposition firmly believe in is the requirement for reform and competition on the waterfront. What the government is now trying to do is to wrap around itself a position that every Australian agrees with—including those on this side of the House—as an excuse to cover what has been one of the most manifestly incompetent and malevolent episodes in Australian industrial relations and political history.
What the public will not forgive the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) for is not so much his objectives; they will not forgive him for his incompetence and his unwillingness to acknowledge and understand that the course of action he chose to support was an illegal course of action. The Australian people above all expect their government to be a government of competence and a government of laws. That is what they expect of them—a government of competence and a government of laws.
This is not the first occasion on which we have had to call into question the competence of this government. We have had plenty of opportunities in that regard; 15 changes in nursing home policy, one disaster after another on employment policy and one bungle after another in public administration.
But this is the first time that the incompetence has been combined with illegality. It takes a position of true genius from a government with 75 to 80 per cent support in the public for waterfront reform to convert that 
 into 60 per cent opposition with it methodology. That is an act of true political genius by the Prime Minister and his Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business.
Only fumble farm over there could produce an outcome like that. Instead of using the fact that there is strong public sentiment for waterfront reform, the minister and this government chose to take a course of illegality. Why did they do it? They chose to do it because some time around about last March a number of people put up their hands in the business community and elsewhere and said, `What are you doing? You are an incompetent, weak government and as an incompetent and weak government we expect you to develop a degree of competence and get about waterfront reform. Get off your bike and get into it.' That is what they said.
What happened after that point of time was flat panic as far as this government was concerned. There was no investigation of what ought to be done sensibly to bring about change. Everybody on the waterfront was prepared to negotiate change. Everybody on the waterfront has been prepared to negotiate change repeatedly over the course of the last nine years or so. Everybody on the waterfront has been there for it. Only these incompetents can turn that willingness on the waterfront and that public sentiment behind it into a concern in the entire community about whether or not their jobs and their job security might not come under attack from 1970s style bottom of the harbour arrangements being officially approved by the government. What the government has touted in its own Workplace Relations Act as a right to work and a right to be in employment is, if you choose to be a member of a union, a right that does not exist against a government that no longer is in touch with its own laws. Only this incompetent minister could produce that outcome and only that Prime Minister, who spends more time chatting on radio stations and examining opinion polls than he does in administering this country, could let him get away with it—fundamental, utter incompetence.
Part of the mantra that they used to talk themselves into this mad, insane obsession 
 they have with the MUA is that somehow they confronted a situation where there had been no change and they needed to take this from the ground up and alter it. I ask the Australian public and the House this question: looking at Minister Reith's record and this government's record over the course of the last six months, do you think that they would have been capable of taking down the stevedoring work force, by consensus, from 10,000 to 3,700? Do you think they would have been capable of improving container rates by 75 per cent?
Mr Reith interjecting—
—These are BTCE figures, old son—not ours. Do you think that this government could have reduced to one-fifth the cost of movement of bulk cargo across the waterfront and establish world's best practice on what is in fact about two-thirds by volume of our exports? Do you think they could have done that? Do you think they could have established company employment out of a situation which existed for 60 to 70 years as pooled employment? Do you think they could have established  company employment on the waterfront? No. I do not think that anybody in all honesty could look at the character opposite and say that he would have been capable of delivering that.
What is he actually asking for in terms of improvements in container rates? He is asking for a 25 per cent improvement in container rates—against all that. That is the gravamen of his position—a 25 per cent improvement in container rates, on his own figures. Against everything that was achieved by the previous government since 1989 he asks for a bagatelle and he makes a meal of it. And he stands up in this place and quotes container rates achieved by the non-union work force on the waterfront—but Patricks was sending congratulatory letters out to its work force during the course of the last 18 months for doing five and six containers an hour better than those particular propositions. That is what he has managed to achieve. He has managed to achieve a sort of `value subtractal' in relation to the work force on the waterfront.
He has to live with this: in his own polling something like 10 per cent of the Australian 
 people believe him. He has almost broken the Abe Lincoln barrier; he has almost got himself down to beat the Abe Lincoln barrier, which is, `You can fool some of the people all of the time; all of the people some of the time; but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.' He has actually got to the point, the Abe Lincoln record, that as far as the public is concerned nobody believes him any of the time. He has compromised his government's position as a result of that. His malevolence and his competence and his complete inability to fathom what his obligations are in waterfront reform have got him to the sorry state that he is in now, where 75 to 80 per cent of the Australian people want waterfront reform and 60 per cent of the Australian people oppose the way in which the government has gone about it. He alone has managed to produce these circumstances.
Honourable members interjecting—
—Order! Could I suggest that there be a little less intervention, please.
Honourable members interjecting—
—There are not many of them in regard to this place. So this man who has managed to produce a situation where the public puts a question mark over waterfront reform is the character who still has to carry the argument. And what is his motive? Is his motive waterfront reform? No, and he has said it here again today. His motive is the destruction of the MUA. This is not a legal objective, this is not a democratic objective and it is not an industrially necessary objective. It is none of those things. Every single port in the United States, in Japan, in Singapore and in Europe with which the minister likes to compare Australia's situation has one thing in common with Australian ports and that is this: every single port has a single union of which all stevedores are members—every one of them. The public knows that the destruction of the MUA is not the sine qua non of waterfront reform; it is the political objective of the Liberal Party. And it is no wonder that the Australian public by a substantial margin do not support $250 million of their hard-earned cash going into the backing up of the political objectives of the Liberal 
 Party. They do not support that. And they also probably do not know that they should.
When we put our reforms in place—and it was not $400 million worth of public funds that was spent; it was closer to $130 million to achieve all those reforms that I talked about a bit earlier on—we arrived at that position on the basis, signed up to by the companies and the unions, that any further redundancies would be met from the situation that persisted after those reforms of company employment by the companies themselves. Why can it not be achieved in the case of Patrick's? Because this government—and this is one of the reasons why it should be censured—have said to Patrick's that as far as they are concerned they can restructure themselves in identikit sort of bottom-of-the-harbour type arrangements in order to remove their assets from their stevedoring companies.
There is no question at all about Patrick's being able to afford those redundancy payments if the totality of the company is considered. They can amply afford those redundancies if the totality of the companies involved is considered. But a legal piece of sharp practice which has been tumbled by the Federal Court and the High Court has placed at jeopardy $250 million worth of taxpayers' funds. I will quote Justice North, upheld six to one by the High Court, including appointees of the current government, on this subject:
There is also evidence that the Patrick owners and other companies in the Patrick group, together with others, agreed on these unlawful acts as part of an overall plan to replace the workforce with non-Union labour. This means that there is an arguable case that the Patrick owners and Patrick employers have engaged in an unlawful conspiracy.
Further on, the High Court judgment says that all parties to a conspiracy are liable as concurrent tortfeasors, and it is only necessary for one of the conspirators to have performed the act for an action to lie against all. If damages are recovered, each is liable for the whole amount. It is time, old son, for you to tell the Australian people whether they or you are going to pay for your personal area of liability. Are the Australian people going to have to pay for your personal incompetence? I think there will be one or two people over the next 
 few months who will be very interested in an answer to that question.
He talks about me evading questions on the waterfront—listen to his entire performance in question time today! Not one answer on any of the pointed matters put to him, all of which a parliament would be entitled to, all of which an independent inquiry would tease out, as far as the involvement of his government is concerned. Don't you remember him here, just before Easter, standing up and slapping everybody on the back for the wonderful thing he had done—illegally sacking the work force—which has caused the Federal Court and the High Court, conservative gentlemen and lady as far as legal matters are concerned to a person, to come down on top of him 10 to one, like a ton of bricks, to say that out there is a prima facie case for conspiracy which he has given the tick to in the course of the last six months?
Every time he has got up he has washed his hands: `I know nothing.' He produces a detailed bill on what we ought to do a day later but he did not know what was going on the day before; he just conjured that out of the atmosphere. He gets on the 7.30 Report and says, `We did not know anything about the suggestion to sack the whole work force. I have learnt about that in the last 24 hours.' Then people come out and present evidence that he has been involved in discussions of that matter for a good six months prior to that date—one piece of evidence produced after another.
His totally mendacious performance is matched only by the incompetence and malevolence of his performance. The Australian people have tumbled him on this matter and he is now damaged goods, and is damaging the reputation of this government as a result of his incompetence. Nothing is more despicable in this debate than the way in which they exaggerate the outcomes of what they want to achieve in order to protect themselves from examination of their incompetence. Nothing is more demeaning of people who are supposed to be adults than taking that child-like approach to their own defence. Nothing is more insulting to those of us who are professional politicians, who have 
 been ministers for 13 years, than to watch one of their colleagues perform in the pathetic, mendacious and incompetent fashion that this minister has performed in.
Those of us who have actually made a few hard yards when it comes to a bit of microeconomic reform around here see the Australian public turned off its conviction that things ought to change not because reform is not achieved but because the terms and conditions under which they are employed are threatened, as indeed they are by what this government has chosen to do. That is a serious worry to ordinary Australians and it is a further serious worry that when somebody is faced with being illegally sacked they are then confronted by government approved guard dogs on the waterfront snapping and biting at them.
If you are talking about symbols of this period of time stamped on anybody in Australian politics as far as this whole exercise is concerned, guard dogs snapping on the waterfront is certainly going to be one of the symbols. You talk about things featuring in election advertising. You don't think that might not feature in the course of the next little while? We have got the rottweilers up there and the ad says: `Your entitlement to annual leave: snap. Your entitlement to a lunch hour: snap. Your entitlement to sick pay: snap. Your entitlement to long service leave: snap.' You do not think that might not make a bit of an advertisement about your behaviour in the course of the next election campaign if it is advertisements that you want to talk about, Minister? You are symbolised by the balaclava.
The other thing he does is exaggerate. What can be more important than exaggerating the effect of waterfront reform! Let us understand what he is struggling for: an improvement in stevedoring costs. Let us take farmers and the movement of fine wool. Let us take fine wool shifted by containers at today's price of 650c a kilogram. Stevedoring costs for fine wool are 1c a kilogram. Australian GDP is over $550 billion. If you accept the Productivity Commission statement as to what it costs us a year in efficiencies on the waterfront, it is $1 billion out of that $550 billion—$1 billion 
 that it should not cost us if the position they put is indeed the case.
Compare that with another of your areas of responsibility, minister, about which we hear nothing: that of occupational health and safety—the cost to the GDP, $20 billion. That is 20 times the cost of what is supposed to happen as far as improvement of the waterfront is concerned. But do we hear anything from you on that? Not a word. Every action that you take as a minister for industrial relations, not just on this matter but on others, has been inimical to the interests of decent workplace occupational health and safety as you threaten the job conditions of every Australian worker by the illegal acts that you are prepared to sign up to.
—Who is next?
—`Who is next?' said a colleague behind me. I will tell you who next has the opportunity to declare themselves on this: the Australian people, and they have marked your card. (Time expired)
—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.
—Come on, fibber.
—Mr Speaker, I think that should be withdrawn.
—I think that the honourable member for Batman might withdraw that remark.
—I withdraw the suggestion that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business is a fibber.",REPS,<title>WATERFRONT</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,4,1,speech
"Reith, Peter, MP",LP,1998-05-12,"—The government, of course, rejects this shallow censure motion. It is indicative of the attitude of the Labor Party that they would present this censure motion today. Censure motions are supposed to raise matters of grave national importance. Instead, what the Labor Party have done is to reveal their partisan position in support of the MUA against the national interest. What the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) did not do was to acknowledge the problems faced by our country as a result of the inefficiencies on the Australian waterfront.
I think people internationally are certainly looking at this dispute, but what they are wanting to know is whether Australia in the next century is going to have an efficient waterfront which will allow us to compete with the rest of the world. In the London Economist, for example, they said that the dispute in Australia reminded them of the agro-ridden Britain of the 1970s, and they are right to make that comment because the attitudes expressed today by the Leader of the Opposition, which are so evident in the conduct of the MUA, are really the attitudes of the 1970s in the UK and they are the left-over, remnant attitudes of a hardcore within the Australian trade union movement going back to the 1940s and 1950s. That is the truth of it. The world wants to know whether Australia is going to finally grasp this significant issue and make a difference so that our farmers, our exporters and our importers really are going to be able to compete against the rest of the world.
The Leader of the Opposition says, `Oh, but the costs are only a few cents per pound of wool or whatever might be exported.' That really does reveal just a complete lack of understanding of the real problems here. Australia has something like $120 billion worth of goods going out by sea. A huge percentage of Australia's imports and exports go across the Australian waterfront.
—In bulk.
—Yes, a lot of it is bulk. In value terms, approximately 70 per cent of imports and 78 per cent of exports were transported by sea in 1995-96. They shipped approximately $120 billion worth of cargo in 1995-96, $62 billion of which was containerised—$62 billion worth of goods. It is in the container terminals where we have appallingly low levels of productivity—where Australia's reputation for reliability has been marred for years by high levels of industrial action, a lack of reliability and workplace practices which make us a laughing-stock. That is the issue. You are obviously entitled to raise any related matter but, in the end, the issue is whether or not Australia is going to go into the next century with a system that works. That is the issue. You say that the marginal 
 cost is therefore irrelevant. That is not the case.
—He didn't say that.
—He did say that, and I heard him say it. Take Jack Schmidt, for example, who runs the Riverland stockfeed business. He made the point that, as the feed leaves his farm gates, it is a competitive product. It is a quality product and can beat the best in the world. They produce that product. It goes out through the port of Melbourne in containers. It goes to, of all places, the dairy industry in Japan. They compete against the Americans who also have a reasonable product, and it is very important that they can compete with them in every aspect of the growing, the harvesting and the delivery of their product. As he said, when it comes to those delivery costs, including the stevedoring, they are at a cost disadvantage to the Americans.
This is not just a few cents off per kilo or whatever the price measurement is; this can mean the difference between whether you are in business or not. This is not just a cent here or there; this can be a vital question of whether or not you get the contract in the first place. If Australia's reputation is that we are not a reliable supplier, then you miss out on the lot. That is why cost is important. Price is important, but so is our reputation for reliability.
I thought the figures that I read out during question time were very revealing when it comes to the impact of a less than reliable system. This is the impact calculated by the Productivity Commission on the shipping costs between Australia and the west coast of the US. What they say is that one of these companies runs seven ships whereas, if we had a more reliable system, they would need only six. So the extra ship is put on because of the lack of reliability in Australia. It costs that shipping line $US7 million per year, and who pays for that? We do. We all pay for it. That is lost export income and lost opportunities, and it makes us less competitive in those markets.
When we go back to the workplace practices, we can see how it is that	those workplace practices give Australia a reputation for being somewhat less than reliable. The level 
 of industrial disputes on the Australian waterfront is, by average, nine times the national average. That is the official figure from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The figure does not include every stoppage. In fact, the stoppages which are for an hour, two hours or four hours are just as damaging as an even longer stoppage because again there is a knock-down effect. The ships come out here and they go from port to port. Of course, if they are four hours or two hours late in each and every port, that all adds up to our reputation for being unreliable.
These guys take industrial action at the drop of a hat. In the case against Patricks, there has been something like 40 days plus of industrial action against them since near the end of January and early April. Only about nine of those days actually went into the official statistics. That gives a feel for the extent and constancy of industrial action. The wharfies take industrial action for just about any possible reason. During the first part of this year they took industrial action for a $4,500 a year wage increase. They are already on an average wage of between $62,000 and $101,000. They were taking industrial action to get a $4,500 increase and so as to be able to get all the rorts, inefficiencies and overmanning loaded into the base. That was the motive for the industrial action.
But not just for wage claims do wharfies take industrial action; they take industrial action for the most extreme reasons. For example, last year in Port Botany there was an argument over the billiard table. They threatened to close down Sydney because they wanted the billiard table re-covered. In Port Botany last year there was a pallet of toilets to be loaded. They took industrial action because they wanted embarrassment money. This is typical of this union.
They went back at Darling Harbour a week or so ago. They took industrial action on the day they went back. Do you know what one of their complaints was? Their complaint was that they did not want to wear safety vests because they had been worn by people who were not members of the MUA. They said to management, `We expect all the vests to be collected, put in plastic bags and burnt be 
 cause they were worn by people other than members of the MUA.' They demanded that the cranes be cleaned because scab labour had been driving the cranes. That is typical of the behaviour of these people which, in the end, gives Australia this shocking reputation for unreliability. As these shipping company figures show, it all adds up. The people who are disadvantaged are literally the thousands of Australian businesses, big and small, that rely on having an efficient waterfront into the future.
It is not just unreliability; it is lack of productivity. When it comes to productivity the figures coming out of the Productivity Commission report demonstrate that Australia is a long way behind an average world figure. The best in Australia is not as good as the  worst in New Zealand. That tells you in a simple way where we are at. There was a very good 60 Minutes program—I think it must have been last year—where they put a camera on a ship that went from Auckland to Melbourne to Sydney. In Auckland they were doing 24 lifts an hour, when they got to Melbourne they were doing eight and by the time they got to Sydney they were doing 14. Could we do better? The lady whose story is in the Sunday Telegraph tells us that we can do better. She worked for the farmers and, as she said, they were doing 23 lifts an hour. As to the average in Sydney, there have been times this year in Sydney when those wharfies were running at 10 crane lifts an hour. Here is a young woman, the first ever to drive a container crane in Sydney. She is fully trained and she was doing double the rate they were doing in her first week on the Australian waterfront.
In terms of the productivity rates, the five-port average in Australia is 18.5. In Auckland it is 25. In places like Manila, Laem Chabang or Mozambique they do better than we do—they do 25 to 30. As I said to John Coombs, why can't Australian wharfies do a decent day's work for a decent day's pay like wharfies anywhere else? Think of the average Australian small business person. They would give their right arms to have a job for $90,000 a year and 14 hours a week. What is the average Aussie farmer on? They are on an 
 average sort of income of $11,000 or $15,000. They really put in a decent week's work for that sort of money. What a comparison it makes. It is not a fair system that allows these people to rort the system to the disadvantage of all other Australians. That is all we are saying.
This has been an interesting dispute because of many aspects, but at the political and at the policy level it really has flushed out the Labor Party's position. Mr Beazley has had an opportunity to declare where he stands on some of these fundamental principles. We say it is a fundamental principle that, if you want to be in a union, then you should be allowed to be so. Similarly, if you do not want to be in a union, then you do not have to be. I cannot say it more simply than that. I cannot say it more plainly than that. That is the government's position. In fact, most Australians—I say three-quarters—think that is a fair position. Yet, when it comes to the waterfront, Mr Beazley and the Labor Party adopt a different view.
When he was challenged on radio the other day, Mr Beazley ended up endorsing this position, namely, that the MUA is entitled to have a monopoly. The Labor Party's position is that it is okay and fair enough for people like John Coombs to be able to enforce compulsory union membership on the Australian waterfront. Why do they do that? I will tell you why they do that. It is because it allows the MUA, which has a significant influence within the Labor Party and the ACTU, to hang on to their stranglehold. They use that stranglehold: they use it for their own political purposes and to maintain rorts, inefficiencies and overmanning at the expense of every other Australian, and that is why we object to it. We think that, by all means, if you want to be in a union, that is fine, but compulsory unionism is not fine, a monopoly is not fine. We have been publicly opposed to and advocating that change for as long as I can remember and for as long as I have been in Australian politics. We will go on so arguing because it is in the national interest that we have real competition.
The second policy position which the Labor Party has publicly advocated is the abolition 
 of the Trade Practices Act provisions which place a ban on secondary boycotts. This is very important. I call these the Cheryl clauses because Cheryl, the star recruit of the Labor Party, voted for them in the Senate. These clauses in the Trade Practices Act prohibit people taking industrial action against their employer for a reason other than terms and conditions. In other words, you are not allowed to financially cripple your employer because you want to take industrial action for some reason other than the terms and conditions of your employment.
You are not allowed as a union—for example, the MUA—to take secondary boycott action on the Australian waterfront because you want to take action in respect of some other business off the waterfront. You are just simply not allowed to do it. You are not allowed to do it for the very good policy reason that you are not entitled to financially damage your employer.
We give people the right to strike; we think that is fair enough. It has to be constrained, it has to be reasonable, there have to be some rules about it; but if workers collectively want to take industrial action then they are entitled to do so. But you are not entitled to take secondary boycott action.
The Labor Party's policy today is to repeal those provisions. The one union in this country that will use that to the disadvantage of every other Australian is the MUA. It says much about the Labor Party. They are in here today with their shallow nonsense censure motion, when in fact their policy position is against the national interest; it is opposed to genuine reform and, therefore, reveals them for what they are, bound hand and foot to the MUA. We just reject this censure motion. We treat it with the contempt it deserves. The policy position by the Labor Party deserves contempt. The challenge for them now is: are they going to support the administrators, who now have the authority given to them by the courts, are they going to support reform or are they going to sit back and support the MUA and push those companies into liquidation? Let us hear your answer.",REPS,<title>WATERFRONT</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,4,1,speech
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,1998-05-12,"—Once again we have a minister in the dock— 
not just in the dock in parliament, not just in the dock of public opinion; he is in a real dock. He is in the dock in court. He is a defendant in an unlawful conspiracy action and all that he can do, in response to this action, is plead the fifth. Again, today in question time and, again, in his contribution just then, he has had the gall to suggest that we might answer some questions. He has not answered any; not one single question has been answered.
Let me remind the defendant of what is on the charge sheet, let me remind the defendant what he is facing. In March 1997 his own department sends him a minute suggesting that maybe they should consider  sacking the entire work force of the stevedoring companies in a way that there should be no appeal. On 30 July 1997 Stephen Webster starts as a consultant to the government. On the same day he contacts Michael Wells and says, `I want you to contact Chris Corrigan; he's got a job for you.' Wells subsequently does that and Corrigan starts the process with him of organising the recruiting of serving Australian soldiers to go and be trained in Dubai to replace an existing work force of people who are not on strike, who are not breaking the law, who are acting in accordance with their agreements and the award at that time.
Subsequently, there are phone calls between Wells and Webster, and then Webster says, `Okay, no more calls. I'm satisfied that things are going according to plan, it's all all right, no more calls.' Webster has given us several versions of what happened. Initially, he denies that he calls, now he accepts that there might have been some calls. But this consultant on $1,000 a day, what was he doing at the time? He was organising chauffeurs for people. The government was actually out there organising chauffeurs for businessmen—or so we are led to believe.
Then we get to the start of the process of asset stripping. We suddenly get Chris Corrigan rearranging and reconfiguring all these companies so that the employment of labour is separated from the ownership and the assets of the company. In December, the Dubai mercenaries fly out two days after 
 Peter Reith's own staffer and departmental officials meet with Patrick's and discuss how to sack an entire work force and what procedures to go through and, only a couple of days before, the government writes to Corrigan saying, `Don't worry, we will fund redundancies.'
In January, after the Dubai exercise has gone by the board, at least for the time being, the NFF Webb Dock operation starts up. Again, Peter Reith and John Howard do not know anything about this, but they endorse it. It is fine, it is all competition on the waterfront. The culmination of this sequence of events, this unlawful conspiracy—this conspiracy that has been found to be prima facie unlawful by 10 judges to one in the Federal and High Court—reaches its culmination in April when there are mass sackings, the dogs are brought in and the goons in balaclavas are brought in to take people away from their lawful jobs on the waterfront.
Subsequently, much to the chagrin of Mr Reith, the High Court and the Federal Court have found that there is a prima facie case of unlawful conspiracy. Their only answer to this charge is, `We're in favour of waterfront reform.' We had another 15 minutes of it from the minister today. `My only answer: waterfront reform.' Does this mean that anything that he is prepared to do, however unlawful, is justified? Answer, `No.' The Labor Party supports waterfront reform but we also support acting in accordance with the law; and that, manifestly, is what this minister and this government are not doing.
The real story underneath the facts that are emerging is this: the minister has approached the stevedoring companies and suggested, `How about sacking your entire work force?' He has appointed Stephen Webster as his go-between, as the coordinator of this exercise, and he has set up a deniability wall. He has said, `Look, I don't really need to know the details of what you're doing, because we might get into a bit of difficulty about this, so don't tell me the details but here's the basic strategy.' He has had other consultancies for people to lay the groundwork for the whole exercise. They have said to him, `Here is what the opinion polling says.' Mark Textor 
 has done his consultancy. Jonathan Gaul says, `Here's the media strategy, here's what you need to do. Just vilify these people, abuse them, tell everybody they're bludgers and rorters.' We heard more of it today, more nonsense. He does not respond when you point out that some of what he is saying is totally untrue and the rest of it is grossly distorted. No response, just more nonsense. There is the strategy.
You have Peter Reith, the minister, as the propagandist, and you have Chris Corrigan, the company, assisted by Stephen Webster, the consultant, as the people who do the dirty work. They are the people who actually orchestrate the corporate restructure, who orchestrate the soldiers off to Dubai, who orchestrate the mass sackings of the wharfies. The minister is able to stand up and say, `I didn't know anything about any of this. I have never heard of Dubai. I do not know anything about it.' Nobody believes him. He keeps repeating his mantra and nobody believes him.
Now it has all gone wrong. The Oliver North of Australia is in a bit of trouble. Peter Kilfoyle and Michael Wells are singing like birds. Stephen Webster is contemplating his future. John Howard is wriggling. He is evasive and refusing to answer questions. He just says, `This is all a joke. It's all boring all this sort of stuff.' Peter Costello is doing cute pictures for the magazines in his jeans. The trendy young Treasurer is there, he is very elegant. He is there preening himself and saying, `Look, I don't want to have anything to do with Pauline Hanson.'
So it is all going wrong for the minister and on top of that he now faces the threat of being personally liable for damages—and he wouldn't answer that question, would he? He did not tell us today whether he has been slinking around the corridors to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), talking about indemnities. He would not respond to that question, would he? But at least we have to give him some credit for persistence—maybe not intelligence, but persistence. The High Court and the Federal Court found that prima facie he has acted unlawfully in breach of his own act—in breach of provisions that require 
 non-discrimination with respect to union membership. Yet what is he doing now? He is telling the administrator of the Patrick companies, `We will only give you money for redundancies if you guarantee that you are employing non-union members.' He does not appear to have learnt his lesson.
Oliver North was not that bright but he got caught only once: he did the wrong thing only once. Yet with this Oliver North no sooner is he out of court, having been found prima facie to have acted unlawfully, and he is doing it again. He is there saying, `We want what we call waterfront reform and the only way that we are going to go about it is to force de-unionisation'—because that is effectively what it amounts to.
In all of this he is still backing Chris Corrigan. He and the Prime Minister are still supporting Chris Corrigan. Today the Prime Minister was asked, `What have you got to say about a few of the things that Corrigan has been involved in?' He has admitted lying. He has called himself a desperate man. He said to the Industrial Relations Commission on 8 February, `I don't know anything about the financing of Dubai. I didn't do that.' Yet there is a letter of 8 May—signed by Corrigan—to the lawyers acting for Fynwest Pty Ltd that states:
Your clients have consistently failed to provide regular accounting and bank reconciliation details in respect of the loan provided by Patrick to Fynwest Pty Ltd.
The bank records that are attached to Michael Wells's affidavit make it abundantly clear. If you look through them—they are from the Commonwealth Bank and are the usual sort of records—you will see there is a reference, for example, to `9 January 1988: $140,000' from Patrick Stevedoring. Yet this man, whom the Prime Minister continues to support to the hilt, told the Industrial Relations Commission one month later that he had nothing to do with the financing of Dubai.
An honourable member interjecting—
—He might possibly have forgotten but I think that is probably an unlikely scenario given the issues that were at stake. John Howard has wrapped his arms around Chris Corrigan and said, `If you're 
 going down, then I'm going down with you.' Has he held any inquiry? Has he condemned any of the actions that Corrigan has admitted to? Has he even distanced himself from some of the features of the dispute like the dogs, the batons and the security guards in balaclavas? No, all he has done is to say this is a joke—any complaints and any concerns are a joke; it is all boring—and his own Minister for Justice (Senator Vanstone)—the person who is in charge of the Federal Police, the person who is supposed to administer the law with respect to matters such as perjury or giving unlawful evidence—says that Chris Corrigan should be nominated for Australian of the Year. There is something very strange going on here when the Minister for Justice is administering justice in this way. I wonder what she will say about Christopher Skase after that performance.
We need to ask ourselves why all this is happening. You do not have to be a genius to work it out: there are decades of blind, atavistic hatred of the maritime union and of its membership. It goes back to `Pig Iron' Bob.
—No, it goes back to Bruce.
—The honourable member for Lalor is quite correct—it goes back to the 1925 dispute with Walsh and Johnson. He is absolutely correct, but I think that particular dispute pales into insignificance in the Liberal Party pantheon of hatred when you look at `Pig Iron' Bob, because they were humiliated by the maritime union at Port Kembla, which said to them, `Japan is going to be at war with Australia within a couple of years; we should not be sending the raw materials for weapons to them,' and Bob Menzies said, `No, that is all right. We think they are nice people.' Of course, he was proved wrong.
On A Current Affair John Howard was asked why all the people in the smaller ports, who had not been on strike for years because there were no issues in dispute, had been sacked. His response: they were all members of the same union.
What does that tell you? That is the reason why they were dismissed, and that is why the Federal Court has found that the government and Chris Corrigan and the NFF are prima 
 facie in breach of Peter Reith's own act, because these people have been dismissed for one reason only: they are members of the maritime union. This has been compounded by Peter Reith's recent actions: not only have they done that but he is still in there boxing—punch drunk, albeit, but still in there boxing—and saying to the administrators after he has lost in court, `Only give the redundancy money to these people if they are employing non-union labour.'
This whole exercise is not about waterfront reform and there is a very simple test, a very simple way of illustrating that, because waterfront reform is about a lot more than just workplace practices, a lot more than union membership and a lot more than labour. What have they done about new entrants and more competition on the waterfront? Nothing. What have they done about improving road and rail links to the ports and improving information technology links? The answer is nothing. What have they done about reducing port charges, something that our government was very successful on? Absolutely nothing.
What have they done about anti-competitive practices like the agreement that was allegedly there between the Port of Melbourne Authority and the two stevedoring companies not to have a third entrant? Again, absolutely nothing because they are interested in only one form of competition. Give them credit, because there is actually one type of competition they are keen on: competition between workers; individual workers standing up to say, `I'll do the job for $8 an hour, sir,' and another worker saying, `No, I'll do it for $7 an hour, sir.' That is the competition that they want. That is what `monopolies on labour' is code for. That is what that whole story is about. They want competition between workers: they want to go back to the old bull system; they want to go back to the hungry mile when workers had to compete with each other for a decent wage. Of course, when they are in a position of having to do that, they have got no hope, no serious bargaining power—that is what the government wants.
If ever there was a political scandal that needed a judicial inquiry this is it. We have a minister who has been found by a court and 
 subsequently by appeal courts to have been prima facie involved in a conspiracy to breach his own legislation. We have a Prime Minister supporting to the hilt a confessed liar who has admitted to acting illegally and who is accused of giving false evidence to the Industrial Relations Commission on oath.
We have a government refusing consistently to release key documents which are crucial evidence of this pattern of conspiracy. We have 2,000 workers, 1,400 of them permanent full-time workers, sacked in circumstances that I do not need to remind you of, and still under threat of not having jobs. And we have  a new low in corporate immorality and corporate skulduggery set by Chris Corrigan, with the active connivance and involvement of this government. Bottom of the harbour John Howard of 1982 in tax avoidance is now bottom of the harbour John Howard of 1998 in corporate law and industrial relations. There is a link, because it is precisely the same techniques that have been used and it is precisely the same pattern. What you do is separate the bits that you want to keep that do not involve any liabilities, where the assets are, from the liabilities and out they go. That is precisely the technique that is being used.
The Prime Minister cannot wriggle out of this one. He cannot just stand back and say, `Look, those ministerial guidelines that I had do not really mean very much anymore.' He cannot do a Senator Parer and redefine the notion of conflict of interest to a point where it actually ceases to exist. He does not have the ability to back away from this one. He must act. He must call an immediate independent judicial inquiry to go through all of the issues and to get to all of the evidence which has bit by bit been coming out in spite of all of the efforts to cover up by the government, to ensure that his government is acting honestly, legally and openly after what has been a pattern of two years of lies, deceit and conspiracy.",REPS,<title>WATERFRONT</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,4,1,speech
"Elson, Kay, MP",LP,1998-05-12,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) on this grandstanding motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). At the outset, I con 
 gratulate the minister on his resolve, his patience, his bravery and the consummate skills he has displayed in his handling of this issue—
—Who wrote this?
—I did.
Opposition members interjecting—
—Order! Members on my left will be silent.
—If the opposition listened they might learn a little bit about why it concerns my electorate. He has remained steadfast in his determination to do what is in the national interest. That is the bottom line in our approach—the national interest. This is where our approach differs greatly from those on the opposite side of this House. We want what is best for Australia; they want what is best for the union movement. In a perfect world those two aims would not be mutually exclusive. But the fact is that the MUA, with their bloody-minded approach, their inability to catch up with the rest of the work force in terms of the need for productivity, their militant determination to hang onto every little rort of the job they have enjoyed for many years, cannot have it both ways.
—How much do you get paid?
—I work hard for my money and I expect that they would too.
—Do you enjoy the car?
—I hope you do too. Don't forget that we work hard. I appreciate that you have to work hard in your job—
Mr Adams interjecting—
—Order! The member for Lyons!
—You cannot be bound hand and foot to the MUA, as the Leader of the Opposition has been, and be acting in the national interest. It is impossible. The Australian public know that. They can see very clearly that the MUA has had it too good for too long at the expense of thousands of Australian jobs over the years. They know that waterfront reform is crucial if we are to truly become a competitive nation in our region. The sad part about Labor's approach is that deep down the opposition leader and 
 all those opposite know that waterfront reform is crucial, but the point is that they know they cannot deliver it because they are beholden to the MUA and the union movement.
The Labor opposition say, `We want waterfront reform,' but they failed to do anything substantial in the 13 years they were in government, except to spend $420 million of taxpayers' money. They say they want waterfront reform, but they are not prepared to actually take the tough decisions necessary to ensure lasting reform. That is a pretty comforting position, isn't it? Similarly, they say they want tax reform, but they do not have the guts to make any substantial changes to the current system. Those opposite are great advocates for tinkering around the edges, aren't they? They are great at crying, `We want, we want,' but we only have to take a look at their record in office to see that they are just no good at delivering.
The government, on the other hand, has been decisive, has been strong and has been determined in our push for waterfront reform. I would like to point out that the events of recent months do not represent the government's approach to reform. The Labor Party like to think they do because they think they can gain political mileage out of the difficulties created by the union picket lines and threats. But the fact is that the events of recent months are a direct result of the MUA's bloody-minded approach to maintaining their privileged monopoly and are a direct consequence of their senseless campaign to put their own employer out of business. Surely the past union leaders sitting opposite could have advised them better than that. When they could not produce productivity, the Australian public put them out of a job.
Those opposite conveniently forget that the government's approach to waterfront reform has been one of negotiation and discussions for over a year. We have been prepared to talk with the MUA but we have not been prepared to compromise on what is in the national interest. We have set in place seven crucial benchmarks to be met. Most importantly, we have set in place legislative arrangements to contain industrial action. Ironically, that was only possible with the help of Jennie George's 
 great mate and Labor's so-called star recruit, Cheryl Kernot. The point is that over the past two years we have discussed, met all parties, listened to everyone involved, but we have not been prepared to act contrary to the national interest. We have not been prepared to compromise on what is best for Australia. And why  should we compromise Australian jobs and Australia's international competitiveness because a handful of men want to protect their privileged positions?
The recent pickets by the MUA have succeeded in highlighting and magnifying the difficulties so many farmers and business people face in having to get their produce and their goods through the waterfront. The uncertainty of the last few months is merely a reflection on what these people go through year in and year out; reliability is the biggest problem that we have. Strikes, go-slows, stop-work meetings and containers piling up on our wharves are par for the course.
The recent action has magnified things though; it has touched many people in my electorate of Forde. There have been many examples. Some 7,000 people in Forde are employed in manufacturing and local business owners have told me that they are concerned that crucial exports will be lost as a result of uncertainties on the wharves.
A local backhoe operator has been unable to earn a living for nearly a month now because a crucial part he needed to repair his backhoe has been held up on the wharves. Many local produce and beef farmers in Boonah and Beaudesert have had to endure drought over the past few years and survive on a fraction of what the wharfies earn—they now worry about getting their produce overseas. One local engineer who won a tender for excavation of a building site has been waiting on a vital piece of equipment which was not allowed off the dock by the MUA; he fears losing his contract. These are just a few examples of how the wharves are crucial and how the MUA, fully supported by Labor, is putting jobs at risk by refusing to be part of this reform process.
And there was the owner of a transport company who called me in tears. He explained how five of his trucks had been 
 damaged by picketers while trying to get their containers off the wharves in Brisbane. He and his drivers are just ordinary blokes trying to earn a living and having to endure the treatment that the sacked wharfies dished out to them. I can assure you that the wharfies won no friends there.
But, obviously, Labor consider their interests as second to that of the MUA. Just like the farmers do not matter, the small business people do not matter—all that matters is that the union bosses keep their stranglehold on power. That is why it amazes me that Labor have the gall to come in here and talk about the government's approach to waterfront reform. Their approach is to back the MUA. Let us look for a minute at the MUA's approach. The local transport company owner who had five of his trucks damaged by picketers is just one example. I am stunned that Kim Beazley has the gall to say he thinks that unions have conducted themselves pretty well. It is a real commentary on the nature of these people if he thinks that destroying property, spitting at people, hurling abuse at workers, making death threats and the like are examples of restraint on their part. I would hate to see what would have happened if they expressed their true selves.
We all saw footage of unionists with planks of wood going up to a truck approaching the picket line and wilfully damaging it. One could only imagine what they would have done to the driver if he had stepped outside of the cab. And of course there was the disgraceful use of children on the picket lines; that was simply inexcusable. The father had the opportunity to remove those children, but he did not seem to be concerned about their welfare when it came to yelling at police.
Closer to home, I had the opportunity to observe first-hand the thuggery of Labor's mates in the MUA when the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business visited my electorate last month. The minister was a guest speaker at the regional small business awards ceremony hosted by the Beenleigh Chamber of Commerce. It is an important annual event for locals and it was attended by over 500 small business people and their staff. This year these people, who 
 are hardworking, decent Queenslanders, had to run a gauntlet of abuse from unionists—bussed in from Brisbane, I might add. They had to dodge eggs and many had their cars rocked and damaged. The local young children who were invited to sing and dance at the awards were also sworn at and their bus was pelted with eggs. These kids were as young as 12; they were naturally very scared. And Kim Beazley says that the unionists have handled themselves well.
—The Leader of the Opposition says.
—Sorry, the Leader of the Opposition says that the unionists have handled themselves well. I can tell the opposition leader that on that evening there were several people there who identified themselves as long-time Labor supporters who came up to me and said, `Never again.' They said they will never support Labor while Labor supports violent, disgusting action like that. In fact, they were so outraged by the protesters behaviour that they have offered to hand out how-to-vote cards for me on election day, and I appreciate those offers.
I have no doubt whatsoever that the majority of Australians condemn the MUA's approach to reform; they recognise how crucial waterfront reform is and they are disappointed, though not surprised, that Labor are putting their mates before the national interest—that has always been their way though. That is why the MUA have been able to keep their stranglehold and their monopoly; that is why this country is so far behind our competitors when it comes to waterfront productivity and practice.
You had 13 years to do something about it, so do not come into this place and say you want reform then condemn the only government with enough guts to actually stand up to the MUA and work to achieve real reform. The government's approach on this issue is what is needed; your approach is to cave in to union demands. The Australian public and certainly the people of Forde know that we cannot continue to give in to the MUA. For Australia's sake, we have got to fix the wharves and that is precisely what this government is doing. I join with Peter Reith 
 and reject wholeheartedly the opposition's motion.",REPS,<title>WATERFRONT</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,4,1,speech
"Campbell, Graeme, MP",IND,1998-05-12,"—I feel it necessary to speak in this debate because I do not think either side really comprehends the nature of the problem. The Labor Party wonder where it all started.  I can tell them: it started when Paul Keating embraced rational economics—which is not an economic theory; it of course is an ideology. It is the ideology of big business—mainly American big business—to control world trade. Once the Labor Party endorsed that, then there was no hope; obviously the Liberals were going to endorse it because it looks and tastes like neo-classical economics. Of course it is not because big business colludes; it does not compete.
When we heard the last speaker, the member for Forde (Mrs Elson), talking about the national interest, it really was absurd. I am concerned about the national interest. It was in the national interest that the government's 10-point Wik plan got to the Senate; weak and wishy-washy as it is, it was important it got through because it contains one important clause. It is quite clear the government could have got it through had they accepted the vote of Senator Colston. But, for some reason or other, this was not acceptable, a matter of principle—the Parer principle I think it is probably called. But the fact is that, had they done that, we could have got that through. The government did not do it because they wanted a double dissolution election and now of course they are not so sure.
Kalgoorlie—the centre of Australia's second biggest export industry—is grinding to a halt because of the government's action. Is that in the national interest?	The truth is that the waterfront is not Australia's big problem. It never was and it is an absurdity to suggest that it was. Off the top of my head, I would say that the increase in litigation in this country is costing a magnitude more than the wharf is, and that is being endorsed by people in this parliament. There are many things that need attending to before the wharf, but that is not to say that there are not problems with the wharf. 
I was on a committee that looked at waterfront reform, and we found that the real problem is between the wharf and the warehouse. It is interesting to note that nothing has been done about our report. We noticed in the very congested port of Sydney, for instance, that the wharf worked 24 hours a day and the trucks worked 10. They stacked the containers up on the wharf, and Murphy's Law dictated that the first truck in the morning wanted the container on the bottom. You would see empty trucks going down to pick up containers and going away empty. It was a nonsense, and nothing has been done about that.
I know a little bit about the wharf because I have had to deal with the wharf and, in my youth, I had some altercations with the waterfront myself. Overwhelmingly, the rate of pay is 15 bucks an hour. At the port of Dampier it is $15 an hour and, if you do not get overtime in the Pilbara, you simply cannot exist. In Derby there are no waterfront workers because it is an automatic port—the ship is loaded automatically—but there the seamen, and it is the same union, take a tug 22 nautical miles out to sea and load on to other ships. It is a very neat operation. They are paid a daily rate—they signed a workplace agreement—of $180, not big bickies by anyone's standard. I looked at their time sheets and noticed that some of them had been working 22½ hours a day, which is clearly outside any occupational health and safety standards. The mining company involved, Western Metals, is a very good company and they quickly got onto it and insisted that their operator fix this, and it has been fixed. These people are now back to working 12 hours a day at $18 an hour—not the big money that the minister is talking about. The figures the minister talks about are based on massive overtime. We talk about double-headers, but whose prerogative is that? If a company cannot arrange its work force to get over that, surely they must be the problem.
I was in Perth the other day promoting a new Australian grader which is so far ahead of anything in the world in terms of productivity and cost that it should be in every local government and every government depart 
 ment. I can assure some of the ministers here that they will be hearing about it. One of the people there had in his time been the CEO of the Port of Fremantle, and he was reminiscing about how they fought long and hard to get one union on the waterfront. He said it was a nightmare dealing with eight unions, and when they all consolidated into the MUA this was seen by the Liberal Party of the time as a great advance. He said, `No sooner had we done that than the government gave me 10 bureaucrats to negotiate with. So I got rid of eight unions and suddenly found myself with 10 government departments to negotiate with.' His figures were probably exaggerated, but the point he made was that he now had to arrange his working day to fit the travel arrangements and workings of a whole host of government ministers.
Most of Australia's product goes out as bulk commodities. We are the best bulk commodity shippers in the world. We are talking here about the liner trade—containers—and it is mostly imports. It is my fervent wish that the wharf not be so confoundedly efficient because, with the policies of both the Labor and the Liberal parties destroying the manufacturing industry in this country, the waterfront is just about the last line of defence we have and, sadly, they have let us down.
We hear about the farmers. I represent a lot of primary industry. The farmers have no real interest in waterfront reform; they are overwhelmingly bulk shippers and they have fairly good arrangements in this regard. The National Farmers Federation does not represent farmers. It is hard to say what it does represent. If it represents anybody at all, it probably represents peak councils in Australia which, in turn, are very unrepresentative. I think it also has a large component of agribusiness, but it certainly does not represent the family farm. Indeed, NFF stands for `No Family Farms' because its policies will see the advent of big business.
The NFF recommended to this government that they allow in Brazilian orange juice concentrate. Its idea was that there would be winners and losers but that this would benefit the wheat, wool and beef producers. I repre 
 sent those people and I know that the demise of orange growers is not going to benefit my constituency one little bit. As one wheat grower said to me, `Where are we going to send our second-grade wheat when the NFF kills the pig industry through support of pork imports?' The NFF has consistently  attacked smaller domestic farming operations in pursuit of what it sees as the bigger picture. The truth is that as you diminish the whole rural constituency you diminish the power of the rural vote, and that is not in the interest of any farmer.
It is true that there were a few farmers who went down to the waterfront. Sadly, just like the unions, there are some very stupid people involved. I represent a lot of farmers and they have seen through this and resent very strongly the suggestion that farmers are backing the NFF or that the NFF represents them. When I was at the PNG conference recently, overwhelmingly people were saying to me, `We want no part of this,' because they knew it was not in their interest.
What has this government done? Look at the speed with which this government rushed off to war against Iran and immediately put at risk a $1.2 billion trade surplus with that part of the world. That trade surplus was overwhelmingly in agricultural produce, yet this government was prepared to put that at risk. I asked John Howard directly whether he was prepared to compensate farmers, and the answer was no. It was highly predictable that American longshoremen would act against Australian agricultural produce. Do you think that American farmers are going to say, `Oh, no, we believe in free trade'? They are going to endorse the actions of those longshoremen because it is in their interest to do so, and anyone who thinks otherwise is talking nonsense.
Let us get down to it. We are told there are great reforms to be had on the waterfront. I am told by Patrick's that the cost of moving a container across the Australian waterfront is about $200. It is obviously cheaper in other places, but in some places in Europe it is also significantly dearer. But that is a figure. Now $200 as a value of the contents of that container is not very much, but it is worth hav 
 ing. If you were to get a 50 per cent improvement—which I think is probably impractical for a whole host of other reasons—do you really think the customer will get that $100? Of course he will not. It will go into the pocket of the stevedores because the stevedores have the monopoly. That must be realised. The MUA at least had to share the monopoly. If you take them away, the stevedores will have the monopoly entirely on their own.
This whole thing is an absolute nonsense. It is not in the national interest. It is one of these issues which the government picked because they saw it as a soft underbelly. They thought they could get public support, but the Australian public are more intelligent than that. Today they are better educated, and they knew, they sensed—either intellectually or ideologically—that the government were lying. The government were not being honest in this transaction.
If you really want to improve the efficiency of Australian ports, you would close down a large number of the ports in Australia. This would certainly increase efficiency. But which state is going to volunteer to lose its ports? I suggest that none of them will. And why should they? You will improve the efficiencies of the ports, but you will increase the costs to the state. Nobody ever saved money by taking stuff off ships and putting it on rail. Certainly you would get stuff across the wharf quicker, but the result to those states which had forgone their ports would be a higher cost. It is a geographical fact that in Australia we have all these ports, and as a consequence they are not going to get the efficiencies.
I have stood on the dock at Singapore and watched them unloading. A panamax loaded to the gunwales with 30,000 tonnes of containers would come in and unload bang, bang, bang, one after the other. It was very efficient. When they come to Australia they use small boats. If you get down to the wharf in Fremantle, as I have, you can see them having to lift a container because it is going to Launceston, take off the one underneath because that is for Fremantle and put the one for Launceston back on. When it gets to Adelaide there is the same procedure. That is 
 one container movement. So you are never going to get those efficiencies.
At the end of the day, it is not a big problem in Australia. What the government has done, in trying to make this an issue, is that it has made it a political issue, an ideological issue. What it has done is divided Australia and played into the hands of one of the great problems besetting this country: that is, the growing dichotomy between rural Australia and urban Australia. Here we have a nation where the major cultures are growing apart because of lack of understanding, and it is being exacerbated by this government. It is playing right into that. That is surely not in the national interest.
We have seen the nation divided against itself this way. We are seeing it constantly as a result of policies which flow directly from the policy of rational economics endorsed by Paul Keating, the great architect, the great prophet of this nonsense policy. If the Labor Party goes down this road, what hope does this nation have? That brings me to my concluding remarks. The reality in Australia today is that there is very little difference between Labor and Liberal.
—How can you say that after this?
—Because the policies you pursue are only a matter of proportion. When the government point out what happened to the airline pilots, they have an uncomfortable truth about them. There is no doubt about that. Workplace agreements were brought in by the Keating government, and this is only an extension. It was bound to happen. When you look at the native title debate, the government are putting forward a wishy-washy bill. The Labor Party, in their absolute hypocrisy, are opposing what they thought was in their own bill—in fact, what was in their own bill but which was knocked out by the Federal Court. All this government are doing is putting that same condition back in the bill but not in the hands of the tribunal. But the Labor Party seeks to oppose it because it is not in the national interest. There is little difference between you. If you listen to that debate, one after another the bleeding hearts on the other side were indecipherable 
 from your own left wing. That is an absolute fact of life.
I make the point that the wharf is not the great problem the government says it is, it is an annoyance in some areas. I have found the union to be very open  to negotiation. This union is not homogeneous either. I can remember when there was a refusal to transport uranium through the port of Darwin. I went to see the waterside workers at Wyndham and they said, `No problems, bring it here.' I suspect it was the threat of Wyndham that made the wharfies in Darwin see some sense. When we had to bring radioactive material back into Australia because it was inadvertently exported by Western Mining to Singapore, I had no trouble negotiating with the wharfies in Esperance to bring it back through Esperance. It would not come back through Fremantle, but through Esperance it was all right. So the union itself is much more reasonable, much more open to negotiation and by no means as united as the government and the opposition portray it to be. This is a nonsense. The wharf is not Australia's problem. Let us tackle the real problems and have done with it.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,1998-05-12,"—Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the new flags placed in each corner of the chamber and ask: what costs 
 have been incurred to date in installing these flags and what additional costs are forecast? I also ask: are these flags to be replaced by larger flags and, if so, why and what costs are associated with this decision? Further, is it a fact that the flags had to be ironed before they were hung in the chamber? Will these flags be replaced daily, as happens with other flags in the chamber?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER</title>,<title>Flags in the Chamber</title>,Questions to the Speaker,5,1,question
Mr SPEAKER,N/A,1998-05-12,"—I thank the honourable member for Hunter for his question. The answer to his last question is no. It is for that reason that flags have been mounted outside the members entrance to the chamber. These are the flags that will be provided for members to present to their constituents, as they have in the past. They are a lot easier to get down and get up.
Regarding the second question, I do not know whether the flags were ironed. I do know that we are going to trial larger flags tomorrow. The degree to which costs have been incurred is still highly problematic. I do not know how much they will be. They are all trials. Indeed, one of the concerns we had was to try to ensure that the architects looked at mounting them in such a way that nothing would be absolutely fixed. You will notice that the mountings are such that they can be removed. I would have preferred it had they been at right angles but, in order to maintain the design symmetry with the slope of the roof, I was told it was better that they went at that particular angle. The purpose is to make them a more permanent feature of the building in the same way as the flag pole is the centrepiece of the whole building. It is obviously desirable that we do not have things part of this building that appear to be there only temporarily. If at any stage—and, from my point of view, God forbid it—there were to be a change to the flag,  presumably they could be very easily changed at that time.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER</title>,<title>Flags in the Chamber</title>,Questions to the Speaker,5,1,answer

Mr SPEAKER,N/A,1998-05-12,"—I present the Presiding Officers' further response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories entitled A right to protest .
The report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories entitled A right to protest was presented to both Houses in June 1997. Madam President and the former Speaker presented a response to the report on 4 September 1997 and the government response was tabled on 25 March 1998.
Madam President and I recognise the right to protest as an inherent part of any active and healthy democratic process and wish, in the light of the government's response, to affirm our position in relation to the committee's recommendations. Our joint response emphasises the special position of the parliament as established by the constitution, the privileges and immunities provided for by the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 and authorities to control and manage the parliamentary precincts as provided for by the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988. This response endeavours to balance the needs of the parliament as a legislature with those of public access to the parliamentary precincts and its elected officials.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1998-05-12," asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 1 September 1997:
(1) Did the Federal Airport Corporation (FAC) in its 1992 development of Essendon Airport, invest in the construction of a two storey office; if so, (a) has the building been fully tenanted since completion, (b) is it fully tenanted at 1 September 1997 and (c) has the investment made money or lost money.
(2) Was Essendon Airport the FAC's first corporate development and was it followed by other similar developments; if so, how do the other developments rank in financial performance compared to Essendon; if further developments did not follow, why not.
(3) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the Community News on 28 November 1995 which indicated the FAC had agreed to lease two hectares of land to a consortium which was to build a samples and seconds warehouse, a 24 hour child care centre, a health centre and a service station/convenience store; if so, (a) did the development proceed, (b) did the FAC enter into an agreement with a consortium and (c) was there a financial cost incurred by the FAC if the development did not proceed.
(4) Has his attention been drawn to claims by the former Essendon Airport General Manager in the Community News on 7 May 1996 that a Brands factory warehouse would be established on the airport site which would sell discount clothing and shoes; if so, (a) did the proposal proceed and (b) was there any financial cost incurred by the FAC if the development did not proceed.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Essendon Airport: Development</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,25,1,question
"Vaile, Mark, MP",NP,1998-05-12,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) Yes. (a) The FAC has advised that the office block has been fully tenanted since construction with the exception of one ten month period during 1995/96 when part of the ground floor was vacant. (b) Yes. (c) The building is providing satisfactory returns to the FAC.
(2) The FAC has advised that it is unclear about the definition of `corporate development' in this context. 

(3) Yes. The FAC has advised that this development was for a Factory Seconds and Peripheral Sales Outlet Centre. (a) The project was delayed because of legal action taken by a nearby shopping centre operator. (b) The FAC has not finalised a lease with the prospective tenants as they may have lost interest because of the delay. (c) The FAC has incurred legal costs of approximately $14,100, which would normally be recovered from the tenant on satisfactory completion of lease documentation. If this project does not go ahead these costs will not be recovered.
(4) The FAC has advised that the Brands factory warehouse is the same development referred to in the previous question.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Essendon Airport: Development</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,25,1,answer
