Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:31):  This is the continuation of the committee stage of the Fair Work Amendment Bill, and last night I was asking whether the government could provide us with an estimate of the costs associated with the proposed name change. The Senate committee inquiring into this was told a week ago the question would be taken on notice. We were told last night the question would be taken on notice, and I am wondering if the government now might actually have a defined figure to provide to us, rather than the rubbery explanation we have continually been provided.


Further, I asked the parliamentary secretary if the appointment of two new vice-presidents is going to cost Fair Work Australia $1.5 million or thereabouts per annum; if the name change is going to incur a cost; and, if all those costs are going to be absorbed by Fair Work Australia, what areas of Fair Work Australia's current activities will be curtailed for the extravagance of appointing these two new positions and for the this non-name change?

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (09:33):  I can apprise Senator Abetz that since 10 o'clock last night there has been no change in the advice government has from Fair Work Australia with respect to their internal processes that I described during the committee stage last night, looking at the detail of the cost involved to change the name. So I cannot advise him further on any defined figure; only the information I gave him last night about the process under which Fair Work Australia is determining such matter. As Senator Abetz full knows, Fair Work Australia are an independent statutory body. They will go through their process and, at such time as we have advice for the Senator, we will inform him.


I will clarify also a component of the advice I gave last night: the absorption of the cost for the name change was the information I gave; it did not pertain to the issues around the appointment.


Senator Abetz is also asking with respect to what areas of current activities might be curtailed. Again, that is a matter for Fair Work Australia. I will seek to ascertain whether there is further advice on that matter.


I am also in the hands of the Senate as to whether, at this point in time, we want to move to the matters that Senator Cormann raised last night or whether Senator Abetz would like to remain on the areas that, prior to that, he was canvassing yesterday.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-11-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:34):  The last point of the parliamentary secretary is a fair question. I do not know how many other senators have general questions, though I still have a few. After that I would suggest we start moving through the amendments formally. I would then, according to the sheet, move the vice-presidential amendments and then Senator Cormann will come back into the chamber and canvass opposition amendments to superannuation. Given Senator Cormann's absence at the moment, if the parliamentary secretary could oblige by responding when Senator Cormann returns to the chamber I think that would be the most beneficial for both the parliamentary secretary and, if I might say so, especially for the opposition.


In relation to the issues I raised, I do note the parliamentary secretary's comment that the position has not changed since 10 o'clock last night. But the regrettable thing is that the position has not changed since the matter was before the Senate committee a week ago. The government makes money available to Fair Work Australia to undertake all sorts of issues and activities. We have been told in recent times now that Fair Work Australia from its budget will simply absorb the costs of a new registered organisations regime with new forensic accountants, new forensic lawyers, beefed up—all to be absorbed by Fair Work Australia without an extra allocation of money. We are similarly told that Fair Work Australia is simply going to appoint two new vice-presidents at a cost of at least $1.5 million per annum, simply to be absorbed. Fair Work Australia is now going to have a name change and the cost of that simply to be absorbed. 


How much more is the government going to demand from Fair Work Australia and why was Fair Work Australia given such a big budget if it can afford all these extra changes without any curtailment of its existing activities? Clearly something must be giving within the Fair Work regime for all these extra financial burdens to be placed upon it without any extra money being made available. The Australian people are entitled to an answer, and to simply hide behind the fact that it is an independent statutory authority is not good enough because it is the government that makes the money available. This independent statutory authority operates under legislation that this government introduced, and the people of Australia are entitled to know where the money is coming from and what areas of Fair Work Australia's activities will be curtailed to fund all these new activities without supplementation to Fair Work Australia's budget.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Collins, do you want me to seek from the Greens an answer to your question about the general questions, whether the Greens have an indication as to whether they have many questions in this segment or they are happy to move through the amendments? Senator Wright.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (09:38):  The Greens do not have any further questions in relation to the general issues. We are happy to move through the amendments.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (09:38):  With respect to Senator Cormann's questions, I am happy to defer them even if it is necessary to do so during the discussion of the amendments themselves. So if it suits Senator Cormann to simply come and move his amendments I am happy to deal with the issues that he raised last night at that stage.


With respect to the issues that Senator Abetz raised, I described last night that Fair Work Australia has a process to work through to determine the costs involved with the change of name. It is not that there is no understanding of cost but rather that Fair Work Australia have advised government of their process and we are waiting for an outcome of that process. We are quite happy to inform the Senate and indeed Senator Abetz of the outcome of that process once it becomes known.


I can clarify further the point I made in response last night to a question on the name change. I indicated that the costs were to be absorbed by Fair Work Australia. I differentiated just a moment ago between that and the costs associated with the new appointments.


However, no differentiation is warranted: it is indeed the case that Fair Work Australia will absorb the full cost involved in the changes that have been sought. However, the precise details—and I think I mentioned this last night—in relation to the costs associated with the new appointments are still subject to the Remuneration Tribunal.


But we can be quite clear that the government is confident that Fair Work Australia will continue to fulfil its functions under the Fair Work Act diligently and well. Senator Abetz would be aware that over time, since the establishment of Fair Work Australia, there have been differential arrangements in relation to the costs of the agency, some of those associated with dealing with the new act and the new arrangements that were first implemented and with changes that have occurred subsequently. What the government has done on this occasion is respond to requests from Fair Work Australia to set up new administrative arrangements. We rely on Fair Work Australia to advise us on what administrative arrangements it needs, and any further costs that may need to be considered would be a matter of the usual budgetary arrangements. We are confident that Fair Work Australia will absorb the cost in relation to these measures that they have sought, without any loss of function in other areas.


On the cost of the vice-presidents, I have already mentioned this is a matter for the Remuneration Tribunal and any costs beyond those that have been estimated in a broad sense would be subject to normal budgetary processes.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-11-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:41):  So what we have is a situation where we do not actually know the cost of these two new appointments; the cost is going to be subject to whatever the Remuneration Tribunal might determine. But, irrespective of what the cost is, the government is saying it will be absorbed by Fair Work Australia. We do not know what the cost of the name change is going to be, but it is going to be sorted out by Fair Work Australia simply absorbing the costs.


We cannot be told where the money is going to come from within Fair Work Australia because Fair Work Australia is still working through it. What that tells us clearly is that this has been rushed. Fair Work Australia itself still has no idea where the money is going to come from within its internal budgets. This is indicative, yet again, of the shambolic and rushed nature of this legislation, because Fair Work Australia itself has not been given the time to work out where the money is going to come from. The parliamentary secretary has been kind to tell the Senate that, when the process is known and the outcome of the process is known, she is willing to tell the Senate. But what we know is that we will not know the answer before the vote. So here we have the parliamentary secretary, and I am sure the Greens will oblige her, asking the parliament to vote for legislation when we do not know where the money is coming from and how the arrangements are going to be made internally.


It is this sort of shambolic management—just a snapshot—of Fair Work Australia which provides us with a window into the total management of the Australian economy by this government. They have no idea where the money is coming from and they make changes with no idea how much it is going to cost. We are still waiting on Fair Work Australia, we are still waiting on the Remuneration Tribunal—and so the uncertainty goes on. But we need to vote on this today, irrespective of what the actual outcome or consequences might be!


I am a relatively hopeful individual, and a person who has a positive outlook, but I must say I doubt that the Senate is going to get any further answers in relation to these matters, so allow me to move on and test the parliamentary secretary. Every piece of workplace relations legislation that this government has introduced thus far has been rushed through the House of Representatives only to find itself in an embarrassing position in this place requiring further amendments. Can the parliamentary secretary guarantee us that the government is absolutely and utterly confident that this legislation does not need any further government amendments?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (09:44):  Perhaps I will close off on the last set of questions from Senator Abetz by making the point that Fair Work Australia has sought to make administrative changes for quite sensible reasons, and the government has responded to those requests.


Fair Work Australia understand that they need to absorb the costs of those arrangements and, other than the issues that the opposition is now raising, I am not aware of any concerns about them needing to do so. Senator Abetz may want to wait until the next round of estimates and explore this issue further, but there has been no evidence before me that there is an issue for Fair Work Australia in absorbing the costs associated with the changes that they themselves have sought.


With respect to every piece of workplace relations legislation, Senator Abetz wants to test me within the recent period of workplace relations. He knows as well as I do that workplace relations law is a constantly evolving issue. I think back to the various waves of workplace relations law, and were I to ask a similar question during a period of the Howard government it would possibly have had a response which was even more so. But I take the Senate back to the context of my summing-up speech, where I indicated and, indeed, Senator Cash highlighted—and I think that even Senator Abetz has used this language too, but I might be wrong there—that this is the first tranche of amendments, the matters that are generally agreed in response to the review of the Fair Work panel.


The first tranche are those matters which we think have general agreement and which can be moved forward fairly speedily. That said, the government has indicated that we have an open mind to further amendments that may be required in response to the other recommendations of the review panel. Some of those recommendations may cross some of the amendments that we are dealing with here so, no, Senator Abetz, I would not be in a position to say that there will not be a requirement for further amendments in the matters that we are dealing with now.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-11-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:47):  Of course, it is very obvious that Fair Work Australia accepts that it has to absorb the costs. What else can it do? What else can it do in the face of the government changing legislation and foisting these things on Fair Work Australia without giving it extra money? The parliamentary secretary says, 'Oh, they realise that they have to absorb it.' Everybody knows that they have to absorb it, but that is not, with respect, a justification for what has occurred, especially in circumstances where we do not know where those cost-cutting measures will occur within Fair Work Australia. I have a funny feeling that those cuts may well occur in the area of monitoring registered organisations, and that in the event that we have another Craig Thomson-Health Services Union debacle we will once again see Fair Work Australia underresourced and incapable of dealing with the issues as it should have done. But let us move on.


I seek leave of the Senate to move opposition amendments (2), (3) and (5) on sheet 7305 together.


Leave granted.




Senator ABETZ:
  I move:


(2) Schedule 2, item 43, page 22 (line 10), omit ""Vice President or"".


(3) Schedule 8, item 1, page 43 (line 7), omit paragraph 606(2)(c).


(5) Schedule 8, item 16, page 49 (line 7), omit ""a Vice President,"".


The opposition also opposes schedules 8 and 11 in the following terms:


(6) Schedule 8, items 17 to 56, page 49 (line 9) to page 53 (line 16), TO BE OPPOSED.


(14) Schedule 11, item 21, page 184 (lines 13 to 16), TO BE OPPOSED.


I thank the Senate. This raft of opposition amendments deals with the creation of two new vice-presidential positions on the body known as Fair Work Australia. These two new positions were not canvassed in the Fair Work Act review panel's report. In the 250 submissions made to the review there was no such suggestion. As a result, not surprisingly, the review panel saw no need to make such a recommendation.


It is therefore appropriate to ask from whence did this recommendation come. We now know that this recommendation came as a result of one ex-trade union boss talking to another ex-trade union boss—the former Assistant Secretary of the ACTU, who just happens to be the president of Fair Work Australia, talking to Mr Shorten, the former AWU boss, who now happens to be the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations—and it was determined that it would be a good idea to have these two new vice-presidential positions.


This is a very important issue. The reason it is important has been highlighted by no lesser authority than the Law Council of Australia. The Law Council of Australia have set out, in a very articulate manner, a very well-reasoned manner and a very robust manner, how these two new appointments will be a diminution of judicial independence within Australia. It is a bad precedent, and they have said so. The government's response is like Ms Gillard's response in relation to the AWU scandal—basically a lot of words without any meaning and without any proper defence of the matters put to them.


This bill creates two additional vice-presidential positions and they will be the second and third highest positions within Fair Work Australia. The minister has completely failed to explain why these positions are required, let alone justified, apart from the department's submission that the president of Fair Work Australia—a former assistant ACTU secretary—sought the additional roles. These two positions would slot in as the second and third most senior officers of the tribunal.


Since the announcement of these two additional positions, there has been widespread community concern, including from within Fair Work Australia itself. Clearly, with this new appointment in Fair Work Australia of a new president, there is a power struggle occurring within Fair Work Australia. And what better way for the government to get complete domination than simply creating two new positions and appointing two new people into them? The Australian Financial Review recently reported:


In an email obtained by the Weekend Financial Review, Senior deputy president Les Kaufman wrote to Fair Work president Iain Ross on Wednesday questioning the need for two positions, which reintroduces a level of seniority at the tribunal that was removed under the Fair Work Act in 2009.


Mr Kaufman, the senior deputy president, said the appointments would 'further erode the standing' of the tribunal and 'gives rise to the perception it is being stacked'. It is no longer a perception that it is being stacked; it is absolutely proven that it has been stacked. But allow me to continue to quote. The article went on to report that senior deputy president Les Kaufman said in his letter:


Although I have no direct interest in the creation of the two new vice-president positions because, as you know my commission expires on December 1—


so only a few more days to go, and nothing in it for this senior deputy president, Mr Kaufman; he is just expressing his concern. He goes on to say:


… I wish to express my dismay at what appears to be a retrograde step.


You might think senior vice-president Les Kaufman was having a whack on the way out and might be a lone voice, but it is not so. The article goes on to say:


Deputy presidents Graeme Watson and Peter Richards have also written to Justice Ross over concerns the federal government will use the opportunity to install government-friendly appointees.


Here we have a senior deputy president and two deputy presidents writing to the president of Fair Work Australia and disagreeing with his suggestion—which he seems to have cobbled together with the minister—to create these two new positions.


Many submissions to the Senate committee in relation to this expressed deep reservations about the inclusion of these two positions. Some of the comments included:


From our perspective the need for the creation of these additional positions and the requirement that they be statutory positions is unclear. Neither the Fair Work Act Review Panel nor submissions to the review have identified the absence of these statutory positions as inhibiting the performance of Fair Work Australia.


Possibly, we might get an explanation from the government as to how the lack of these positions is inhibiting the performance of Fair Work Australia. Clearly, three deputy presidents of Fair Work Australia do not think it is. They have very real concerns and, of course, we know about the Law Council's concerns. Another submission said:


This was not recommended by the Panel. It is unclear why these amendments are necessary or required and are opposed without amendments.


Another comment from the submission reads:


It is unclear why the existing Vice Presidents would not be suitable for re-appointment to the new statutory Vice Presidential roles.


To this end, there was wide stakeholder support for the appointment of the two members of Fair Work Australia to the new positions titled as vice-president. Steve Knott of AMMA told the committee :'The legislation previously recognised the two existing vice presidents, Vice President Lawler and Vice President Watson, but the current legislation does not.' Clearly what we have, with the move to the Fair Work Act, is the government deliberately cutting these two people out of vice-presidential positions to move them to the side. The government is now moving to create two new positions and, as a result, is sidelining these two vice-presidential office holders of Fair Work Australia.


The proposal to have the legislation recognise these two roles once again, and put two new people into them, is unacceptable. It is real pea-and-thimble trick. For those with long memories in industrial relations, we will go back to the eighties when there was new legislation and everybody got appointed except one member of the tribunal—a fellow by the name of Justice Staples. I think this gives the opportunity—and again, we have commented on this publicly—to really damage the independence, or the perceived independence and impartiality, of the tribunal. We have senior appointments made to the tribunal through the political cycle. There are people who are appointed by one side who may not be appointed by another side, but that is the way it goes over the fullness of time in the political cycle.


The coalition is deeply concerned that the appointment of pro-Labor vice-presidents would bring into question the tribunal's integrity, which has already suffered considerable damage courtesy of the Health Services Union scandal. But, if I may say so, the most significant submission comes from the Law Council of Australia, which said in part:


Members of FWA are appointed to a quasi-judicial position. The status of FWA depends upon the independence and impartiality of its Members being maintained and being seen to be maintained.


As a general principle, once a person has been appointed to sit on a Court or independent Tribunal with designated powers and privileges, any change that would have the effect of removing or reducing that particular person's powers or privileges while not affecting the powers and privileges of other Members of that Tribunal, has a tendency to undermine the independence of the Court or Tribunal.


…   …   …


Should the Government appoint the two individuals currently designated Vice President to the two statutory Vice President positions, then their status will not be reduced. However, if the two Deputy Presidents designated Vice Presidents are not so appointed, the effect of the Bill will be to reduce their status. Henceforth responsibilities that would have been capable of being delegated or given to them by nature of their senior status would instead be given to the new statutory Vice Presidents.


This would have the tendency to reduce the independence of the Tribunal in that it will reduce the role and privileges associated with particular individuals.


So says the Law Council of Australia.


The government's argument in response to that to date has been shallow, has been hollow and has been completely absent of any rationale, any robust rejoinder. The only rationale is that this is a government that thinks it might be in its death throes and wants to future-proof Fair Work Australia from any future appointments by another government and therefore has rushed through this legislation, created two new positions and further stacked Fair Work Australia.


I remind the parliamentary secretary of Mr Rudd's promise before the 2007 election:


I give you this as an absolute guarantee here on your program. I will not be prime minister of this country and appoint some endless tribe of trade union officials to staff or ex trade union officials to staff the key positions in this body. That's not my intention. That's not the way in which it's going to work.


Well, we now know that that is exactly the way it has worked under both the Rudd and Gillard governments. It is like their carbon tax promise: hollow, shallow, with no intention of delivering on it—simply words before the election to get them over the line and then do the exact opposite afterwards.


I ask of the parliamentary secretary: what are the entitlements of the two new vice-presidents? We do not know that as yet, I understand, because the Remuneration Tribunal still has to make the determination. This is very unhelpful in circumstances where we are supposed to vote on this without knowing what their entitlements will be. The Greens might like being treated as mushrooms, but we, the coalition, do not.


The other answer that I have is about the current people on Fair Work Australia who have judges pension entitlements. If they apply for one of these two new positions on Fair Work Australia, would they lose their judicial pension entitlements? It is understood that the new appointments will not have these judicial pension entitlements so, apart from their remuneration, there is also the question of what their pension entitlements might be.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (10:03):  I might commence by dealing in general with the government's response to these opposition amendments and then I will move to answer the questions that Senator Abetz asked at the conclusion, as well as perhaps addressing a few of the other observations he made in that process which do not stand up to any serious scrutiny. I know that Senator Abetz thinks that he has got case closed on balance and appointments to this tribunal but I would suggest that he is making quite a few cheap political points that would not stand up to any serious scrutiny.


The government does not support the opposition's proposed amendments. The two new vice-president roles to be created within the tribunal were recommended by the President of Fair Work Australia, Justice Ross. In establishing Fair Work Australia, the government took the decision to abolish the formal statutory positions of vice-president and senior vice-president, as Senator Abetz has indicated. Vice-presidents and senior deputy vice-presidents became deputy presidents within the Fair Work Australia structure. Let us remove that illusion around the seniority issue that Senator Abetz has raised.


In the transition arrangements in moving from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to Fair Work Australia former senior deputy presidents and vice-presidents were entitled to retain their former entitlements and titles. Indeed, this gives me the opportunity to reflect on Senator Abetz's visit to the 1980s around appointments and remind those listening and the Senate that in the transition from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to Fair Work Australia all positions were maintained—complete balance, complete reflection of the existing arrangements. Those arrangements had principally been established under the Howard government with a track record I do not intend spending some detail visiting; I think it is pretty much a matter of record.


Justice Ross recommended to the government providing for two senior positions within the tribunal to ensure senior legal specialists with high-level expertise were attracted to Fair Work Australia, and, I stress, to assist him in the administration and management of the tribunal. Senator Abetz likes to highlight some of the issues facing Fair Work Australia. He likes to highlight the need for independence and the need for administrative and management improvements. This is indeed the solution that Justice Ross has raised in relation to some of those issues. So it surprises me now that the opposition seek to oppose the president of Fair Work Australia in dealing with some of the internal management issues that the opposition themselves have canvassed.


Fair Work Australia deals with important and complex matters of industrial law and should be resourced accordingly. In addition to matters of industrial law, Fair Work is undertaking a broad range of functions, including the new Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal jurisdiction, a major projects panel and a new comprehensive stakeholder engagement model. Creating these positions will assist Fair Work Australia to deal with such matters. The criteria for appointment as vice-presidents will be set out in the Fair Work Act and are reflected in the bill. This reflects the approach taken in respect of other members of Fair Work Australia and previous iterations of legislation.


The process for selecting the two new vice-presidents will be open and transparent. The government has committed to a merit-based selection process for these appointments. The positions will be advertised publicly and anyone will be able to apply for the positions. An advisory panel consisting of senior officers of the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and the APSC will recommend a short list of applicants and the incumbent minister will then seek cabinet's endorsement of the appointments, as is the usual practice. The endorsed candidates will then be recommended to the Governor-General and to the Executive Council.


I dealt with Senator Abetz's brief visit to the 1980s on the issue of appointments and highlighted probably the most recent principal example of how the Prime Minister has met the commitment she made in relation to balance within Fair Work Australia, to be the Fair Work Commission. But I think I need to address in a little more detail Senator Abetz's claim that there is a perception that Fair Work Australia is, in his words, being stacked. Whilst he relates to some internal memos or communications from some existing commissioners, the public record on recent appointments highlights that there is a general satisfaction with the balance that has been established within Fair Work Australia. I have in front of me three press releases. The first one relates to ACCI: 'Employers welcome Fair Work appointments'. Another is dated February this year: 'Employers commend Shorten on Geoff Bull's appointment to Fair Work Australia'. A further newspaper article in the Australian in February this year: 'All sides approve of Fair Work appointees'. So I do not think that the case is quite as established as Senator Abetz seems to think it is. I do add some further context, since Senator Abetz referred to the Prime Minister's remarks. She referred to ministerial advisers. If I a recall correctly, there was a chief of staff of Minister Reith who was appointed to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as registrar.


The government has gone nowhere near the excesses of the Howard government in the balance that it has introduced into Fair Work Australia and the Fair Work system. We have maintained appointments that were made under the Howard government. The appointments made to the Fair Work Ombudsman and the commission have been balanced and fair.


The ongoing problem that I might highlight to Senator Abetz—as a challenge more than anything else—is finding high-calibre women candidates to appoint, particularly on the employer side. He might like to assist the minister and me in encouraging more candidates to seek appointment to the tribunal. This is a challenge that we have raised with employer organisations, and we hope that over time there will be some improvements in that respect.


Senator Abetz asked and then answered his own question on entitlements, and we will be waiting for the Remuneration Tribunal to establish some detail there, but he did seek an assurance on judges' pension entitlements with respect to existing office holders, and I am advised that if existing office holders who carry such entitlements are appointed to the positions the government will, through regulation, ensure that those arrangements are preserved.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-11-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:11):  So when did the government decide to make sure that those things would be preserved by regulation? Undoubtedly, that is something that should have been in the legislation itself, but it will seek to cover a deficiency via regulation. Just in case anybody who is listening thought that there was a substantial argument made out by the parliamentary secretary that that which I had asserted does not stand up to scrutiny about the stacking of Fair Work Australia, let me just ask them—in particular the parliamentary secretary—that, out of the 17 appointments made thus far, who can tell us how many were ex-trade-union bosses, given the promise that it would not be an endless tribe of ex-trade-union officials? Would you think one or two, possibly? Three or four? Five or six? All right, let's go halfway at eight out of the 17. Nah—you got it wrong; it is 12 out of the 17—over two-thirds. But that is not an endless tribe of ex-trade-union officials according to the parliamentary secretary. Heaven help us if two-thirds plus is not an endless tribe. What it means is that a 100 per cent stacking and packing of Fair Work Australia also would not be an endless tribe to Fair Work Australia appointments. 


Need I remind the parliamentary secretary of the appointment of the very first manager of Fair Work Australia—an ex-trade-union official. What was that person's role? The oversight of the Health Services Union inquiry and the inquiry into Craig Thomson. And just when the heat was getting on, just when we as a coalition were seeking to have questions asked of him at a Senate estimates hearing, what does the government do? It miraculously appoints him to the commission of Fair Work Australia to put him out of reach of senators' questions as to the absolutely disgraceful handling of the Craig Thomson and the Health Services Union matter. So this manager, who oversaw this absolute disregard for process and this disgraceful delay in the Craig Thomson-Health Services Union matter, is not chided but rewarded by this government and elevated to the bench of Fair Work Australia. If that is not enough, there is a vacancy created in the managerial role of Fair Work Australia. I wonder what sort of person we might appoint to that vacancy. Guess what! Another ex-trade-union official. But it is not an endless tribe, you understand; it is not an endless tribe of ex-trade-union officials being appointed!


Well, chances are that I misinterpreted what Mr Rudd meant when he said there would not be an endless tribe of ex-trade union officials being appointed. I actually took him at face value. Clearly, I was wrong, as the Australian people were wrong in relation to the no carbon tax promise made at the last election.


We have been told that these appointments are open, transparent and merit based, as undoubtedly was the appointment of that greatly successful manager of Fair Work Australia who oversaw the Health Services Union debacle—open and merit based. What a fantastic job! They did a great job looking into the Craig Thomson Health Services Union for—how many years was it?—three years or whatever it was. Great! And merit demanded that this sort of performance saw this person put onto the bench of Fair Work Australia.


What about the trade union official who was in diabolical trouble with his own trade union, the Electrical Trades Union, which was suing him, if I recall, for about $1 million? They were wanting back pay for the moneys he had received while sitting on one of those industry super funds as a board member, milking out money. There will be more talk about the industry super funds and the default funds under the modern award system later on today. But guess what happened to this person? The day before his announcement to Fair Work Australia was made public—it was just serendipitous; it was just coincidental—the case with the union miraculously settled. Oh please! Merit based? Open? Transparent? I could go on with a list. I think the government knows it cannot claim honesty in relation to that assertion.


Coming back to the issue that Justice Ross says is required, namely, a 'high level of expertise', I think the term was, I am sorry but, with great respect, is the government asserting that that high level of expertise does not currently exist on the bench of Fair Work Australia? I can tell you, there are many people who would clearly fit into that category who would be, I am sure, more than willing to assist the president if he were willing to use their expertise, their experience and their reputation to assist him in the management and running of Fair Work Australia. I say to the government again that no genuine argument has been made out for this enhanced stacking and packing measure of Fair Work Australia.


I finally make a comment in relation to female appointments. It is amazing. The second-last time around, when I pursued the so-called merit based appointments to Fair Work Australia, it was astounding how the selection process showed a complete dearth of quality private sector people worthy of the short list. But, oh, the ex-trade union officials made the short list. They were in there, right through. They made the short list as high-quality individuals. All I would ask you to do, Parliamentary Secretary, if you do want to look for female candidates for appointment to workplace relations tribunals, is look no further than the new LNP government in Queensland, which have appointed for their industrial commission a very distinguished lady, Minna Knight. But people like that, I am sure, simply would not make the short list or would—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  I am not going to indicate whether or not, because there are privacy considerations involved.


But it is interesting that, when you have an LNP government elected, all of a sudden it finds meritorious female candidates to appoint to its industrial tribunals, yet this government, with all its quotas and other things, seems to have great difficulty.


I will leave my contribution to this amendment at that. I commend the amendment to the Senate. I believe it is worthy. I simply say to the Greens: even if you want to discount every single word I have said in this debate, as is usually your wont, please do so—please be my guest—but you cannot discount—




Senator Polley:
  Yes.




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Polley smiles and says, 'Yes.' But, even if you discard every single word I have said, how on earth do you discard the words of three deputy presidents of Fair Work Australia and how do you discard the very wise counsel of the Law Council of Australia? The parliamentary secretary and the government can play politics with my words, but they cannot play politics with the considered views of three deputy presidents of Fair Work Australia or the Law Council of Australia. That is what makes the coalition so confident that it is right on the fundamental matter of principle that these amendments should be carried—namely, that these two new positions should not be established. Given that the government cannot respond in any coherent way to reject the views of these three deputy presidents and the Law Council of Australia, we can be left with no other conclusion than that this is a deliberate attempt to stack and pack Fair Work Australia, as the government feels it might be in the death throes.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (10:21):  Unfortunately, I have been provoked to traverse some territory I was hoping not to occupy Senate time with, but I think the responses of my colleagues and others to at least three references of 'stacking and packing' warrant some consideration. Those listening and other senators need to understand that Senator Abetz's view about what constitutes a union official is a particularly interesting one. Anyone who has ever, at any stage of their professional career, been associated with a trade union would fit his category. So just imagine, across the Australian workforce, people across a broad range of professions and experience—for instance, mine, professional social work. Because I was involved with a union—because I joined a union at the age of about 16—I would fit his category. It is just ludicrous. He counts, for instance, Justice Ross as one of these 'stacks'. He may not particularly like that particular appointment, but it is not really a fair characterisation of the balance and composition of Fair Work Australia, and I do not think that Senator Abetz does the tribunal justice with this approach.


In relation to the Law Council's submission, we need to remind the chamber that what the government is doing is re-establishing an arrangement of seniority that had been in place for many years. The Law Council is concerned about relative positions of some of the existing office holders. Unfortunately, change involves affecting relative positions of existing office holders. That is a necessary consequence of change.


The other three considered views that Senator Abetz highlights relate, if I have got this correct, to at least one and perhaps three leaked emails, possibly taken out of context. I am not sure about how those deputy presidents feel about the opposition bandying around leaked emails, or what their motives may or may not have been in commenting, or how that material came into the public realm. It may have been reported by the Australian Financial Review, but I remind senators and those listening that that is the context of the reporting of those views, not necessarily in their full context. These were private communications between them and the President of Fair Work Australia and certainly cannot be taken as representative of the view of Fair Work Australia commissioners and deputy presidents.


What we do know, as a matter of fact, is that the President of Fair Work Australia sought to have the government re-establish seniority arrangements that had previously been in place to assist him in the administration and management of an agency which we all know has reviewed its internal processes so that it can deal with some of the issues and problems associated, as Senator Abetz highlighted, with resourcing and work in certain areas.


This is what the government is doing to try to assist Fair Work Australia overcome some of the difficulties that have arisen in recent times.

 (Western Australia) (10:32):  Before I move the opposition's next amendments, I advise that I placed on record a series of concise questions last night, and I would be interested in the government's answers.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (10:32):  For Senator Cormann's benefit, as he may not have been listening at the stage when Senator Abetz and I discussed how to deal with the issues that he raised last night, I advise that we agreed—I think as a courtesy to Senator Cormann—to delay responding to Senator Cormann's questions until Senator Cormann was in the chamber. So I am happy to cover those issues now.


As I highlighted with respect to their amendments generally, the government does not support the opposition's proposed amendments. Our reforms to the default fund selection process will ensure that default superannuation contributions in modern awards will be directed to funds that meet the best interests of employees covered by modern awards. We are enabling superannuation funds to apply for default fund status on an equal footing. This will increase competition in the default fund market, which will drive product and service improvements for the benefit of both members and employers.


Our reforms largely reflect the approach recommended by the Productivity Commission. I think this is a critical point, picking up some of the issues that Senator Cormann raised last night. I should highlight that we are proud of our superannuation reforms and further refinements are simply that—refinements responding to the recommendation of the Productivity Commission.


The opposition's approach, on the other hand, is for employers to be able to select from any available MySuper product. This approach was comprehensively rejected by the Productivity Commission. On the opposition's approach, the Productivity Commission noted it:


… does not have an explicit focus on the best interests of employees. It assumes that their best interests will be reflected in the decisions made by employers …


This is one of the critical reasons around why industry superannuation was established in the first instance. We know from the history of superannuation that you cannot have a system based on relying on the best interests of employees being reflected in the decisions made by employers.


The commission went on to note that most employers, particularly small- and medium-sized employers:


… do not necessarily have the incentive, interest or expertise to make a decision that is aligned with the best interests of employees …


The government's approach will ensure that the best interests of employees covered by a specific award are protected by ensuring those employees are placed in the most appropriate MySuper products. The opposition's approach was strongly opposed by unions, industry superannuation funds and employers, including the Ai Group. The government is looking after the best interests of employees whose super is directed to the default fund. The opposition are only looking after their own cheap political interests.


In respect of how these changes will improve the existing approach, our reforms ensure that default superannuation contributions in modern awards will be directed to funds that meet the best interests covered by the relevant award. For the super funds, our reforms enable them to apply for default fund status on an equal footing. All funds with a generic MySuper product will be able to apply to the Fair Work commission for selection as a default fund on an equal basis, which will bring greater contestability to the system. We are increasing competition in the default fund market, which will drive product and service improvements to the benefit of both fund members and employers while ensuring that the default superannuation system operates in the best interests of employees and at the same time responding to the clear recommendations of the Productivity Commission.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2012-11-28,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (10:36):  I have a few observations in relation to that. That was an extraordinary contribution by the government. Just to explain this: so the government is saying that an amendment which would provide that all MySuper default products—products which are in the process of being legislated by this government—which have in them all of the consumer protection mechanisms that this government judges are necessary, that giving the option for any such products to compete with each other, can somehow be contrary to the best interests of employees? If that is what the government is saying, then it should withdraw its MySuper bills immediately. What it is saying is that even though a super product can qualify for registration as a MySuper default product, consistent with its legislative requirements, that is not in itself a guarantee that that product is an appropriate default fund product. Quite frankly, if that is the government's position, then this whole process—going through three different bills in order to legislate the features of a super product that have to be there in order to ensure that those Australians who are not making active choices about their superannuation are properly protected and have a product that properly caters for their needs—is a complete waste of time.


Given the government is currently legislating to ensure that those Australians who do not make active choices in relation to their superannuation arrangements end up in a default product that has been designed by this Labor government—which is called the MySuper product—if the government is now saying that those products are inadequate and are not in the best interests of employees across Australia, then why bother with that at all? You are completely wasting your time.


The other thing the minister said is that the Productivity Commission recommended against us. That is only a half-truth. The Productivity Commission recommended genuine competition until Minister Shorten bullied them into changing their minds.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Please!




Senator CORMANN:
  That is exactly what happened. I refer you back to the draft report, the interim report and the interim recommendations that were put out by the Productivity Commission.


They were very clear in recommending strong and appropriate moves to a more open, transparent and competitive process. Minister Shorten took the unprecedented step for him to respond to a review before it had actually finally reported. That is never what Minister Shorten does. That is completely inconsistent with his usual modus operandi. Everybody that has anything to do with Minister Shorten knows that that is not normally how he does business. It was a very unique approach. Normally, for any report that comes back to him he has a follow-up consultative review and discussion—a review into the review type process. Quite frankly, in a general sense, Minister Shorten struggles with making decisions. But on this one there was a very clear driver: Minister Shorten wanted to protect the vested commercial interests of his friends in the union movement, who clearly have an interest through union-dominated industry funds to preserve the current situation for as long as possible, which gives them an unfair competitive advantage.


The minister talks about the fact that the Australian Industry Group is also supportive of the government's approach through this legislation—prescribing further government intervention through Fair Work Australia, despite the fact that the Fair Work Australia process as deployed over the last four or so years has been widely discredited. There is such a thing in Australia, still, sadly, called the industrial relations club. There are some cosy arrangements at times between organisational stakeholder interests that are separate from the actual best interests of individual Australians. That is what is happening there. They want to have this cosy arrangement through which, behind closed doors and through a non-transparent, non-competitive process, they can make deals. That is not in the public interest.


What is in the public interest is to have the greatest variety and number of suppliers from across the board—industry funds, retail funds, you name it—competing with each other and keeping each other on their toes in terms of fund performance, investment performance, fees and quality of service. Across all these aspects of the superannuation value proposition it is important to have appropriate competitive tensions to ensure that people can make informed decisions about what is in the best interests of employers and employees in a particular set of circumstances.


The minister in her answer today effectively told us that the MySuper default fund product is not worth the paper the legislation is written on, because, in her words, 'Letting employers direct Australians who do not make active choices in relation to superannuation into MySuper default fund products is contrary to the employee's best interests', unless Fair Work Australia can do another job on top of it—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  I quoted the Productivity Commission.




Senator CORMANN:
  That is exactly what you said, Minister. Either the government trusts its own legislation in terms of defining in legislation what a default fund product should look like—either the government agrees that it has come up with the right consumer protection features in their MySuper legislation, and then as soon as a product complies with the conditions of registration as a MySuper product then any of them should be adequate and appropriate and in the best interests of employees that are not making active choices in relation to their superannuation—or do you think that what you have done is inadequate? If so, you should go back to the drawing board. But to somehow say, 'We're going to let all of you register but even though all of you comply with our conditions of registration we are going to determine through a secretive process who is going to be allowed to compete and who is not allowed to compete,' is just completely inappropriate. It seeks to enshrine yet again an anti-competitive arrangement that, quite frankly, has been widely discredited for some time.


With those few words, I will talk through all of the amendments before moving them in turn because, procedurally, I will not be able to move them all together. Essentially, the objective of the amendments that I am about to move is to ensure that there can be proper and genuine competition between the great diversity of MySuper products which will be available from 1 July 2013, and that all Australians in default super can have the benefits of genuine competition between any MySuper product which complies with the government's requirements for registration as a MySuper product and not just with those select few which have been identified through a discredited process through Fair Work Australia. 


Amendments (1) and (2) remove commencement dates for schedules that the coalition is opposing. Amendment (3) provides that the changes in the amendments will not commence until after the commencement of relevant schedules in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Act 2012—currently a bill before the parliament—that is, to link this amendment with what I have just talked about in terms of the availability of the government's own legislated MySuper default fund products. 


Amendment (4) removes schedule 1. Schedule 1 at present amends the Fair Work Act to introduce a process under which the Fair Work Commission will review default fund terms in modern awards every four years. This will no longer be necessary if all MySuper products can be selected under any modern award as we believe should be the case. 


Amendment (5) removes schedule 2, which currently institutes the expert panel as part of the Minimum Wage Panel in Fair Work Australia. Again, this is an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. Consumer protection requirements have already been built into MySuper products—or so we have been led to believe by the government, which is clearly completely internally inconsistent with the way it has approached this. 


Amendment (6) makes the substantive change to allow for any MySuper product to be available under all modern awards. Amendment (7) makes a minor consequential change to schedule 11.


Let me also point out that we are moving these amendments today to give the Senate the opportunity to do the right thing, to give the Senate the opportunity to help ensure that Australians who are not making active choices in relation to their superannuation arrangements can nevertheless benefit from the highest possible fund performance, the lowest possible fees and the best possible service and, because of competitive tensions that are engendered through genuine competition, this will lead to a maximisation of their retirement savings. That is the reason we are moving these amendments.


If these amendments are unsuccessful today, this will form part of the coalition policy going into the next election. Given that this government has been so belligerent in refusing to do the right thing in this area by continuing to protect the vested commercial interests of their friends in the union movement rather than do the right thing in the public interest, if this does not get fixed between now and the next election a future coalition government will fix it. With those few words I seek leave to move opposition amendments (4), (5) and (7) on sheet 7304 together.


Leave granted.

6 Subsection 539(2) (column 1 of item 11 of the table)



After ""351(1)"", insert ""351A(1)"".


I rise today to move this amendment for the Australian Greens on whistleblowing or public interest disclosure. This is something the Australian Greens feel very strongly about. We note that the government made all sorts of promises about dealing with comprehensive whistleblower legislation, but we are yet to see it.


This is a really important amendment as we know that whistleblowers in Australia are afraid to come forward in many cases because they suffer vilification and frequently they lose their jobs or do not get promotion. So we are in a situation where, instead of transparency and openness and reporting of problems, we have covering up. This amendment will enshrine whistleblowing as a workplace right under Fair Work Australia. The act applies to 80 per cent of the Australian workforce, including the federal government sector, many state agencies and large swathes of the private sector. If claims are made that it covers small business, we can say that the overwhelming majority who are doing nothing wrong have nothing to fear.


Essentially, this amendment will enshrine whistleblowing as a protected right through the existing mechanism in the act called 'adverse action'. What that does is prevent an employer, fellow employee or contractor from taking an adverse action against someone after they have made a public interest disclosure. This could include firing them, demoting them, reducing their pay, cancelling supply orders et cetera. If an adverse action is taken they will be able to claim compensation under the act.


The example that I can give is one that has just been reported in the last couple of weeks—that is, with Mr Twiggy Forrest's Fortescue Metal Group. They commissioned an archaeologist firm to inspect the cultural artefacts and connections of the traditional owners in the Pilbara. When Fortescue did not like the results, they ordered that sections be taken out and they withheld payments until they did. This scourge affects environmental assessments and native title applications too. One firm wrote to the Western Australian department after the requested changes were made and the other refused to make the changes and had to forgo $70,000. In the private sector, whistleblowing protections should extend to contractual right to payment as well as subsequent adverse treatment against contractors if they make a protected disclosure.


Another example is the HIH collapse. This could have been avoided if these proposals were in place at the time. The external actuaries and auditors of HIH relied so heavily on their business that they did nothing when the HIH board refused to heed the recommendations and deferred to the board's authority in fear of upsetting the business relationship and regular work. So there was no incentive or protection for people to blow the whistle on what was clearly going on in that particular company. It is important that we move to recognise whistleblowing as a workplace right.


In addition to adverse action, the amendment also incorporates threats and harassment to stop workplace bullying, which commonly follows disclosure of the information. As we heard recently when a former policeman came forward in relation to what has led to a royal commission into sexual abuse, he knew that his career would be over in terms of the bullying that would go on as he revealed the extent to which moves had been suppressed within the police force formerly.


To qualify for the protections of Fair Work, the whistleblower must first raise the issue with the employer and then, if there is no adequate response to the disclosure within a reasonable time, they may make a disclosure that is reasonably necessary to another person. If it is not appropriate for the person to inform their employer for a justifiable reason, they can immediately inform a third party and still be covered by the scheme. If the above procedure is followed, they would be immune from civil and criminal action arising from the disclosure. It is really important that we take this on board and work now to make sure that we give whistleblowers this workplace right and protect them from any adverse consequences that might occur when they are clearly acting in the public interest. It needs to be not only in the public sector but it also needs to cover the private sector.


The classes of disclosable conduct are listed in the subclause, and there is a catch-all in (e) that says they include 'illegal acts, misappropriating money or property, misuse or concealment of information and risks to public health, a person's safety, and the environment'. In other words, they are disclosable conduct that would be protected by making whistleblowing a fairly extensive workplace right. But a person who discloses information, or even a part of it, with knowledge that it is false or misleading will not be covered by the provisions, so it is not just a carte blanche and it is not trying to encourage vexatious individuals or people making up things or presenting false information. It is actually saying that the provision for whistleblowers covers you providing the information you are giving is truthful and in accordance with what you are claiming. It will cover people in the public and private sectors.


Given the enormous wealth that is being made around the country, particularly in the resources sector, and the decision by the Commonwealth to devolve responsibility to the states for environmental protection and environmental assessment, it is critical that we get coverage for whistleblowers in legislation. I am hoping that there will be support in the Senate for acting on what people say they want—that is, actually protecting whistleblowers in the public interest and making whistleblowing a workplace right.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (11:07):  While the government recognises the importance of providing strong protections to workers who act in the public interest, it will not support these amendments. The government notes that the Fair Work Act currently provides some protection from adverse action where a person has or exercises a workplace right. A workplace right relevantly includes where a person is able to make a complaint or inquiry to a person or body having a capacity under a workplace law to seek compliance with the law or a workplace instrument, or if the person is an employee in relation to their employment.


The government proposes that the need for any amendment to the Fair Work Act should be carefully considered following the release of the government's response to the report of the inquiry into whistleblower protections within the Australian Public Service, which is scheduled for early in the parliamentary new year. For example, the proposed amendments are broad and seek to provide protections to a broad range of disclosures without any appropriate framework for who such disclosures should be made to. Nor do they provide potential disclosers with the certainty of whether their actions are legal or not, with the courts having to make decisions about whether the public disclosure was reasonable or not. The government considers this issue is too important to rush ahead of proper consultation and response to the report, and also highlights that these amendments relate mostly to the first tranche of recommendations from the Fair Work Act review panel. It is in this context that we believe these matters should be dealt with elsewhere.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:09):  Just very briefly, on this occasion I adopt the words of the minister in relation to this—especially her last words—that one of the reasons we should not be considering this is that we should not rush ahead without proper consultation. I think that has been a continuing theme of the coalition and the opposition in relation to this legislation—which, it will be recalled—was introduced into the House of Representatives one day, voted upon on the next day, and then it was exempted from the cut-off in the Senate. It was rushed through here, rushed through a committee, and we have said that proper consultation does need to take place. Clearly what the Australian Greens are doing this morning is to introduce a completely new issue—which they are entitled to do, but it is a completely new issue—in relation to the Fair Work Act regime which has not had consultations with the various stakeholders. 


The coalition's amendments specifically deal with matters that have actually been canvassed in the bill and have actually had some exposure, albeit extremely limited. Having said that, the coalition will be opposing the Greens amendments.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:11):  It is always interesting that when it comes to protecting whistleblowers there are always years and years more consultation that has to happen. Meanwhile, people who have blown the whistle suffer, lose their jobs, lose their promotions and frequently end up being smeared and vilified in the process, and we have years and years more consultation. How many more years do we need before we protect whistleblowers? 


I remind the Senate: we have just been going through the Reserve Bank of Australia note bribery scandal. That would not have happened without three very brave whistleblowers who came forward and basically said, 'Enough is enough,' and got that scandal exposed. At the rate the government and the coalition want to move, it would have been, 'No, we have to have many more years of consultation before we work out how we would actually protect those whistleblowers'—not to mention someone like Dave Reid, for example, who came out and made his claim against ANSTO. He was smeared, he suffered character attacks, and of course he was eventually vindicated after he exposed the poor safety controls at the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor. We could go on and name many, many whistleblowers around Australia who have acted in the public interest, who have exposed appalling scandals. The RBA note bribery scandal is a case in point. If we want people to come out and tell the truth, as we had with the Wheat Board, as we have had with the RBA note inquiry and so on, you have to protect them. We have to encourage a culture of people coming forward in the public interest. But all we seem to do is have governments and oppositions, when they change sides, suddenly change perspective on what sort of protections they are prepared to give people who will come forward in the public interest. In the private sector, of course, there is virtually no protection for people at all.


It may interest both the government and the coalition to know that in the United States they have come forward with legislation which actually allows whistleblowers to get some of the benefit if they are saving money, if they are reporting maladministration or fraud. They actually get a percentage of that. That is not something the Greens are proposing, but it is certainly a way for people to have an incentive to watch what corporations and government agencies are doing in terms of reporting when money is being misappropriated, or fraud is occurring or whatever the allegation might be.


I would just stand here and strongly say that you cannot keep putting this off. You cannot keep saying, 'We are going to the election promising all this protection for whistleblowers', and yet the reality is that it is delay, delay, delay, weak action and ultimately we end up with nobody having the courage to come forward. It has been significantly undermined by the move to contracts in the senior echelons of the Public Service. People now are in the position of knowing that their contract may not be renewed.


There are all kinds of problems associated with why we end up not having people coming forward and telling the truth about what is going on in their companies and in the public sector. Senator Collins was talking about an agency. We have talked about having a national integrity commission that would work with the Ombudsman to make sure that when complaints are made if it is maladministration it would go to the Ombudsman and if it is fraud it would go to the Integrity Commission. We have proposed a structure and we have a bill in this parliament to have a national corruption capacity. For the life of me I cannot understand why neither the government nor the coalition is prepared to back a national integrity commission and serious legislation that deals with whistleblowers. I ask them to reconsider and to it least give in-principle support to whistleblowing as a workplace right.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:21):  by leave—I move opposition amendments (7) to (11) and (13) on sheet 7305 together:


(7) Schedule 8, item 57, page 54 (line 6), omit ""paragraph 581A(1)(a)"", substitute ""subsection 581A(1)"".

(12) Schedule 8, item 63, page 57 (lines 20 to 23), TO BE OPPOSED.


The coalition strongly believes in a strong and independent commission, and it is vital that the Australian people have confidence in Fair Work Australia. These amendments will ensure that the president's powers are not so broad as would provide him with an open remit to penalise people as he sees fit. I do not believe that is necessarily good within any workplace, let alone a workplace such as Fair Work Australia. Regrettably, we do know that there is some disharmony, to put it mildly, at the top of Fair Work Australia. That disharmony received public attention when the President of Fair Work Australia made some observations—I will once again use diplomatic language—about Vice President Graeme Watson's speech in recent times.


Mr Ross told us at Senate estimates that he had 'expressed concern' to the vice president following his speech, in which he expressed concern about the operation of the Fair Work Act and its review.


In July of this year Mr Ross then released a code of conduct which some people interpreted as a thin-veiled attack on Mr Watson. The Australian Financial Review said this code of conduct:


… reads disturbingly like an effort to enforce group-think on his subordinate commissioners.


Under the section headed 'Participation in the public debate', Mr Ross's code directs members to avoid involvement in political controversy when engaging in public debate and carefully consider how they express their views, as they may lead to the perception of bias. The quote goes on:


Other members may hold different views on contentious issues, and may wish to respond accordingly, possibly giving rise to a public conflict between members, which may bring the tribunal into disrepute or could diminish the authority of the tribunal.


Despite all of this, Mr Ross has provided separate advice that:


The President speaks on behalf of the tribunal and its members.


In other words, it is Mr Ross's view that will prevail and no other commissioner will be entitled to express his or her view that may not necessarily 100 per cent align with the president's view. I am not sure that that is healthy for any tribunal or indeed any court. The fact that they should resist involvement in public controversy is, of course, accepted wisdom. But if the president can do so, one wonders why deputy presidents and others cannot do so. What is difficult to swallow by some is that on the very day that Mr Ross appeared at Senate estimates, saying that it was inappropriate for Fair Work Australia tribunal members to 'enter the public debate about such issues', he appeared on the ABC 7.30 program to answer questions about Fair Work Australia's involvement in the investigation into Craig Thomson, despite saying that he had no responsibility for it.


The coalition does have some concerns in relation to what the government is proposing. I understand that the normal practice for tribunals is as is currently in the legislation. Without going into too much detail, what the government is seeking to do is to delete provisions of the existing Fair Work Act and give the president, quite frankly, unprecedented powers. At the moment a Fair Work Commissioner must, under section 640, disclose a potential conflict to the president. I should be starting at 643—Termination for appointment for bankruptcy et cetera. Section 643 reads as follows:


The Governor-General must terminate the appointment of an FWA member if—


then we go down to (c):


(c) the FWA member fails without reasonable excuse to comply with section 640.


Now allow me to go back to section 640 where the member, therefore, without reasonable excuse, does not disclose a potential conflict of interest to the president. If that conflict of interest is disclosed to the president then the commissioner can only deal with it with the president's approval, but the president must give a direction to the Fair Work member not to deal or to no longer deal with a matter if, and then those circumstances are set out. The government is basically seeking to delete a number of those aspects and simply replace it with the suggestion that the Fair Work Commission member must disclose the potential conflict to (a) a person who has made or will make a submission, and to the president, and that there are then no follow-on consequences. 


We believe that if a Fair Work commissioner fails to disclose and behave as is currently required under section 643 then termination should take place. There is, of course, the get out, where that failure is without reasonable excuse; so there is that protection for an FWA member. But if they are without reasonable excuse and behaving in a particular manner then the Governor-General must terminate their appointment.


The government is now proposing that the president, basically in his full discretion, will be able to deal with that particular matter. It seems to the coalition that it is unhealthy that so much power should reside with the president of Fair Work Australia. I have also indicated in my other comments that we believe that the powers of the president will be too great, and that it will not be conducive to a healthy, robust Fair Work Australia, where different commissioners might actually be able to hold some differing views and give expression to their differing views—of course, within the bounds of appropriate expression.


I might say that we have that from High Court judges, who from time to time give speeches. I can think of speeches by Justice Kirby where the chances are I would not agree with much at all, yet with former Justice Ian Callinan giving speeches the chances are that I would have agreed with most of what he said. These people sat on the High Court together and the High Court did not fall into disrepute because of it. They were entitled to express differing views. Just imagine if today a High Court judge could not give a speech without Chief Justice French giving his imprimatur. I think that would diminish the High Court and, whilst Fair Work Australia is in no way to be equated with the High Court, being only a quasi-judicial body, it is nevertheless a similar principle that should apply, that there should be that freedom and that we should not have such an oppressive regime being foisted on Fair Work Australia commissioners.


I commend the amendments to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (11:32):  The government opposes the opposition amendments in this area regarding the powers of the president. The bill sets out clearly in law a complaints-handling process for members of the Fair Work Commission, including the president. The government considers an effective complaints mechanism is an important element of ensuring and maintaining public confidence in the commission.


The government's proposed section 581A provides a framework for the president to deal with complaints against members. The provisions proposed by the government are modelled on similar provisions recently passed by the Senate to deal with complaints made against members of the federal judiciary. Paragraph (1)(b) of new section 581A simply makes it clear that the president, as part of the complaints-handling process, has a responsibility to manage issues that could impact on public confidence in the tribunal. Any steps taken by the president during an inquiry into a complaint must be temporary measures taken until the conclusion of the inquiry and determination of the complaint.


The government supports the president having the discretion to effectively manage the affairs of Fair Work Australia as the head of the tribunal, with responsibility for ensuring that it performs its functions and operations effectively and in a manner worthy of public confidence.


The coalition have indicated that they will oppose the government's proposal to omit section 643C from the Fair Work Act. The proposed omission of the section relates to the amendments that the government has put forward in this bill to streamline and clarify the operation of provisions dealing with conflicts of interest. While a failure to comply with section 640, which deals with conflicts of interest, will no longer be a ground for termination of the appointment of a Fair Work Commission member under the bill, the member still retains the obligation to disclose any potential conflict to the parties and to the president under that section. A failure to disclose the conflict may lead to a complaint being made against the member, which would be dealt with in accordance with the new complaints-handling process set out in the bill.


The government considers that the framework it has proposed will bring greater certainty and transparency to handling complaints against Fair Work members, whether a complaint deals with a conflict of interest or some other matter. The important issue here is to have a mechanism or a process that works within the tribunal. That is why we maintain these proposals as they stand.

For all this government's rhetoric about consultation and listening to people, we have another good example of where the rhetoric does not actually match the action. The government set up the Fair Work Review Panel, stacked as it was, skewed terms of reference as they were, and the panel strongly recommended that the name Fair Work Australia should be changed. 


What is the government's recommendation here: that the offending part of the title is not 'Fair Work' but 'Australia'. They want to delete the word 'Australia' and insert 'Commission' in direct rejection of the review panel's recommendation that it is 'Fair Work' that is the tarnished name. 'Fair Work' is the sullied name; 'Fair Work' is the name that has fallen into disrepute. Why? Because of this government. This government has tried to make Fair Work Australia into a political vehicle. We know that Fair Work Australia's reputation is diminished and tarnished because of the Health Services Union inquiry and the inquiry into Mr Craig Thomson. I do not need to canvass that scandal any further other than to say that after three long years Fair Work Australia finally came to the conclusion that I think that every other Australian had come to about 2½ years earlier that Mr Thomson was a bad egg, that he had misspent members' moneys. It took Fair Work Australia three long years to come to that conclusion.


It is no wonder that the review panel into the Fair Work Act came to the conclusion that the name should be changed with the deletion of the words 'Fair Work'. Let me remind senators of the actual recommendation. It says:


The panel recommends that the Fair Work Act be amended to change the name of Fair Work Australia to a title which more aptly denotes its functions. It is recommended that the new title contain the word ""Commission""—


and the government has done that—


and that it no longer contain the words ""Fair Work"".


Was this a bolt out of the blue? No, it was not. The President of Fair Work Australia, Mr Ross, no less, when I asked him at a Senate estimates in May about these matters in relation to the name change, said:


I have put forward two suggestions. Frankly, I do not mind as long as it is not the same as the name of the act. The two names I have put forward are: the Australian Workplace Commission or the Australian Workplace Relations Commission. The key point is not really what the name is. It is that it be separate from the name given to the act and that there be a clear distinction between the administrative functions of the organisation and the adjudicative functions.


So you have got the Fair Work Act Review Panel making this recommendation and you have got the President of Fair Work Australia making that recommendation. Guess who else makes that recommendation? It is not often that we in the coalition would rely on these people as our allies, but listen to this: the Maritime Workers Union said:


The MUA welcomes a return to the inclusion of ""Commission"" in the name of the Tribunal.


However, the MUA supports calls for further amendment of the name to its natural form, ""Australian Industrial Relations Commission"".


The Commission has been and remains a cornerstone of a functioning Australian democracy and is renowned for its fair and efficient management of industrial relations following federation with the enactment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904.


As such, the Commission deserves a name that is recognised throughout Australia and should revert to its longstanding and accepted form.


So we can go from the extreme and the ridiculous with the MUA, who actually support this, right through to the Australian Metals and Mining Association who submitted:


Enacting a name change from Fair Work Australia to the Fair Work Commission will do little to rectify the branding challenges—


Isn't that a polite way of putting it? Some of us might say the 'trashed reputation', but very diplomatic language was used here. The submission continues:


the tribunal has experienced in the wake of the Health Services Union investigation or to clear up the confusion between the judicial and administrative arms of the Fair Work infrastructure. A more objective name for the tribunal such as the Australian Workplace Relations Commission (AWRC) if far more appropriate.


In its response to the Fair Work review, the ACTU said that they strongly supported the recommendation as it was. 


So I ask the question: who is standing in the way of the name change? We have got the ACTU, we have got the Maritime Workers Union of Australia, we have got employer group after employer group—from the big ACCIs and AiG through to the Master Builders, the Housing Industry Association, the Independent Contractors Association, the Council of Small Business of Australia, and we have even got the Law Council of Australia—all supporting this. 


Who has submitted or argued that the name should be 'Fair Work Commission'—nobody other than Ms Gillard, who created Fair Work Australia and the legislation. Her vanity is what stands in the way of this very sensible, practical recommendation. Indeed, Labor senators in considering this legislation—and rushed as the committee process was; a matter that I had previously canvassed—said this in paragraph 2.40:


A number of submitters saw merit in resurrecting the title 'Australian Industrial Relations Commission', on the basis that the name is well known and accepted in the community.


Even they were mugged by the overwhelming number of submissions in relation to this.


So, for good judicial and administrative purposes the President of Fair Work Australia has recommended this change. The Fair Work Review Panel, stacked and packed as it was by Labor for a certain outcome with skewed terms of reference, were also mugged by all the submissions that this name change should occur. 


Indeed, the Orwellian name of Fair Work Australia, or now Fair Work Commission, has all the hallmarks of the sort of Orwellian naming that this government loves, but it has fallen into disrepute. The name 'Fair Work' is now a trashed commodity within the Australian community and within the workplace relations space. Everybody knows it, from the Maritime Union of Australia right through to the ACTU, all the employer groups, the panel and President of Fair Work Australia and even Labor senators on the committee; but who does not get it? The Prime Minister, in her vanity. Indeed, that is what some of the submitters have suggested. The feedback they have got is that this very sensible change was stopped at the very highest levels of the government.


I am not going to spend any more of this chamber's time on this, but it is yet again another window for the Australian people to see how this government operates. Let us start with consultation—'We will take into account community concerns. We are going to have a thorough, robust panel looking at this.' They made a recommendation that was supported by everybody—it was unanimous. Yet the government will not do it. Why? Because of the vanity of the Prime Minister.


It is a matter of great concern when the proper judicial and administrative functioning of such an important tribunal cannot be rehabilitated with a name change simply because of the vanity of the Prime Minister. She created Fair Work Australia. She appointed the initial personnel to Fair Work Australia. Of course, Fair Work Australia is now a trashed brand. That is recognised across the political divide, across the employer-employee divide and within Fair Work Australia.


Whilst we would argue that a name change is only a small change and there may need to be some cultural change attached to it, this government cannot even bring itself to a name change. If it cannot bring itself to such a basic change as that that has been so overwhelmingly recommended and so overwhelmingly endorsed, it stands to reason that the Australian people will come to the conclusion that this government will set its own course irrespective of the national interest and irrespective of the interests of having good functioning tribunals in this nation because the overriding factor will be the vanity of the Prime Minister. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

Let me conclude with one reflection. The only completely trashed name in this debate is Work Choices.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:31):  This is the continuation of the committee stage of the Fair Work Amendment Bill, and last night I was asking whether the government could provide us with an estimate of the costs associated with the proposed name change. The Senate committee inquiring into this was told a week ago the question would be taken on notice. We were told last night the question would be taken on notice, and I am wondering if the government now might actually have a defined figure to provide to us, rather than the rubbery explanation we have continually been provided.


Further, I asked the parliamentary secretary if the appointment of two new vice-presidents is going to cost Fair Work Australia $1.5 million or thereabouts per annum; if the name change is going to incur a cost; and, if all those costs are going to be absorbed by Fair Work Australia, what areas of Fair Work Australia's current activities will be curtailed for the extravagance of appointing these two new positions and for the this non-name change?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (09:33):  I can apprise Senator Abetz that since 10 o'clock last night there has been no change in the advice government has from Fair Work Australia with respect to their internal processes that I described during the committee stage last night, looking at the detail of the cost involved to change the name. So I cannot advise him further on any defined figure; only the information I gave him last night about the process under which Fair Work Australia is determining such matter. As Senator Abetz full knows, Fair Work Australia are an independent statutory body. They will go through their process and, at such time as we have advice for the Senator, we will inform him.


I will clarify also a component of the advice I gave last night: the absorption of the cost for the name change was the information I gave; it did not pertain to the issues around the appointment.


Senator Abetz is also asking with respect to what areas of current activities might be curtailed. Again, that is a matter for Fair Work Australia. I will seek to ascertain whether there is further advice on that matter.


I am also in the hands of the Senate as to whether, at this point in time, we want to move to the matters that Senator Cormann raised last night or whether Senator Abetz would like to remain on the areas that, prior to that, he was canvassing yesterday.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-11-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:34):  The last point of the parliamentary secretary is a fair question. I do not know how many other senators have general questions, though I still have a few. After that I would suggest we start moving through the amendments formally. I would then, according to the sheet, move the vice-presidential amendments and then Senator Cormann will come back into the chamber and canvass opposition amendments to superannuation. Given Senator Cormann's absence at the moment, if the parliamentary secretary could oblige by responding when Senator Cormann returns to the chamber I think that would be the most beneficial for both the parliamentary secretary and, if I might say so, especially for the opposition.


In relation to the issues I raised, I do note the parliamentary secretary's comment that the position has not changed since 10 o'clock last night. But the regrettable thing is that the position has not changed since the matter was before the Senate committee a week ago. The government makes money available to Fair Work Australia to undertake all sorts of issues and activities. We have been told in recent times now that Fair Work Australia from its budget will simply absorb the costs of a new registered organisations regime with new forensic accountants, new forensic lawyers, beefed up—all to be absorbed by Fair Work Australia without an extra allocation of money. We are similarly told that Fair Work Australia is simply going to appoint two new vice-presidents at a cost of at least $1.5 million per annum, simply to be absorbed. Fair Work Australia is now going to have a name change and the cost of that simply to be absorbed. 


How much more is the government going to demand from Fair Work Australia and why was Fair Work Australia given such a big budget if it can afford all these extra changes without any curtailment of its existing activities? Clearly something must be giving within the Fair Work regime for all these extra financial burdens to be placed upon it without any extra money being made available. The Australian people are entitled to an answer, and to simply hide behind the fact that it is an independent statutory authority is not good enough because it is the government that makes the money available. This independent statutory authority operates under legislation that this government introduced, and the people of Australia are entitled to know where the money is coming from and what areas of Fair Work Australia's activities will be curtailed to fund all these new activities without supplementation to Fair Work Australia's budget.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Collins, do you want me to seek from the Greens an answer to your question about the general questions, whether the Greens have an indication as to whether they have many questions in this segment or they are happy to move through the amendments? Senator Wright.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (09:38):  The Greens do not have any further questions in relation to the general issues. We are happy to move through the amendments.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (09:38):  With respect to Senator Cormann's questions, I am happy to defer them even if it is necessary to do so during the discussion of the amendments themselves. So if it suits Senator Cormann to simply come and move his amendments I am happy to deal with the issues that he raised last night at that stage.


With respect to the issues that Senator Abetz raised, I described last night that Fair Work Australia has a process to work through to determine the costs involved with the change of name. It is not that there is no understanding of cost but rather that Fair Work Australia have advised government of their process and we are waiting for an outcome of that process. We are quite happy to inform the Senate and indeed Senator Abetz of the outcome of that process once it becomes known.


I can clarify further the point I made in response last night to a question on the name change. I indicated that the costs were to be absorbed by Fair Work Australia. I differentiated just a moment ago between that and the costs associated with the new appointments.


However, no differentiation is warranted: it is indeed the case that Fair Work Australia will absorb the full cost involved in the changes that have been sought. However, the precise details—and I think I mentioned this last night—in relation to the costs associated with the new appointments are still subject to the Remuneration Tribunal.


But we can be quite clear that the government is confident that Fair Work Australia will continue to fulfil its functions under the Fair Work Act diligently and well. Senator Abetz would be aware that over time, since the establishment of Fair Work Australia, there have been differential arrangements in relation to the costs of the agency, some of those associated with dealing with the new act and the new arrangements that were first implemented and with changes that have occurred subsequently. What the government has done on this occasion is respond to requests from Fair Work Australia to set up new administrative arrangements. We rely on Fair Work Australia to advise us on what administrative arrangements it needs, and any further costs that may need to be considered would be a matter of the usual budgetary arrangements. We are confident that Fair Work Australia will absorb the cost in relation to these measures that they have sought, without any loss of function in other areas.


On the cost of the vice-presidents, I have already mentioned this is a matter for the Remuneration Tribunal and any costs beyond those that have been estimated in a broad sense would be subject to normal budgetary processes.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-11-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:41):  So what we have is a situation where we do not actually know the cost of these two new appointments; the cost is going to be subject to whatever the Remuneration Tribunal might determine. But, irrespective of what the cost is, the government is saying it will be absorbed by Fair Work Australia. We do not know what the cost of the name change is going to be, but it is going to be sorted out by Fair Work Australia simply absorbing the costs.


We cannot be told where the money is going to come from within Fair Work Australia because Fair Work Australia is still working through it. What that tells us clearly is that this has been rushed. Fair Work Australia itself still has no idea where the money is going to come from within its internal budgets. This is indicative, yet again, of the shambolic and rushed nature of this legislation, because Fair Work Australia itself has not been given the time to work out where the money is going to come from. The parliamentary secretary has been kind to tell the Senate that, when the process is known and the outcome of the process is known, she is willing to tell the Senate. But what we know is that we will not know the answer before the vote. So here we have the parliamentary secretary, and I am sure the Greens will oblige her, asking the parliament to vote for legislation when we do not know where the money is coming from and how the arrangements are going to be made internally.


It is this sort of shambolic management—just a snapshot—of Fair Work Australia which provides us with a window into the total management of the Australian economy by this government. They have no idea where the money is coming from and they make changes with no idea how much it is going to cost. We are still waiting on Fair Work Australia, we are still waiting on the Remuneration Tribunal—and so the uncertainty goes on. But we need to vote on this today, irrespective of what the actual outcome or consequences might be!


I am a relatively hopeful individual, and a person who has a positive outlook, but I must say I doubt that the Senate is going to get any further answers in relation to these matters, so allow me to move on and test the parliamentary secretary. Every piece of workplace relations legislation that this government has introduced thus far has been rushed through the House of Representatives only to find itself in an embarrassing position in this place requiring further amendments. Can the parliamentary secretary guarantee us that the government is absolutely and utterly confident that this legislation does not need any further government amendments?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (09:44):  Perhaps I will close off on the last set of questions from Senator Abetz by making the point that Fair Work Australia has sought to make administrative changes for quite sensible reasons, and the government has responded to those requests.


Fair Work Australia understand that they need to absorb the costs of those arrangements and, other than the issues that the opposition is now raising, I am not aware of any concerns about them needing to do so. Senator Abetz may want to wait until the next round of estimates and explore this issue further, but there has been no evidence before me that there is an issue for Fair Work Australia in absorbing the costs associated with the changes that they themselves have sought.


With respect to every piece of workplace relations legislation, Senator Abetz wants to test me within the recent period of workplace relations. He knows as well as I do that workplace relations law is a constantly evolving issue. I think back to the various waves of workplace relations law, and were I to ask a similar question during a period of the Howard government it would possibly have had a response which was even more so. But I take the Senate back to the context of my summing-up speech, where I indicated and, indeed, Senator Cash highlighted—and I think that even Senator Abetz has used this language too, but I might be wrong there—that this is the first tranche of amendments, the matters that are generally agreed in response to the review of the Fair Work panel.


The first tranche are those matters which we think have general agreement and which can be moved forward fairly speedily. That said, the government has indicated that we have an open mind to further amendments that may be required in response to the other recommendations of the review panel. Some of those recommendations may cross some of the amendments that we are dealing with here so, no, Senator Abetz, I would not be in a position to say that there will not be a requirement for further amendments in the matters that we are dealing with now.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-11-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:47):  Of course, it is very obvious that Fair Work Australia accepts that it has to absorb the costs. What else can it do? What else can it do in the face of the government changing legislation and foisting these things on Fair Work Australia without giving it extra money? The parliamentary secretary says, 'Oh, they realise that they have to absorb it.' Everybody knows that they have to absorb it, but that is not, with respect, a justification for what has occurred, especially in circumstances where we do not know where those cost-cutting measures will occur within Fair Work Australia. I have a funny feeling that those cuts may well occur in the area of monitoring registered organisations, and that in the event that we have another Craig Thomson-Health Services Union debacle we will once again see Fair Work Australia underresourced and incapable of dealing with the issues as it should have done. But let us move on.


I seek leave of the Senate to move opposition amendments (2), (3) and (5) on sheet 7305 together.


Leave granted.




Senator ABETZ:
  I move:


(2) Schedule 2, item 43, page 22 (line 10), omit ""Vice President or"".


(3) Schedule 8, item 1, page 43 (line 7), omit paragraph 606(2)(c).


(5) Schedule 8, item 16, page 49 (line 7), omit ""a Vice President,"".


The opposition also opposes schedules 8 and 11 in the following terms:


(6) Schedule 8, items 17 to 56, page 49 (line 9) to page 53 (line 16), TO BE OPPOSED.


(14) Schedule 11, item 21, page 184 (lines 13 to 16), TO BE OPPOSED.


I thank the Senate. This raft of opposition amendments deals with the creation of two new vice-presidential positions on the body known as Fair Work Australia. These two new positions were not canvassed in the Fair Work Act review panel's report. In the 250 submissions made to the review there was no such suggestion. As a result, not surprisingly, the review panel saw no need to make such a recommendation.


It is therefore appropriate to ask from whence did this recommendation come. We now know that this recommendation came as a result of one ex-trade union boss talking to another ex-trade union boss—the former Assistant Secretary of the ACTU, who just happens to be the president of Fair Work Australia, talking to Mr Shorten, the former AWU boss, who now happens to be the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations—and it was determined that it would be a good idea to have these two new vice-presidential positions.


This is a very important issue. The reason it is important has been highlighted by no lesser authority than the Law Council of Australia. The Law Council of Australia have set out, in a very articulate manner, a very well-reasoned manner and a very robust manner, how these two new appointments will be a diminution of judicial independence within Australia. It is a bad precedent, and they have said so. The government's response is like Ms Gillard's response in relation to the AWU scandal—basically a lot of words without any meaning and without any proper defence of the matters put to them.


This bill creates two additional vice-presidential positions and they will be the second and third highest positions within Fair Work Australia. The minister has completely failed to explain why these positions are required, let alone justified, apart from the department's submission that the president of Fair Work Australia—a former assistant ACTU secretary—sought the additional roles. These two positions would slot in as the second and third most senior officers of the tribunal.


Since the announcement of these two additional positions, there has been widespread community concern, including from within Fair Work Australia itself. Clearly, with this new appointment in Fair Work Australia of a new president, there is a power struggle occurring within Fair Work Australia. And what better way for the government to get complete domination than simply creating two new positions and appointing two new people into them? The Australian Financial Review recently reported:


In an email obtained by the Weekend Financial Review, Senior deputy president Les Kaufman wrote to Fair Work president Iain Ross on Wednesday questioning the need for two positions, which reintroduces a level of seniority at the tribunal that was removed under the Fair Work Act in 2009.


Mr Kaufman, the senior deputy president, said the appointments would 'further erode the standing' of the tribunal and 'gives rise to the perception it is being stacked'. It is no longer a perception that it is being stacked; it is absolutely proven that it has been stacked. But allow me to continue to quote. The article went on to report that senior deputy president Les Kaufman said in his letter:


Although I have no direct interest in the creation of the two new vice-president positions because, as you know my commission expires on December 1—


so only a few more days to go, and nothing in it for this senior deputy president, Mr Kaufman; he is just expressing his concern. He goes on to say:


… I wish to express my dismay at what appears to be a retrograde step.


You might think senior vice-president Les Kaufman was having a whack on the way out and might be a lone voice, but it is not so. The article goes on to say:


Deputy presidents Graeme Watson and Peter Richards have also written to Justice Ross over concerns the federal government will use the opportunity to install government-friendly appointees.


Here we have a senior deputy president and two deputy presidents writing to the president of Fair Work Australia and disagreeing with his suggestion—which he seems to have cobbled together with the minister—to create these two new positions.


Many submissions to the Senate committee in relation to this expressed deep reservations about the inclusion of these two positions. Some of the comments included:


From our perspective the need for the creation of these additional positions and the requirement that they be statutory positions is unclear. Neither the Fair Work Act Review Panel nor submissions to the review have identified the absence of these statutory positions as inhibiting the performance of Fair Work Australia.


Possibly, we might get an explanation from the government as to how the lack of these positions is inhibiting the performance of Fair Work Australia. Clearly, three deputy presidents of Fair Work Australia do not think it is. They have very real concerns and, of course, we know about the Law Council's concerns. Another submission said:


This was not recommended by the Panel. It is unclear why these amendments are necessary or required and are opposed without amendments.


Another comment from the submission reads:


It is unclear why the existing Vice Presidents would not be suitable for re-appointment to the new statutory Vice Presidential roles.


To this end, there was wide stakeholder support for the appointment of the two members of Fair Work Australia to the new positions titled as vice-president. Steve Knott of AMMA told the committee :'The legislation previously recognised the two existing vice presidents, Vice President Lawler and Vice President Watson, but the current legislation does not.' Clearly what we have, with the move to the Fair Work Act, is the government deliberately cutting these two people out of vice-presidential positions to move them to the side. The government is now moving to create two new positions and, as a result, is sidelining these two vice-presidential office holders of Fair Work Australia.


The proposal to have the legislation recognise these two roles once again, and put two new people into them, is unacceptable. It is real pea-and-thimble trick. For those with long memories in industrial relations, we will go back to the eighties when there was new legislation and everybody got appointed except one member of the tribunal—a fellow by the name of Justice Staples. I think this gives the opportunity—and again, we have commented on this publicly—to really damage the independence, or the perceived independence and impartiality, of the tribunal. We have senior appointments made to the tribunal through the political cycle. There are people who are appointed by one side who may not be appointed by another side, but that is the way it goes over the fullness of time in the political cycle.


The coalition is deeply concerned that the appointment of pro-Labor vice-presidents would bring into question the tribunal's integrity, which has already suffered considerable damage courtesy of the Health Services Union scandal. But, if I may say so, the most significant submission comes from the Law Council of Australia, which said in part:


Members of FWA are appointed to a quasi-judicial position. The status of FWA depends upon the independence and impartiality of its Members being maintained and being seen to be maintained.


As a general principle, once a person has been appointed to sit on a Court or independent Tribunal with designated powers and privileges, any change that would have the effect of removing or reducing that particular person's powers or privileges while not affecting the powers and privileges of other Members of that Tribunal, has a tendency to undermine the independence of the Court or Tribunal.


…   …   …


Should the Government appoint the two individuals currently designated Vice President to the two statutory Vice President positions, then their status will not be reduced. However, if the two Deputy Presidents designated Vice Presidents are not so appointed, the effect of the Bill will be to reduce their status. Henceforth responsibilities that would have been capable of being delegated or given to them by nature of their senior status would instead be given to the new statutory Vice Presidents.


This would have the tendency to reduce the independence of the Tribunal in that it will reduce the role and privileges associated with particular individuals.


So says the Law Council of Australia.


The government's argument in response to that to date has been shallow, has been hollow and has been completely absent of any rationale, any robust rejoinder. The only rationale is that this is a government that thinks it might be in its death throes and wants to future-proof Fair Work Australia from any future appointments by another government and therefore has rushed through this legislation, created two new positions and further stacked Fair Work Australia.


I remind the parliamentary secretary of Mr Rudd's promise before the 2007 election:


I give you this as an absolute guarantee here on your program. I will not be prime minister of this country and appoint some endless tribe of trade union officials to staff or ex trade union officials to staff the key positions in this body. That's not my intention. That's not the way in which it's going to work.


Well, we now know that that is exactly the way it has worked under both the Rudd and Gillard governments. It is like their carbon tax promise: hollow, shallow, with no intention of delivering on it—simply words before the election to get them over the line and then do the exact opposite afterwards.


I ask of the parliamentary secretary: what are the entitlements of the two new vice-presidents? We do not know that as yet, I understand, because the Remuneration Tribunal still has to make the determination. This is very unhelpful in circumstances where we are supposed to vote on this without knowing what their entitlements will be. The Greens might like being treated as mushrooms, but we, the coalition, do not.


The other answer that I have is about the current people on Fair Work Australia who have judges pension entitlements. If they apply for one of these two new positions on Fair Work Australia, would they lose their judicial pension entitlements? It is understood that the new appointments will not have these judicial pension entitlements so, apart from their remuneration, there is also the question of what their pension entitlements might be.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (10:03):  I might commence by dealing in general with the government's response to these opposition amendments and then I will move to answer the questions that Senator Abetz asked at the conclusion, as well as perhaps addressing a few of the other observations he made in that process which do not stand up to any serious scrutiny. I know that Senator Abetz thinks that he has got case closed on balance and appointments to this tribunal but I would suggest that he is making quite a few cheap political points that would not stand up to any serious scrutiny.


The government does not support the opposition's proposed amendments. The two new vice-president roles to be created within the tribunal were recommended by the President of Fair Work Australia, Justice Ross. In establishing Fair Work Australia, the government took the decision to abolish the formal statutory positions of vice-president and senior vice-president, as Senator Abetz has indicated. Vice-presidents and senior deputy vice-presidents became deputy presidents within the Fair Work Australia structure. Let us remove that illusion around the seniority issue that Senator Abetz has raised.


In the transition arrangements in moving from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to Fair Work Australia former senior deputy presidents and vice-presidents were entitled to retain their former entitlements and titles. Indeed, this gives me the opportunity to reflect on Senator Abetz's visit to the 1980s around appointments and remind those listening and the Senate that in the transition from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to Fair Work Australia all positions were maintained—complete balance, complete reflection of the existing arrangements. Those arrangements had principally been established under the Howard government with a track record I do not intend spending some detail visiting; I think it is pretty much a matter of record.


Justice Ross recommended to the government providing for two senior positions within the tribunal to ensure senior legal specialists with high-level expertise were attracted to Fair Work Australia, and, I stress, to assist him in the administration and management of the tribunal. Senator Abetz likes to highlight some of the issues facing Fair Work Australia. He likes to highlight the need for independence and the need for administrative and management improvements. This is indeed the solution that Justice Ross has raised in relation to some of those issues. So it surprises me now that the opposition seek to oppose the president of Fair Work Australia in dealing with some of the internal management issues that the opposition themselves have canvassed.


Fair Work Australia deals with important and complex matters of industrial law and should be resourced accordingly. In addition to matters of industrial law, Fair Work is undertaking a broad range of functions, including the new Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal jurisdiction, a major projects panel and a new comprehensive stakeholder engagement model. Creating these positions will assist Fair Work Australia to deal with such matters. The criteria for appointment as vice-presidents will be set out in the Fair Work Act and are reflected in the bill. This reflects the approach taken in respect of other members of Fair Work Australia and previous iterations of legislation.


The process for selecting the two new vice-presidents will be open and transparent. The government has committed to a merit-based selection process for these appointments. The positions will be advertised publicly and anyone will be able to apply for the positions. An advisory panel consisting of senior officers of the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and the APSC will recommend a short list of applicants and the incumbent minister will then seek cabinet's endorsement of the appointments, as is the usual practice. The endorsed candidates will then be recommended to the Governor-General and to the Executive Council.


I dealt with Senator Abetz's brief visit to the 1980s on the issue of appointments and highlighted probably the most recent principal example of how the Prime Minister has met the commitment she made in relation to balance within Fair Work Australia, to be the Fair Work Commission. But I think I need to address in a little more detail Senator Abetz's claim that there is a perception that Fair Work Australia is, in his words, being stacked. Whilst he relates to some internal memos or communications from some existing commissioners, the public record on recent appointments highlights that there is a general satisfaction with the balance that has been established within Fair Work Australia. I have in front of me three press releases. The first one relates to ACCI: 'Employers welcome Fair Work appointments'. Another is dated February this year: 'Employers commend Shorten on Geoff Bull's appointment to Fair Work Australia'. A further newspaper article in the Australian in February this year: 'All sides approve of Fair Work appointees'. So I do not think that the case is quite as established as Senator Abetz seems to think it is. I do add some further context, since Senator Abetz referred to the Prime Minister's remarks. She referred to ministerial advisers. If I a recall correctly, there was a chief of staff of Minister Reith who was appointed to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as registrar.


The government has gone nowhere near the excesses of the Howard government in the balance that it has introduced into Fair Work Australia and the Fair Work system. We have maintained appointments that were made under the Howard government. The appointments made to the Fair Work Ombudsman and the commission have been balanced and fair.


The ongoing problem that I might highlight to Senator Abetz—as a challenge more than anything else—is finding high-calibre women candidates to appoint, particularly on the employer side. He might like to assist the minister and me in encouraging more candidates to seek appointment to the tribunal. This is a challenge that we have raised with employer organisations, and we hope that over time there will be some improvements in that respect.


Senator Abetz asked and then answered his own question on entitlements, and we will be waiting for the Remuneration Tribunal to establish some detail there, but he did seek an assurance on judges' pension entitlements with respect to existing office holders, and I am advised that if existing office holders who carry such entitlements are appointed to the positions the government will, through regulation, ensure that those arrangements are preserved.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-11-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:11):  So when did the government decide to make sure that those things would be preserved by regulation? Undoubtedly, that is something that should have been in the legislation itself, but it will seek to cover a deficiency via regulation. Just in case anybody who is listening thought that there was a substantial argument made out by the parliamentary secretary that that which I had asserted does not stand up to scrutiny about the stacking of Fair Work Australia, let me just ask them—in particular the parliamentary secretary—that, out of the 17 appointments made thus far, who can tell us how many were ex-trade-union bosses, given the promise that it would not be an endless tribe of ex-trade-union officials? Would you think one or two, possibly? Three or four? Five or six? All right, let's go halfway at eight out of the 17. Nah—you got it wrong; it is 12 out of the 17—over two-thirds. But that is not an endless tribe of ex-trade-union officials according to the parliamentary secretary. Heaven help us if two-thirds plus is not an endless tribe. What it means is that a 100 per cent stacking and packing of Fair Work Australia also would not be an endless tribe to Fair Work Australia appointments. 


Need I remind the parliamentary secretary of the appointment of the very first manager of Fair Work Australia—an ex-trade-union official. What was that person's role? The oversight of the Health Services Union inquiry and the inquiry into Craig Thomson. And just when the heat was getting on, just when we as a coalition were seeking to have questions asked of him at a Senate estimates hearing, what does the government do? It miraculously appoints him to the commission of Fair Work Australia to put him out of reach of senators' questions as to the absolutely disgraceful handling of the Craig Thomson and the Health Services Union matter. So this manager, who oversaw this absolute disregard for process and this disgraceful delay in the Craig Thomson-Health Services Union matter, is not chided but rewarded by this government and elevated to the bench of Fair Work Australia. If that is not enough, there is a vacancy created in the managerial role of Fair Work Australia. I wonder what sort of person we might appoint to that vacancy. Guess what! Another ex-trade-union official. But it is not an endless tribe, you understand; it is not an endless tribe of ex-trade-union officials being appointed!


Well, chances are that I misinterpreted what Mr Rudd meant when he said there would not be an endless tribe of ex-trade union officials being appointed. I actually took him at face value. Clearly, I was wrong, as the Australian people were wrong in relation to the no carbon tax promise made at the last election.


We have been told that these appointments are open, transparent and merit based, as undoubtedly was the appointment of that greatly successful manager of Fair Work Australia who oversaw the Health Services Union debacle—open and merit based. What a fantastic job! They did a great job looking into the Craig Thomson Health Services Union for—how many years was it?—three years or whatever it was. Great! And merit demanded that this sort of performance saw this person put onto the bench of Fair Work Australia.


What about the trade union official who was in diabolical trouble with his own trade union, the Electrical Trades Union, which was suing him, if I recall, for about $1 million? They were wanting back pay for the moneys he had received while sitting on one of those industry super funds as a board member, milking out money. There will be more talk about the industry super funds and the default funds under the modern award system later on today. But guess what happened to this person? The day before his announcement to Fair Work Australia was made public—it was just serendipitous; it was just coincidental—the case with the union miraculously settled. Oh please! Merit based? Open? Transparent? I could go on with a list. I think the government knows it cannot claim honesty in relation to that assertion.


Coming back to the issue that Justice Ross says is required, namely, a 'high level of expertise', I think the term was, I am sorry but, with great respect, is the government asserting that that high level of expertise does not currently exist on the bench of Fair Work Australia? I can tell you, there are many people who would clearly fit into that category who would be, I am sure, more than willing to assist the president if he were willing to use their expertise, their experience and their reputation to assist him in the management and running of Fair Work Australia. I say to the government again that no genuine argument has been made out for this enhanced stacking and packing measure of Fair Work Australia.


I finally make a comment in relation to female appointments. It is amazing. The second-last time around, when I pursued the so-called merit based appointments to Fair Work Australia, it was astounding how the selection process showed a complete dearth of quality private sector people worthy of the short list. But, oh, the ex-trade union officials made the short list. They were in there, right through. They made the short list as high-quality individuals. All I would ask you to do, Parliamentary Secretary, if you do want to look for female candidates for appointment to workplace relations tribunals, is look no further than the new LNP government in Queensland, which have appointed for their industrial commission a very distinguished lady, Minna Knight. But people like that, I am sure, simply would not make the short list or would—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  I am not going to indicate whether or not, because there are privacy considerations involved.


But it is interesting that, when you have an LNP government elected, all of a sudden it finds meritorious female candidates to appoint to its industrial tribunals, yet this government, with all its quotas and other things, seems to have great difficulty.


I will leave my contribution to this amendment at that. I commend the amendment to the Senate. I believe it is worthy. I simply say to the Greens: even if you want to discount every single word I have said in this debate, as is usually your wont, please do so—please be my guest—but you cannot discount—




Senator Polley:
  Yes.




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Polley smiles and says, 'Yes.' But, even if you discard every single word I have said, how on earth do you discard the words of three deputy presidents of Fair Work Australia and how do you discard the very wise counsel of the Law Council of Australia? The parliamentary secretary and the government can play politics with my words, but they cannot play politics with the considered views of three deputy presidents of Fair Work Australia or the Law Council of Australia. That is what makes the coalition so confident that it is right on the fundamental matter of principle that these amendments should be carried—namely, that these two new positions should not be established. Given that the government cannot respond in any coherent way to reject the views of these three deputy presidents and the Law Council of Australia, we can be left with no other conclusion than that this is a deliberate attempt to stack and pack Fair Work Australia, as the government feels it might be in the death throes.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (10:21):  Unfortunately, I have been provoked to traverse some territory I was hoping not to occupy Senate time with, but I think the responses of my colleagues and others to at least three references of 'stacking and packing' warrant some consideration. Those listening and other senators need to understand that Senator Abetz's view about what constitutes a union official is a particularly interesting one. Anyone who has ever, at any stage of their professional career, been associated with a trade union would fit his category. So just imagine, across the Australian workforce, people across a broad range of professions and experience—for instance, mine, professional social work. Because I was involved with a union—because I joined a union at the age of about 16—I would fit his category. It is just ludicrous. He counts, for instance, Justice Ross as one of these 'stacks'. He may not particularly like that particular appointment, but it is not really a fair characterisation of the balance and composition of Fair Work Australia, and I do not think that Senator Abetz does the tribunal justice with this approach.


In relation to the Law Council's submission, we need to remind the chamber that what the government is doing is re-establishing an arrangement of seniority that had been in place for many years. The Law Council is concerned about relative positions of some of the existing office holders. Unfortunately, change involves affecting relative positions of existing office holders. That is a necessary consequence of change.


The other three considered views that Senator Abetz highlights relate, if I have got this correct, to at least one and perhaps three leaked emails, possibly taken out of context. I am not sure about how those deputy presidents feel about the opposition bandying around leaked emails, or what their motives may or may not have been in commenting, or how that material came into the public realm. It may have been reported by the Australian Financial Review, but I remind senators and those listening that that is the context of the reporting of those views, not necessarily in their full context. These were private communications between them and the President of Fair Work Australia and certainly cannot be taken as representative of the view of Fair Work Australia commissioners and deputy presidents.


What we do know, as a matter of fact, is that the President of Fair Work Australia sought to have the government re-establish seniority arrangements that had previously been in place to assist him in the administration and management of an agency which we all know has reviewed its internal processes so that it can deal with some of the issues and problems associated, as Senator Abetz highlighted, with resourcing and work in certain areas.


This is what the government is doing to try to assist Fair Work Australia overcome some of the difficulties that have arisen in recent times.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (10:32):  For Senator Cormann's benefit, as he may not have been listening at the stage when Senator Abetz and I discussed how to deal with the issues that he raised last night, I advise that we agreed—I think as a courtesy to Senator Cormann—to delay responding to Senator Cormann's questions until Senator Cormann was in the chamber. So I am happy to cover those issues now.


As I highlighted with respect to their amendments generally, the government does not support the opposition's proposed amendments. Our reforms to the default fund selection process will ensure that default superannuation contributions in modern awards will be directed to funds that meet the best interests of employees covered by modern awards. We are enabling superannuation funds to apply for default fund status on an equal footing. This will increase competition in the default fund market, which will drive product and service improvements for the benefit of both members and employers.


Our reforms largely reflect the approach recommended by the Productivity Commission. I think this is a critical point, picking up some of the issues that Senator Cormann raised last night. I should highlight that we are proud of our superannuation reforms and further refinements are simply that—refinements responding to the recommendation of the Productivity Commission.


The opposition's approach, on the other hand, is for employers to be able to select from any available MySuper product. This approach was comprehensively rejected by the Productivity Commission. On the opposition's approach, the Productivity Commission noted it:


… does not have an explicit focus on the best interests of employees. It assumes that their best interests will be reflected in the decisions made by employers …


This is one of the critical reasons around why industry superannuation was established in the first instance. We know from the history of superannuation that you cannot have a system based on relying on the best interests of employees being reflected in the decisions made by employers.


The commission went on to note that most employers, particularly small- and medium-sized employers:


… do not necessarily have the incentive, interest or expertise to make a decision that is aligned with the best interests of employees …


The government's approach will ensure that the best interests of employees covered by a specific award are protected by ensuring those employees are placed in the most appropriate MySuper products. The opposition's approach was strongly opposed by unions, industry superannuation funds and employers, including the Ai Group. The government is looking after the best interests of employees whose super is directed to the default fund. The opposition are only looking after their own cheap political interests.


In respect of how these changes will improve the existing approach, our reforms ensure that default superannuation contributions in modern awards will be directed to funds that meet the best interests covered by the relevant award. For the super funds, our reforms enable them to apply for default fund status on an equal footing. All funds with a generic MySuper product will be able to apply to the Fair Work commission for selection as a default fund on an equal basis, which will bring greater contestability to the system. We are increasing competition in the default fund market, which will drive product and service improvements to the benefit of both fund members and employers while ensuring that the default superannuation system operates in the best interests of employees and at the same time responding to the clear recommendations of the Productivity Commission.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2012-11-28,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (10:36):  I have a few observations in relation to that. That was an extraordinary contribution by the government. Just to explain this: so the government is saying that an amendment which would provide that all MySuper default products—products which are in the process of being legislated by this government—which have in them all of the consumer protection mechanisms that this government judges are necessary, that giving the option for any such products to compete with each other, can somehow be contrary to the best interests of employees? If that is what the government is saying, then it should withdraw its MySuper bills immediately. What it is saying is that even though a super product can qualify for registration as a MySuper default product, consistent with its legislative requirements, that is not in itself a guarantee that that product is an appropriate default fund product. Quite frankly, if that is the government's position, then this whole process—going through three different bills in order to legislate the features of a super product that have to be there in order to ensure that those Australians who are not making active choices about their superannuation are properly protected and have a product that properly caters for their needs—is a complete waste of time.


Given the government is currently legislating to ensure that those Australians who do not make active choices in relation to their superannuation arrangements end up in a default product that has been designed by this Labor government—which is called the MySuper product—if the government is now saying that those products are inadequate and are not in the best interests of employees across Australia, then why bother with that at all? You are completely wasting your time.


The other thing the minister said is that the Productivity Commission recommended against us. That is only a half-truth. The Productivity Commission recommended genuine competition until Minister Shorten bullied them into changing their minds.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Please!




Senator CORMANN:
  That is exactly what happened. I refer you back to the draft report, the interim report and the interim recommendations that were put out by the Productivity Commission.


They were very clear in recommending strong and appropriate moves to a more open, transparent and competitive process. Minister Shorten took the unprecedented step for him to respond to a review before it had actually finally reported. That is never what Minister Shorten does. That is completely inconsistent with his usual modus operandi. Everybody that has anything to do with Minister Shorten knows that that is not normally how he does business. It was a very unique approach. Normally, for any report that comes back to him he has a follow-up consultative review and discussion—a review into the review type process. Quite frankly, in a general sense, Minister Shorten struggles with making decisions. But on this one there was a very clear driver: Minister Shorten wanted to protect the vested commercial interests of his friends in the union movement, who clearly have an interest through union-dominated industry funds to preserve the current situation for as long as possible, which gives them an unfair competitive advantage.


The minister talks about the fact that the Australian Industry Group is also supportive of the government's approach through this legislation—prescribing further government intervention through Fair Work Australia, despite the fact that the Fair Work Australia process as deployed over the last four or so years has been widely discredited. There is such a thing in Australia, still, sadly, called the industrial relations club. There are some cosy arrangements at times between organisational stakeholder interests that are separate from the actual best interests of individual Australians. That is what is happening there. They want to have this cosy arrangement through which, behind closed doors and through a non-transparent, non-competitive process, they can make deals. That is not in the public interest.


What is in the public interest is to have the greatest variety and number of suppliers from across the board—industry funds, retail funds, you name it—competing with each other and keeping each other on their toes in terms of fund performance, investment performance, fees and quality of service. Across all these aspects of the superannuation value proposition it is important to have appropriate competitive tensions to ensure that people can make informed decisions about what is in the best interests of employers and employees in a particular set of circumstances.


The minister in her answer today effectively told us that the MySuper default fund product is not worth the paper the legislation is written on, because, in her words, 'Letting employers direct Australians who do not make active choices in relation to superannuation into MySuper default fund products is contrary to the employee's best interests', unless Fair Work Australia can do another job on top of it—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  I quoted the Productivity Commission.




Senator CORMANN:
  That is exactly what you said, Minister. Either the government trusts its own legislation in terms of defining in legislation what a default fund product should look like—either the government agrees that it has come up with the right consumer protection features in their MySuper legislation, and then as soon as a product complies with the conditions of registration as a MySuper product then any of them should be adequate and appropriate and in the best interests of employees that are not making active choices in relation to their superannuation—or do you think that what you have done is inadequate? If so, you should go back to the drawing board. But to somehow say, 'We're going to let all of you register but even though all of you comply with our conditions of registration we are going to determine through a secretive process who is going to be allowed to compete and who is not allowed to compete,' is just completely inappropriate. It seeks to enshrine yet again an anti-competitive arrangement that, quite frankly, has been widely discredited for some time.


With those few words, I will talk through all of the amendments before moving them in turn because, procedurally, I will not be able to move them all together. Essentially, the objective of the amendments that I am about to move is to ensure that there can be proper and genuine competition between the great diversity of MySuper products which will be available from 1 July 2013, and that all Australians in default super can have the benefits of genuine competition between any MySuper product which complies with the government's requirements for registration as a MySuper product and not just with those select few which have been identified through a discredited process through Fair Work Australia. 


Amendments (1) and (2) remove commencement dates for schedules that the coalition is opposing. Amendment (3) provides that the changes in the amendments will not commence until after the commencement of relevant schedules in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Act 2012—currently a bill before the parliament—that is, to link this amendment with what I have just talked about in terms of the availability of the government's own legislated MySuper default fund products. 


Amendment (4) removes schedule 1. Schedule 1 at present amends the Fair Work Act to introduce a process under which the Fair Work Commission will review default fund terms in modern awards every four years. This will no longer be necessary if all MySuper products can be selected under any modern award as we believe should be the case. 


Amendment (5) removes schedule 2, which currently institutes the expert panel as part of the Minimum Wage Panel in Fair Work Australia. Again, this is an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. Consumer protection requirements have already been built into MySuper products—or so we have been led to believe by the government, which is clearly completely internally inconsistent with the way it has approached this. 


Amendment (6) makes the substantive change to allow for any MySuper product to be available under all modern awards. Amendment (7) makes a minor consequential change to schedule 11.


Let me also point out that we are moving these amendments today to give the Senate the opportunity to do the right thing, to give the Senate the opportunity to help ensure that Australians who are not making active choices in relation to their superannuation arrangements can nevertheless benefit from the highest possible fund performance, the lowest possible fees and the best possible service and, because of competitive tensions that are engendered through genuine competition, this will lead to a maximisation of their retirement savings. That is the reason we are moving these amendments.


If these amendments are unsuccessful today, this will form part of the coalition policy going into the next election. Given that this government has been so belligerent in refusing to do the right thing in this area by continuing to protect the vested commercial interests of their friends in the union movement rather than do the right thing in the public interest, if this does not get fixed between now and the next election a future coalition government will fix it. With those few words I seek leave to move opposition amendments (4), (5) and (7) on sheet 7304 together.


Leave granted.

6 Subsection 539(2) (column 1 of item 11 of the table)



After ""351(1)"", insert ""351A(1)"".


I rise today to move this amendment for the Australian Greens on whistleblowing or public interest disclosure. This is something the Australian Greens feel very strongly about. We note that the government made all sorts of promises about dealing with comprehensive whistleblower legislation, but we are yet to see it.


This is a really important amendment as we know that whistleblowers in Australia are afraid to come forward in many cases because they suffer vilification and frequently they lose their jobs or do not get promotion. So we are in a situation where, instead of transparency and openness and reporting of problems, we have covering up. This amendment will enshrine whistleblowing as a workplace right under Fair Work Australia. The act applies to 80 per cent of the Australian workforce, including the federal government sector, many state agencies and large swathes of the private sector. If claims are made that it covers small business, we can say that the overwhelming majority who are doing nothing wrong have nothing to fear.


Essentially, this amendment will enshrine whistleblowing as a protected right through the existing mechanism in the act called 'adverse action'. What that does is prevent an employer, fellow employee or contractor from taking an adverse action against someone after they have made a public interest disclosure. This could include firing them, demoting them, reducing their pay, cancelling supply orders et cetera. If an adverse action is taken they will be able to claim compensation under the act.


The example that I can give is one that has just been reported in the last couple of weeks—that is, with Mr Twiggy Forrest's Fortescue Metal Group. They commissioned an archaeologist firm to inspect the cultural artefacts and connections of the traditional owners in the Pilbara. When Fortescue did not like the results, they ordered that sections be taken out and they withheld payments until they did. This scourge affects environmental assessments and native title applications too. One firm wrote to the Western Australian department after the requested changes were made and the other refused to make the changes and had to forgo $70,000. In the private sector, whistleblowing protections should extend to contractual right to payment as well as subsequent adverse treatment against contractors if they make a protected disclosure.


Another example is the HIH collapse. This could have been avoided if these proposals were in place at the time. The external actuaries and auditors of HIH relied so heavily on their business that they did nothing when the HIH board refused to heed the recommendations and deferred to the board's authority in fear of upsetting the business relationship and regular work. So there was no incentive or protection for people to blow the whistle on what was clearly going on in that particular company. It is important that we move to recognise whistleblowing as a workplace right.


In addition to adverse action, the amendment also incorporates threats and harassment to stop workplace bullying, which commonly follows disclosure of the information. As we heard recently when a former policeman came forward in relation to what has led to a royal commission into sexual abuse, he knew that his career would be over in terms of the bullying that would go on as he revealed the extent to which moves had been suppressed within the police force formerly.


To qualify for the protections of Fair Work, the whistleblower must first raise the issue with the employer and then, if there is no adequate response to the disclosure within a reasonable time, they may make a disclosure that is reasonably necessary to another person. If it is not appropriate for the person to inform their employer for a justifiable reason, they can immediately inform a third party and still be covered by the scheme. If the above procedure is followed, they would be immune from civil and criminal action arising from the disclosure. It is really important that we take this on board and work now to make sure that we give whistleblowers this workplace right and protect them from any adverse consequences that might occur when they are clearly acting in the public interest. It needs to be not only in the public sector but it also needs to cover the private sector.


The classes of disclosable conduct are listed in the subclause, and there is a catch-all in (e) that says they include 'illegal acts, misappropriating money or property, misuse or concealment of information and risks to public health, a person's safety, and the environment'. In other words, they are disclosable conduct that would be protected by making whistleblowing a fairly extensive workplace right. But a person who discloses information, or even a part of it, with knowledge that it is false or misleading will not be covered by the provisions, so it is not just a carte blanche and it is not trying to encourage vexatious individuals or people making up things or presenting false information. It is actually saying that the provision for whistleblowers covers you providing the information you are giving is truthful and in accordance with what you are claiming. It will cover people in the public and private sectors.


Given the enormous wealth that is being made around the country, particularly in the resources sector, and the decision by the Commonwealth to devolve responsibility to the states for environmental protection and environmental assessment, it is critical that we get coverage for whistleblowers in legislation. I am hoping that there will be support in the Senate for acting on what people say they want—that is, actually protecting whistleblowers in the public interest and making whistleblowing a workplace right.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (11:07):  While the government recognises the importance of providing strong protections to workers who act in the public interest, it will not support these amendments. The government notes that the Fair Work Act currently provides some protection from adverse action where a person has or exercises a workplace right. A workplace right relevantly includes where a person is able to make a complaint or inquiry to a person or body having a capacity under a workplace law to seek compliance with the law or a workplace instrument, or if the person is an employee in relation to their employment.


The government proposes that the need for any amendment to the Fair Work Act should be carefully considered following the release of the government's response to the report of the inquiry into whistleblower protections within the Australian Public Service, which is scheduled for early in the parliamentary new year. For example, the proposed amendments are broad and seek to provide protections to a broad range of disclosures without any appropriate framework for who such disclosures should be made to. Nor do they provide potential disclosers with the certainty of whether their actions are legal or not, with the courts having to make decisions about whether the public disclosure was reasonable or not. The government considers this issue is too important to rush ahead of proper consultation and response to the report, and also highlights that these amendments relate mostly to the first tranche of recommendations from the Fair Work Act review panel. It is in this context that we believe these matters should be dealt with elsewhere.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:09):  Just very briefly, on this occasion I adopt the words of the minister in relation to this—especially her last words—that one of the reasons we should not be considering this is that we should not rush ahead without proper consultation. I think that has been a continuing theme of the coalition and the opposition in relation to this legislation—which, it will be recalled—was introduced into the House of Representatives one day, voted upon on the next day, and then it was exempted from the cut-off in the Senate. It was rushed through here, rushed through a committee, and we have said that proper consultation does need to take place. Clearly what the Australian Greens are doing this morning is to introduce a completely new issue—which they are entitled to do, but it is a completely new issue—in relation to the Fair Work Act regime which has not had consultations with the various stakeholders. 


The coalition's amendments specifically deal with matters that have actually been canvassed in the bill and have actually had some exposure, albeit extremely limited. Having said that, the coalition will be opposing the Greens amendments.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:11):  It is always interesting that when it comes to protecting whistleblowers there are always years and years more consultation that has to happen. Meanwhile, people who have blown the whistle suffer, lose their jobs, lose their promotions and frequently end up being smeared and vilified in the process, and we have years and years more consultation. How many more years do we need before we protect whistleblowers? 


I remind the Senate: we have just been going through the Reserve Bank of Australia note bribery scandal. That would not have happened without three very brave whistleblowers who came forward and basically said, 'Enough is enough,' and got that scandal exposed. At the rate the government and the coalition want to move, it would have been, 'No, we have to have many more years of consultation before we work out how we would actually protect those whistleblowers'—not to mention someone like Dave Reid, for example, who came out and made his claim against ANSTO. He was smeared, he suffered character attacks, and of course he was eventually vindicated after he exposed the poor safety controls at the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor. We could go on and name many, many whistleblowers around Australia who have acted in the public interest, who have exposed appalling scandals. The RBA note bribery scandal is a case in point. If we want people to come out and tell the truth, as we had with the Wheat Board, as we have had with the RBA note inquiry and so on, you have to protect them. We have to encourage a culture of people coming forward in the public interest. But all we seem to do is have governments and oppositions, when they change sides, suddenly change perspective on what sort of protections they are prepared to give people who will come forward in the public interest. In the private sector, of course, there is virtually no protection for people at all.


It may interest both the government and the coalition to know that in the United States they have come forward with legislation which actually allows whistleblowers to get some of the benefit if they are saving money, if they are reporting maladministration or fraud. They actually get a percentage of that. That is not something the Greens are proposing, but it is certainly a way for people to have an incentive to watch what corporations and government agencies are doing in terms of reporting when money is being misappropriated, or fraud is occurring or whatever the allegation might be.


I would just stand here and strongly say that you cannot keep putting this off. You cannot keep saying, 'We are going to the election promising all this protection for whistleblowers', and yet the reality is that it is delay, delay, delay, weak action and ultimately we end up with nobody having the courage to come forward. It has been significantly undermined by the move to contracts in the senior echelons of the Public Service. People now are in the position of knowing that their contract may not be renewed.


There are all kinds of problems associated with why we end up not having people coming forward and telling the truth about what is going on in their companies and in the public sector. Senator Collins was talking about an agency. We have talked about having a national integrity commission that would work with the Ombudsman to make sure that when complaints are made if it is maladministration it would go to the Ombudsman and if it is fraud it would go to the Integrity Commission. We have proposed a structure and we have a bill in this parliament to have a national corruption capacity. For the life of me I cannot understand why neither the government nor the coalition is prepared to back a national integrity commission and serious legislation that deals with whistleblowers. I ask them to reconsider and to it least give in-principle support to whistleblowing as a workplace right.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:21):  by leave—I move opposition amendments (7) to (11) and (13) on sheet 7305 together:

(12) Schedule 8, item 63, page 57 (lines 20 to 23), TO BE OPPOSED.


The coalition strongly believes in a strong and independent commission, and it is vital that the Australian people have confidence in Fair Work Australia. These amendments will ensure that the president's powers are not so broad as would provide him with an open remit to penalise people as he sees fit. I do not believe that is necessarily good within any workplace, let alone a workplace such as Fair Work Australia. Regrettably, we do know that there is some disharmony, to put it mildly, at the top of Fair Work Australia. That disharmony received public attention when the President of Fair Work Australia made some observations—I will once again use diplomatic language—about Vice President Graeme Watson's speech in recent times.


Mr Ross told us at Senate estimates that he had 'expressed concern' to the vice president following his speech, in which he expressed concern about the operation of the Fair Work Act and its review.


In July of this year Mr Ross then released a code of conduct which some people interpreted as a thin-veiled attack on Mr Watson. The Australian Financial Review said this code of conduct:


… reads disturbingly like an effort to enforce group-think on his subordinate commissioners.


Under the section headed 'Participation in the public debate', Mr Ross's code directs members to avoid involvement in political controversy when engaging in public debate and carefully consider how they express their views, as they may lead to the perception of bias. The quote goes on:


Other members may hold different views on contentious issues, and may wish to respond accordingly, possibly giving rise to a public conflict between members, which may bring the tribunal into disrepute or could diminish the authority of the tribunal.


Despite all of this, Mr Ross has provided separate advice that:


The President speaks on behalf of the tribunal and its members.


In other words, it is Mr Ross's view that will prevail and no other commissioner will be entitled to express his or her view that may not necessarily 100 per cent align with the president's view. I am not sure that that is healthy for any tribunal or indeed any court. The fact that they should resist involvement in public controversy is, of course, accepted wisdom. But if the president can do so, one wonders why deputy presidents and others cannot do so. What is difficult to swallow by some is that on the very day that Mr Ross appeared at Senate estimates, saying that it was inappropriate for Fair Work Australia tribunal members to 'enter the public debate about such issues', he appeared on the ABC 7.30 program to answer questions about Fair Work Australia's involvement in the investigation into Craig Thomson, despite saying that he had no responsibility for it.


The coalition does have some concerns in relation to what the government is proposing. I understand that the normal practice for tribunals is as is currently in the legislation. Without going into too much detail, what the government is seeking to do is to delete provisions of the existing Fair Work Act and give the president, quite frankly, unprecedented powers. At the moment a Fair Work Commissioner must, under section 640, disclose a potential conflict to the president. I should be starting at 643—Termination for appointment for bankruptcy et cetera. Section 643 reads as follows:


The Governor-General must terminate the appointment of an FWA member if—


then we go down to (c):


(c) the FWA member fails without reasonable excuse to comply with section 640.


Now allow me to go back to section 640 where the member, therefore, without reasonable excuse, does not disclose a potential conflict of interest to the president. If that conflict of interest is disclosed to the president then the commissioner can only deal with it with the president's approval, but the president must give a direction to the Fair Work member not to deal or to no longer deal with a matter if, and then those circumstances are set out. The government is basically seeking to delete a number of those aspects and simply replace it with the suggestion that the Fair Work Commission member must disclose the potential conflict to (a) a person who has made or will make a submission, and to the president, and that there are then no follow-on consequences. 


We believe that if a Fair Work commissioner fails to disclose and behave as is currently required under section 643 then termination should take place. There is, of course, the get out, where that failure is without reasonable excuse; so there is that protection for an FWA member. But if they are without reasonable excuse and behaving in a particular manner then the Governor-General must terminate their appointment.


The government is now proposing that the president, basically in his full discretion, will be able to deal with that particular matter. It seems to the coalition that it is unhealthy that so much power should reside with the president of Fair Work Australia. I have also indicated in my other comments that we believe that the powers of the president will be too great, and that it will not be conducive to a healthy, robust Fair Work Australia, where different commissioners might actually be able to hold some differing views and give expression to their differing views—of course, within the bounds of appropriate expression.


I might say that we have that from High Court judges, who from time to time give speeches. I can think of speeches by Justice Kirby where the chances are I would not agree with much at all, yet with former Justice Ian Callinan giving speeches the chances are that I would have agreed with most of what he said. These people sat on the High Court together and the High Court did not fall into disrepute because of it. They were entitled to express differing views. Just imagine if today a High Court judge could not give a speech without Chief Justice French giving his imprimatur. I think that would diminish the High Court and, whilst Fair Work Australia is in no way to be equated with the High Court, being only a quasi-judicial body, it is nevertheless a similar principle that should apply, that there should be that freedom and that we should not have such an oppressive regime being foisted on Fair Work Australia commissioners.


I commend the amendments to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (11:32):  The government opposes the opposition amendments in this area regarding the powers of the president. The bill sets out clearly in law a complaints-handling process for members of the Fair Work Commission, including the president. The government considers an effective complaints mechanism is an important element of ensuring and maintaining public confidence in the commission.


The government's proposed section 581A provides a framework for the president to deal with complaints against members. The provisions proposed by the government are modelled on similar provisions recently passed by the Senate to deal with complaints made against members of the federal judiciary. Paragraph (1)(b) of new section 581A simply makes it clear that the president, as part of the complaints-handling process, has a responsibility to manage issues that could impact on public confidence in the tribunal. Any steps taken by the president during an inquiry into a complaint must be temporary measures taken until the conclusion of the inquiry and determination of the complaint.


The government supports the president having the discretion to effectively manage the affairs of Fair Work Australia as the head of the tribunal, with responsibility for ensuring that it performs its functions and operations effectively and in a manner worthy of public confidence.


The coalition have indicated that they will oppose the government's proposal to omit section 643C from the Fair Work Act. The proposed omission of the section relates to the amendments that the government has put forward in this bill to streamline and clarify the operation of provisions dealing with conflicts of interest. While a failure to comply with section 640, which deals with conflicts of interest, will no longer be a ground for termination of the appointment of a Fair Work Commission member under the bill, the member still retains the obligation to disclose any potential conflict to the parties and to the president under that section. A failure to disclose the conflict may lead to a complaint being made against the member, which would be dealt with in accordance with the new complaints-handling process set out in the bill.


The government considers that the framework it has proposed will bring greater certainty and transparency to handling complaints against Fair Work members, whether a complaint deals with a conflict of interest or some other matter. The important issue here is to have a mechanism or a process that works within the tribunal. That is why we maintain these proposals as they stand.

For all this government's rhetoric about consultation and listening to people, we have another good example of where the rhetoric does not actually match the action. The government set up the Fair Work Review Panel, stacked as it was, skewed terms of reference as they were, and the panel strongly recommended that the name Fair Work Australia should be changed. 


What is the government's recommendation here: that the offending part of the title is not 'Fair Work' but 'Australia'. They want to delete the word 'Australia' and insert 'Commission' in direct rejection of the review panel's recommendation that it is 'Fair Work' that is the tarnished name. 'Fair Work' is the sullied name; 'Fair Work' is the name that has fallen into disrepute. Why? Because of this government. This government has tried to make Fair Work Australia into a political vehicle. We know that Fair Work Australia's reputation is diminished and tarnished because of the Health Services Union inquiry and the inquiry into Mr Craig Thomson. I do not need to canvass that scandal any further other than to say that after three long years Fair Work Australia finally came to the conclusion that I think that every other Australian had come to about 2½ years earlier that Mr Thomson was a bad egg, that he had misspent members' moneys. It took Fair Work Australia three long years to come to that conclusion.


It is no wonder that the review panel into the Fair Work Act came to the conclusion that the name should be changed with the deletion of the words 'Fair Work'. Let me remind senators of the actual recommendation. It says:


The panel recommends that the Fair Work Act be amended to change the name of Fair Work Australia to a title which more aptly denotes its functions. It is recommended that the new title contain the word ""Commission""—


and the government has done that—


and that it no longer contain the words ""Fair Work"".


Was this a bolt out of the blue? No, it was not. The President of Fair Work Australia, Mr Ross, no less, when I asked him at a Senate estimates in May about these matters in relation to the name change, said:


I have put forward two suggestions. Frankly, I do not mind as long as it is not the same as the name of the act. The two names I have put forward are: the Australian Workplace Commission or the Australian Workplace Relations Commission. The key point is not really what the name is. It is that it be separate from the name given to the act and that there be a clear distinction between the administrative functions of the organisation and the adjudicative functions.


So you have got the Fair Work Act Review Panel making this recommendation and you have got the President of Fair Work Australia making that recommendation. Guess who else makes that recommendation? It is not often that we in the coalition would rely on these people as our allies, but listen to this: the Maritime Workers Union said:


The MUA welcomes a return to the inclusion of ""Commission"" in the name of the Tribunal.


However, the MUA supports calls for further amendment of the name to its natural form, ""Australian Industrial Relations Commission"".


The Commission has been and remains a cornerstone of a functioning Australian democracy and is renowned for its fair and efficient management of industrial relations following federation with the enactment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904.


As such, the Commission deserves a name that is recognised throughout Australia and should revert to its longstanding and accepted form.


So we can go from the extreme and the ridiculous with the MUA, who actually support this, right through to the Australian Metals and Mining Association who submitted:


Enacting a name change from Fair Work Australia to the Fair Work Commission will do little to rectify the branding challenges—


Isn't that a polite way of putting it? Some of us might say the 'trashed reputation', but very diplomatic language was used here. The submission continues:


the tribunal has experienced in the wake of the Health Services Union investigation or to clear up the confusion between the judicial and administrative arms of the Fair Work infrastructure. A more objective name for the tribunal such as the Australian Workplace Relations Commission (AWRC) if far more appropriate.


In its response to the Fair Work review, the ACTU said that they strongly supported the recommendation as it was. 


So I ask the question: who is standing in the way of the name change? We have got the ACTU, we have got the Maritime Workers Union of Australia, we have got employer group after employer group—from the big ACCIs and AiG through to the Master Builders, the Housing Industry Association, the Independent Contractors Association, the Council of Small Business of Australia, and we have even got the Law Council of Australia—all supporting this. 


Who has submitted or argued that the name should be 'Fair Work Commission'—nobody other than Ms Gillard, who created Fair Work Australia and the legislation. Her vanity is what stands in the way of this very sensible, practical recommendation. Indeed, Labor senators in considering this legislation—and rushed as the committee process was; a matter that I had previously canvassed—said this in paragraph 2.40:


A number of submitters saw merit in resurrecting the title 'Australian Industrial Relations Commission', on the basis that the name is well known and accepted in the community.


Even they were mugged by the overwhelming number of submissions in relation to this.


So, for good judicial and administrative purposes the President of Fair Work Australia has recommended this change. The Fair Work Review Panel, stacked and packed as it was by Labor for a certain outcome with skewed terms of reference, were also mugged by all the submissions that this name change should occur. 


Indeed, the Orwellian name of Fair Work Australia, or now Fair Work Commission, has all the hallmarks of the sort of Orwellian naming that this government loves, but it has fallen into disrepute. The name 'Fair Work' is now a trashed commodity within the Australian community and within the workplace relations space. Everybody knows it, from the Maritime Union of Australia right through to the ACTU, all the employer groups, the panel and President of Fair Work Australia and even Labor senators on the committee; but who does not get it? The Prime Minister, in her vanity. Indeed, that is what some of the submitters have suggested. The feedback they have got is that this very sensible change was stopped at the very highest levels of the government.


I am not going to spend any more of this chamber's time on this, but it is yet again another window for the Australian people to see how this government operates. Let us start with consultation—'We will take into account community concerns. We are going to have a thorough, robust panel looking at this.' They made a recommendation that was supported by everybody—it was unanimous. Yet the government will not do it. Why? Because of the vanity of the Prime Minister.


It is a matter of great concern when the proper judicial and administrative functioning of such an important tribunal cannot be rehabilitated with a name change simply because of the vanity of the Prime Minister. She created Fair Work Australia. She appointed the initial personnel to Fair Work Australia. Of course, Fair Work Australia is now a trashed brand. That is recognised across the political divide, across the employer-employee divide and within Fair Work Australia.


Whilst we would argue that a name change is only a small change and there may need to be some cultural change attached to it, this government cannot even bring itself to a name change. If it cannot bring itself to such a basic change as that that has been so overwhelmingly recommended and so overwhelmingly endorsed, it stands to reason that the Australian people will come to the conclusion that this government will set its own course irrespective of the national interest and irrespective of the interests of having good functioning tribunals in this nation because the overriding factor will be the vanity of the Prime Minister. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

Senator CAMERON

 (New South Wales) (12:45):  I rise on a matter of public interest—that is, the report of the International Trade Union Congress on violations of trade union rights. Trade unionists around the world face huge challenges. Here, in Australia, they face the challenge of well-organised and well-resourced business groups doing their best to defeat collective bargaining and representative rights. They face unfounded accusations from ignorant and self-serving business leaders and those opposite who say that unions are to blame for the recent decline in Australia's productivity growth. The argument is: just get rid of those nasty unions and everything will be okay. 




Senator Edwards:
  Hear, hear! 




Senator CAMERON:
  I hear 'Hear, hear' from the opposite group. It is just unbelievable that you would even say that in jest, that you would argue to get rid of the Australian trade union movement—but it does not surprise me from those who support Work Choices. Around the world, trade unionists face the relentless drumbeat of calls from business interests, their cheer squad—



Senator Edwards interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  as you happen to be, and the Tory press for stripping away workplace rights—like the fundamental right of an unfairly sacked worker to challenge their dismissal. I cannot understand why you would say that, if you were unfairly sacked, that should be a right and proper thing to do anywhere in the world. 


As I have said before in this place, there are challenges that the Australian labour movement will meet head-on, but they are nowhere near as challenging as the threats, violence and murder that are visited on trade unionists in countries less fortunate than ours. I raised this issue as a matter of public interest in this place in 2009 and again in 2010. Each year, the International Trade Union Confederation releases a report on the violations of trade union rights worldwide. I am pleased to note that a distinguished Australian trade unionist, the former ACTU President and a friend of mine, Sharan Burrow, is currently the General Secretary of the ITUC and is carrying on the fight she waged against the injustices of Work Choices on the global stage. 


In its recent report, the ITUC catalogues the violations that occurred during 2011. As the 2010 report noted: 


The crisis in employment, set off by the global economic crisis, continues in every region and those who make policy have largely failed to make the changes needed to create and sustain employment. Governments have simply swallowed free market corporate rhetoric at the expense not only of working families but also of the stability and future of their own national economies. Big banks, big finance and big business have been allowed to dominate government policy while unemployment, poverty and insecurity continue to grow. 


You have only got to look at Australia—at the behaviour of the Queensland coalition government, the New South Wales coalition government, the Victorian coalition government and the Western Australian coalition government—to understand what challenges Australian workers would face if we were ever to be in the unfortunate position of having a coalition government led by the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. 


The very inequality which was a driving force in tipping the world into economic crisis is still growing and the violation of basic international labour standards is itself the primary cause of this inequality. These global forces continue unabated. Trade unions in many countries face repression by governments and employers. The introduction of the 2011 ITUC report notes: 


The world economic crisis continued to impact unfairly on workers, as many governments persisted in favouring austerity measures over stimulating growth and employment. Unemployment rose to record levels in 2011, with over 205 million people out of work. 


In Europe, trade unions felt the impact of the Eurozone crisis, with Portugal, Hungary and Romania all facing further restricting workers' rights as part of their austerity measures. 


The most dramatic changes were in Greece however where unemployment rose to 21%, wages and living standards fell sharply and collective bargaining rights were severely curtailed. 


There were 76 people killed in 2011 because of their involvement in legitimate trade union activities and many more were subjected to death threats. There were 56 trade unionists murdered in Latin America, including 29 in Columbia and 10 in Guatemala. The ITUC report also documents thousands of arbitrary arrests and dismissals of trade unionists around the world. Many more cases go unreported. This is due to the climate of anti-union fear and intimidation which many workers have to face in their union activities. Sadly, Latin America once again holds the shameful distinction of being a killing field for trade unionists. Killings were also recorded in Bangladesh, the Philippines, South Africa and Indonesia. A one-year-old child died in Zimbabwe after spending a night on the roadside, in the rain, because her family was among farm workers summarily evicted for daring to organise. In Fiji the military junta launched an aggressive campaign to dismantle the trade union movement and Felix Anthony, the leader of the Fiji Trades Union Congress, was arrested, threatened, insulted and beaten. The ILO Commission of Inquiry on Zimbabwe has confirmed that the Zimbabwean government was responsible for systemic violations of trade union rights. In Djibouti, the ILO expressed its deep concern at the government's complete lack of will to settle several cases of trade union rights violations.


Complete bans on trade unionism remain in place in several countries including Laos, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Some of the world's most wealthy economies also figure in the report including the USA where attacks on organising and collective rights bargaining, already identified in 2009 and previous years, actually intensified in 2010 and 2011. Much of this is by state governments under the influence of the Tea Party. Canada's Conservative Party government has weakened freedom of association and collective-bargaining rights, while in New Zealand amendments to the Employment Relations Act reduced worker rights.


When I spoke previously about the violence committed against trade unions in Colombia, I said that Colombia remains the most dangerous place in the world to be an active trade unionist. Sadly, this is still the case. The murder of trade unionists in Colombia continues unchecked. The murderers continue to enjoy immunity from prosecution despite expressions of concern by government officials. The Vice-President of the republic, speaking on behalf of the government, has recognised the scale of the violence—something previous governments have never done. While some efforts have been made to investigate these crimes in Colombia, in the majority of cases the state clearly lacks the capacity to protect trade union rights.


Over 2,800 union members have been murdered in Colombia since 1986. Aside from those murdered, hundreds of trade unionists received death threats, many were forcibly displaced, dozens were arbitrarily detained, a few 'disappeared' and many more were harassed. Over the past 24 years, a Colombian trade unionist has been murdered every three days. Colombia accounts for more than half of all the trade unionists murdered worldwide: 294 out of a total of 580 since 2006. Despite the establishment in 2007 of special courts and investigative units focussed on cases of violence against trade unionists, they have done little to quell the violence or bring the perpetrators to justice. In cases of murder, only four per cent of perpetrators have been brought to justice. The rest have committed their crimes with impunity. For other forms of violence against trade unionists, 99.8 per cent of perpetrators have been able to commit their crimes with impunity.


I must say I have grave concerns that my government is talking about making a free trade agreement with Colombia. I have been a long-time critic of free trade agreements. I think they are over-egged in terms of the benefits that workers are supposed to achieve from them, and the problems that they create are diminished in the political discourse. But I have to say I would find it absolutely amazing if any government would sign off on a free trade agreement with Colombia while it remains the most dangerous place for trade union activity in the world.


The second most dangerous country to be a trade unionist in is Guatemala. In 2011, 10 trade unionists were murdered in addition to the 10 murdered in 2010, 16 trade unionists were assassinated in 2009 and nine in 2008. Other forms of violence have escalated: 76 violent, non-deadly acts were committed against unionists in 2009—a near five-fold increase from the 16 committed in 2008. The Guatemalan government claims that unionists are killed as a result of the general upsurge of violence sweeping the country and not for their work protecting labour rights. The facts indicate very strongly otherwise.


According to a 2010 report from the Guatemalan Labor, Indigenous and Campesino Movement, 75 per cent of union leaders were threatened prior to their assassinations and 98 per cent were assassinated within a few weeks of advocating for worker rights. Nevertheless, the murderers continue to enjoy blanket impunity. Companies, the courts and the Guatemalan government continue to deny the connection. In nearly a quarter of the recorded cases of murder, there is evidence of ties between the suspected perpetrators and the Guatemalan security forces or municipal government bodies. The Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, far from fostering labour rights, is the obedient servant of the national and transnational employers. When there are decisions by the labour court in favour of workers, they are not applied. The Special Prosecutor for Crimes against Journalists and Trade Unionists has repeatedly refused to investigate crimes against trade unionists, determining without investigation that the individual or family was attacked and/or assassinated for non-union activity.


Violence has increased significantly since the implementation of the Central America Free Trade Agreement in 2006. No trade unionists were murdered in 2006. Four were murdered in 2007, nine in 2008 and 16 in 2009. In April 2008, the AFL-CIO and six Guatemalan unions filed a CAFTA complaint with the US Office of Trade, citing labour law violations and violations against trade unionists. After three years of informal and formal consultations that yielded little progress on workers' rights, the US government in August 2011 announced that it would take Guatemala to arbitration. So far the complaint is unresolved and the killings continue.


I want to pay my respects to the courageous trade union members around the world who stand up for their members, stand up for democracy and stand up for the rights of trade unionism. We must remedy these attacks against trade unionists, and I say again that providing free trade agreements to countries like Guatemala or Colombia is not in the national interest. I call on Minister Emerson to ensure that we never do a free trade agreement with Colombia while it is a killing field for trade unionists.

Senator BOB CARR
 (New South Wales—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (14:01):  The draft resolution 'Question of Palestine' is scheduled to be voted on in the UN General Assembly this Thursday, 29 November. If passed, the draft resolution will accord non-member observer state status in the UN to the Palestinians. It does not confer statehood.


The decision by the government to abstain on this question accords with our strong support for legitimate Palestinian aspirations towards statehood but reflects our view that the only way to a two-state solution in the Middle East, with a strong Palestinian state side by side with an Israel with absolute security, is through an outcome negotiated by the two sides, the two sides thus having a commitment to the success of the outcome. You cannot get that through a resolution of the General Assembly, but to have voted no would have sent a message that Australia does not believe in something we do believe in—namely, statehood for Palestinians.


Before I continue, let me just set the last question to rest. That is that there was some discussion of the political impact of this decision here. I say this candidly to the Senate: I do not believe that a decision on this has a political impact, because the vast bulk of Australians want a two-state solution. That is the common-sense, mainstream position adhered to by the Australian people: that there should be a Palestinian state side by side with a secure Israel. That is the view that the majority of Australians hold.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Bob Carr) and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by senators today.


It is a little disappointing that today, the day of the National Disability Awards and only a few days away from the International Day of People with Disability, the government has continued to answer what are legitimate questions about the funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the NDIS legislation with partisan and dismissive diatribes. I would have hoped that if there were one area of policy where questions could be asked and answered in a civil way it would be the area of disability policy. I must take issue with the continued contention of those opposite that the opposition does not really support a national disability insurance scheme. The opposition does support a national disability insurance scheme. Also, I must take issue with the contention which we heard—repeated by Senator Wong and through Senator Evans's interjections—that the opposition only has a policy for a committee. What the opposition wants to see is a mechanism that can lock in the support of all parties in this parliament for an NDIS. What the opposition wants is a mechanism that can oversee the implementation of the NDIS over the several parliaments that full implementation will take. That is the purpose of the parliamentary committee that the opposition has proposed, to be chaired by both sides of politics, to oversee the implementation. That is the essence of our proposition. It is completely different from the characterisation that the government has given it.


The questions that I asked Senator Wong were pretty straightforward. They were about whether it was the intention of the government to announce this week funding to enable the implementation of a full NDIS. The reason why I asked if that announcement will take place this week is that the government are introducing tomorrow, in the other place, the legislation to give effect to the national disability insurance transition agency. It is not just me and it is not just members of the opposition who are asking the question as to when the government will announce funding certainty for the NDIS; it is also Australians with disability, it is also their families and it is also their carers. It is not a partisan question to ask the government of the day if they are going to provide funding certainty for an organisation which will be given effect to by legislation to be introduced tomorrow. That is not a partisan question. That is a legitimate question, and the fact that the government continue to hurl partisan abuse across the chamber every time we ask simple legitimate questions in a sober and reasonable fashion does not reflect on the opposition. It reflects on the government that the most simple questions and the most basic questions about the NDIS and NDIS funding cannot be asked without receiving partisan diatribes in return. Every time I ask questions on the NDIS I make sure I circulate the Hansards to people with disability, their families and their carers, so they see what the true attitude of this government is when it comes to bipartisanship and the NDIS. The government pay lip service to bipartisanship when it comes to the NDIS, but every time the hand of bipartisanship is extended, it is rejected by the government. The ultimate proof of that was when I moved a motion in this chamber to establish a non-partisan parliamentary oversight committee for the implementation of the NDIS and the Labor Party and the Greens combined together to vote it down.




Senator McLucas:
  Because it was a bad idea.




Senator FIFIELD:
  Let the record show that Senator Jan McLucas said that a bipartisan committee binding on all parties to oversee the implementation of the NDIS 'was a bad idea'. Let the Hansard record show that Senator McLucas is against bipartisan oversight of the implementation of the NDIS. But I can tell you, Mr Deputy President, that is what Australians with disability want. They want bipartisanship, they want parliamentary oversight and they want certainty. (Time expired)

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:06):  I agree with Senator Fifield on one thing, and that is that today is a good day, because we are going to have the disability awards this evening. I know the one thing that will actually engage all people in this chamber is the recognition and celebration of the people who will be acknowledged this evening. So I think that, in a true bipartisan way, I can start off with that.


I was a little worried, though, when Senator Fifield said he was able to actually show that in this chamber all the questions asked by the opposition are sober and reasonable and that the only place where there is any objection or abuse is on this side of the chamber. I would think that any sober and reasonable evaluation of the Hansard would point out that—and we have had this conversation, Mr Deputy President—in many ways there could be a consideration of behaviour and how we interact across the whole place.


I am interested that we are taking note of the answers given to questions asked of both Senator Wong and Senator Bob Carr, because they are very important issues, but it is difficult in five minutes to respond effectively to both. In terms of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, we are very keen to have that legislation in this place and to have the opportunity of a fulsome committee process around that, which I would expect, where all the questions that so many people have about the future of this wonderful scheme will be addressed.


We know, from the first round of the budget, that the trial process has been guaranteed. That has been out there publicly in terms of looking at the trial sites, which required massive discussion and consultation with user groups, with people across the country and, on the financial side, most clearly with the states, which seems to be forgotten in the way we look at finances around the national disability scheme. We have been very open about the need for this discussion through the COAG process. The services that people with disabilities clearly need—there is no debate about the fact that these services are required—require the financial, social and policy engagement of all levels of government in this country because, currently, the scheme engages both the federal and state systems. That is one aspect of pulling together the scheme for the future.


The implications of the full funding of the NDIS in the future will be a matter for the upcoming budget. There is no doubt about that and no-one is unaware of that process. In terms of what we will do when looking at the legislation when it comes before this place and through the committee process, which I expect will occur, if and when the Senate agrees to that, we will be able to identify exactly what the needs will be in the future and work with that.


I fully expect that there will be bipartisanship because I have this need for optimism, because I have this need to see a massive acceptance of the need to better improve services and to provide respect for people with disabilities in our country. The development of a committee, which was asked for by the opposition, was not considered to be the best way to do that at this stage. That was explained. I understand that people from the opposition who put that forward will be disappointed that it was not the chosen direction of the government. But saying that that means that there will not be full opportunity for bipartisan engagement is just not true. I am also interested in whether we could be given any information about where we have previously had this kind of committee in terms of development of policy. That would be useful.


I also want to make a couple of quick comments about the answers given by Senator Bob Carr on what happened with the UN vote. It was incredibly important for the government to have a united voice on this process. It is not the way it has been portrayed by people in this area and by the great investigations and references in the media. It is not the case that the Prime Minister was pushed into a position. When you have policy, what happens is that you debate it within the caucus, you debate it within the cabinet and then you come up with a position. It is clear that there is great support for our country to be involved in an effective process around the development of policy in this incredibly important area. We have seen the most wonderful development: a peace settlement has been put in place now, tenuous and vulnerable as it is, by people internationally saying, 'These two important groups, Israel and Palestine, need to work together to develop their future.' We all have a role in that. We must have that. What we have asked is that in this important UN vote we acknowledge that there should be a process to allow Palestine to have a greater say.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2012-11-28,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (15:11):  Today the opposition again extended the hand of bipartisanship on both issues, Israel and the National Disability Insurance Scheme, raised by this motion and, again, that hand was turned away arrogantly, dismissively.




Senator Carol Brown:
  Seriously?




Senator SINODINOS:
  Seriously. The politics of this is very straightforward if we talk first about the National Disability Insurance Scheme. How do you lock in your opposition to a process? You lock them in by having them be part of the process. The opposition was offering to be locked in with the government in a bipartisan committee that would oversee this. Everybody would be on the same page, speaking the same language and on the same wavelength. The government has nothing to lose from offering the hand of bipartisanship, nothing at all. Politics 101 teaches you that when you offer the hand of bipartisanship, it is almost always to the benefit of the government of the day; yet this government is so incompetent it cannot even see what is in its own interest.


So why do we offer the hand of bipartisanship? Because Tony Abbott took a leadership position on the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the government was forced to respond, as it did in the budget context. But it was dragged, kicking and screaming. It offered $1 billion over the forward estimates, not the $3.9 billion requested, evaluated and recommended by the Productivity Commission. We now wait for the budget to see what funding is put in for the out years, because the sacred promise that Julia Gillard has made to all of those disabled people out there is that the money will be there, that there will be a ramp up of $7 billion or $8 billion on top of what we do already by 2017 or 2018. Those people are waiting. They take it seriously. It is not just a political headline to them. So why treat them with such contempt? Why raise their expectations only to dash them?


In relation to Israel, I will say only this: the events of the last 24 hours confirm that the judgement of Julia Gillard has once again been trashed by her own colleagues. The Prime Minister took a principled view on this, to give her her due. She, as Prime Minister, made a judgement and, as the principal foreign policy spokesman of the government—the person who recently has been doing most on the foreign affairs trail, if you like, representing the government abroad—she took a view, and her colleagues rounded on her. Senator Bob Carr, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, led the charge against the Prime Minister.


I do not ascribe leadership aspirations to Senator Carr but his behaviour was not that of a foreign minister, loyal to the Prime Minister, backing up her judgement. He took on her judgement. They have been emboldened within the Labor Party by the events of the last 48 hours, in which the Prime Minister's judgement has been rendered under such a cloud by the events in Melbourne of almost two decades ago which have, once again, reminded people that Julia Gillard's judgement cannot be trusted.


But on the issue of Israel there is a bond of bipartisanship between the Prime Minister and the opposition. The only people not in the cart are the Labor Party. The excuse that was given was that it might upset people in Western Sydney—that is, it is about votes. It is about Chris Bowen's seat of McMahon and about Tony Burke's seat of Watson. We were told that it might offend some of our trading partners in the Asia-Pacific and that it might offend people in the live sheep trade or the live cattle trade. Well, we offended them when we unilaterally revoked the trade, when we took away the capacity for Australians to trade with the region. That is what we should have dealt with. You do not trade your foreign policy for your trade policy. You take a principled view.


What are we getting in return from the Palestinians, who will be the beneficiaries of our abstention? Have they given any further commitments on going to the peace table? At least Britain is trying to get something out of the Palestinians in terms of if they get observer status at the United Nations they will not join the International Criminal Court and then try to take Israel to that court to charge them with crimes against humanity. At least the Brits are trying to get something in return. By the government's action we have given our vote—in effect, our consent—to what Hamas has done.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Sinodinos. Before I call the next speaker, it was my error for not bringing you to order earlier in your debate. I let it go and it complicated matters.

I remind all senators of that for the continuation of this debate.




Senator Sinodinos:
  Thank you, Deputy President; I stand admonished.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (15:17):  I too rise to make a contribution to this debate and to take note of the answers given by Senator Bob Carr and Senator Wong to questions today. If I could follow on from where Senator Sinodinos left off, I do not think that there is one Australian who is not concerned about what is happening between Hamas and Israel. No-one could have turned on the television during those six days of horrible violence between those parties and not wanted some kind of a resolution.


A ceasefire was announced. I think that the conditions of the ceasefire are a credit to all those who were involved in the negotiations. But, as Senator Sinodinos has so rightly asked, we certainly need both sides to adhere to the conditions of that ceasefire and we need both parties to resume negotiations towards what we all believe is the right thing, which is a two-state solution.


But a question from Senator Barnaby Joyce in question time today was what really flummoxed me—to be asking the foreign minister about the importance of abstaining in this vote, as it comes up, for non-state status for Palestine. His rant actually became part of the question and, in a sense, it was oxymoronic. It defies belief that people would want to stand up and debate an issue like this while being so absolutely ignorant of the facts and having no understanding of what it is all about. Of course, abstaining is a political statement.


The notion that, because we have a seat on the Security Council, it means that abstaining is actually supporting Hamas's position is a nonsense. First of all, the vote does not count as a veto, which is what some people would like us to believe is the case, so our position on the Security Council is totally irrelevant; and that means that in this case an abstention from the vote is not a wasted vote at all. It is a very important political statement and it reflects our unanimous position, over many, many years and many governments, that a two-state solution must be negotiated through a sensible outcome. Israel cannot, as Minister Bob Carr said and as Israel has argued, be bombed towards peace negotiations. It is such a nonsense.


Someone, in the interaction in question time, suggested that Senator Joyce needed to study UN resolution 101 to understand the issue. We have an unequivocal commitment on all sides of politics here to what is a very important position of a two-state solution, and statehood for Palestine can only be negotiated through a resolution that is negotiated between the two sides. So, as I say, abstaining is a valid option.


The conditions of the ceasefire agreement are actually quite important, not only for those who are concerned about Palestine and for the staged departure of some 60,000 Israeli troops who are deployed along the Gaza border, but there is also the need for a very serious commitment to not re-arming Hamas. Dealing with the whole tunnel industry that has become part and parcel of the Gaza Strip is a very significant issue and, unless those conditions can be agreed to, it will be very difficult for Israel to make any kind of agreement with a moderate Palestine authority. We are all very conscious that this is not a partisan issue; it is one that we all seek a resolution to. I would hope that the coalition's position on this is not to undermine a peace process and a two-state solution.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2012-11-28,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (15:22):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Bob Carr and Senator Wong to questions asked by Senator Abetz and Senator Fifield. I am sure all senators in this place will extend, in anticipation of tonight's National Disability Awards, our appreciation for the success and courage shown by many disabled people and the organisations that represent them. And, of course, in anticipation of next week's International Day for People with Disability, I am sure the Senate again wants to note its endorsement of the great work that many people do to support people with disabilities in our community.


I want to touch briefly, in the short time available to me, on comments in the debate about the importance of adopting a bipartisan approach to the issue of disabilities in our country. No-one doubts that this is an issue critical to the generosity of our country going forward. To reflect on the contribution of Senator Fifield, I think his defence of adopting a bipartisan approach is an appropriate one, and it is disappointing that the government and others in this place did not endorse it at the time of its debate. As Senator Fifield said, a bipartisan joint select committee approach does allow this parliament a mechanism to lock in support from all parties for this important policy issue going forward. In addition to that, of course, it does provide a very effective parliamentary oversight mechanism to ensure that the implementation of a national approach to disability services is well constructed and well implemented over many years and many parliaments.


Senator Fifield and coalition senators believe that this approach is sound and forward thinking. It was somewhat surprising to hear the contribution of other senators in this place—some Labor senators—who suggested that a bipartisan approach was a bad idea. It is a great shame, but the reality is that over time this government is increasingly being characterised by inflexibility—inflexibility in a whole range of issues, not least the ability to develop and implement a bipartisan approach to what is an important national social policy; that is, the creation of a National Disability Insurance Scheme.


In the contribution of Senator Moore she was quite right to talk about the necessary engagement of all levels of government across Australia when we move toward the implementation of a National Disability Insurance Scheme. Reports today in the West Australian newspaper and in the Australian Financial Review point very, very squarely to the fact that the government is being inflexible in its approach to a National Disability Insurance Scheme. Let me quote from an Australian Financial Review article headed 'WA rejects disability scheme bill':


The West Australian government says it doesn't support federal legislation to introduce the national disability insurance scheme, describing the bill as too prescriptive and likely to set the state back 30 years to a time when people with disabilities had little control over their support services.


That article goes on to highlight the government's inflexibility. It says of the final version of the draft legislation:


… the state's Disability Services Minister, Helen Morton, said the final version failed to address WA's concerns and limited its role in decision-making.


The article goes on to say that the Western Australian government thinks that this Labor government might be more about promoting its own self-interest and that it should be about promoting personalised services, encouraging choice and control, rather than a constant prescriptive and inflexible approach to disability services as proposed by the government draft legislation.


In addition to that the West Australian says that the Western Australia state government:


… remained unhappy that the Commonwealth was insisting on sidelining the States in regards to the issue of control.


The scheme in Western Australia remained deadlocked after the state rejected the Commonwealth's latest offer of a fifty-fifty funding split with Canberra because—


not because of the funding split but because—


Canberra wanted to maintain its control over the particular pilot program.


It is very, very disappointing that this government is again characterised by inflexibility in its approach to disability services. But I am an optimist and I am very, very confident that, when the government's legislation reaches the Senate and the Senate decides to embark upon a consultation process across Australian cities and other locations, the bipartisan spirit of this Senate will come to the fore and that we will be able to work towards developing a truly effective National Disability Insurance Scheme.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Fifield be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,7,1,speech
"PRESIDENT, The",,2012-11-28,"



The PRESIDENT
 (15:35):  I table the explanatory memorandum to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Bill amends the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 (the Act) and runs in parallel with, but is distinct from, the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012 that has passed the House of Representatives.


The Act established for the first time a separate Parliamentary Service, independent of the Executive Government of the day. That legislation complemented widespread changes to the Australian Public Service which were introduced in the Public Service Act 1999 (the APS Act).



The Public Service Amendment Bill 2012 amends the Public Service Act 1999 to ensure the Australian Public Service is able to continue serving the Australian Government, the Parliament and the Australian public to a high standard. It implements recommendations of the report, Ahead of the Game: Blueprint for the Reform of Australian Government Administration, which require legislative change. 


This Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill contains various amendments to the Act, most of which reflect changes to the Public Service Act 1999 in the Public Service Amendment Bill. 




Changes to Act, arising from the Public Service Amendment Bill 





1. Values and Employment Principles



The current set of 15 Parliamentary Service Values in section 10 of the Act will be amended to include a shorter set of five Parliamentary Service Values and a set of Parliamentary Service Employment Principles comprising items from the current Values that reflect organisational aspirations. There will also be a statement about the role of the Parliamentary Service.


It is worth noting that the Public Service Amendment Bill does not include an equivalent of this role statement. This statement in this Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill confirms the independence of the Parliamentary Service from the Executive Government


Section 11 of the Act will be amended so that the Parliamentary Service Commissioner may advise the Presiding Officers in relation to any of the Values, and the Bill moves the power for the Presiding Officers to make determinations about the Values to proposed section 11A.


The Bill will enable the Commissioner to give advice (but not directions) to the Presiding Officers about employment matters and the Employment Principles. 


Proposed section 11C in the Bill will enable the Presiding Officers to make determinations on employment matters and the Employment Principles. Additionally, section 12 of the Act will be amended to require a Secretary to promote the new Employment Principles (in addition to the Parliamentary Service Values).




2. Code of Conduct



The Bill provides, through amendment of section 13 of the Act, that the first four elements of the Parliamentary Service Code of Conduct will apply where there is a connection with the employee's employment and, for example, will cover behaviour in circumstances such as training away from Canberra.


Subsection 13(11) of the Act will be amended to require employees to behave in a way that upholds the integrity and good reputation of their departments (as well as the Parliamentary Service, to which the current provision only applies), and the proposed Parliamentary Service Employment Principles as well as the Parliamentary Service Values.


Amendments to section 14 of the Act will provide for the Determinations to set out how the Code of Conduct is to be applied to statutory office holders such as the Parliamentary Librarian.


A number of amendments to section 15 will allow action to be taken in relation to Parliamentary Service employees who may have knowingly provided false or misleading information, wilfully failed to disclose relevant information, or otherwise failed to behave honestly and with integrity in connection with their engagement as a Parliamentary Service employee.


The amendments will also enable the procedures for determining whether a Parliamentary Service employee has breached the Code of Conduct to provide separately for different categories of employee, including employees convicted of a criminal offence.


The Bill explicitly provides that a determination of a breach of the Parliamentary Service Code of Conduct may be made after an employee has separated from the Parliamentary Service.


These amendments will require Secretaries to establish procedures for the above and for determining sanctions. Importantly, the procedures must have due regard for procedural fairness. The Presiding Officers' determinations may prescribe limitations on the power of a Secretary to determine sanctions.


Section 20 of the Act will be amended to clarify that Secretaries are not subject to general directions in relation to investigations into Code of Conduct breaches or whistleblower reports (as is already the case in relation to other staffing powers of Secretaries); and state that directions issued under section 20 are legislative instruments (noting, however, that the disallowance and sunsetting provisions of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 do not apply to these instruments).


A new section 48A will enhance the Parliamentary Service Merit Protection Commissioner's functions (the MPC) to allow the MPC to determine, when requested to do so by the relevant Secretary, whether there has been a breach of the Code of Conduct. The consent of the employee concerned is required before the MPC may commence his or her inquiry. The Merit Protection Commissioner would have the discretion to decline such a request and would be required to establish appropriate procedures, which may entail different provisions for different classes of employee, (including employees who have been convicted of criminal offences).


As an important safeguard, the note to proposed section 48A confirms that the MPC's findings under proposed section 48A, are reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. 




3. Whistleblower reports



The bill amends section 16 of the Act to require Secretaries to establish procedures for a Parliamentary Service employee to make a whistleblower report, and to establish procedures for dealing with whistleblower reports.


It also enables the Parliamentary Service Commissioner to inquire into whistleblowers' complaints after notifying the Presiding Officers of a proposed investigation.


Finally, an amendment to subsection 48(2) will extend the MPC's inquiry powers to whistleblowing inquiries.




4. Review of Actions



Subsection 33(4) (d) of the Act will be amended to clarify that reviews of action will be able to be conducted by the MPC personally. This will be in addition to the current arrangements which provide that the MPC must nominate another person or establish a three-member committee to conduct a review.




5. Senior Executive Service (SES)



The role of the SES in subsection 35(2) will be amended to capture better their whole of Parliamentary Service responsibilities. Section 36 which deals with the Commissioner's guidelines on SES matters will be repealed and a new section 11B inserted into the Act to provide that the Commissioner may give advice to the Presiding Officers about employment matters, including those relating to the SES.


Section 37 of the Act, which deals with an incentive for SES retirement, will be clarified so that the retirement of an SES employee under that section is valid even though the employee has not attained the minimum retirement age specified in the Act. Terminology will also be changed to ensure consistency with superannuation legislation.




6. Secretaries 



The description of the roles and responsibilities of Secretaries will be expanded by amending section 57 to better capture the service and performance expected of them. 




7. Confidentiality of Information



The provisions for the use, and confidentiality, of information in the province of the Commissioner and MPC are to be expanded and included in the Act, instead of the Determinations where they are currently located. Section 68 of the Act dealing with the release of personal information will be repealed as it will be covered in these new provisions. 


There will also be a new provision to provide protections for a Secretary or Parliamentary Service employee who provides information to the Commissioner or the MPC in the course of the exercise their review or inquiry functions.




8. Immunity from suit



Provisions for immunity from civil proceedings for both the Commissioner and MPC will be moved from the current location of the Determinations to the Act.




9. Legislative instruments



Several provisions are to be amended to reflect the provision and requirements of the Legislative Instruments Act2003. For instance, the requirement to gazette Classification Rules is replaced; the Rules are to be prescribed to be legislative instruments and a note mentions that the disallowance and sunsetting provisions of the Legislative Instruments Act do not apply. 




10. Miscellaneous amendments





There will also be a range of miscellaneous amendments related to the reduction of classification of employees, the terminology of the provisions for the appointment of departmental secretaries, and empowering the Parliamentary Service and Merit Protection Commissioners to engage consultants.





Subsection 66(4) of the Act will be amended to provide that the amount of payments the Presiding Officers may authorise, in relation to matters arising from Commonwealth employment, is the same as the amount prescribed by the Public Service Regulations. 





And section 71 of the Act will be amended to increase the maximum number of penalty units for offences against the Presiding Officers
'


determinations to be consistent with provisions in the 
Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers,
 published by the Attorney-General
'
s Department.





Amendments not directly related to Public Service Act changes



Other changes are proposed which are not directly related to the Public Service Act changes. These include enabling the Parliamentary Service Commissioner and Merit Protection Commissioner to delegate their powers and functions, enabling the determinations to vary the scope and application of the Values and Employment Principles (eg, to vary the application of merit to enable the direct engagement of people with disabilities in specified circumstances), and revising provisions dealing with acting arrangements for statutory office-holder positions to align them with the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. 




Summary



This Bill ensures that the Parliamentary Service will continue to provide professional support of the highest calibre to all parliamentarians, independent of the executive government of the day. 


In a number of sections, provisions have been strengthened and clarified to ensure that this continues. A number of items have been clarified and, where appropriate, brought into line with the revised Public Service Bill.


All parliamentarians depend on a professional, non-partisan parliamentary service. After more than a decade since the Parliamentary Service was first created, this bill will ensure that the service can continue to provide a high level of support and advice which will ultimately benefit the wider Australian community.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

Senator CASH:
  The coalition finds this motion extraordinary on a number of accounts. Not all states have opted to refer their industrial relations arrangements to the Commonwealth, and for some states there was only a partial referral. In Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, public sector employees are not covered by the Fair Work Act because successive Labor governments did not refer powers to the Commonwealth in respect of public sector employees and local government employees. Clearly, if federal Labor were to support this motion, it would be casting a vote of no confidence in former state Labor governments of New South Wales and Queensland. The then Labor state governments made the decision not to refer powers for public sector employees in those states, and therefore the issues raised in this reference are matters for state governments. The coalition will not support this reference, which seeks to undermine the principles of federalism.

Senators will be aware that no uranium mine has ever gone into production in Western Australia, and on this side of the chamber we plan on keeping it that way.


This is project has been waved through by the state EPA and it is now on Minister Tony Burke's desk. I want to put it, in the strongest terms possible, to Minister Burke to exercise his full obligations under the EPBC Act and to be well aware that Toro is telling investors at various briefings around the place and probably also at the AGM that the federal approvals will be in by the end of this year, no worries; it's all in the bag; no problem; it's going to be a pushover. Minister Burke needs to take this proposal very, very seriously—to stop the clock and make sure that it is not waved through.

The speeches read as follows—



BIOSECURITY BILL 2012


Second reading speech


Australians benefit from Australia's world class biosecurity system, which underpins the comparative advantage of Australia's agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors. 


The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resources Economics and Sciences estimates the value of exported food and fibre commodities at $39.3 billion in 


2011-12. 


These exports underpin an estimated 300 000 jobs in regional Australia. 


But Australia's biosecurity framework is not only about farmers. 


Australia's unique pest and disease status helps to protect our environment, human health, the wellbeing of our domestic animals and our way of life. 


Each and every day, Australian Government biosecurity officers facilitate the movement into and out of Australia of tonnes of goods, thousands of passengers, and many more thousands of parcels and mail items.


Yet the Quarantine Act 1908, from which those officers draw their powers, was designed to suit a vastly different time and operating environment. 


It was a time when every point of entry into the new Dominion of Australia was a seaport. A time when the threat of diseases such as smallpox, plague, cholera and leprosy were at the forefront of policy makers' minds and those of the community. 


The capacity for people and goods to move freely is an essential part of our modern way of life; but presents different biosecurity risks than were ever canvassed in 1908. 


People and cargo move from one side of the world to another within 24 hours, transported in air and sea craft that were unimaginable in 1908. 


Australia's biosecurity system needs to be underpinned by a modern and effective regulatory framework to manage the risk of pests and diseases entering Australian territory and causing harm to animal, plant and human health, the environment and the economy.


Quarantine Act


The century old Quarantine Act has been amended no less than 50 times. Overall, Parliament has helped ensure the legislation underpinning the biosecurity system has kept pace with a changing world. 


But while the legislation has served us well, it has become cumbersome to administer and difficult to interpret.


We see this through:


complex and difficult to administer co-regulatory provisions


considerable gaps in the process for managing biosecurity risks at first ports of entry; and


multiple and overlapping powers to manage goods of biosecurity risk.


A new regulatory framework is now needed. New legislation is needed to provide for a safe and seamless transition of people and goods across Australia's borders.


It also needs to be more responsive to the threat of communicable diseases; while avoiding unnecessary burden on international passengers and trade.


Beale review


Prior to 2008, a spate of serious biosecurity events occurred, including:


the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom


bovine spongiform encephalopathy (or ""mad cow disease"") in Europe, Japan and North America


the emergence of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza


incursions of several exotic pests and diseases in Australia such as the European house borer, sugar cane smut, citrus canker and khapra beetle, and of course


the well remembered 2007 outbreak of equine influenza in Australia which the Government of the day said would never happen.


Against this context, the Government commissioned a review of Australia's quarantine and biosecurity system, forming an independent panel of experts chaired by Mr Roger Beale AO.


The panel's report—One biosecurity: a working partnership (also known as the Beale review)—and the Australian Government's response was released on 18 December 2008.


The panel made 84 recommendations to enhance Australia's biosecurity system; focussing on a partnership approach to managing biosecurity risks and biosecurity decision-making based on risk and evidence.


The Beale review recommended a new Biosecurity Act be developed to replace the Quarantine Act, drawing on a broader set of the Commonwealth's Constitutional powers and providing for modern and effective management of biosecurity risks. This Bill addresses this recommendation and will enact 15 related legislative recommendations of the Beale review. 


Biosecurity Bill


The Biosecurity Bill 2012 will provide us with a modern framework that allows the Australian Government to make biosecurity risk management decisions that are based on science and evidence. It will allow us to protect our unique biosecurity status, our citizens and our industries from pest and disease threats; as we have been since 1908.


Five broad principles underpin the Biosecurity Bill. These are:


managing biosecurity risk


improving productivity


strengthening partnerships


sound administration; and


increasing transparency.


Managing biosecurity risks


Identifying, assessing and managing risk is at the foundation of our biosecurity system. The appropriate management of risk is strongly supported by this new legislation. 


In 2002, the Primary Industries Ministerial Council agreed that the policy framework surrounding ALOP, including its expression as ""very low, but not zero"", and the practical guidelines for risk analysis which illustrate the concept by way of a risk estimation matrix, adequately met Australia's needs. 


This conservative level of protection acknowledges that we have a lot to protect; but that zero risk is not achievable. 


Zero risk would mean no tourists, no immigration, no imports and as a result, no exports. Zero risk is not feasible. 


To provide certainty to administrators, our trading partners and the community, the Biosecurity Bill expresses Australia's Appropriate Level of Protection. 


The Bill includes mechanisms to more clearly identify risks across the biosecurity continuum—offshore, at the border and onshore—and will manage these risks using a broad range of Commonwealth powers.


In relation to risks posed to human health, the Quarantine Act was enacted before the considerations of individual rights and personal freedoms we have today. Within the Bill, the process for managing the threat of a serious communicable disease to human health will be better aligned with modern science relating to treatment and management of such diseases. It will also provide for consideration of personal freedoms and rights to review in human health biosecurity decision-making. 


Improving Productivity


The Bill will help to ensure the regulatory framework is simple, clear and that regulatory burden is commensurate with the level of risk posed by the importer and/or their goods.


Making the regulatory framework easier to engage with will not only help to improve productivity at our ports, it will encourage compliance and therefore drive better biosecurity outcomes. 


The Bill will facilitate modernising overly complex regulatory provisions and administrative practices under the Quarantine Act. Areas of improvement include:


the management options that may be covered by an approved arrangement will be expanded, processes simplified and clarified


the Bill provides that goods become automatically subject to biosecurity control on entering Australian territory; and


the Biosecurity Bill will now cover the field for goods imported into Australia, where additional measures to those established by the Commonwealth will not be able to be applied by states or territories; providing certainty to international trading partners, importers and industry.


These reforms continue to demonstrate the Government's commitment to reducing red-tape whilst ensuring the integrity of Australia's biosecurity system is upheld.


Strengthening partnerships


A central tenet of the Beale review was the need to strengthen the partnership approach to reflect the shared responsibility for biosecurity with stakeholders.


Ultimately, business and industries will be able to take a greater role in managing biosecurity risks—where it is appropriate to do so—with support and regulatory oversight from the Australian Government. In doing so, there will be a more appropriate level or intensity of intervention from the government. 


Such arrangements and partnerships enabled by the new Biosecurity Bill will strengthen the relationship between stakeholders and the government.


The Intergovernmental Agreement on Biosecurity demonstrates the desired outcome of a partnership approach to biosecurity. The agreement signed by the Prime Minister in January 2012, between the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments—except Tasmania—is another key achievement envisaged by Beale. 


The Biosecurity Bill continues this intent through providing expanded onshore powers for the Commonwealth to cooperatively manage and address pest and disease incursions. Provisions such as the ability to issue biosecurity control orders and the establishment of biosecurity zones enhance the powers available to the Commonwealth to address biosecurity risks within or across jurisdictions, in a consistent way. Particularly where state and territory government regulations are not harmonised or are absent. 


Sound administration


As a regulator, there is a requirement and expectation that sound administrative procedures are upheld. This is essential to ensure that stakeholders:


are aware of their responsibilities in managing biosecurity risks


understand the legislative requirements they need to meet; and 


recognise the potential consequences if they are non compliant.


The Biosecurity Bill will also provide the Director of Biosecurity with general administration of the legislation. The Director can offer practical guidance in situations where there are multiple ways to interpret the law or if there is ambiguity. This will help build the community's confidence in the fair administration of the biosecurity system.


The new legislation further provides a modern and graduated compliance regime. This will allow for a proportionate response to a non-compliance incident. The Bill maintains the existence of an infringement notice scheme for high volume, low complexity offences; for example for passengers in airports. 


However, it also introduces an enforceable undertaking scheme and a civil penalty regime as an alternative to criminal penalties. The introduction of a civil penalty regime alternative—in addition to existing criminal offences—provides the greatest opportunity to take compliance action in a graduated and appropriate way, reflecting the significance of the non-compliance and the level of risk posed.


Increased Transparency


A key principle from the Beale review and of government policy is to increase the transparency of the biosecurity system for clients and stakeholders, including trading partners, in the assessment and management of biosecurity risks.


Ensuring that processes and decisions are transparent, open and reviewable where appropriate, provides assurance to clients and stakeholders and demonstrates the integrity of the system; building community confidence.


The Biosecurity Bill will better articulate the role of the Director of Biosecurity and the Minister to improve confidence in scientific and operational decision making processes.


The Bill establishes a process for Biosecurity Import Risk Analyses. The Director will be required to take into account Australia's Appropriate Level of Protection in conducting risk assessments for the importation of goods. 


Science based biosecurity decision making has been the policy of successive Australian Governments.


This continues to demonstrate the focus on biosecurity risk management and supporting scientific and operational decision making, whilst providing appropriate oversight and review mechanisms; in conjunction with the proposed Inspector-General of Biosecurity Bill 2012. 


Conclusion


This Bill is several years in the making. Consultation draft chapters of the Bill have been released progressively since early July 2012 and the Government is grateful for the feedback that has been provided. 


After engaging with industry, state and territory governments, environment groups, health professionals, the general public and our trading partners—the Biosecurity Bill 2012 represents a comprehensive modernisation of Australia's biosecurity legislation. 


The Bill directly addresses the Australian Government's commitment to reform of Australia's biosecurity system. It reaffirms our commitment to the Beale review recommendations to develop new biosecurity legislation. 


Australia's biosecurity system is world-class. 


The Australian Government employs and works with some of Australia's most knowledgeable and experienced plant scientists, veterinarians and medical and clinical experts. 


These people are available to our biosecurity officers to provide current advice and guidance on the risks posed by the movement of people, aircraft, vessels and goods.


This Bill will ensure Australia's biosecurity system can continue to respond to future changes that this changing world presents and the challenges and opportunities that come with those changes. 


 



INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF BIOSECURITY BILL 2012


Second reading speech


Australia's biosecurity system


Australia's biosecurity system ensures good biosecurity outcomes are realised through Australia's activities as an exporter and importer of goods.


Australia's economy and environment benefit significantly from a strong biosecurity system. Australia has enjoyed a high degree of protection from biosecurity risks based on natural advantages of relative geographical isolation, the absence of shared land borders and a border-focused system of biosecurity. 


These advantages have meant that the environment has been free of many pests and diseases common elsewhere and has positioned Australia well to prevent their entry into the ecosystem. The freedom of the agricultural, fisheries and forestry sectors from the most destructive pests and diseases confers a higher degree of quality on Australia's exports.


Australia's biosecurity system has become increasingly complex. With increasing biosecurity risk there is a need to ensure consistent, systematic processes for oversight and continual improvement. The demonstration of integrity in the biosecurity system and review of the quality of processes is vital.


Our system put to the test


In the years preceding 2008, a spate of biosecurity events occurred. This included:


the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom


bovine spongiform encephalopathy—or ""mad cow disease""—in Europe, Japan and North America


the emergence of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza; and


more significantly, Australia's biosecurity system was put to the test in 2007 with the outbreak of equine influenza in Australia.


Against this backdrop:


complexity is constantly increasing in biosecurity risk management as new and different products arrive from a wider variety of countries


clients and stakeholders are continually seeking greater levels of assurance on the effectiveness of Australia's biosecurity system


there is a growing demand from international trading partners to access Australian markets


Australian businesses are seeking access to a greater number of overseas markets


Australian consumers are demanding access to a greater variety of goods; and


tighter timelines in logistics chains is increasing the pressure on border agencies to process goods more rapidly.


Reviews of Australia's biosecurity system


Australia's biosecurity system has been subject to review several times. Recommendations made for improvements to the way it operates started with the Nairn Review in 1995.


In response to the August 2007 outbreak of Equine Influenza in Australia, the 2008 Equine Influenza Inquiry was conducted by the Honourable Ian Callinan AC.


A key recommendation of the inquiry was the establishment of the Inspector-General of Horse Importation. The inquiry reported that regular checking and reporting on the compliance of biosecurity measures needed to be conducted by an individual external to the biosecurity system. 


At the time, this was seen by Callinan as critical in the need for independence, detachment and the restoration of industry and public confidence. 


This was reaffirmed in the 2008 independent review of Australia's quarantine and biosecurity arrangements—One biosecurity: a working partnership—also known as the Beale review. 


The Australian Government commissioned an independent panel of experts chaired by Mr Roger Beale AO to conduct a comprehensive review of Australia's quarantine and biosecurity systems. The Beale review found that Australia's biosecurity system operated well, but could be improved.


It proposed significant reforms to strengthen the system by revising legislative arrangements and improving governance arrangements, transparency, timeliness and operations across the biosecurity continuum. In total, the panel made 84 recommendations.


The Panel considered that independent audit and review provided invaluable assistance in verifying the performance of individual programs and provided an objective overview of the system. It saw the creation of a position to conduct independent audit function, to assess activities along the biosecurity continuum, as critical.


Recommendation 20 of the Beale review sought that a statutory office of the Inspector-General of Biosecurity be established that will audit and report on the performance of the biosecurity system. This Bill directly addresses this recommendation. 


This Bill will also enact two related legislative recommendations of the Beale review.


Inspector-General of Biosecurity Bill


The Inspector-General of Biosecurity Bill 2012 establishes the statutory office of the Inspector-General of Biosecurity. It defines its role, functions and powers. 


The Inspector-General will report directly to the Agriculture Minister. The office is independent from the regulator and the Director of Biosecurity. 


The Inspector-General of Biosecurity will undertake independent audit and review functions focused on biosecurity systems and processes. The office ensures that biosecurity processes are transparent and accountable.


In addition, the statutory position will perform an important role ensuring the integrity and transparency of the Biosecurity Import Risk Analysis process. Stakeholders will have the opportunity to appeal where they believe there was a significant deviation from the Biosecurity Import Risk Analysis process that adversely affects their interests. 


Not only will the Inspector-General ensure transparency and integrity in the biosecurity system more broadly, the Bill also establishes a number of powers to ensure transparency in the way the role is carried out.


Conclusion


The Inspector-General of Biosecurity Bill 2012 is an important legislative reform. Such a position has been recommended in numerous reviews and inquiries over the last 17 years.


The Bill directly addresses the Australian Government's commitment to reform of Australia's biosecurity system. It reaffirms our commitment to the Beale review recommendations to implement a statutory position of the Inspector General of Biosecurity. 


It introduces provisions that enhance the transparency of Australia's biosecurity system. It ensures independent review of the system's processes and activities to provide a high level of assurance to clients and stakeholders.


By having a dedicated office to review the performance of functions and the exercise of powers by the Director of Biosecurity, all Australians can expect an efficient, modern and robust biosecurity framework.


That is what this Bill provides.


Along with the proposed Biosecurity Bill 2012, the two Bills provide a strong and sound new biosecurity regulatory framework. This provides the Australian Government modern and comprehensive legislation to continue to manage the risk of pests and diseases entering Australian territory and causing harm to animal, plant and human health, the environment and the economy.


Australia's biosecurity system is world-class. This new Bill is about modernising our independent review and verification mechanisms of the system and creating a responsive and flexible operating environment to ensure that world-class standing into the future.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
) (17:04):  On behalf of the President and for the information of senators I present the Rules for Media Related Activity in Parliament House and its Precincts which the Speaker and the President have agreed to. 


These rules are the result of a year-long consultation process by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings with representatives of the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery, senators, members, and parliamentary officials. Through written submissions and roundtable discussions, each of these stakeholders has had an opportunity to make their views known. The rules will replace the Guidelines for Filming and Photography and General Media Rules in Parliament House and its Precincts.


The rules are underpinned by four guiding principles, namely: the openness and accessibility of parliament; the facilitation of fair and accurate reporting by the media of parliamentary proceedings; respect for the privacy of members, senators, other building occupants and visitors to Parliament House; and non-interference with the operations of parliament or the ability of members, senators and other building occupants to fulfil their duties.


The rules will clarify for the media, senators and members and their staff, where media activity is permitted, permitted with approval or not permitted in the building and precincts. The rules have, as an appendix, a set of maps which clearly demarcate these areas. 


The rules also allow images and footage of chamber proceedings to be broadcast if used fairly and accurately. However, broadcast or publication of images that have been digitally manipulated is not acceptable.


It will be a condition of access for building occupants that the rules are complied with. Where breaches occur, a graduated range of sanctions may be applied. Administration of the rules will be delegated to the Usher of the Black Rod and the Serjeant-at-Arms.


The Clerks are preparing advice on proposed amendments to the resolutions relating to broadcasting in both the Senate and the House. The changes will take into account technological changes in broadcasting, including the introduction of ParlView. The Speaker and the President will seek advice from senators and members on the resolutions before they are introduced.


The rules will be available on the Australian Parliament House website. They come into effect on 5 February 2013, that is, from the first sitting week of next year. This should give us all time to become more familiar with their operation. I thank the Senate.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:12):  I present the government's response to the 126th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on a treaty tabled on 21 November 2011. I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The document read as follows—





Australian Government response to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report: Report 126: Review of treaty tabled on 21 November 2011: Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement





National Interest Analysis





Recommendation 1





That National Interest Analyses of treaties clearly intended to have an economic impact include an assessment of the economic benefits and costs of the treaty, or, if no assessment of the economic benefit of a treaty has been undertaken, a statement to that effect, along with an explanation as to why it was not necessary or unable to be undertaken.





Agreed. 
The National Interest Analysis process already includes a requirement for a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS). This RIS process requires an impact analysis to be conducted in relation to the costs and benefits to business, the not-for-profit sector and the community arising from any necessary regulatory change as the result of treaty commitments, unless that impact is of a minor or machinery nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. The impact analysis takes the form of an assessment of the costs and benefits of the proposed changes and an assessment of the net impact on the community as a whole.





Recommendation 2





That the Australian Government commissions an independent and transparent assessment of the economic and social benefits and costs of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.





Agreed. While ratification of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) does not necessitate any changes to Australian laws and regulations, in view of the concerns raised by the Committee the Government has commissioned an analysis of the economic and social benefits and costs to Australian business, the not-for-profit sector and the community that would result from the ratification of ACTA. This analysis is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.





Copyright





Recommendation 3





That, in circumstances where a treaty includes the introduction of new criminal penalties, the treaty
'
s National Interest Analysis justify the new penalties.





Agreed.
 National Interest Analyses already typically explain the introduction of new criminal penalties that would be necessary as a result of ratification of a treaty. This issue does not arise in relation to the ratification of ACTA because ACTA does not require any new criminal penalties to be introduced in Australia.





Recommendation 4





That the Australian Government publishes the individual protections that will be read into the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) from the Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement and how the protections will apply in relation to the enforcement provisions contained in ACTA.





Agreed.
 Article 1 of ACTA specifically notes that: 





Nothing in this Agreement shall derogate from any obligation of a Party with respect to any other Party under existing agreements, including the TRIPS Agreement.





The Government confirms, and hereby publishes the fact that all obligations set out in the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (including the individual protections raised by the Committee) would continue to apply in relation to the enforcement provisions contained in ACTA.





Recommendation 5





That the Australian Government clarify and publish the meaning of 
""
aiding and abetting
""
 as it applies to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.





Agreed.
 The Government
'
s position, which is hereby published, is as follows: the term 
""
aiding and abetting
""
 is not defined within ACTA and as such is to be given a meaning in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law, including Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Furthermore, Australia is free to determine how it 
implements Article 23.4 of ACTA within its own legal system and practice. Australian Commonwealth criminal law on aiding and abetting requires intention to aid and abet and provides defences against liability.





Recommendation 6





That the Australian Government clarify and publish the meaning of 
""
commercial scale
""
 as it applies to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.





Agreed.
 The Government
'
s position, which is hereby published, is as follows: article 23 of ACTA sets out a definition as to what constitutes commercial scale. Article 23 states that





For the purposes of this Section, acts carried out on a commercial scale include at least those carried out as commercial activities for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage.





The meaning of commercial scale provided in the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) is consistent with the definition of commercial scale set out in Article 23 of ACTA. Accordingly, the Government confirms that no changes to Australian copyright enforcement settings are required by ACTA.





Intellectual Property





Recommendation 7





In the event that the Australian Government ratifies the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), the Government prepares legislation to:





Exclude patents from the application of the civil enforcement and border measures parts of ACTA;





Agreed in part.
 Australian law complies with Section 2 of Chapter II of ACTA and the Australian Government has no intention to amend the relevant Australian legislation. The Australian Government confirms that the ratification of ACTA would have no impact on Australian law, including the Patents Act 1990 (Cth).





However, as indicated by the footnote to the civil enforcement section of ACTA, a party may exclude patents from the application of that section. In view of concerns raised by the Committee, the Government will lodge a declaration, with any instrument of ratification of ACTA, stating Australia
'
s intention to exclude patents from the scope of Section 2.





Patents are explicitly excluded from the border measure section of ACTA (Section 3 of Chapter II) by the footnote, which provides that: 
'
[t]he parties agree that patents…do not fall within the scope of this section
'
.





Customs officials in Australia do not have the power to seize goods suspected of infringing patents at the border without a court order. Legislative change would be required to introduce such powers.





Ensure that products produced in Australia as a result of the invalidation of a patent or part of a patent in Australia are not subject to the counterfeiting prohibition in ACTA; and





Agreed in principle.
 The counterfeiting prohibition in ACTA applies only to 
'
wilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale
'
 (Article 23.1) (emphasis added). Producing a product in Australia (including a generic medicine) following the invalidation of a patent or part of a patent would not constitute wilful trademark counterfeiting unless a counterfeit trademark was applied to the product.





In view of the concerns raised by the Committee, the Government confirms that there are no criminal provisions for patent infringement under either ACTA or Australian patent law, therefore legislative change is not required.





•Ensure that the expression 
'
counterfeit
'
 in ACTA is not applied to generic medicines entered or eligible for entry on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.





Agreed in principle.
 The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth) includes a definition of counterfeit (s.42E(3)) which states that goods are considered counterfeit if the label or presentation, advertising or documents relating to the goods contain a false representation about various matters including the name, identity, formulation, composition, presence of an ingredient, sponsor, source, manufacturer or place of manufacture. This applies to both branded (originator) and generic medicines without discrimination. In relation to therapeutic goods, the ratification of ACTA would not require changes to either the definition of counterfeiting, or the application of border measures in Australia. On this basis, the 
Government can confirm there would be no impact resulting from the ratification of ACTA on generic medicines included, or eligible for inclusion, in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and therefore no legislation is required.





Conclusion





Recommendation 8





That the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement not be ratified until the:



Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has received and considered the independent and transparent assessment of the economic and social benefits and costs of the Agreement referred to in Recommendation 2;




   Australian Law Reform Commission has reported on its Inquiry into





Copyright and the Digital Economy; and the





Australian Government has issued notices of clarification in relation to the terms of the Agreement as recommended in the other recommendations of this report.





Agreed in part.
 The Government intends to consider ratification of ACTA following the receipt of the analysis recommended at Recommendation 2, but would also consider any further, timely, recommendations of JSCOT as part of that consideration.





ACTA allows considerable flexibility in its implementation. Australia would retain considerable flexibility to modify its laws on copyright while still meeting its obligations under ACTA.





The Government has responded to recommendations for clarification on the application of the terms of the Agreement.





Recommendation 9





In considering its recommendation to ratify the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), a future Joint Standing Committee on Treaties have regard to events related to ACTA in other relevant jurisdictions including the European Union and the United States of America.





Agreed in part.
 In considering whether to ratify ACTA, the Government will make its decision based on an assessment of Australian national 
interests. This assessment would include, among other factors, consideration of events related to ACTA in the European Union, the United States and other relevant jurisdictions.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-11-28,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:13):  by leave—I rise to make some brief remarks about the government's response to the 126th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and move:


The Senate take note of the document.


Senators might be forgiven for not knowing that this report was focused on the ACTA treaty, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. It is one that has been widely discredited so this response by the Australian government to the Treaties Committee's discussion of ACTA is greatly appreciated. This has been described as an extremely lonely bandwagon in that the Australian government has piled onto a bandwagon that nobody else is on. So I have been waiting with some interest to see what the government would make of the Treaties Committee's highly critical report into ACTA. Generally the Treaties Committee, one that I have really enjoyed serving on for the past 4½ years, is pretty diligent in its work but it is rare to see language as strong as this deployed in effective condemnation of an agreement—and this was a unanimous report on ACTA.


The first European Parliament's rapporteur, Kader Arif, resigned in protest when the EU signed ACTA. The European Parliament's chief investigator into ACTA recommended against it and then the European Parliament voted against it. JSCOT produced a very a strongly worded document with a large number of conditions attached to the treaty being ratified by the Australian government. Effectively it was a red light that said not to ratify this thing until you have satisfied these various conditions and until you are in possession of some very specific kinds of information which have not been provided. Yesterday we got a really weak response. The Treaties Committee found and exposed very deep flaws in the national interest analysis and exposed a failure to assess the costs and benefits. We were told it was fine and the national interest analysis already included a requirement for a regulatory impact statement. What the government response reveals to me is that the government has barely even read the Treaties Committee report. While at first blush it looks as though the Australian government has agreed with a great deal of what the Treaties Committee found, when you go into some of the summary text and some of the exposition as to what the government thinks it is agreeing with, it is fairly apparent that the Treaties Committee's report was either not read or if it was read it certainly was not understood.


For example, the response reveals that the government is still not considering the issues raised in the inquiry about the costs. Trade treaties such as this are sold to the Australian public and particular industry sectors as being all benefit with no costs, so we wanted a proper cost-benefit analysis conducted. There are administrative costs, for example, of participating in yet another forum on IP and coordinating that with all the others, including—and here's an acronym sandwich—WIPO, the TRIPS Council, the WCU, the WHO and our trade agreements such as AUSFTA, the unloved free trade agreement and I remind senators of what the Productivity Commission said about these bureaucratic costs. There are real costs of locking us in to a given model in an area that is changing as rapidly as IP. The government have indicated that they are getting some independent analysis, and this is one sound instance where they have listened to the recommendations of the Treaties Committee. I commend the government for that and I thank the minister's office for responding very rapidly to our calls yesterday to find out who is doing the analysis and when it is likely to be produced. I do thank the minister for providing us with the information. It is PricewaterhouseCoopers that they have had working on this for at least two months—and they will table it some time towards the end of the year, says the government's response. I hope that is not on Christmas Eve, along with all the other stuff that tends to get tipped into the public domain while nobody is watching. I think this one is going to be particularly interesting.


I remind PwC and the government that if the review were truly independent we would actually expect them to—and hope that they would—get in touch with stakeholders and experts, starting, for example, with the people who provided evidence to the Treaties Committee. So I look forward to seeing who PwC actually did consult with, to find out who they spoke to, and what kind of modelling they had done and, in particular, what their inputs were when assessing the cost of these agreements. It will not be good enough if they just wave their hands, as the government seems to have done, and say there are never any costs with these kinds of things.


In the absence of some calculation of the costs of the present system, let alone its benefits, there is no real basis for asserting that the system that we have at the moment strikes an appropriate balance of interests or that it should be internationalised. The government has provided some very brief clarifications to some quite complex problems and its response to recommendation 4 is fine but it does not explain why the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights provisions are not in ACTA. The clarification of the term 'aiding and abetting' in recommendation 5 is not helpful. These are clarifications that do not actually clarify. We need examples of the kinds of things that they envisage would be included. So reference to intention is useful, but how do we know whether the intention is an intention to do the act that aids/abets or an intention to participate in IP infringement? These are serious grey areas that the Treaties Committee, acting in good faith, asked the government to clarify. Unfortunately, in the course of clarification the government has done no such thing.


The government responds to recommendation 6, which asks for a clarification about what actually constitutes commercial scale by quoting the treaty back at us. Well, we already have the treaty language. I do not understand how can our laws cover indirect commercial advantage, for example. It is still entirely unclear. Section 132AC talks about substantial prejudicial impact and commercial scale—and the latter remains undefined. Section 132AD talks about 'profit or commercial advantage' without any further definition or clarification. As we know, article 23.1 of ACTA provides a broad definition of 'commercial scale', including at least those carried out as commercial activities 'for direct or indirect commercial or economic advantage'. This definition applies to single acts, and hence operates effectively to remove any requirement of commercial scale in determining that an act is criminal. Under the ACTA definition, for example, forwarding a single email without permission of the copyright owner—the author of the email—in a business context could therefore be construed as being a criminal act. That is the sort of grey area that we are talking about here. It is hard to imagine many businesses that do not engage inadvertently in some criminal copyright infringement on this kind of standard given the broad prevalence of copying—of newspaper articles, of journal articles and of pictures to put in PowerPoint presentations or brochures or whatnot. If that is to be construed as commercial scale—and on a strict reading it could be—we would appreciate clarification from DFAT as to how the definition of 'commercial scale' under ACTA is in line with existing law, given a number of academic submissions to this inquiry disputed that. References to provisions, subsections, explanatory memorandums, anything at all specific would really be helpful.


Overall this response reads as though the government have not changed their views at all. They have simply disregarded the findings of the JSCOT inquiry and are assuming that these issues can be sorted out with the kind of glib and rather dismissive response that we have here. I am alarmed because we have been here before. In 2004, a Senate inquiry found the IP standards adopted under the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement were at a net cost to Australia. We are a net IP importer, not exporter, so the standards that we adopted actually cost Australia. Needless to say, the Senate inquiry strongly condemned the process of negotiations whereby we handed off the advantages we had as to these issues. In 2010, Australia concluded ACTA, reinforcing the same problematic standards that we had an issue with in 2006, and negotiating it in much the same way, marred by allegations of secrecy and lack of protection of the public interest. In 2012, another parliamentary committee has found issue with ACTA, just as with the free trade agreement in 2006—and yet again DFAT has not bothered to address whether our negotiating stance is actually appropriate.


Here we are in 2012, and Australia is negotiating another trade agreement with an IP chapter, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, and again DFAT's negotiating position is to encourage the adoption of standards 'consistent with Australia's own'. We know that the ACTA text is on the table. We know two previous parliamentary committees, and a host of academics, economists and NGOs have issues with those standards. So what independent economic analysis determined that these standards were appropriate? Will the next parliamentary committee find the same issues in the TPP as they have in the free trade agreement and ACTA, and at what point will DFAT actually start listening? There is no real evidence presented in the government's response to the treaty's report that the government is listening just yet.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (17:23):  I present the 125th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly report of the Australian parliamentary delegation in Bern, Switzerland, and bilateral visits to Germany and Austria, which took place from 16 October to 25 October 2011. I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.


Leave granted.




Senator STEPHENS:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I am pleased to present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation which participated in the 125th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly in Bern, Switzerland, and also undertook bilateral visits to Germany and Austria in October 2011. As the report attests, this was another successful and hardworking parliamentary delegation.


At the IPU Assembly, the delegation was an active participant in the proceedings. This report outlines the various presentations and meetings that featured in the delegation's program. Australia's delegations to assemblies of the IPU have established a reputation for making a significant contribution to the Inter-Parliamentary Union through their hard work, often behind the scenes, to facilitate dialogues and broker agreements across a wide range of global issues. The high regard in which Australia is held within the IPU is reflected in the election of Australian representatives to key positions on drafting committees at the assembly in Bern. I was appointed chair of the drafting committee for the emergency resolution on the plight of people of famine-stricken Somalia and relief efforts by IPU member parliaments. Mr Dick Adams was appointed chair of the drafting committee of the Standing Committee on Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade. Both resolutions were adopted unanimously by the assembly. Mr Dick Adams, Mr Patrick Secker, Senator Sue Boyce and I were active representatives of the delegation in the work of the standing committees.


The assembly continued its examination of nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament through a series of panel discussions. Australia's leadership in this area was reflected in the former Speaker, Mr Harry Jenkins MP, who was appointment as chair of a panel session of the Committee on United Nations Affairs on Nuclear Weapons: The Road to Zero. These discussions drew together a number of prominent experts, including Mr Gareth Evans, Co-Chair of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament and former Minister for Foreign Affairs.


The delegation was honoured to meet with United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki-moon. The Secretary-General commended Australia for its support of preventative diplomacy efforts in the Pacific and for the important leadership role Australia continues to play in the region. He also expressed his gratitude to Australia for logistical support during his historic visit to attend the 42nd Pacific Islands Forum in Auckland.


The delegation's visits to Austria and Germany provided excellent opportunities to explore issues around sustainable energy production, nuclear nonproliferation, education and the eurozone crisis. I found the series of meetings on Germany's dynamic approach to renewable energy policy particularly interesting. Many of the issues we discussed around market and system acceptance, land use and the debate around food versus fuel are very familiar to Australian parliamentarians. It was also of benefit to be able to explore the successes and lessons learned from alternate models for encouraging and supporting diversity and innovation across all sectors of the renewable energy industry.


It was also hugely beneficial for the delegation to be able to receive comprehensive briefings from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Organization and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and to discover how highly valued Australia's contribution to the work of these important organisations is. The delegation came away with a clear impression of the importance of continuing to support and strengthen the capacity of such agencies to undertake their roles.


Parliamentary delegations are an important part of building interparliamentary relationships. The delegation was grateful for the opportunity to meet with parliamentary counterparts in the German and Austrian parliaments and to continue the already well-established parliamentary dialogue between our parliaments. The discussions we had were frank and good humoured and provided honest insights into a number of significant issues of common interest.


At the Austrian Parliament, Ms Barbara Prammer, President of the Austrian National Council, generously made time available on the eve of celebrations to mark Austria's National Day. In Germany, Mr Jurgen Herrmann and his colleagues on the Germany-Australia-New Zealand Parliamentary Friendship group were equally generous with their time. The delegation was therefore very saddened to learn of the sudden death of Mr Herrmann in August this year. He was a good friend to Australia with a firm commitment to fostering interparliamentary relations.


I would like to commend the many people who contributed to the success of the delegation's visits. It is important to acknowledge that goes on in facilitating the visits of delegations. I would like to thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for their high level of assistance to the delegation. They provided both advance briefing material and on-the-ground support at the IPU Assembly in Bern and throughout Germany and Austria. Australia's ambassadors to Germany and Austria, Mr Peter Tesch and Mr Michael Potts, and their staff put together outstanding programs and provided practical support to the delegation. I make special mention of Mr Phillip Anderson, the delegation's foreign affairs adviser at the IPU Assembly in Bern, for his advice and professional support throughout the assembly.


I would also like to thank staff of the Parliamentary Library, the parliament's International and Community Relations Office and the Department of the Senate, who provided briefings, advice and assistance with the arrangements for the delegation.


In closing, may I congratulate my fellow delegates for their hard work and good humour throughout this highly successful series of visits. I particularly thank Ms Jeanette Radcliffe, the delegation secretary, for her support. I commend the report to the Senate.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (17:43):  I table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of the bill amend the Banking Act 1959, the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008 and the Life Insurance Act 1995. The changes reduce from seven years to three the period of inactivity before bank accounts and life insurance moneys are treated as unclaimed. Currently, authorised deposit taking institutions are required to transfer accounts to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission where there has not been a deposit or a withdrawal, other than bank fees, for seven years. There is a similar requirement for life insurers except that the seven-year period is from when an amount becomes payable, such as when a policy matures. To help reunite people with their unclaimed money, details of all unclaimed bank accounts and life insurance amounts are published on the ASIC website. People can reclaim these bank accounts and life insurance amounts at any time. However, currently no form of interest is paid when they are reclaimed. Under the amendments the inactive period will be shortened to three years and interest will be paid at a rate equivalent to consumer price index inflation from 1 July 2013. This will ensure that bank accounts and life insurance amounts reclaimed from ASIC maintain their real value—a very important amendment and a very good one for consumers. 


Schedule 4 of this bill amends the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 to change the circumstances in which small lost accounts and accounts of unidentifiable members are required to be transferred to the Commissioner of Taxation and to provide for the payment of CPI interest on unclaimed superannuation money. The first change relates to small lost accounts. The account balance threshold below which lost accounts are required to be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office will be increased from $200 to $2,000 where the account has been inactive for a period of five years or the member is uncontactable. The second change relates to the tiny proportion of superannuation accounts where the member is unidentifiable. These are accounts where the superannuation provider is satisfied that it will never be possible for the provider to pay an amount to the member—for example, where they are missing both the member's name and tax file number. The period of inactivity before which the accounts of unidentifiable members are required to be transferred to the ATO will also be reduced from five years to 12 months. These amounts represent only a tiny proportion of superannuation—in fact, less than 0.1 per cent. 


Individuals can reclaim at any time superannuation accounts transferred to the ATO. However, no form of interest is currently paid when they are reclaimed. Under the new arrangements interest will accrue and be payable from 1 July 2013 on all superannuation accounts reclaimed from the ATO, further boosting an individual's retirement savings—again, a win for consumers. The ATO has a number of strategies in place to help reunite members with lost super accounts to help reduce the number of inactive and unnecessary accounts. ATO programs like SuperSeeker have helped to reunite about 1.9 million lost and unclaimed superannuation accounts worth $3.2 billion—that is $3.2 billion going back to ordinary people for their retirement savings. This was done with their owners during the 12 months to 30 June this year. This was the first time the amount of lost and unclaimed super has declined, after reaching a peak of almost $21 billion at 30 June 2011. By transferring more small lost accounts to the ATO and paying CPI interest, these accounts will not only be properly protected from being eroded from fees and charges but will also maintain their real value over time. 


The Treasury estimates that, under the current rules, a 20-year-old with $1,000 in superannuation can unknowingly have their super savings eroded to just $418 after five years by a range of fees and deductions. Fees and insurance charges typically exceed average investment earnings, even for accounts with $2,000. For example, a 30-year-old with $2,000 can unknowingly have their super savings eroded to just $1,250 over the same five-year period. However, as a result of the new arrangements a 20-year-old with $1,000 currently inactive in super is expected to be able to claim $1,131 from the ATO after five years—a boost to their superannuation savings of around $700 compared with the current arrangements. This is a massive win for consumers and a proper way to deal with people's retirement savings. A 30-year-old with $2,000 is expected to be able to claim $2,263 from the ATO after five years—a boost to their superannuation savings of around $1,000 compared with the current arrangements. 


These are good and sensible changes that help reunite consumers with their lost bank accounts and superannuation accounts. This also maintains the value of those accounts into the future. The new arrangements will also help reduce the number of superannuation accounts that have unidentifiable members by reducing the period of time for which a superannuation fund can hold the account of an unidentifiable member. This will encourage funds to collect sufficient information to identify members during the period when contributions are being made. 


Schedule 5 of this bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to streamline the processes around the administration and distribution of unclaimed moneys and properties under the Corporations Act. 


Currently unclaimed property, including unclaimed money, is handled by the regulator, by ASIC, on behalf of the Commonwealth and deposited into the Companies and Unclaimed Monies Special Account on receipt, CUMSA. Under the amendments, unclaimed property will be recognised directly in the Commonwealth consolidated revenue fund upon receipt by ASIC. Owners of unclaimed property will be able to lodge claims for unclaimed property at any time, the same as with any accounts—so nothing there changes. In addition, owners of unclaimed property will for the first time be paid an interest component equal to CPI inflation for amounts reclaimed after 1 July 2013. 


I can inform the House that the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been advised of these changes to the corporations legislation in accordance with the Corporations Agreement 2002. Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. These are good, sensible changes. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:49):  I move:


That the Basin Plan 2012, made under Part 2 of the Water Act 2007, be disallowed.


I rise today to speak in favour of this motion. It is with a heavy heart that I do, because I would have preferred that we could be celebrating the passage of a plan that would have set the river up for a living future—set the river up over the next 20 years to be a system that is healthy and can sustain itself and, of course, the communities and the ecosystems that rely on it. Unfortunately, the plan as tabled by the minister earlier this week does not do this. I know the minister talks about the fact that it does, but when you look at these things the devil is always in the detail, and the devil in the detail in this plan is that we do not have the water being returned that the best available science says we need if we are to set the river up and give it a fighting chance. This plan is meant to be the blueprint for how the river system will be managed for the next 20 years, yet this plan does not even include the impacts of climate change or how to deal with the system in an increasingly drying environment.


We know that the coalition and the government have agreed to endorse this plan and pass it through this place today. This plan has had the support of the coalition to pass through this place, because it is not a plan that will save the river; it is a plan that appeases those who did not want to give back as much water as they have been greedily taking. It is not a plan that is set up to support the long-term interests of the environment. It is a plan not based on the best available science. It tries to balance interests rather than the long-term health and resilience of the basin overall.


This process has been all political, not scientific; and, unfortunately, that is backed up by the very fact that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has not even done the modelling for its long-term forecast of the impact that this plan is going to have. The modelling that has been done has been limited and has no comparison. There is no modelling of the impact of the massive increase in groundwater extraction, which is allowed for under this plan. I know the coalition have now decided they do not like figures; that was Tony Burke, the minister, 12 months ago. The coalition have now adopted this and do not want to talk about the figures. Unfortunately, the figures do not add up to the rhetoric of the outcomes that this plan is meant to achieve.


The whole point of this plan is to set the river up for a healthy future, to get back the water that has been overallocated for generations. I stand here as a representative of my home state of South Australia. We know that, when there is less water in the system, when the drought years come, it is South Australia at the end of the system that always cops it the hardest. That is because we are at the end of the river. When there is less runoff, when there is less water in the system, the upstream states continue to take, take, take and leave basically nothing for South Australia down the end. That means, of course, that our precious environment—our Coorong, the Storm Boy country, our Lower Lakes—and the irrigators in the Riverland have to scrape by with the little amount of water that is left.


Let's not forget that South Australia takes only seven per cent of the overall water within the basin. When the drought is on, it is even less. During the millennium drought, which South Australians remember wholeheartedly and which was not that long ago, we were not even getting that seven per cent flowing across the border. We had far less than that.


As I have said, this plan as tabled today and debated this afternoon is, unfortunately, not the plan that will save the Murray-Darling Basin system. It will not give river communities, particularly in South Australia, security into the future, because it is not based on what we need to do in order to save the system. A friend of mine put it to me like this: if you have any infection and you are seriously sick and you are prescribed by the doctor a course of antibiotics yet are only given a few of those antibiotic tablets and not the whole packet, you are not going to knock that bug off. Everyone knows you need to take the entire course to get your health back on track. That is how antibiotics work. In this instance we have the minister and many others acknowledging that this system is not healthy and that we have to build resilience back into the system because it has been so crippled after decades of overallocation. We really need to realign what the environment is entitled to to keep itself going, to give itself some resilience, to keep the ecosystems alive, particularly in those harsher and drier years. And yet we are not giving the river and the environment the opportunity to do that, because we are not prepared to give it its full course of antibiotics. We are not allowing it even the best fighting chance to get its health back on track.


The best available science says we need 4,000 gigalitres. We have not been given that under this plan. We then saw modelling released by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and backed up by Minister Burke. He flew with the Prime Minister all the way down to the Murray mouth in South Australia and said, 'Hey presto, we know now that 3,200 gigalitres will be somewhat what the river needs if we are even to try to give it a sense of being able to get healthy again and to keep it healthy.' The Greens would have been more than happy and supportive of working with the government to guarantee that minimum amount of 3,200 gigalitres, which would have kept our river red gums alive; which would have flushed out that two million tonnes of salt each year to keep the water healthy and to ensure that the water quality is good enough for domestic use, for stock use, for Adelaide to keep drinking from; which would have ensured that we could protect the iconic Coorong and Lower Lakes. But this is where the devil is in the detail. This plan does not even give us that minimum amount of 3,200 gigalitres, and that is of course why people like Senator Barnaby Joyce, who is sitting in here this afternoon, are I am sure going to stand up and tell people all about how they got a good deal for their constituents and the irrigators upstream—because they have. This plan is for the irrigators. This plan is not about protecting the environment. There are no guarantees in this plan for the water the river needs, particularly to keep South Australia going when the dry years hit. That is not the water that is guaranteed under this plan. When you add in the massive extractions of groundwater—1,700 gigalitres—that has a big impact on how much water is genuinely being returned to the river system.


The coalition do not want to talk about figures. Barnaby Joyce does not want to talk about figures.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Please refer to members by their correct titles.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I apologise. The coalition senators in this place do not want to focus on the figures, and neither does the minister. It is because they do not add up. This plan is a plan to deliver less water for the environment than science says is needed. It is delivering less water for the environment than even the environment minister says is needed if we are to give the river any chance of survival.


We know that $11 billion is going to be spent on this plan, and that is why we must get it right. The motion today is about sending the plan back to the minister and saying, 'We need to get this right because, if we're going to spend $11 billion dollars, we'd better make sure it will return the amount of water to the river that will give the environment a fighting chance, that will ensure we can maintain our majestic river red gums, that will ensure we can give Adelaide healthy drinking water, that will ensure our Coorong can survive the next drought.' $11 billion—what an opportunity to implement true reform. What a fantastic challenge that we all have in this place to make sure that we can overcome the mistakes of generations past when the river was compromised over and over again for vested interests. This plan was an opportunity to get this right, but unfortunately what is before us today is not that. It is a plan that cuts the environment short and appeases those who are upstream and who never wanted this process in the first place. Senator Barnaby Joyce is going to stand up here at any moment and say: 'This is the best deal irrigators were ever going to get.' It is a bonanza for upstream irrigators because they are about to pocket $11 billion and they do not even have to give back to the river or to South Australia the water that the river really needs. The $11 billion should be setting us up for a healthy future. 


The plan is a blueprint for how this system will be managed over the next 20 years, and what is on the table today locks in failure. It spends $11 billion of taxpayers' money and locks in failure. It will cost $11 billion and only achieve 57 per cent of the key targets that the plan says and the Water Act requires the plan to achieve. This is $11 billion, yet we are only going to get half of what we are meant to. We know what that means for South Australia: it means big losses in years to come because this plan does not even take into consideration climate change. It does not take into consideration the long-term effects of increased groundwater extraction. It is not a plan that has been written for the drought years—and the minister has said this himself. This plan is based on average flows. We know that when there are less than average flows things really start to bite for the environment; it is when things really start to bite for my home state of South Australia, which is located at the bottom of the system. 


The Greens have moved a motion to send this plan back to the minister so that we can get it right. The minister said himself that we need 3,200 gigalitres, yet that is not what is in this plan. So let us put that in. Let us make sure that we have a minimum of 3,200 gigalitres. If that is what science says is needed, if that is what the minister believes is needed and if that is what Jay Weatherill, the Premier of South Australia, says is needed, let us do it. The Greens would be more than willing and happy to deliver a minimum of 3,200 gigalitres, because that is what even the minister says is required. But, unfortunately, that is not what is in this plan. This plan has 2,750 gigalitres. It fails half of the key environmental targets that it needs to keep the river system alive. On the table today is $11 billion, only half the job done and locked in failure for the next 20 years. 


Unfortunately, it seems as though we lost the courage to manage this process when the sky opened, the rains started coming and the millennium drought broke two years ago. Two years ago, people were crying out for proper reform. Let us never go back to a situation where there were kilometres and kilometres of dry river bed, where the water was so high in saline content that it was too salty to even irrigate pasture, let alone to feed stock or to use in the houses of those communities who rely on it. Two years ago, before the millennium drought broke, people wanted urgent action and proper national reform, and they wanted a system that was fair—a system that would manage the water in the basin fairly. That courage seems to be all but forgotten today, because what we have in front of us is not a courageous plan. It is an appeasement on the part of the Labor Party to those upstream and to the coalition to allow them to continue their business as usual. There is talk of an extra 450 gigalitres that maybe some day, if they could—ooh, let's see—be added on by 2024. There are no guarantees about that. It is not in the plan; it is not locked in. The legislation before the other place does not say that it has to be delivered, even though $1.7 billion will be spent long before any water is seen. 


The courage to actually do the right thing by the environment and to stop compromising the very real needs of the river have been all but forgotten by this minister, who is desperate to cut a deal with the coalition and to appease those upstream. Let us not forget that Senator Barnaby Joyce, at the height of the millennium drought, said to South Australians when they could not even drink the water in the Murray because it was so salty, when they could not even get their pumps and their pipes past the kilometres and kilometres of mud: 'Chin up. Move upstream if you don't like it.' That is what Barnaby Joyce thinks about South Australia's predicament when there is less water in the system. That is what Senator Barnaby Joyce thinks about South Australia's opportunity for a fair go when it comes to sharing the waters of the rivers.


The Greens will continue to work to get locked in that minimum of 3,200 gigalitres. I stand here today urging the government to do the right thing, to find the courage to fix this. You do not have to cuddle up to Tony Abbott and Senator Joyce just to get this passed.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am sorry, but once again, Senator Hanson-Young, please use the correct titles of the members. You mentioned the Leader of the Opposition and did not use his honorific.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I guess it depends on your definition. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, you refer to members of the House of Representatives as Mr or Ms et cetera. 




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  The government do not have to be cuddling up to Mr Abbott and Senator Joyce just to appease the upstream states. If they are truly into reforming the system—saving our river and doing what is right by the environment, setting us up for a future we can rely on for the next 20 years—then they should be putting in place a plan that will save the river for the future, based on the best available science, backed up by the modelling, including the realistic impacts of climate change, not carrying on with the Nationals' approach of head in the sand and ignore, ignore, ignore, that everything will be all right, somebody else will look after it. That is the response of the Nationals to anything in relation to the environment in years to come. It is unfortunate because they are cutting their own communities short by doing it.


What an opportunity to get reform right is $11 billion to ensure that we start rebalancing and paying back to the river the water that has been ripped away from it for so long. As I said at the outset, I stand here with a heavy heart that we have not been able to convince the government to do the right thing by the river, the right thing for South Australia and to stand by their commitment to proper reform. What is in this plan is a dud. It does not protect the river system for the future, it does not set us up for resilience and it is going to waste $11 billion in the meantime. It needs to go back and it needs to be fixed. The Greens will continue to fight for that to happen.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (18:10):  The government does not support this disallowance motion and expresses its deep disappointment that the Greens are engaging in a deliberate strategy to delay the achievement of what is a significant environmental reform for this critical riparian system. 


On Monday the Water Act Basin Plan 2012 was tabled in the Senate. This instrument brings into effect the Murray-Darling Basin Plan announced by Minister Burke last week. The plan brings to an end 100 years of disagreement. The plan restores our rivers to health, supports strong regional communities and sustains food production. The plan implements the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's recommendation to return 2,750 gigalitres of surface water to the environment. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority has consulted widely in the development of the plan. The government is acutely aware of the range of views expressed in those consultations. As was said in the Senate last week, the foundation for this reform is unequivocally and unapologetically to restore the river system to health. The plan takes the pathway that is most sensitive to basin communities.


The biggest risk to this historic plan is the disallowance of the plan in either chamber of the parliament. All Australians concerned about the health of this great river system and the wellbeing of basin communities need to promote to their representatives the importance of supporting this plan. The river system cannot survive any further delay. As senators know, the plan is already law unless of course the disallowance motion is successful here and now. Senators need to be aware that, if this plan is disallowed, the future of the Murray-Darling Basin will continue to stagnate and deteriorate. Redrafting the plan would take years. The processes under the Water Act 2007 would require a new public comment period, two rounds of ministerial consultation and the authority's consideration of the minister's suggestions. Even if the plan was not changed, it could not be reintroduced as a disallowable instrument for another six months.


The Murray-Darling Basin is too important to be used as a platform for political posturing. The Greens party does not have a commitment to sustainability. It is a party that is only committed to conservation at any price. The Greens judge success on what they stop, not on what they protect. They had a chance to support an emissions-trading scheme to address climate change three years ago but urged against it. They just want coalmining to stop. The question is: what will the Greens allow? They do not consider the economic or social implications at all. They do not take a triple bottom line approach. They just have a single bottom line. If there is an environmental impact, it is bad. To paraphrase former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, they represent the impotence of purity.


The Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been crafted by expert advice and years of consultation. The Greens party need to comprehend that they live in a pluralistic democracy. If you have the option where everyone's interests can be considered and not just simply your own, that is in fact a virtuous thing.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:13):  Isn't it amazing the sort of empathy you get from someone whose office is at level 7, 147 Pirie Street, when they want to talk about the basin. If you have so much empathy for the basin, Senator Hanson-Young, here is my suggestion: get your office and move there. Show a real desire to actually put your actions and your reality on the same page, because you have not done it. And that is what is so frustrating: when we are in the basin and we have the profits, you ride in from somewhere else to shut down our communities.


At level 7, 147 Pirie Street you cannot see Dirranbandi—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Order! Senator Joyce, you should address your remarks through the chair, not to individual senators.




Senator JOYCE:
  Certainly, Madam Acting Deputy President. At level 7, 147 Pirie Street, it is rather hard to understand what happens at Dirranbandi when the town shuts down. It is rather difficult to understand how you go to the people of Collarenebri and leave them in destitution. It is rather difficult to understand and comprehend what happens at Coleambally.


No, at level 7, 147 Pirie Street, you can say some wonderful things and make some marvellous gestures—the faux empathy, the grimace and the emotive pause—but they are not fair dinkum. It just goes to show you how absolutely lacking real empathy is, because people who believe in things actually go and place themselves exactly where those things are.


I have lived, and have always lived, in the basin—we live with the people. There is this assertion that it is all about—as Senator Hanson-Young said before—multibillion-dollar irrigators. I will tell you about the houses where some of these multibillion-dollar irrigators live. If you go to the town of Dirranbandi you can pick up a house for 50 grand, hardly the sort of opulence that I think you could understand at level 7, 147 Pirie Street.


We have heard that, of course, it is about the community. What community? If you are going to look after the community come and live in the communities. Come and think that there is more to this: it is about, and has always been about, a triple bottom line—an environmental outcome, which the coalition put the money on the table for. But there is also the social outcome and there is also the economic outcome, and that goes beyond, as has rightly been said, just a play by the Greens to divide and destroy, and to talk in these riddles that they never, ever have to deliver on. They never, ever have to live with the consequences of their decisions.


We have worked with the government because we understand exactly how incredibly important this is. It would have been absolutely incredibly easy to mount a demonstration—gosh knows, I have done them before—up and down through the basin. It would have been easy. The trouble is that it would also have been pyrrhic because it will not actually have brought a result.


And I apologise for wanting to look after people. I apologise for wanting to put people on the same level as frogs and newts and swamps. I apologise that when you walk into a town people actually talk about their futures. I am sorry that I do not have the Green ethos where we can just flush them all down the toilet. I am sorry that I do not have that! I have never actually managed to be able to do that.


And the talk in all those metaphors—'greedily taking'! Who is 'greedily taking'? The paper shop in Moree? Are they 'greedy takers'? Or maybe it is the person who is a teacher in Goondiwindi? Are they another 'greedy taker'? Or maybe it is the person who is trying to start a motel in Forbes—are they another 'greedy taker'? Is that who these people are? The 2.2 million people who live in the basin, are they just all greedy? They are all greedy because they want a future!


We talk about wanting to be the food bowl of South-East Asia. Well, the first thing we actually have to be is the food bowl of Australia. That is a good start. But there is this sort of nihilist philosophy that the Greens revel in; this nihilist idealism where success is destruction, where success is Smithton in Northern Tasmania, with 30 per cent unemployment. And the Greens are cock-a-hoop—they have kicked a goal. They have kicked a goal when people are poor and they can revel in the benefaction of the welfare state. They are from a community that is completely removed from the disaster that they cast on the people around them. And that is supposed to be some sort of beneficial outcome.


The coalition has worked with the Labor Party. We have worked not just at a federal level but at a state level over a long period of time, and we have tried our very best. To be honest, we have stayed out of the media, we have trusted one another and we have worked for an outcome because we know that the ramifications for the people who we represent of not coming to that outcome would be disastrous. They would then be at the behest of the whims of the Greens, represented by Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who said at the start that she wanted 7,600 gigalitres to be taken from the basin. That was her kick-off point—7,600 gigalitres—which would absolutely and utterly send people up and down the river destitute, and their final cause—the issue du jour—to return us all to eating beetles and nuts on the forest floor would be one step closer.


I can assure you that there are people who are not happy with this plan in towns. I can assure you that we are quelling resentments as they ring up our offices, saying, 'We feel uncertain. We are unsure. We are taking you, the Australian government and the responsible parties'— who actually have to live by the decision and even though they have had their differences—'in this chamber on trust'. We are responsible for it. They are taking us on this incredible thing called trust. They are trusting us not to be perverse in the outcomes that we bring into their lives. Gosh knows, that is what we hope to do.


The reality is that whether it is the coalition or the Labor Party we have to live with the decisions as well. It actually has to go beyond the spruiking; you actually have to pay for them. You have to live with them, you have to deliver them and you have to go back to the people and be responsible for them. It is all very well to be the marginal party with the nihilist ideals that appeases a constituency with the sweat, the blood and the reality that someone else has to live with.


They want 3,200. By the end of this, through the course of state actions and the Living Murray agreement, there will be more than 3,200. There will be 3,700. There has already been 950 delivered. We have got 2,750 here. We will have 3,700 gigalitres that, over the course of a range of programs, will have been delivered back to the river. There is still the capacity for a five per cent movement of total extractions, a capacity of 710, that is still there. We are still in the process, within that upside, of allowing extra money to go towards 450 gigs of that five per cent limit. There has been an immense amount of movement. 


All that this is really about is that the Greens have said, 'The Labor Party are there and the coalition are there, so we'll sit over here and throw rocks.' That is their process. Senator Hanson-Young has had a range of numbers. She started with 7,600, then it was 4,000, now it is 3,200—and then she accuses us about numbers. We have got a number: 2,750. It is there—2,750, with the potential of five per cent up or five per cent down, and with 450 gigs going towards the upside to actually finance it.


The other issue that has to be dealt with from the person from level 7, 147 Pirie Street, Adelaide—Senator Sarah Hanson-Young—is about when the drought was on. The millennium drought did not just happen in Adelaide or the Lower Lakes, it happened across the whole basin. The reason there was no water at the lower end of the system is because there was no water at the upper end of the system. I can prove that because people in my area went broke—that is, the banks came in and kicked them off their place. I am not going to name those people here but I could go through quite a list of them. They went through humiliation for trying to do something for this nation. They did what this nation asked of them: they went west, they scratched out a living in the dirt, they borrowed in some instances tens of millions of dollars, it did not rain because the drought happened and they went broke. They are now live with the humiliation of not having a house, of living with sons and daughters. What does Senator Sarah Hanson-Young call them? Greedy. They are greedy people. Greedy for trying to do the right thing by our country; terrible, shocking people trying to feed people, trying to clothe people, going without, going through the privations of trying to start a business. And what do they get accosted with? They are greedy. A nation of people who—if that is what they call them—are greedy like that, who make the sacrifice for our nation, will make our nation a great place and will actually build our nation.


It is such an absolute insult from someone who, good luck to them, lives with the benefaction of the taxpayers' dollar in the job we have here, in an office in the middle of a town, where the closest they will ever get to the basin on a day-to-day basis is when they turn on the tap—possibly. That is about as close as they get. For them it is a philosophy, it is an ideal, it is over the hill—but it makes sense when you get down to the manic monkey cafe to bang on about this. If you can just create a bit of resentment, create a bit of hate, create a bit of division and then build on that, you can be the real destroyer, the total nihilist for which, if our nation followed that path, it would be completely and utterly led to a social and economic oblivion.


We are working to try to come to a resolution because it is the responsible thing to do. And it is an absurdity to think that there has not been a movement that hurts us in what we do. I will explain to you some of the hurt that we have had so far. When they purchased the water from Twynam's, from John Kahlbetzer, they basically made the town of Collarenebri defunct. It has no water licence. There is no reason for there to be a cotton gin anymore. What do we say to those people? What is Senator Sarah Hanson-Young's message to those people? What is it? Can they move down to level 7, 147 Pirie Street and get a job? Maybe we can send the whole town down there.


We have got to realise that when the drought was on it was not just a drought for one corner of the basin, it was a drought for the whole basin. It was privation for the whole basin. I know that because I live there. My office is there. My office is on the river. My business is on the river. My property is in the basin. Our family are not irrigators. In fact, we are below irrigators, but we acknowledge that that is part of the economy because above us is a town called Cunnamulla and they have got a little bit of irrigation. Good luck to the people of Cunnamulla—they have a bit of irrigation so the standard of living has slowly advanced.


This is what terrible people we are in my own town of St George. In the town of St George, with about 4,000 people, agricultural output on a yearly basis is between three-quarters of a billion and a billion dollars every year that they put towards our nation—these terrible greedy people. Year in, year out, they are putting it towards our nation. It is actually how we make money. These people make money and then they pay taxes, and they go without and they live out in the sticks, and with their taxes they pay for a whole range of things that this nation needs. One is level 7, 147 Pirie Street—that is one of the things they pay for. What they get for that is the prophet from over the horizon preaching to them about how evil they are, how greedy they are.


The approach of the Greens, after the nihilist destruction, is now to destroy the plan. It is their form of 'burn the plan'. It is their little day of destroying things: come out, wreck the joint. I suppose then we can all cop it. As they say, we will 'just have to cop it'. And we have ridiculous things like the metaphor they draw: 'We have to take our full course of antibiotics.' As prescribed by who? As prescribed for what purpose?




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Science.




Senator JOYCE:
  The full course of antibiotics from these people? Not one of them is prepared to live in the area they are talking about. What total and utter hypocrites. With their ideas, not only would we have social and economic destruction but also in some areas a complete compromise of the economic infrastructure—of bridges, of roads, of easements. In some areas it is not even possible to move the water that they require. It just does not have that capacity because of natural choke points, or choke points put in by man such as those other terrible things of civilisation, bridges—we cannot have bridges anymore. 


And what is the final goal? What do they want? Why don't we just remove every piece of infrastructure? This is the peculiar thing: the water that is going to provide the environmental outcome in many instances is going to come from man-made structures and, if those man-made structures were not there, wouldn't it be hard to deliver the water? If we deliver water in a drought, the water will probably come from man-made structures—those evil man-made structures. They will be delivering the water in order to deliver an environmental outcome. Surely a purist could not possibly take water from those man-made structures that are actually going to have the capacity to deliver an outcome that sustains the environment! 


People who live in the basin, and that goes beyond people who are irrigators—the townspeople, the people who live in the weatherboard and iron, the brick and tile, who put their rubbish out on a Monday or Tuesday night, who live in streets like mine—are put at risk because of a nihilist philosophy that wants no more than to destroy things, and then has the hide, basically, to not have to live with their decisions. They foist on other people their philosophy and outcomes. They are not prepared to pay the price, but they are prepared to take the cheque. They are prepared to live by the benefaction of a taxpayer's dollar whilst they destroy the economy that actually provides it.


It would be interesting to know exactly what their purpose is. Maybe the real frustration about this is that through the Christmas period—because this issue after many years of work is coming to a conclusion—one of those final things that the Greens are out there to destroy will not be there. They will have to find some other thing to destroy. They have destroyed the timber industry, they have destroyed the fishing industry, and they want to destroy the irrigation industry. They want to destroy our capacity to feed ourselves, and with their ideas surrounding the excesses of the carbon tax, maybe they just want to destroy the economy, full stop. They are running out of things to destroy. What other things can they get rid of? What is the next stage of nihilism for them? When will we hear that they are actually trying to create something that is a reasonable expression of something with a sustainable economic base? Do we just have to put up with the position that every time Senator Sarah Hanson-Young turns up it is about something that people in the Murray-Darling Basin live in fear and trepidation of? They know that the only utterances that will come from the Australian Greens are ones that are going to make their lives—the lives of people whose socio-economic condition is vastly inferior to that of so many people in capital cities—more difficult, and that the delivery of the Greens will take them from poor to destitute.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-11-28,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:33):  I rise tonight to support my colleague's move to try to secure an improvement in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. People listening might be excused for thinking, after the contribution we have just heard from Senator Joyce, that the Senate was engaged in street theatre. I think that people in the National Party would be quite disappointed to think that in an opportunity to debate the merits or otherwise of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, all we had was a rant and an attack and no real engagement with the merits or otherwise of the plan.


Contrary to the view that somehow the Greens do not have to live with the decisions that we make, it is in fact because we have to live with the decisions that this parliament makes that we think very carefully about the positions we take and the consequences of those decisions for everyone who comes after us, and not just this generation but future generations. 


I go to the first point: why are we having a Murray-Darling Basin Plan? It is an attempt to save the river. Australians love the Murray-Darling. They love the river system and they have been distraught in recent years to see that the mouth of the Murray is not open and that there are high levels of salinity in the Lower Lakes. Right down the river system communities have been under enormous pressure as a result of the river failing. It has been failing because of the drought, and the drought occurred in part because of climate change. 


And we now have a Leader of the National Party who is refusing to acknowledge that climate change is real and urgent. We are seeing reports coming out daily that it is far worse than anyone anticipated and now we have a Murray-Darling Basin Plan which fails to take account in any shape or form of the climate predictions that we are going to live with in Australia. How can you save a river system if you do not anticipate the changes in the climate and the impacts of those changes on the river system? How can you genuinely say that you are interested in the livelihood or wellbeing of people who live in a river basin if you are not taking into account the health of the river that will sustain them into the future? That is the point here.


The figure of 7,600 gigalitres came from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and from the Wentworth Group. Both of them came out and said that if you want to restore the river to its optimum level of health, that is the amount of water that needs to be in the river system. It was not some extreme group of people who said that; it was the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the Wentworth Group. They actually take a science based approach. That is something the National Party does not take. Senator Joyce has made it quite clear that he does not believe in climate change and he does not believe in carbon pricing to reduce emissions. He obviously does not think it is appropriate that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan anticipates the needs of the river in a climate scenario. The amount of water that this plan has in it—2,750 gigalitres—is actually only for so-called average years. It does not take into account the needs of the river system in anything other than average years. I suggest that there is no such thing as average years any more in a world that is rapidly responding and having to adapt to the climate crisis.


Senator Feeney would suggest that the Greens are politically posturing. His extraordinary example of that is that the Greens voted against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Indeed, we did. We did it because we knew we would have to live with the consequences. If it had gone through and Senator Feeney had his wish, Australia would now have a five per cent reduction target and the carbon price in Australia would be $1.25, the equivalent of one euro, with no institutional capacity to change the target. What a complete nonsense that would be. We would have no Clean Energy Finance Corporation, no Renewable Energy Agency, no Biodiversity Fund, no Carbon Farming Initiative and so on and so forth. I think Senator Feeney should reflect on the fact that all he is doing is highlighting the complete embarrassment that this country would have had for carbon pricing if the stupidity that was engaged in at that time had been allowed to stand. Equally, in relation to living with the decisions you make—and I draw this to the attention of both Senators Feeney and Joyce—there are the decisions you made on asylum seekers as well. You raced in here and lectured the Greens about standing here saying, 'We can't compromise on fundamentals. We actually have to look at what might really save lives.' Now we are living with the consequences of that stupidity.


I come back to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in terms of living with the consequences. What is the point of spending $11 billion if you fail to save the river; if you fail to put enough water back into the river to maintain the ecosystem? Four thousand gigalitres has been mentioned because that is what the Wentworth Group said was the absolute minimum that would be needed to give the river system a chance. The Greens asked the minister to model that 4,000 gigalitres, and that ought to have been done in the interests of science, but the minister did not do it. Now we have 2,750 gigalitres and a promise of 450 gigalitres. Much has been said about 3,200 gigalitres. It is a wish and a promise at this stage. There is no promise that there will be a minimum of 3,200 gigalitres. In fact, that could well end up being a maximum that is never achieved.


This is not evidence based policy. This is policy where you have brought in a political fix. The reason I say that is that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan does not come into effect until 2019. The money flows but the water does not get restored to the river system until 2019, by which time Minister Burke, Senator Joyce and Senator Feeney will be long gone from here and will not be living with the consequences of their actions. The money will be spent but I can assure you that the senators who are here in 2019 will be trying to fix the plan that has failed because the consequences of climate change will be something they are living with. You can rest assured that there will not be average years between now and 2019. There will be another drought—there always is in Australia—and it will be more extreme than previous droughts because of the intensity factor of climate change.


Senators will be in here saying: 'How is it possible that $11 billion was spent but the river was not saved?' The excuse will be then, as it always is: 'If only we had known in 2012 what we know now, we would never have agreed to a plan that did not provide for restoring the river.' Every single one of us in here knows right now that this is inadequate in terms of the science. It is not science and evidence based policy; it is a policy which says that this is the political fix that will deliver the money in the short term and by the time the river actually gets to have the water everyone will be long gone and it will be revisited.


Minister Burke knows as well as I do that the 450 extra gigalitres will not be there until 2024. Senator Feeney was saying: 'We cannot delay this any longer. Who would want to delay the water coming into the system?' Well it is not coming into the system until 2019 initially and the extra 450 gigalitres, if indeed that 450 gigalitres gets into the system, will not be until 2024. So, yes, we do have time to get this right. We should be getting it right now. I really think it shows that neither the coalition nor the government believes that climate change is real or urgent if they can all laud a plan which delivers to the river far less than the scientists say is the minimum that is necessary and you are prepared to tick off on a plan which does not anticipate or take into account climate ramifications in Australia.


You think you are doing the people who live in the river system a favour by ticking off such a plan, but you are not. All you are doing is condemning them to an extremely uncertain future because, as much as they would like to think if we spend this $11 billion now their future is assured, it is not assured, because you cannot have an economy without a healthy environment to underpin it.


Without the environment there is no economy, and it is no more so than with a river system. That is why we need to get this right from the start. That is why we need an absolute minimum of what the science says is necessary to give the river a fighting chance—and with the river having a fighting chance come the communities who live along that river system. That is why we need to stop this in its tracks and improve the plan so that we get an evidence based outcome, rather than have the government and the coalition browning down the plan and abandoning the science in favour of a political fix.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-11-28,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:45):  I am not lauding the Basin Plan 2012 as I have reservations about it but the alternative concerns me. I want to make it clear that I do not consider for one moment that the Greens are engaging in an act of political posturing in relation to this. I have worked closely with my colleague Senator Hanson-Young from the Australian Greens to seek the best outcome for the environment and to seek the best outcome for South Australia, which has the unenviable position of being at the bottom of the river system. So, while I understand the intent of this motion, I am concerned that it is a risky path to take.


I understand that this plan is far from perfect. I understand that this plan has many flaws in it. There has finally been a rigorous process with a number of inquiries—Senate inquiries and House of Representatives inquiries—and there has been the whole process around the guide to the Basin Plan, which was a bit of a farce. Finally, when the draft plan was released, there was a more thorough process of consultation. So as imperfect as this plan is, my concern is simply this: what happens if this plan is disallowed and if the version that comes back is worse than the one that we have now? What happens if we have a change of policy or if we have a change of government and whichever government is in power wants to start the process from square one? We could well be in our next drought by then. There is a real concern amongst the communities I speak to—amongst those who have a genuine concern for ensuring the production capacity of land for our food security and those who have a genuine concern for the environment—that we could potentially be in a worse position.


I believe the Basin Plan will make a difference to the environment in terms of what the government is proposing  with the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012, and I note recent comments of the environment minister, the Hon. Tony Burke, where he has said that we need to address the issue of a flaw in that bill which referred to up to another 440 gigalitres being put into the environment to make it much clearer that that is the mandated amount that we need to go for. So that gives me some comfort.


I understand the concerns of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists. They have added to this debate invaluably. People such as Peter Cosier, Tim Stubbs and others in that group have the highest integrity and I 'get' their concerns and I have pursued their concerns in relation to the issue of the interaction between groundwater and surface water. I am pleased that there has been some attempt by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to respond to questions that I put to them on notice just last Friday at a Senate committee hearing.


But ultimately this is about certainty. This is about communities wanting to be able to move forward in a constructive way to deal with these matters. If this plan is not adequate in years to come, then we need to tackle that but right now with the alternative I believe the risks are too high. We need a plan for this river system and I believe disallowing the plan carries with it a real risk for little guaranteed benefit, which is why I will have difficulty in supporting this motion, but I do not under any circumstances criticise the Australian Greens for bringing this motion. They have that right and they have reason to be concerned, but to me it is a question of risk. It is a question of the risk of not supporting this plan, as imperfect as it is. I believe it ought to be continually monitored. We ought to hold the government and the opposition to account in terms of the promises made. There is nothing to stop a further motion being moved in the new year, because of the way that the time limits for disallowance motions operate, by either Senator Hanson-Young or indeed another senator for a disallowance of this plan to debate this issue again. But right now on the evidence available I reluctantly cannot support this motion because I believe the risk is too great.

  Isn't it the absolute height of hypocrisy: after the Greens sought to destroy the Murray-Darling Basin Plan with a disallowance motion, they then seek to destroy the vote with a guillotine.

It is the essence of why they cannot be responsible in any way, shape or form for the livelihoods of the people living in the basin.


They are all theatre, they do not care, they are all about destruction and they are total and utter nihilists, whose only desire is for the theatrical and for a response to the theatrical. And the outcome of the theatrical is the destruction of the livelihoods of the people who live in the basin. It is a clear sign to all those who are listening to this debate that this is why you cannot trust them and this is why we had to do a deal with the Labor Party, because God help us if we ever had to deal with the Greens.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (19:02):  I seek leave to speak on the division just taken, until 7.20 pm.


Leave granted. 




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Thank you, Mr President. I thank the Senate and I thank the government for their facilitation, whilst in no way of approving of the gag that was just applied by the government and the Greens to this debate. 


I come to the issue. I rise to support reform. I rise to support action. I want to support change. I want to support something that will deliver an improved management system of the Murray-Darling Basin. That is why I opposed this disallowance motion. That is why I opposed the wrecking of the plan by the Australian Greens. That is why I opposed the fact that the Greens have simply voted to stop action, to stop reform, to block any type of change.


I said in my maiden speech that I was a great fan of former President Theodore Roosevelt. President Roosevelt was in fact one of the first great environmentalists—someone who started the process of establishing national parks and implementing environmental reforms. I want to quote Roosevelt:


Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty …


Perhaps nothing relates more to effort, pain or difficulty in a policy sense than achieving Murray-Darling reform. There have been 120 years worth of arguments and bickering—120 years since the states first gathered to establish Federation and this place and, in so doing, the arguments were had over who should manage the Murray-Darling Basin.


Sadly, the wrong decision was made then. Today, it has been righted slightly because today we are a step closer to now having a national management plan for the Murray-Darling Basin. We have seen, unfortunately, in the last 120 years, especially in the last 40 to 50 years, serious mismanagement of the water resources of the Murray-Darling.


What is the source of the problem? Who is the source of the problem? The source of the problem, very clearly, has been state governments. Labor state governments, Liberal state governments and National Party state governments all share the blame. They all saw the extraction of water from the Murray rise at a dramatic rate, especially in the period since the 1960s and, in rising at that dramatic rate, it reached levels that came to be accepted as being overallocated. It was too much for the system to withstand. There was too much extraction of water from the system; therefore, there was a need for reform.


But let us be very clear: state governments were to blame here—not farmers, not irrigators and certainly not irrigation communities. They simply took advantage of the opportunities afforded to them by their state governments, to take a water licence and undertake business, grow food, grow fibre, make produce and help the economy of this country. That is why, in fixing the problem that has been created, we must do it in a way most sympathetic to those farmers, those irrigators and those communities. They did not create the problem; their state governments did.


When we got to the last great drought that began at the turn of this century, it was evident that the Murray-Darling system was under more stress than ever before. It was clear it had been overallocated and it was obvious that action was demanded and warranted. That is why the Howard government, having tried in 2004 through the National Water Initiative to initiate reform and yet seen the state governments drag their heels yet again—fight and bicker yet again—in 2007 said: 'Enough is enough. We must have national management of the Murray-Darling.' They put $10 billion on the table. We put $10 billion on the table—I say 'we' because I am proud to have been a member, albeit briefly, through that important period when that solution was actually implemented—when the Water Act was passed through this parliament and when the funds were budgeted and set aside for the recovery of the water to restore some sustainability.


The solution of the Howard government was to establish an independent authority under the Water Act—the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. We hear a lot sometimes about the fact that this authority has not done its job. People attack it from all sides. People suggest it has no credibility and has compromised the outcome. Let us remember the people sitting around that authority table, the six members of the authority, do genuinely constitute an independent authority. I want to thank them for the work that they have done in preparing this Basin Plan—for the difficult task they have undertaken. They have not always got it right. They have not always engaged as they should have with the communities. But around that table there is an environmental scientist—you would not think that listening to the Greens, but there is—and around the table there is an agricultural scientist. Yes, there are economists and former public servants. But around that table are credible people trying to fix a very difficult problem.


The other aspect of the solution in terms of establishing the authority was to task it to come up with what has been coined as a triple-bottom-line approach—one that said we must optimise the economic, social and environmental outcomes that we seek through this process. That has been a very, very difficult thing for them to achieve, because it involves trade-offs, it involves compromise and it has been seen to be a painful process.


During the debate many analogies have been thrown around for this process. If I can add one more, it has certainly been like root canal treatment without the anaesthetic. It has been painful for all participants. It has taken far too long, since 2007. We have seen delays, we have seen problems and we have seen mistakes. And, yes, it is a process that has been made that much harder due to the incompetence of the government at various times—the incompetence that has seen the government undertake buybacks at the expense of delivering on infrastructure projects and in doing so lose the confidence of so many of those people in the upstream communities who were and are being asked to make the sacrifices of their water back to the environment. There has been, of course, mismanagement of expectations—both upstream and downstream—of just what would be achieved and how much could actually be returned. 


Nonetheless, after all of the arguments, after all of the rallies, after all of the shouting, after all of the delays that we have seen throughout this process, we now finally have a final Basin Plan. Not much has been said in this debate about what it is—what the actual solution is and what it might achieve. Again, you would be forgiven, when you listen in particular to the Greens, for believing that not much is achieved through this Basin Plan. Let us put that in some perspective. Firstly, 2,750 gigalitres of water will be returned to the environment. What does that mean, though? Well, that is 2,750 gigalitres from a 2009 baseline of 13,623 gigalitres. That is a 20 per cent reduction in water use across the Murray-Darling Basin. That is an enormous step. That is a huge change. We should not downplay the significance of the amount of water that is being recovered for the environment through this process. There is, of course, the aspiration—and I will not go into the detail of that now—to get another 450 gigalitres, taking it to 3,200 gigalitres, a 23½ per cent reduction, getting close to the point where one in every four litres of water that had been available for extraction from the basin before 2009 will no longer be. We should not in any way underestimate the extent of that change. In terms of that 40-year period of enormous growth in extractions and allocations of water, it knocks out about half of that growth. That is why this is such a difficult adjustment for the communities of the basin. That is why this is so challenging for those communities being asked to give up the water.


Let me deal with another misconception—that is, that there is no modelling behind this or it makes no difference. I will invite any senator, anybody listening, anybody who reads this, to go and look at the MDBA website. Go and look at the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of reports that sit behind this plan. Look at the modelling that has been released. Yes, the modelling that has been released and has been undertaken. And also look at the difference that it makes, because it makes a real difference environmentally. Look at some of the targets that have been set for the bottom end of the system which have attracted the greatest attention, and there are some good examples here. The maximum period in number of days where salinity in the Coorong southern lagoon is greater than 130 grams per litre: under the baseline model, that maximum period is 323 days; with the recovery of this water it returns to the without-development figure of zero days. The maximum salinity in grams per litre in the Coorong northern lagoon over the model period: without development it would be 49 grams per litre; at the baseline at the 2009 extraction levels, it is 148 grams per litre; with the return of the 2,750 gigalitres it falls back to 56 grams per litre—getting very close the without-development scenario again. Then there are water flows out of the barrages right at the end of the system—the proportion of three-year rolling average barrage flows greater than 2,000 gigalitres per year.


Without development, that is achieved 100 per cent of the time. Under the baseline model, it is achieved only 79 per cent of the time. With this Basin Plan, it will be achieved 98 per cent of the time. One could reasonably ask of the Greens sometimes what more they want. This is achieving some very significant environmental improvements—some huge steps forward in terms of the environmental outcomes—and they, just like the scale of change being achieved, should not in any way be underestimated.


However, the task of saying how much water should be returned is only one half of the equation. The other half of the equation is to address how the water is returned. With that, the coalition still has some grave reservations about the capacity and commitment of this government to do it in the most socially and economically sustainable ways for the communities who are being asked to return this water to environmental flows. The government has released a very worthy document, the Environmental Water Recovery Strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin. What it seeks to do—what it indicates will happen—is worthwhile and will manage to ensure that the economic fabric of our river communities is preserved. If it is implemented as the government has indicated could be achieved, it should ensure that our river communities maintain their productive capacity and have a strong, viable and robust future. But my concern about this document is that in large part it is indicative.


The commitment of the coalition is that we will apply the strategy outlined here. That is why in the other place we have moved amendments to make aspects of this strategy, including a cap on buybacks, law. That is a commitment we will stand by, because we believe you must deliver on the infrastructure parts of the deal. You must get the win-win projects off the ground where you can make our farmers and our river systems more efficient and return water to the environment from those efficiencies but leave their productive capacity intact so that they can continue to grow the food and the exports that we want for this country into the future. So this must be done in the most sympathetic way possible because, as I said before, it is not the fault of the farmers or of the irrigation communities that we have seen the problems that have necessitated this action. They instead deserve our support and our assistance to ensure their future is as sound as that of the river system we are trying to protect.


I want to pay tribute to some of my colleagues who have worked with me through this process—in particular to Senator Joyce. We have been in some ways described as the yin and the yang of the coalition on water. Senator Joyce is from St George and, yes, I am from Adelaide—opposite ends of the system and opposite concerns in many ways. But I think we have managed to come together to a common understanding of the need to get the environmental outcomes and the need to ensure the protection of the river communities. Many other colleagues have engaged along the way—House of Representatives colleagues as well. If I start to name some, I will end up missing some, so I will not name any, but I do acknowledge the work of my South Australian colleagues in fighting for this reform but also the work of those upstream colleagues who have equally fought for a fair outcome for their communities and who have got the commitment of the coalition to make sure that that happens.


I am pleased the disallowance motion was just defeated. It was critically important that that happen to allow for reform to occur. To borrow from Voltaire, we should not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. In this instance, the plan is not perfect—of course it will have problems—but equally there are many review processes built into this. Some may say there are too many review processes built into this, but I have faith that those processes and the independent authority seeking to deliver and implement this plan will address problems as we proceed through it. This plan does represent, if not perfection, at least a very good step forward that, if implemented correctly, will leave us in a situation where we have a healthier Murray-Darling system and a better environmental outcome and still enjoy robust river communities producing the food and produce this country wants for the future. I welcome this reform. It is 120 years overdue, but better late than never.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2012-11-28,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:49):  I move:


That the Basin Plan 2012, made under Part 2 of the Water Act 2007, be disallowed.


I rise today to speak in favour of this motion. It is with a heavy heart that I do, because I would have preferred that we could be celebrating the passage of a plan that would have set the river up for a living future—set the river up over the next 20 years to be a system that is healthy and can sustain itself and, of course, the communities and the ecosystems that rely on it. Unfortunately, the plan as tabled by the minister earlier this week does not do this. I know the minister talks about the fact that it does, but when you look at these things the devil is always in the detail, and the devil in the detail in this plan is that we do not have the water being returned that the best available science says we need if we are to set the river up and give it a fighting chance. This plan is meant to be the blueprint for how the river system will be managed for the next 20 years, yet this plan does not even include the impacts of climate change or how to deal with the system in an increasingly drying environment.


We know that the coalition and the government have agreed to endorse this plan and pass it through this place today. This plan has had the support of the coalition to pass through this place, because it is not a plan that will save the river; it is a plan that appeases those who did not want to give back as much water as they have been greedily taking. It is not a plan that is set up to support the long-term interests of the environment. It is a plan not based on the best available science. It tries to balance interests rather than the long-term health and resilience of the basin overall.


This process has been all political, not scientific; and, unfortunately, that is backed up by the very fact that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has not even done the modelling for its long-term forecast of the impact that this plan is going to have. The modelling that has been done has been limited and has no comparison. There is no modelling of the impact of the massive increase in groundwater extraction, which is allowed for under this plan. I know the coalition have now decided they do not like figures; that was Tony Burke, the minister, 12 months ago. The coalition have now adopted this and do not want to talk about the figures. Unfortunately, the figures do not add up to the rhetoric of the outcomes that this plan is meant to achieve.


The whole point of this plan is to set the river up for a healthy future, to get back the water that has been overallocated for generations. I stand here as a representative of my home state of South Australia. We know that, when there is less water in the system, when the drought years come, it is South Australia at the end of the system that always cops it the hardest. That is because we are at the end of the river. When there is less runoff, when there is less water in the system, the upstream states continue to take, take, take and leave basically nothing for South Australia down the end. That means, of course, that our precious environment—our Coorong, the Storm Boy country, our Lower Lakes—and the irrigators in the Riverland have to scrape by with the little amount of water that is left.


Let's not forget that South Australia takes only seven per cent of the overall water within the basin. When the drought is on, it is even less. During the millennium drought, which South Australians remember wholeheartedly and which was not that long ago, we were not even getting that seven per cent flowing across the border. We had far less than that.


As I have said, this plan as tabled today and debated this afternoon is, unfortunately, not the plan that will save the Murray-Darling Basin system. It will not give river communities, particularly in South Australia, security into the future, because it is not based on what we need to do in order to save the system. A friend of mine put it to me like this: if you have any infection and you are seriously sick and you are prescribed by the doctor a course of antibiotics yet are only given a few of those antibiotic tablets and not the whole packet, you are not going to knock that bug off. Everyone knows you need to take the entire course to get your health back on track. That is how antibiotics work. In this instance we have the minister and many others acknowledging that this system is not healthy and that we have to build resilience back into the system because it has been so crippled after decades of overallocation. We really need to realign what the environment is entitled to to keep itself going, to give itself some resilience, to keep the ecosystems alive, particularly in those harsher and drier years. And yet we are not giving the river and the environment the opportunity to do that, because we are not prepared to give it its full course of antibiotics. We are not allowing it even the best fighting chance to get its health back on track.


The best available science says we need 4,000 gigalitres. We have not been given that under this plan. We then saw modelling released by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and backed up by Minister Burke. He flew with the Prime Minister all the way down to the Murray mouth in South Australia and said, 'Hey presto, we know now that 3,200 gigalitres will be somewhat what the river needs if we are even to try to give it a sense of being able to get healthy again and to keep it healthy.' The Greens would have been more than happy and supportive of working with the government to guarantee that minimum amount of 3,200 gigalitres, which would have kept our river red gums alive; which would have flushed out that two million tonnes of salt each year to keep the water healthy and to ensure that the water quality is good enough for domestic use, for stock use, for Adelaide to keep drinking from; which would have ensured that we could protect the iconic Coorong and Lower Lakes. But this is where the devil is in the detail. This plan does not even give us that minimum amount of 3,200 gigalitres, and that is of course why people like Senator Barnaby Joyce, who is sitting in here this afternoon, are I am sure going to stand up and tell people all about how they got a good deal for their constituents and the irrigators upstream—because they have. This plan is for the irrigators. This plan is not about protecting the environment. There are no guarantees in this plan for the water the river needs, particularly to keep South Australia going when the dry years hit. That is not the water that is guaranteed under this plan. When you add in the massive extractions of groundwater—1,700 gigalitres—that has a big impact on how much water is genuinely being returned to the river system.


The coalition do not want to talk about figures. Barnaby Joyce does not want to talk about figures.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Please refer to members by their correct titles.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I apologise. The coalition senators in this place do not want to focus on the figures, and neither does the minister. It is because they do not add up. This plan is a plan to deliver less water for the environment than science says is needed. It is delivering less water for the environment than even the environment minister says is needed if we are to give the river any chance of survival.


We know that $11 billion is going to be spent on this plan, and that is why we must get it right. The motion today is about sending the plan back to the minister and saying, 'We need to get this right because, if we're going to spend $11 billion dollars, we'd better make sure it will return the amount of water to the river that will give the environment a fighting chance, that will ensure we can maintain our majestic river red gums, that will ensure we can give Adelaide healthy drinking water, that will ensure our Coorong can survive the next drought.' $11 billion—what an opportunity to implement true reform. What a fantastic challenge that we all have in this place to make sure that we can overcome the mistakes of generations past when the river was compromised over and over again for vested interests. This plan was an opportunity to get this right, but unfortunately what is before us today is not that. It is a plan that cuts the environment short and appeases those who are upstream and who never wanted this process in the first place. Senator Barnaby Joyce is going to stand up here at any moment and say: 'This is the best deal irrigators were ever going to get.' It is a bonanza for upstream irrigators because they are about to pocket $11 billion and they do not even have to give back to the river or to South Australia the water that the river really needs. The $11 billion should be setting us up for a healthy future. 


The plan is a blueprint for how this system will be managed over the next 20 years, and what is on the table today locks in failure. It spends $11 billion of taxpayers' money and locks in failure. It will cost $11 billion and only achieve 57 per cent of the key targets that the plan says and the Water Act requires the plan to achieve. This is $11 billion, yet we are only going to get half of what we are meant to. We know what that means for South Australia: it means big losses in years to come because this plan does not even take into consideration climate change. It does not take into consideration the long-term effects of increased groundwater extraction. It is not a plan that has been written for the drought years—and the minister has said this himself. This plan is based on average flows. We know that when there are less than average flows things really start to bite for the environment; it is when things really start to bite for my home state of South Australia, which is located at the bottom of the system. 


The Greens have moved a motion to send this plan back to the minister so that we can get it right. The minister said himself that we need 3,200 gigalitres, yet that is not what is in this plan. So let us put that in. Let us make sure that we have a minimum of 3,200 gigalitres. If that is what science says is needed, if that is what the minister believes is needed and if that is what Jay Weatherill, the Premier of South Australia, says is needed, let us do it. The Greens would be more than willing and happy to deliver a minimum of 3,200 gigalitres, because that is what even the minister says is required. But, unfortunately, that is not what is in this plan. This plan has 2,750 gigalitres. It fails half of the key environmental targets that it needs to keep the river system alive. On the table today is $11 billion, only half the job done and locked in failure for the next 20 years. 


Unfortunately, it seems as though we lost the courage to manage this process when the sky opened, the rains started coming and the millennium drought broke two years ago. Two years ago, people were crying out for proper reform. Let us never go back to a situation where there were kilometres and kilometres of dry river bed, where the water was so high in saline content that it was too salty to even irrigate pasture, let alone to feed stock or to use in the houses of those communities who rely on it. Two years ago, before the millennium drought broke, people wanted urgent action and proper national reform, and they wanted a system that was fair—a system that would manage the water in the basin fairly. That courage seems to be all but forgotten today, because what we have in front of us is not a courageous plan. It is an appeasement on the part of the Labor Party to those upstream and to the coalition to allow them to continue their business as usual. There is talk of an extra 450 gigalitres that maybe some day, if they could—ooh, let's see—be added on by 2024. There are no guarantees about that. It is not in the plan; it is not locked in. The legislation before the other place does not say that it has to be delivered, even though $1.7 billion will be spent long before any water is seen. 


The courage to actually do the right thing by the environment and to stop compromising the very real needs of the river have been all but forgotten by this minister, who is desperate to cut a deal with the coalition and to appease those upstream. Let us not forget that Senator Barnaby Joyce, at the height of the millennium drought, said to South Australians when they could not even drink the water in the Murray because it was so salty, when they could not even get their pumps and their pipes past the kilometres and kilometres of mud: 'Chin up. Move upstream if you don't like it.' That is what Barnaby Joyce thinks about South Australia's predicament when there is less water in the system. That is what Senator Barnaby Joyce thinks about South Australia's opportunity for a fair go when it comes to sharing the waters of the rivers.


The Greens will continue to work to get locked in that minimum of 3,200 gigalitres. I stand here today urging the government to do the right thing, to find the courage to fix this. You do not have to cuddle up to Tony Abbott and Senator Joyce just to get this passed.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am sorry, but once again, Senator Hanson-Young, please use the correct titles of the members. You mentioned the Leader of the Opposition and did not use his honorific.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I guess it depends on your definition. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, you refer to members of the House of Representatives as Mr or Ms et cetera. 




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  The government do not have to be cuddling up to Mr Abbott and Senator Joyce just to appease the upstream states. If they are truly into reforming the system—saving our river and doing what is right by the environment, setting us up for a future we can rely on for the next 20 years—then they should be putting in place a plan that will save the river for the future, based on the best available science, backed up by the modelling, including the realistic impacts of climate change, not carrying on with the Nationals' approach of head in the sand and ignore, ignore, ignore, that everything will be all right, somebody else will look after it. That is the response of the Nationals to anything in relation to the environment in years to come. It is unfortunate because they are cutting their own communities short by doing it.


What an opportunity to get reform right is $11 billion to ensure that we start rebalancing and paying back to the river the water that has been ripped away from it for so long. As I said at the outset, I stand here with a heavy heart that we have not been able to convince the government to do the right thing by the river, the right thing for South Australia and to stand by their commitment to proper reform. What is in this plan is a dud. It does not protect the river system for the future, it does not set us up for resilience and it is going to waste $11 billion in the meantime. It needs to go back and it needs to be fixed. The Greens will continue to fight for that to happen.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-11-28,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (18:10):  The government does not support this disallowance motion and expresses its deep disappointment that the Greens are engaging in a deliberate strategy to delay the achievement of what is a significant environmental reform for this critical riparian system. 


On Monday the Water Act Basin Plan 2012 was tabled in the Senate. This instrument brings into effect the Murray-Darling Basin Plan announced by Minister Burke last week. The plan brings to an end 100 years of disagreement. The plan restores our rivers to health, supports strong regional communities and sustains food production. The plan implements the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's recommendation to return 2,750 gigalitres of surface water to the environment. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority has consulted widely in the development of the plan. The government is acutely aware of the range of views expressed in those consultations. As was said in the Senate last week, the foundation for this reform is unequivocally and unapologetically to restore the river system to health. The plan takes the pathway that is most sensitive to basin communities.


The biggest risk to this historic plan is the disallowance of the plan in either chamber of the parliament. All Australians concerned about the health of this great river system and the wellbeing of basin communities need to promote to their representatives the importance of supporting this plan. The river system cannot survive any further delay. As senators know, the plan is already law unless of course the disallowance motion is successful here and now. Senators need to be aware that, if this plan is disallowed, the future of the Murray-Darling Basin will continue to stagnate and deteriorate. Redrafting the plan would take years. The processes under the Water Act 2007 would require a new public comment period, two rounds of ministerial consultation and the authority's consideration of the minister's suggestions. Even if the plan was not changed, it could not be reintroduced as a disallowable instrument for another six months.


The Murray-Darling Basin is too important to be used as a platform for political posturing. The Greens party does not have a commitment to sustainability. It is a party that is only committed to conservation at any price. The Greens judge success on what they stop, not on what they protect. They had a chance to support an emissions-trading scheme to address climate change three years ago but urged against it. They just want coalmining to stop. The question is: what will the Greens allow? They do not consider the economic or social implications at all. They do not take a triple bottom line approach. They just have a single bottom line. If there is an environmental impact, it is bad. To paraphrase former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, they represent the impotence of purity.


The Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been crafted by expert advice and years of consultation. The Greens party need to comprehend that they live in a pluralistic democracy. If you have the option where everyone's interests can be considered and not just simply your own, that is in fact a virtuous thing.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:13):  Isn't it amazing the sort of empathy you get from someone whose office is at level 7, 147 Pirie Street, when they want to talk about the basin. If you have so much empathy for the basin, Senator Hanson-Young, here is my suggestion: get your office and move there. Show a real desire to actually put your actions and your reality on the same page, because you have not done it. And that is what is so frustrating: when we are in the basin and we have the profits, you ride in from somewhere else to shut down our communities.


At level 7, 147 Pirie Street you cannot see Dirranbandi—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Order! Senator Joyce, you should address your remarks through the chair, not to individual senators.




Senator JOYCE:
  Certainly, Madam Acting Deputy President. At level 7, 147 Pirie Street, it is rather hard to understand what happens at Dirranbandi when the town shuts down. It is rather difficult to understand how you go to the people of Collarenebri and leave them in destitution. It is rather difficult to understand and comprehend what happens at Coleambally.


No, at level 7, 147 Pirie Street, you can say some wonderful things and make some marvellous gestures—the faux empathy, the grimace and the emotive pause—but they are not fair dinkum. It just goes to show you how absolutely lacking real empathy is, because people who believe in things actually go and place themselves exactly where those things are.


I have lived, and have always lived, in the basin—we live with the people. There is this assertion that it is all about—as Senator Hanson-Young said before—multibillion-dollar irrigators. I will tell you about the houses where some of these multibillion-dollar irrigators live. If you go to the town of Dirranbandi you can pick up a house for 50 grand, hardly the sort of opulence that I think you could understand at level 7, 147 Pirie Street.


We have heard that, of course, it is about the community. What community? If you are going to look after the community come and live in the communities. Come and think that there is more to this: it is about, and has always been about, a triple bottom line—an environmental outcome, which the coalition put the money on the table for. But there is also the social outcome and there is also the economic outcome, and that goes beyond, as has rightly been said, just a play by the Greens to divide and destroy, and to talk in these riddles that they never, ever have to deliver on. They never, ever have to live with the consequences of their decisions.


We have worked with the government because we understand exactly how incredibly important this is. It would have been absolutely incredibly easy to mount a demonstration—gosh knows, I have done them before—up and down through the basin. It would have been easy. The trouble is that it would also have been pyrrhic because it will not actually have brought a result.


And I apologise for wanting to look after people. I apologise for wanting to put people on the same level as frogs and newts and swamps. I apologise that when you walk into a town people actually talk about their futures. I am sorry that I do not have the Green ethos where we can just flush them all down the toilet. I am sorry that I do not have that! I have never actually managed to be able to do that.


And the talk in all those metaphors—'greedily taking'! Who is 'greedily taking'? The paper shop in Moree? Are they 'greedy takers'? Or maybe it is the person who is a teacher in Goondiwindi? Are they another 'greedy taker'? Or maybe it is the person who is trying to start a motel in Forbes—are they another 'greedy taker'? Is that who these people are? The 2.2 million people who live in the basin, are they just all greedy? They are all greedy because they want a future!


We talk about wanting to be the food bowl of South-East Asia. Well, the first thing we actually have to be is the food bowl of Australia. That is a good start. But there is this sort of nihilist philosophy that the Greens revel in; this nihilist idealism where success is destruction, where success is Smithton in Northern Tasmania, with 30 per cent unemployment. And the Greens are cock-a-hoop—they have kicked a goal. They have kicked a goal when people are poor and they can revel in the benefaction of the welfare state. They are from a community that is completely removed from the disaster that they cast on the people around them. And that is supposed to be some sort of beneficial outcome.


The coalition has worked with the Labor Party. We have worked not just at a federal level but at a state level over a long period of time, and we have tried our very best. To be honest, we have stayed out of the media, we have trusted one another and we have worked for an outcome because we know that the ramifications for the people who we represent of not coming to that outcome would be disastrous. They would then be at the behest of the whims of the Greens, represented by Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who said at the start that she wanted 7,600 gigalitres to be taken from the basin. That was her kick-off point—7,600 gigalitres—which would absolutely and utterly send people up and down the river destitute, and their final cause—the issue du jour—to return us all to eating beetles and nuts on the forest floor would be one step closer.


I can assure you that there are people who are not happy with this plan in towns. I can assure you that we are quelling resentments as they ring up our offices, saying, 'We feel uncertain. We are unsure. We are taking you, the Australian government and the responsible parties'— who actually have to live by the decision and even though they have had their differences—'in this chamber on trust'. We are responsible for it. They are taking us on this incredible thing called trust. They are trusting us not to be perverse in the outcomes that we bring into their lives. Gosh knows, that is what we hope to do.


The reality is that whether it is the coalition or the Labor Party we have to live with the decisions as well. It actually has to go beyond the spruiking; you actually have to pay for them. You have to live with them, you have to deliver them and you have to go back to the people and be responsible for them. It is all very well to be the marginal party with the nihilist ideals that appeases a constituency with the sweat, the blood and the reality that someone else has to live with.


They want 3,200. By the end of this, through the course of state actions and the Living Murray agreement, there will be more than 3,200. There will be 3,700. There has already been 950 delivered. We have got 2,750 here. We will have 3,700 gigalitres that, over the course of a range of programs, will have been delivered back to the river. There is still the capacity for a five per cent movement of total extractions, a capacity of 710, that is still there. We are still in the process, within that upside, of allowing extra money to go towards 450 gigs of that five per cent limit. There has been an immense amount of movement. 


All that this is really about is that the Greens have said, 'The Labor Party are there and the coalition are there, so we'll sit over here and throw rocks.' That is their process. Senator Hanson-Young has had a range of numbers. She started with 7,600, then it was 4,000, now it is 3,200—and then she accuses us about numbers. We have got a number: 2,750. It is there—2,750, with the potential of five per cent up or five per cent down, and with 450 gigs going towards the upside to actually finance it.


The other issue that has to be dealt with from the person from level 7, 147 Pirie Street, Adelaide—Senator Sarah Hanson-Young—is about when the drought was on. The millennium drought did not just happen in Adelaide or the Lower Lakes, it happened across the whole basin. The reason there was no water at the lower end of the system is because there was no water at the upper end of the system. I can prove that because people in my area went broke—that is, the banks came in and kicked them off their place. I am not going to name those people here but I could go through quite a list of them. They went through humiliation for trying to do something for this nation. They did what this nation asked of them: they went west, they scratched out a living in the dirt, they borrowed in some instances tens of millions of dollars, it did not rain because the drought happened and they went broke. They are now live with the humiliation of not having a house, of living with sons and daughters. What does Senator Sarah Hanson-Young call them? Greedy. They are greedy people. Greedy for trying to do the right thing by our country; terrible, shocking people trying to feed people, trying to clothe people, going without, going through the privations of trying to start a business. And what do they get accosted with? They are greedy. A nation of people who—if that is what they call them—are greedy like that, who make the sacrifice for our nation, will make our nation a great place and will actually build our nation.


It is such an absolute insult from someone who, good luck to them, lives with the benefaction of the taxpayers' dollar in the job we have here, in an office in the middle of a town, where the closest they will ever get to the basin on a day-to-day basis is when they turn on the tap—possibly. That is about as close as they get. For them it is a philosophy, it is an ideal, it is over the hill—but it makes sense when you get down to the manic monkey cafe to bang on about this. If you can just create a bit of resentment, create a bit of hate, create a bit of division and then build on that, you can be the real destroyer, the total nihilist for which, if our nation followed that path, it would be completely and utterly led to a social and economic oblivion.


We are working to try to come to a resolution because it is the responsible thing to do. And it is an absurdity to think that there has not been a movement that hurts us in what we do. I will explain to you some of the hurt that we have had so far. When they purchased the water from Twynam's, from John Kahlbetzer, they basically made the town of Collarenebri defunct. It has no water licence. There is no reason for there to be a cotton gin anymore. What do we say to those people? What is Senator Sarah Hanson-Young's message to those people? What is it? Can they move down to level 7, 147 Pirie Street and get a job? Maybe we can send the whole town down there.


We have got to realise that when the drought was on it was not just a drought for one corner of the basin, it was a drought for the whole basin. It was privation for the whole basin. I know that because I live there. My office is there. My office is on the river. My business is on the river. My property is in the basin. Our family are not irrigators. In fact, we are below irrigators, but we acknowledge that that is part of the economy because above us is a town called Cunnamulla and they have got a little bit of irrigation. Good luck to the people of Cunnamulla—they have a bit of irrigation so the standard of living has slowly advanced.


This is what terrible people we are in my own town of St George. In the town of St George, with about 4,000 people, agricultural output on a yearly basis is between three-quarters of a billion and a billion dollars every year that they put towards our nation—these terrible greedy people. Year in, year out, they are putting it towards our nation. It is actually how we make money. These people make money and then they pay taxes, and they go without and they live out in the sticks, and with their taxes they pay for a whole range of things that this nation needs. One is level 7, 147 Pirie Street—that is one of the things they pay for. What they get for that is the prophet from over the horizon preaching to them about how evil they are, how greedy they are.


The approach of the Greens, after the nihilist destruction, is now to destroy the plan. It is their form of 'burn the plan'. It is their little day of destroying things: come out, wreck the joint. I suppose then we can all cop it. As they say, we will 'just have to cop it'. And we have ridiculous things like the metaphor they draw: 'We have to take our full course of antibiotics.' As prescribed by who? As prescribed for what purpose?




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Science.




Senator JOYCE:
  The full course of antibiotics from these people? Not one of them is prepared to live in the area they are talking about. What total and utter hypocrites. With their ideas, not only would we have social and economic destruction but also in some areas a complete compromise of the economic infrastructure—of bridges, of roads, of easements. In some areas it is not even possible to move the water that they require. It just does not have that capacity because of natural choke points, or choke points put in by man such as those other terrible things of civilisation, bridges—we cannot have bridges anymore. 


And what is the final goal? What do they want? Why don't we just remove every piece of infrastructure? This is the peculiar thing: the water that is going to provide the environmental outcome in many instances is going to come from man-made structures and, if those man-made structures were not there, wouldn't it be hard to deliver the water? If we deliver water in a drought, the water will probably come from man-made structures—those evil man-made structures. They will be delivering the water in order to deliver an environmental outcome. Surely a purist could not possibly take water from those man-made structures that are actually going to have the capacity to deliver an outcome that sustains the environment! 


People who live in the basin, and that goes beyond people who are irrigators—the townspeople, the people who live in the weatherboard and iron, the brick and tile, who put their rubbish out on a Monday or Tuesday night, who live in streets like mine—are put at risk because of a nihilist philosophy that wants no more than to destroy things, and then has the hide, basically, to not have to live with their decisions. They foist on other people their philosophy and outcomes. They are not prepared to pay the price, but they are prepared to take the cheque. They are prepared to live by the benefaction of a taxpayer's dollar whilst they destroy the economy that actually provides it.


It would be interesting to know exactly what their purpose is. Maybe the real frustration about this is that through the Christmas period—because this issue after many years of work is coming to a conclusion—one of those final things that the Greens are out there to destroy will not be there. They will have to find some other thing to destroy. They have destroyed the timber industry, they have destroyed the fishing industry, and they want to destroy the irrigation industry. They want to destroy our capacity to feed ourselves, and with their ideas surrounding the excesses of the carbon tax, maybe they just want to destroy the economy, full stop. They are running out of things to destroy. What other things can they get rid of? What is the next stage of nihilism for them? When will we hear that they are actually trying to create something that is a reasonable expression of something with a sustainable economic base? Do we just have to put up with the position that every time Senator Sarah Hanson-Young turns up it is about something that people in the Murray-Darling Basin live in fear and trepidation of? They know that the only utterances that will come from the Australian Greens are ones that are going to make their lives—the lives of people whose socio-economic condition is vastly inferior to that of so many people in capital cities—more difficult, and that the delivery of the Greens will take them from poor to destitute.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-11-28,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:33):  I rise tonight to support my colleague's move to try to secure an improvement in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. People listening might be excused for thinking, after the contribution we have just heard from Senator Joyce, that the Senate was engaged in street theatre. I think that people in the National Party would be quite disappointed to think that in an opportunity to debate the merits or otherwise of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, all we had was a rant and an attack and no real engagement with the merits or otherwise of the plan.


Contrary to the view that somehow the Greens do not have to live with the decisions that we make, it is in fact because we have to live with the decisions that this parliament makes that we think very carefully about the positions we take and the consequences of those decisions for everyone who comes after us, and not just this generation but future generations. 


I go to the first point: why are we having a Murray-Darling Basin Plan? It is an attempt to save the river. Australians love the Murray-Darling. They love the river system and they have been distraught in recent years to see that the mouth of the Murray is not open and that there are high levels of salinity in the Lower Lakes. Right down the river system communities have been under enormous pressure as a result of the river failing. It has been failing because of the drought, and the drought occurred in part because of climate change. 


And we now have a Leader of the National Party who is refusing to acknowledge that climate change is real and urgent. We are seeing reports coming out daily that it is far worse than anyone anticipated and now we have a Murray-Darling Basin Plan which fails to take account in any shape or form of the climate predictions that we are going to live with in Australia. How can you save a river system if you do not anticipate the changes in the climate and the impacts of those changes on the river system? How can you genuinely say that you are interested in the livelihood or wellbeing of people who live in a river basin if you are not taking into account the health of the river that will sustain them into the future? That is the point here.


The figure of 7,600 gigalitres came from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and from the Wentworth Group. Both of them came out and said that if you want to restore the river to its optimum level of health, that is the amount of water that needs to be in the river system. It was not some extreme group of people who said that; it was the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the Wentworth Group. They actually take a science based approach. That is something the National Party does not take. Senator Joyce has made it quite clear that he does not believe in climate change and he does not believe in carbon pricing to reduce emissions. He obviously does not think it is appropriate that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan anticipates the needs of the river in a climate scenario. The amount of water that this plan has in it—2,750 gigalitres—is actually only for so-called average years. It does not take into account the needs of the river system in anything other than average years. I suggest that there is no such thing as average years any more in a world that is rapidly responding and having to adapt to the climate crisis.


Senator Feeney would suggest that the Greens are politically posturing. His extraordinary example of that is that the Greens voted against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Indeed, we did. We did it because we knew we would have to live with the consequences. If it had gone through and Senator Feeney had his wish, Australia would now have a five per cent reduction target and the carbon price in Australia would be $1.25, the equivalent of one euro, with no institutional capacity to change the target. What a complete nonsense that would be. We would have no Clean Energy Finance Corporation, no Renewable Energy Agency, no Biodiversity Fund, no Carbon Farming Initiative and so on and so forth. I think Senator Feeney should reflect on the fact that all he is doing is highlighting the complete embarrassment that this country would have had for carbon pricing if the stupidity that was engaged in at that time had been allowed to stand. Equally, in relation to living with the decisions you make—and I draw this to the attention of both Senators Feeney and Joyce—there are the decisions you made on asylum seekers as well. You raced in here and lectured the Greens about standing here saying, 'We can't compromise on fundamentals. We actually have to look at what might really save lives.' Now we are living with the consequences of that stupidity.


I come back to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in terms of living with the consequences. What is the point of spending $11 billion if you fail to save the river; if you fail to put enough water back into the river to maintain the ecosystem? Four thousand gigalitres has been mentioned because that is what the Wentworth Group said was the absolute minimum that would be needed to give the river system a chance. The Greens asked the minister to model that 4,000 gigalitres, and that ought to have been done in the interests of science, but the minister did not do it. Now we have 2,750 gigalitres and a promise of 450 gigalitres. Much has been said about 3,200 gigalitres. It is a wish and a promise at this stage. There is no promise that there will be a minimum of 3,200 gigalitres. In fact, that could well end up being a maximum that is never achieved.


This is not evidence based policy. This is policy where you have brought in a political fix. The reason I say that is that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan does not come into effect until 2019. The money flows but the water does not get restored to the river system until 2019, by which time Minister Burke, Senator Joyce and Senator Feeney will be long gone from here and will not be living with the consequences of their actions. The money will be spent but I can assure you that the senators who are here in 2019 will be trying to fix the plan that has failed because the consequences of climate change will be something they are living with. You can rest assured that there will not be average years between now and 2019. There will be another drought—there always is in Australia—and it will be more extreme than previous droughts because of the intensity factor of climate change.


Senators will be in here saying: 'How is it possible that $11 billion was spent but the river was not saved?' The excuse will be then, as it always is: 'If only we had known in 2012 what we know now, we would never have agreed to a plan that did not provide for restoring the river.' Every single one of us in here knows right now that this is inadequate in terms of the science. It is not science and evidence based policy; it is a policy which says that this is the political fix that will deliver the money in the short term and by the time the river actually gets to have the water everyone will be long gone and it will be revisited.


Minister Burke knows as well as I do that the 450 extra gigalitres will not be there until 2024. Senator Feeney was saying: 'We cannot delay this any longer. Who would want to delay the water coming into the system?' Well it is not coming into the system until 2019 initially and the extra 450 gigalitres, if indeed that 450 gigalitres gets into the system, will not be until 2024. So, yes, we do have time to get this right. We should be getting it right now. I really think it shows that neither the coalition nor the government believes that climate change is real or urgent if they can all laud a plan which delivers to the river far less than the scientists say is the minimum that is necessary and you are prepared to tick off on a plan which does not anticipate or take into account climate ramifications in Australia.


You think you are doing the people who live in the river system a favour by ticking off such a plan, but you are not. All you are doing is condemning them to an extremely uncertain future because, as much as they would like to think if we spend this $11 billion now their future is assured, it is not assured, because you cannot have an economy without a healthy environment to underpin it.


Without the environment there is no economy, and it is no more so than with a river system. That is why we need to get this right from the start. That is why we need an absolute minimum of what the science says is necessary to give the river a fighting chance—and with the river having a fighting chance come the communities who live along that river system. That is why we need to stop this in its tracks and improve the plan so that we get an evidence based outcome, rather than have the government and the coalition browning down the plan and abandoning the science in favour of a political fix.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-11-28,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:45):  I am not lauding the Basin Plan 2012 as I have reservations about it but the alternative concerns me. I want to make it clear that I do not consider for one moment that the Greens are engaging in an act of political posturing in relation to this. I have worked closely with my colleague Senator Hanson-Young from the Australian Greens to seek the best outcome for the environment and to seek the best outcome for South Australia, which has the unenviable position of being at the bottom of the river system. So, while I understand the intent of this motion, I am concerned that it is a risky path to take.


I understand that this plan is far from perfect. I understand that this plan has many flaws in it. There has finally been a rigorous process with a number of inquiries—Senate inquiries and House of Representatives inquiries—and there has been the whole process around the guide to the Basin Plan, which was a bit of a farce. Finally, when the draft plan was released, there was a more thorough process of consultation. So as imperfect as this plan is, my concern is simply this: what happens if this plan is disallowed and if the version that comes back is worse than the one that we have now? What happens if we have a change of policy or if we have a change of government and whichever government is in power wants to start the process from square one? We could well be in our next drought by then. There is a real concern amongst the communities I speak to—amongst those who have a genuine concern for ensuring the production capacity of land for our food security and those who have a genuine concern for the environment—that we could potentially be in a worse position.


I believe the Basin Plan will make a difference to the environment in terms of what the government is proposing  with the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012, and I note recent comments of the environment minister, the Hon. Tony Burke, where he has said that we need to address the issue of a flaw in that bill which referred to up to another 440 gigalitres being put into the environment to make it much clearer that that is the mandated amount that we need to go for. So that gives me some comfort.


I understand the concerns of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists. They have added to this debate invaluably. People such as Peter Cosier, Tim Stubbs and others in that group have the highest integrity and I 'get' their concerns and I have pursued their concerns in relation to the issue of the interaction between groundwater and surface water. I am pleased that there has been some attempt by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to respond to questions that I put to them on notice just last Friday at a Senate committee hearing.


But ultimately this is about certainty. This is about communities wanting to be able to move forward in a constructive way to deal with these matters. If this plan is not adequate in years to come, then we need to tackle that but right now with the alternative I believe the risks are too high. We need a plan for this river system and I believe disallowing the plan carries with it a real risk for little guaranteed benefit, which is why I will have difficulty in supporting this motion, but I do not under any circumstances criticise the Australian Greens for bringing this motion. They have that right and they have reason to be concerned, but to me it is a question of risk. It is a question of the risk of not supporting this plan, as imperfect as it is. I believe it ought to be continually monitored. We ought to hold the government and the opposition to account in terms of the promises made. There is nothing to stop a further motion being moved in the new year, because of the way that the time limits for disallowance motions operate, by either Senator Hanson-Young or indeed another senator for a disallowance of this plan to debate this issue again. But right now on the evidence available I reluctantly cannot support this motion because I believe the risk is too great.

It is the essence of why they cannot be responsible in any way, shape or form for the livelihoods of the people living in the basin.


They are all theatre, they do not care, they are all about destruction and they are total and utter nihilists, whose only desire is for the theatrical and for a response to the theatrical.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (19:02):  I seek leave to speak on the division just taken, until 7.20 pm.


Leave granted. 




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Thank you, Mr President. I thank the Senate and I thank the government for their facilitation, whilst in no way of approving of the gag that was just applied by the government and the Greens to this debate. 


I come to the issue. I rise to support reform. I rise to support action. I want to support change. I want to support something that will deliver an improved management system of the Murray-Darling Basin. That is why I opposed this disallowance motion. That is why I opposed the wrecking of the plan by the Australian Greens. That is why I opposed the fact that the Greens have simply voted to stop action, to stop reform, to block any type of change.


I said in my maiden speech that I was a great fan of former President Theodore Roosevelt. President Roosevelt was in fact one of the first great environmentalists—someone who started the process of establishing national parks and implementing environmental reforms. I want to quote Roosevelt:


Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty …


Perhaps nothing relates more to effort, pain or difficulty in a policy sense than achieving Murray-Darling reform. There have been 120 years worth of arguments and bickering—120 years since the states first gathered to establish Federation and this place and, in so doing, the arguments were had over who should manage the Murray-Darling Basin.


Sadly, the wrong decision was made then. Today, it has been righted slightly because today we are a step closer to now having a national management plan for the Murray-Darling Basin. We have seen, unfortunately, in the last 120 years, especially in the last 40 to 50 years, serious mismanagement of the water resources of the Murray-Darling.


What is the source of the problem? Who is the source of the problem? The source of the problem, very clearly, has been state governments. Labor state governments, Liberal state governments and National Party state governments all share the blame. They all saw the extraction of water from the Murray rise at a dramatic rate, especially in the period since the 1960s and, in rising at that dramatic rate, it reached levels that came to be accepted as being overallocated. It was too much for the system to withstand. There was too much extraction of water from the system; therefore, there was a need for reform.


But let us be very clear: state governments were to blame here—not farmers, not irrigators and certainly not irrigation communities. They simply took advantage of the opportunities afforded to them by their state governments, to take a water licence and undertake business, grow food, grow fibre, make produce and help the economy of this country. That is why, in fixing the problem that has been created, we must do it in a way most sympathetic to those farmers, those irrigators and those communities. They did not create the problem; their state governments did.


When we got to the last great drought that began at the turn of this century, it was evident that the Murray-Darling system was under more stress than ever before. It was clear it had been overallocated and it was obvious that action was demanded and warranted. That is why the Howard government, having tried in 2004 through the National Water Initiative to initiate reform and yet seen the state governments drag their heels yet again—fight and bicker yet again—in 2007 said: 'Enough is enough. We must have national management of the Murray-Darling.' They put $10 billion on the table. We put $10 billion on the table—I say 'we' because I am proud to have been a member, albeit briefly, through that important period when that solution was actually implemented—when the Water Act was passed through this parliament and when the funds were budgeted and set aside for the recovery of the water to restore some sustainability.


The solution of the Howard government was to establish an independent authority under the Water Act—the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. We hear a lot sometimes about the fact that this authority has not done its job. People attack it from all sides. People suggest it has no credibility and has compromised the outcome. Let us remember the people sitting around that authority table, the six members of the authority, do genuinely constitute an independent authority. I want to thank them for the work that they have done in preparing this Basin Plan—for the difficult task they have undertaken. They have not always got it right. They have not always engaged as they should have with the communities. But around that table there is an environmental scientist—you would not think that listening to the Greens, but there is—and around the table there is an agricultural scientist. Yes, there are economists and former public servants. But around that table are credible people trying to fix a very difficult problem.


The other aspect of the solution in terms of establishing the authority was to task it to come up with what has been coined as a triple-bottom-line approach—one that said we must optimise the economic, social and environmental outcomes that we seek through this process. That has been a very, very difficult thing for them to achieve, because it involves trade-offs, it involves compromise and it has been seen to be a painful process.


During the debate many analogies have been thrown around for this process. If I can add one more, it has certainly been like root canal treatment without the anaesthetic. It has been painful for all participants. It has taken far too long, since 2007. We have seen delays, we have seen problems and we have seen mistakes. And, yes, it is a process that has been made that much harder due to the incompetence of the government at various times—the incompetence that has seen the government undertake buybacks at the expense of delivering on infrastructure projects and in doing so lose the confidence of so many of those people in the upstream communities who were and are being asked to make the sacrifices of their water back to the environment. There has been, of course, mismanagement of expectations—both upstream and downstream—of just what would be achieved and how much could actually be returned. 


Nonetheless, after all of the arguments, after all of the rallies, after all of the shouting, after all of the delays that we have seen throughout this process, we now finally have a final Basin Plan. Not much has been said in this debate about what it is—what the actual solution is and what it might achieve. Again, you would be forgiven, when you listen in particular to the Greens, for believing that not much is achieved through this Basin Plan. Let us put that in some perspective. Firstly, 2,750 gigalitres of water will be returned to the environment. What does that mean, though? Well, that is 2,750 gigalitres from a 2009 baseline of 13,623 gigalitres. That is a 20 per cent reduction in water use across the Murray-Darling Basin. That is an enormous step. That is a huge change. We should not downplay the significance of the amount of water that is being recovered for the environment through this process. There is, of course, the aspiration—and I will not go into the detail of that now—to get another 450 gigalitres, taking it to 3,200 gigalitres, a 23½ per cent reduction, getting close to the point where one in every four litres of water that had been available for extraction from the basin before 2009 will no longer be. We should not in any way underestimate the extent of that change. In terms of that 40-year period of enormous growth in extractions and allocations of water, it knocks out about half of that growth. That is why this is such a difficult adjustment for the communities of the basin. That is why this is so challenging for those communities being asked to give up the water.


Let me deal with another misconception—that is, that there is no modelling behind this or it makes no difference. I will invite any senator, anybody listening, anybody who reads this, to go and look at the MDBA website. Go and look at the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of reports that sit behind this plan. Look at the modelling that has been released. Yes, the modelling that has been released and has been undertaken. And also look at the difference that it makes, because it makes a real difference environmentally. Look at some of the targets that have been set for the bottom end of the system which have attracted the greatest attention, and there are some good examples here. The maximum period in number of days where salinity in the Coorong southern lagoon is greater than 130 grams per litre: under the baseline model, that maximum period is 323 days; with the recovery of this water it returns to the without-development figure of zero days. The maximum salinity in grams per litre in the Coorong northern lagoon over the model period: without development it would be 49 grams per litre; at the baseline at the 2009 extraction levels, it is 148 grams per litre; with the return of the 2,750 gigalitres it falls back to 56 grams per litre—getting very close the without-development scenario again. Then there are water flows out of the barrages right at the end of the system—the proportion of three-year rolling average barrage flows greater than 2,000 gigalitres per year.


Without development, that is achieved 100 per cent of the time. Under the baseline model, it is achieved only 79 per cent of the time. With this Basin Plan, it will be achieved 98 per cent of the time. One could reasonably ask of the Greens sometimes what more they want. This is achieving some very significant environmental improvements—some huge steps forward in terms of the environmental outcomes—and they, just like the scale of change being achieved, should not in any way be underestimated.


However, the task of saying how much water should be returned is only one half of the equation. The other half of the equation is to address how the water is returned. With that, the coalition still has some grave reservations about the capacity and commitment of this government to do it in the most socially and economically sustainable ways for the communities who are being asked to return this water to environmental flows. The government has released a very worthy document, the Environmental Water Recovery Strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin. What it seeks to do—what it indicates will happen—is worthwhile and will manage to ensure that the economic fabric of our river communities is preserved. If it is implemented as the government has indicated could be achieved, it should ensure that our river communities maintain their productive capacity and have a strong, viable and robust future. But my concern about this document is that in large part it is indicative.


The commitment of the coalition is that we will apply the strategy outlined here. That is why in the other place we have moved amendments to make aspects of this strategy, including a cap on buybacks, law. That is a commitment we will stand by, because we believe you must deliver on the infrastructure parts of the deal. You must get the win-win projects off the ground where you can make our farmers and our river systems more efficient and return water to the environment from those efficiencies but leave their productive capacity intact so that they can continue to grow the food and the exports that we want for this country into the future. So this must be done in the most sympathetic way possible because, as I said before, it is not the fault of the farmers or of the irrigation communities that we have seen the problems that have necessitated this action. They instead deserve our support and our assistance to ensure their future is as sound as that of the river system we are trying to protect.


I want to pay tribute to some of my colleagues who have worked with me through this process—in particular to Senator Joyce. We have been in some ways described as the yin and the yang of the coalition on water. Senator Joyce is from St George and, yes, I am from Adelaide—opposite ends of the system and opposite concerns in many ways. But I think we have managed to come together to a common understanding of the need to get the environmental outcomes and the need to ensure the protection of the river communities. Many other colleagues have engaged along the way—House of Representatives colleagues as well. If I start to name some, I will end up missing some, so I will not name any, but I do acknowledge the work of my South Australian colleagues in fighting for this reform but also the work of those upstream colleagues who have equally fought for a fair outcome for their communities and who have got the commitment of the coalition to make sure that that happens.


I am pleased the disallowance motion was just defeated. It was critically important that that happen to allow for reform to occur. To borrow from Voltaire, we should not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. In this instance, the plan is not perfect—of course it will have problems—but equally there are many review processes built into this. Some may say there are too many review processes built into this, but I have faith that those processes and the independent authority seeking to deliver and implement this plan will address problems as we proceed through it. This plan does represent, if not perfection, at least a very good step forward that, if implemented correctly, will leave us in a situation where we have a healthier Murray-Darling system and a better environmental outcome and still enjoy robust river communities producing the food and produce this country wants for the future. I welcome this reform. It is 120 years overdue, but better late than never.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (19:20):  Tonight I want to recognise the life and contribution of the late Ray Gietzelt. Ray was a reformer and moderniser. For 30 years he fought to open up his union and the Labor Party to the voices of their members. He understood that people's commitment to any organisation is influenced by their ability to determine its direction.


Ray Gietzelt was born on 29 September 1922. His parents owned a tyre business in the Sydney suburb of Newtown. Initially the business prospered, but it faltered during the Great Depression when many of their clients were unable to honour their debts. For a time the family struggled and, as with so many of his generation, this experience shaped his politics. In 1940, Ray Gietzelt joined the New South Wales branch of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union, or FMWU. He did so despite the fact that he was working for his father's business at the time. He joined because, in his words, 'It was the logical and principled thing to do.'


His early employment was interrupted by the outbreak of war in the Pacific. Incensed by the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, Ray enlisted in the Army aged 19. He served with the 9th Field Company of the Royal Australian Engineers in Papua New Guinea from 1942 to 1945.


At war's end he rejoined the FMWU but was underwhelmed by the organisation's leaders, who he thought 'worked actively to prevent rank-and-file members from voicing their opinion on wages and conditions of employment'. And so Ray Gietzelt helped found the Protest Committee along with other members such as Jack Dwyer, Harold Facer and Mary Rohan. The committee was dedicated to democratising the elected offices and decision-making processes of the FMWU. In response the right-wing leadership tried to stymie reform by abusing the union's antiquated rules. This included attempts to have Ray's and other reformers' memberships cancelled.


After a period of petitioning rank and file members, a special meeting of the FMWU was held on 7 December 1953 at which members voted for the replacement of the existing leadership. The dispute was finally resolved in favour of the Protest Committee after a hearing before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Not for the last time Ray Gietzelt and his allies were represented by Lionel Murphy. The losing side was represented by John Kerr.


In 1955 Ray Gietzelt was elected General Secretary of the FMWU. With what he described as a mixture of 'self- and collective discipline', Ray expanded the union's membership and democratised its processes. He inherited 22,000 members but retired leading a union of more than 122,000 workers—122,000 cleaners, night watchmen, manufacturing workers and many others. It was a group so diverse 'miscellaneous' was part of the union's name and 'missos' their moniker!


Ray Gietzelt's methods were always true to his principles. He was once horrified to find out that some of his own officials were threatening employers with legal action if they did not sign up their employees. In his memoirs, Worth Fighting For, he argued: 'Such practices harm the union movement—workers need to be persuaded that joining the union is the right thing to do, not compelled. They will join a union if the union has democratic structures in which their views can be heard and their rights asserted if they are protected in exercising their rights, if they are given proper service by their officials and if they see the results of their collective action.'


But Ray's influence extended beyond the labour movement. He was a confidant and friend to three great Labor figures: Lionel Murphy, Neville Wran and Bob Hawke. He supported Murphy's preselection as New South Wales Labor senator. He helped garner support for Neville Wran's switch from the upper to lower house in New South Wales. He supported the Wran challenge for the parliamentary leadership in New South Wales. And he was instrumental in Bob Hawke's election to the presidency of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. But Ray Gietzelt was much more than a patron within the ALP. In July 1970 he helped initiate federal intervention into the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labor Party. Intervention led to some democratisation of the branch, including the introduction of proportional representation.


In 1985 Ray was awarded an Order of Australia. In 1986, along with Neville Wran and Gough Whitlam, he helped establish the Lionel Murphy Foundation. To this day the foundation provides postgraduate scholarships to students of law or science. In 2003 Ray Gietzelt was awarded a life membership of the ALP. It was said on his retirement that under his leadership the FMWU never 'broke its word with any employer, industrial tribunal or kindred organisation'. Those who knew him best spoke of his decency and fairness with allies and adversaries.


Of course, many in this building, including some in the chamber, would know of Ray's brother, Arthur Gietzelt, who served in this chamber from 1971 to 1989. I must say that Arthur spoke eloquently and warmly at his brother's funeral. It was a fine speech from Arthur Gietzelt—perhaps the best speech I have ever heard Arthur give.


On a personal note, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the personal support I received from Ray over many, many years. In some tough times in the Labor Party in New South Wales I can say that that meant a great deal to me.


Ray Gietzelt died on 12 October 2012. He was 90 years of age. His loss is felt by many. My sincere condolences go to his wife, Vi; daughters, Suzanne and Joanne; other members of his family; and friends.
