Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:01):  Members of the House will know that many Australians have lived through a summer of sorrow. Seven people were killed as a result of severe weather and flooding in Queensland. One resident was killed in the Seaton bushfires in Victoria. We lost two firefighters—a Victorian volunteer died in Tasmania and another firefighter died near the Seaton fire. Many Australians have lost homes and possessions, and many will not sleep at home tonight or for some time yet. 


Through summer, it has been very important for those communities to know that all Australians are thinking of them, and I have taken that message to them personally. On 7 January, I visited and spoke to affected families in Tasmania. In Dunalley I toured the site of the primary school which had been burned to the ground. There I met Billie Hassett, a young girl—she is nine—and her mum, Sharee. Billie's school had been burned and she was looking at its ruins. She had actually been told at midnight the night before that they had lost their home as well. Sharee returned to Dunalley to clean up, leaving Billie to stay with friends, but Billie would not eat and would not stop crying. Mum could not get Billie to town by car, so friends brought her daughter to her by boat. Billie told me that, when she got back to town and got back to Mum, she found that her house—next door to a bakery which had exploded in the fire—was in fact still there. 


I visited Coonabarabran on 17 January. While I was there, I met with local firefighter Bob Fenwick and his wife Jeanette. They had lost their house in the fire—the fire Bob had fought. I visited Seaton and Heyfield on the 28th. Over morning tea with Graham Lord and his CFA brigade, I learned about their incredible success saving homes in what they called a guerrilla firefight. 


When I visited Bundaberg and surrounding areas on the 31st, I saw the extensive flood damage there. I will not soon forget Doug Ambrose, who has been the principal of Bundaberg East State School for 21 years, or Janelle Fielding, the manager of the Bargara Bowls Club, where a mini-tornado had ripped the roof from the building. They shared with me the heartache of the whole Bundaberg region.


This is a time beyond politics and a time to pull together, so I acknowledge the efforts of state leaders and members of this House whose communities have been affected, particularly those who hosted me on visits to their communities—the member for Gippsland, the member for Hinkler, the member for Parkes and the member for Lyons, as well as the premiers of Tasmania, Victoria and Queensland. I found the experience of visiting with them a sobering one. I was returning to some places for the second time—I had been there in circumstances of natural disaster before.


I want to thank the emergency services and Australian Defence Force personnel who responded to these events. Brigadier Greg Bilton was appointed commander of a joint task force to assist Queensland authorities and, in the Bundaberg region alone, four Black Hawks, two C130s, a C17 Globemaster aircraft and over 200 personnel have been in the air and on the ground. 


The government is also directly helping those in need. Under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, the Commonwealth and the states are delivering support and assistance to affected communities across Australia right now. This includes personal hardship and distress assistance for affected individuals and families who need immediate financial help, along with access to concessional loans for small businesses and primary producers. It includes funding for counterdisaster operations measures, from supporting evacuation centres to helping councils and states with emerging public health and safety matters in the cleanup phase. It includes funding to restore essential public assets and repairing damaged public infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, in the weeks and months to come. 


In the worst affected areas, we have now activated the Australian government disaster recovery payment and the disaster income recovery subsidy. In the past month, this has, through payments of $1,000 for eligible adults and $400 for eligible children, put more than $50 million into the bank accounts of people severely affected by these disasters.


I am always in awe of the courage and common sense of the Australian people and never more so than in the hardest circumstances. For many, this summer—the summer we are living through—has been a summer of sorrow. But it has also been a summer of survival. I can reassure the House that the communities I visited are resilient and united and I can reassure those communities that we will help them rebuild and recover: that they will not be alone.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:07):  I join with the Prime Minister to acknowledge the dangerous summer that we are still living through and also to point out that the worst of mother nature tends to bring out the best of human nature right around our country, as tens of thousands of Australians rise to the challenges of the natural environment they face. 


The Prime Minister, the parliament, the coalition—all Australians—salute the emergency services workers who have done so much to respond to the ravages of fire and flood. Obviously we salute all the volunteer firefighters; we salute the other volunteers from the Salvation Army, from the Red Cross and elsewhere who are rallying to help victims. We particularly salute the community volunteers who come from nowhere at times like this to help their fellow Australians—the mud army that has been mobilised in Bundaberg and other parts of Queensland and northern New South Wales; neighbours helping neighbours to recover from these heartbreaking circumstances. 


Every state and territory with the exception of the ACT has been affected by fire. In Tasmania, many homes have been lost on the Tasman Peninsula, particularly at Dunalley. In New South Wales, many homes have been lost, particularly around Coonabarabran. Much damage has been done in Victoria—in Gippsland in particular—and South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland have also been affected. Even now Western Australia is being affected by fires. In Bundaberg—an area, a city, a region devastated by floods just two years ago—they have experienced the worst floods on record; what they believe was a one in 200-year flood event, with 7,500 people directly affected and 3,000 homes flooded. Our hearts go out to everyone affected by this terrible tragedy. I particularly salute the local member, the member for Hinkler, Paul Neville, who has not just been helping to organise relief and emergency assistance but also been personally helping—and indeed he carries the scars of his assistance in the floods over the weekend. New South Wales, too, has had record floods on the Clarence River and some 2,000 residents have been evacuated in Grafton and surrounding areas.


I acknowledge the swift response of the national government and I acknowledge the efforts of the Army, magnificent as always, and the good work of Centrelink. I know the farmers and the business people from flood and fire affected areas are looking forward to the relief packages which are normally put in place for business. If I could make one suggestion: I think it would help if these business relief packages were extended to businesses that have been commercially impacted as well as physically impacted by flood and fire, because recovery is not just a matter of physical rebuilding; it is also a matter of economic rebuilding. That is something that has to be of concern to this parliament. 


It has been a difficult and dangerous summer for many Australians. Our hearts go out to those affected and we are resolved to do whatever we reasonably can to help put those people back on their feet.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (14:11):  I wish to support the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, because this has been another summer of tragedy—particularly in my home state of Queensland. There have been all manner of tales of great acts of bravery and neighbourly support; neighbour supporting neighbour, community supporting community. We have heard about some of that from the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition today. Sadly, in Queensland, seven lives have been lost, and there are many stories of individual hardship and hardship to business. 


I pay tribute to the work of the SES and the police, the Army, Centrelink workers and volunteers and also members of parliament—particularly the member for Hinkler in relation to Bundaberg, because the situation there became very serious through Sunday and Monday of the week before last and it did require a huge effort to save lives during the night. The deployment of our Black Hawk helicopters and also helicopters from state emergency services in Queensland did an enormous amount to save lives during that difficult time. 


The destruction in that region reminded me very much of what I saw when we went into the region when it was impacted upon by Cyclone Yasi back in 2011—the huge destruction of houses and the levels of the floodwaters. It was a very distressing sight and it will remain distressing for the thousands of people in those areas. I do pay tribute in particular to the very quick response of our defence forces, who have been working on a bridge across the river up in Bundy, doing what they can do to assist our community—and they are receiving enormous community support for that. But it is not just Bundaberg; it is the wider region of Wide Bay and the many smaller towns which have been very hard hit. 


In the south-east, fortunately we did not have the destruction that we saw in 2011. I have this vivid memory of going out to Enid Street in Goodna in the electorate of Oxley. I visited there with the member for Blair on Monday morning of last week because we thought the waters were probably going to rise, and once again the thousands of homes there would have gone under. I was walking down the street and these beefy blokes wandered along, and I asked what was going on and they said: 'We're the western mud army. We've just redeployed and reactivated from 2011.' People were turning up before the floodwaters had arrived to assist people take the furniture and fridges and so on out of their houses. As it turned out, they all did pack-up; but that was not required because the worst did not happen.


I think we would all agree that the federal government—working with state governments, working with local governments and working with local community organisations—have a responsibility to do everything we can, not just to deal with the emergency but also to help these communities reconstruct themselves. Certainly the federal government is there in the way in which we were there in 2011, working with the state and local governments to make sure we do our very best. I think there is general agreement that the responsibilities and structures that we put in place in 2011 are serving us well again, as we go through a very substantial reconstruction in Queensland. But, overall, whilst it was a tragedy for so many people across our country, we saw the great community spirit of neighbour coming out and helping neighbour and of communities coming together. It says the very best about Australia.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2013-02-05,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (14:15):  I rise to support the comments of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in recognising the summer of fighting fires, cleaning up after devastating floods and mourning lost loved ones that has once again confronted Australia this year. Invariably, it is in regional areas that the biggest costs are counted. Fortunately, Ipswich and Brisbane were spared the worst of the flooding this time around, but I acknowledge there has been very substantial damage and loss of property in those areas too.


On Australia Day I was officiating at a naturalisation ceremony at Sunshine Beach in my electorate, and someone read the famous Dorothea Mackellar poem about 'droughts and flooding rains'. There was light rain on the roof, but we were all warned what to expect as the day wore on. I thought back to just a week or two earlier, when I had been in Tasmania, as the Prime Minister mentioned, visiting people there who had suffered such severe loss of property and homes and the loss of life associated with the fires in that state. I was also thinking of the great heat wave right across Australia this summer—although when I was in Tasmania it was snowing on Mount Wellington. It demonstrates the enormous contrasts we have in our climate across the nation.


Many of the people who suffered in the floods and fires this time around had been through the same emotional and financial wringer in 2010 or 2011, so for them it is difficult to put together the words that would adequately deal with their suffering and loss. It never ceases to amaze me, and it inspires us all, the way in which Australians come together to help one another in these sorts of circumstances. Others have referred to that already; people have come from interstate to help in the clean-up effort, displaying the great Australian hand of mateship, to work together to help get us through these disasters.


The floods in Queensland claimed six lives, and the property losses are enormous. We mourn with the families of those who have lost loved ones. I mention in particular a 27-year-old, wheelchair-bound man who suffered from cerebral palsy and who drowned in Widgee Creek, in my own electorate. His parents were rescued some hours later. That is a particularly tragic example of how people with disabilities have much less capacity to deal with these sorts of climatic circumstances than others.


But there were, of course, some remarkable examples of survival. I think of the story of Lucy Connolly, from Eidsvold, deserves to be told. She woke up just after midnight to the sound of gurgling water in the house on the farm where she was living. That was the first warning she had of the impending crisis. She called her parents for help; but, as she walked outside her house, she was swept up by the floodwaters. She was swept down the drive to the property gate, over the fence, over the highway and then into a wood plantation on the property across the road. While a lot of the timber had been flattened, she managed eventually to cling to a tree. She was not there long when she realised she was sharing it with a snake—but there was only water around her and nowhere else to go. Fortuitously and quite extraordinarily, an emergency beacon got washed up from a weir three kilometres away, with its light flashing, and rested in a tree not far from her. The rescuers, still in the dark of the early morning, saw this flashing light attracting their attention and then heard her screams, and she was rescued. What an extraordinary example of survival it is. So we mourn with those who have lost loved ones, but we also rejoice that so many people lived through this crisis and can now be part of the rebuilding effort.


I want to acknowledge again the rescue workers. I am referring particularly to those in Bundaberg and North Bundaberg, which is actually in the electorate of Flynn. The member for Flynn also has areas like Gayndah, Mundubbera and Eidsvold, which were particularly badly affected by this flooding. The members for Wright and Maranoa have the Lockyer Valley and parts of the Scenic Rim—which were significantly affected—and parts of the South Burnett and of the Western Downs as well. They all worked hard to try and get through this disaster. I acknowledge that in Rockhampton there are still floodwaters that have not yet cleared.


Electricity was out for many days. There will be no gas in Wide Bay, I am told, for several weeks. The phone services were lost, including, very embarrassingly, the triple-0 network. That is obviously an issue we need to address for the future. Central and North Queensland did not have the triple-0 network for several days. People who rely on wireless telephones or internet were similarly affected—indeed, the mobile phone network was also out—once the electricity was lost in most places. Without electricity, it only takes a day or two for the batteries to go flat and then all communication is lost. So there is a need to look at some of those issues.


The final point I make is that there has been a lot of talk about betterment: the need to rebuild facilities to make them better than they were. I visited Gayndah, and the mayor showed me their water intake facility out of the river, which was destroyed in 2011 and rebuilt exactly the same as it was and has now been destroyed again. If it had been built just a couple of metres higher, that issue would not have arisen. So I think we need to work with the various tiers of government to find ways to make sure that we learn from the experiences of infrastructure being lost and do not allow that to be repeated. A couple of mayors have canvassed the idea of giving people the opportunity, if they want to, to move out of the flood-prone area to higher land, and I think that is commendable. It has been done in the past—it was done a bit in Grantham—and, if we can do it more in the future, I think it will stand us in better stead to deal with these crises in the future.


I thank also all of those who helped with the disaster and acknowledge the assistance provided in my own city of Maryborough. My own office had floodwaters coming at it from both ends and we thought for a while that it might go under, but fortunately the flood did not go quite high enough for it to come into the office and so we were spared that inconvenience. But in reality many of my neighbours and a large part of the central shopping area did to go under. Those people face a huge fight back, and we as a nation and as the parliament have an obligation to stand beside them so that they can complete that task and get back to a normal life just as quickly as possible.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:24):  The Leader of the Opposition mentioned to me that it would be appropriate for the House to mark the passing of Dame Elisabeth Joy Murdoch. I am happy for the House to do so, and the Leader of the Opposition wishes to say a few words. As I am sure all members of the House are aware, Dame Elisabeth led a remarkable life in every way. It was remarkable for its length: she was born on 8 February 1909 and died on 5 December 2012. It was an incredible life—to have lived through such an era of change. It was a remarkable life for her generosity. She was a patron of and contributor to so many Victorian charities and beyond. She was noted for her philanthropy in every way, particularly in the arts but not just in the field of the arts. Dame Elisabeth was a very familiar figure to Victorians through her philanthropy. He life was remarkable too in its legacy: at her death she had 77 direct living descendants—an amazing thing. No matter at what age someone loses their mother, loses a parent, it is a painful thing. At the time of Dame Elisabeth's death I expressed my condolences to her children Helen, Rupert, Anne and Janet, and I do so here as well.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:25):  I too rise to acknowledge the remarkable life and contribution of Dame Elisabeth Joy Murdoch. She was the spouse of one of Australia's greatest newspapermen and she was the parent of one of the world's greatest newspapermen. She was also remarkable in her own right. She was president of the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne from 1954 to 1965. She helped found the Murdoch Children's Research Institute. She was the first female trustee of the National Gallery of Victoria. She was a major benefactor of the Australian Ballet, Opera Australia and the Royal Britannic Gardens. She contributed to at least 120 charities.


On a personal note: there was a period when the Australian newspaper, for which I then worked, refused to acknowledge the imperial honours in its reporting, but I am pleased to say that an exception was always made for Dame Elisabeth Murdoch. She led a great, remarkable and marvellous life. In celebrating this life of service, this parliament might encourage others to do their best to emulate it.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (15:23):  Speaker, could I just raise two matters with you on indulgence?



The SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister may.




Ms GILLARD:
  The first is in relation to Michelle Grattan of the press gallery. Before there was a female Governor-General, before there was a female Prime Minister—indeed, before you were Speaker, a woman performing that role—Michelle Grattan was there in the press gallery blazing a trail for women in what was, when she joined it, a very blokey industry indeed. What we can say about Michelle Grattan, though, is: any woman who has the nickname 'Cobber' obviously was able to make her own way in this blokey world.


Michelle Grattan is a watchword in Australian politics and in the Canberra press gallery for work ethic—anybody who has seen her in the press gallery so early in the morning and so late at night can attest to that—for a very old-fashioned devotion to accuracy—indeed, at an earlier stage in my parliamentary career I would frequently joke with Tim that if my phone went at 10.30 at night then it was Michelle Grattan checking copy for the next day—and for a relentless focus on the facts. She will be sorely missed in the press gallery, having announced, as she has, that she is off to The Conversation, so we will get the opportunity of her insights and experience in a different way.


I do ask myself in these circumstances, though: 'What explains the timing of this announcement? Who spoke to who about this announcement? Who was consulted about this announcement? And how long can this chaos in the press gallery go on?' I do ask myself these questions. But Michelle does go from the press gallery with the best of our sentiments, and I know she will continue to make a great contribution.


On a second matter, Speaker, if I can: I had the absolute delight earlier today to meet with Graham Tuckwell, along with members representing the Australian National University, the Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor. Graham Tuckwell and his wife, Louise, have given $50 million—let me just say it again: $50 million—to the Australian National University for a scholarship program that will provide scholarships of $100,000 for students to meet their residential living expenses. They want to, around the country, find those kids that have just got that absolutely extra-special edge and ability to make a contribution but who would not themselves be able to finance the residential costs of coming to Canberra and studying at the ANU. It is a philanthropic venture of truly awesome scale—$50 million. As soon as I sat down with Graham, I knew that I had found a kindred spirit—someone who shares a passion for education and for ensuring that people get the best opportunities in life. So, with a real sense of thanks, on behalf of the nation, thank you to Graham and Louise Tuckwell; thank you for what you will achieve with this money and thank you for the example that you have given our nation of philanthropy at its best.

",HoR,<title>STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE</title>,"<title>Grattan, Ms Michelle, Tuckwell, Mr Graham and Mrs Louise</title>",STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,6,1
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2013-02-05,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:27):  I, too, wish to congratulate Graham Tuckwell on his extraordinary act of philanthropy. Fifty million dollars to fund scholarships for people who might otherwise be unable to attend one of our finest universities is a truly remarkable gift to our nation. I believe this would be the largest ever philanthropic donation in Australia's history—certainly in education—and an absolutely massive contribution. Let us hope that the extraordinary example of Mr Tuckwell and his family is contagious amongst other Australians with the means to be as generous as they can be to worthy causes.


It would be a very different press gallery without Michelle Grattan, but fortunately she is not leaving the press gallery. She may be leaving Fairfax—and I have to say that I think it will be Fairfax's loss to lose Michelle Grattan—but she is not leaving the press gallery. Instead, she will be bringing online journalism to the press gallery in a big way. I think Michelle's presence as the greatest online journalist of the press gallery will certainly enhance the standing of online journalism in the days and weeks and months ahead.


Michelle is rightly acclaimed as a legend. Everyone who has ever been in this place has come to know Michelle. She is the epitome of professionalism. She is an absolute stickler for accuracy. But the great thing about Michelle is that she is a terrific human being. She is the toughest journalist you will ever encounter, but, while she has a very tough mind, a mind like a steel trap, she has a warm and generous heart. Anyone who has children who comes across her knows of Michelle's affection for kids and the respect and the love that she has for families. So I think we can all be grateful that we are going to be seeing a lot of Michelle in the years ahead and that her departure from Fairfax certainly does not mean her departure from the press gallery or this building.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:35):  I am a little disappointed that the Treasurer is not here to answer the charge. He made his announcement just before Christmas, and we have not seen him since. That just says everything about the Labor Party in government. We are the parties which offer stability and certainty; the Labor Party only offers chaos. Firstly, they cannot keep their word and, secondly, they cannot manage a budget. 


On over 500 occasions—and we have not even started on the other ministers—the Prime Minister and the Treasurer promised to deliver a surplus in 2012-13. The Treasurer alone did so on 366 occasions since 2 May 2010. It is one thing to come out with a promise and forecasts and projections; it is yet another thing to do so with language that is extremely emphatic. Their language was totally unqualified. They benchmarked their capacity to manage the economy against that unqualified promise. They benchmarked their capacity to lift the burden of a rising cost of living off everyday Australians against that unqualified promise to deliver a surplus. They used words such as 'ironclad commitment' and 'failure is not an option.' They said the surplus would be delivered 'come hell or high water'. 


These are the words of the Treasurer in this place at the time of the last budget. We all remember it because, when he said it, we all scoffed—because none of us believed it was going to be delivered. But the Treasurer stood in here just seven or eight months back, delivering the May budget, and solemnly said:


The four years of surpluses I announce tonight—


that was about where we scoffed—


are a powerful endorsement of the strength of our economy, resilience of our people, and success of our policies.


He went on to say:



This Budget delivers a surplus this coming year, on time, as promised, and surpluses each year after that, strengthening over time.


No qualification, no talk about revenue like the weasel words we heard from the Prime Minister today. Does anyone really understand what the Prime Minister said today? What she is saying is that she does not know how to explain it. But the Treasurer did not let us down. After setting that benchmark, he went further. In May the Treasurer went on:


The deficit years of the global recession are behind us. The surplus years are here.


Then he gave us a lecture about what a surplus means:


Surpluses that provide a buffer against global uncertainty, and continue to give the Reserve Bank room to cut interest rates for families like it did just last week.


So how appropriate it is that he comes into this place and boasts about the fact that the Reserve Bank did not change interest rates? He is right. These are powerful words; this is not empty rhetoric. Let us go back to the original promise that was made when the Prime Minister solemnly said in a speech to the Australian people after she had knifed Kevin Rudd, for the first time, that the surplus was essential as a benchmark for the economic credibility of the government. Thank God for television! I apologise to my friends from the print media, but they are all going into TV these days at any rate—maybe not you, Sid. There are some people who still believe in print, and long may the printed word continue. In the election campaign we thanked God for television because we have it all on tape—all the solemn promises at the community meetings, all the benchmarks about how you cannot run the economy if you cannot manage the budget. It is a bounty of riches. What does it all mean? It all means that the Prime Minister told another fib. It was unqualified. It was emphatic. It was a benchmark for the government's economic performance claim. 


Of course the government did not just promise a surplus; they claimed to have delivered it already. On 24 June 2010 the Prime Minister said:


… we saved jobs, stayed out of recession and got back to surplus.


The last time Labor delivered a surplus was in 1989-90—before the member for Longman was born. What a glorious year 1989-90 was. On the eve of Christmas, the Treasurer admitted delivering the surplus was unlikely:


… dramatically lower tax revenue now makes it unlikely that there will be a surplus in 2012-13.


I wonder how the Assistant Treasurer feels about that. I do not quite have it at hand, but I seem to recall the Assistant Treasurer boasting to his constituents in Lindsay that the government had delivered a surplus. Do we all remember that? The member for Lindsay, who has now dropped the tone of his voice a few decibels in an attempt to be earnest, has to explain what happened to the surplus that he said to the people of Lindsay he had delivered. Here it is: it is headed, 'Our strong economy—how is it working for you?' Commodore, listen to this; do not be distracted by the new Attorney-General. Are you familiar with this? You sent it to your constituents. Under 'Australia's economic report card', it says:


… back in surplus, on time, as promised—in these uncertain global times there's no clearer sign of a strong economy than a surplus.


Come home spinner; come home Commodore—your mission is complete. But we have not finished with you, old china. Now we are getting all the weasel words from the government; more excuses. The Treasurer said:


We ought to be very clear about why this is the case—


That is, why they cannot get back to surplus—



it's not because the government is spending too much, it's because we didn't collect the amount of taxes we expected to collect.


So all of you Australians, you are at fault—you are not paying enough tax. It is your fault. The Prime Minister repeated that today. I could not believe my ears when I was watching intently the Prime Minister's speech at the National Press Club. The Prime Minister was determined to lock in her leadership by committing herself to an election on 14 September. Then she was prepared to commit Australians to more pain. She said Australians are not paying enough tax and that the Australian people are to blame for the government breaking over 500 promises to deliver a surplus this year. So the Australian people are to blame. The Prime Minister has a history of blaming people—she blames Kevin Rudd, she blames John Howard, she blames the G20, she blames Rob McClelland, she blames Joel Fitzgibbon and she blames her caucus. How do you feel, old china, being blamed for leaking against the government?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for North Sydney will refer to members by their seat or their title.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker; I am trying to be familiar. I apologise. I am just hoping to encourage them to be more honest with those journalists who seem to sit in caucus. It is hugely important to recognise that this Prime Minister does not accept personal responsibility for her actions. We need to have a leader that is prepared to accept personal responsibility for their actions. Revenue this year has been expected to increase by $37 billion above last year.




Mr Craig Kelly:
  Increase?




Mr HOCKEY:
  Increase—that is, the increase on last year. So this government gets $37 billion of extra revenue and then it blames the Australian people for not paying more tax. That is an 11 per cent increase on last year's tax take, and still they blame the Australian people and say, 'Australians, you aren't paying enough tax.' Of a total budget of around $370 billion—$360 billion, say, of revenue—they say that a $3 billion, $4 billion, $5 billion or $6 billion fall in revenue is 'devastating'. That is why they cannot live within their means. Devastating—a fall of barely one per cent of revenue, and all of a sudden the house of cards comes down.


Look at Labor. Look at what they say and then look at what they actually do. Remember: last year they said they would have a deficit of $22 billion. What happened? It ended up being $44 billion, as the Prime Minister tried to shore up her leadership against the member for Griffith. It is all about that paradigm. The Labor Party is talking all about itself—about its leadership, about who gets what job, about how it can manage to trick the Australian people. In the meantime, the Australian people have a government that does not care about what they think, does not care about the cost-of-living burden and does not care about the challenges for families in everyday life. This government just cares about winning the election.


It is the Labor Party that has delivered the four largest deficits in Australian history. It is the Labor Party that in five years has borrowed over $200 billion—$200 billion! The interest alone on that is $7 billion a year, and that $7 billion a year would immediately fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It would immediately fund the Gonski reforms. But, instead of that, now we know that Labor is going to increase taxes. Look out, superannuants; look out, every worker of Australia: the Labor Party is coming after you. They have said it; they have background-briefed the media on it: they want to start taxing Australians over the age of 60 when they take their super. That is coming, as sure as night follows day. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, the Labor Party does not have the guts to be honest with the Australian people. 


They have more problems. They say to us: 'You've got a problem about the mining tax.'



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  Well, let me let you into something, old china—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order!




Mr Dreyfus:
  Mr Deputy Speaker—




Mr HOCKEY:
  I'm sorry—old mate.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Attorney-General will resume his seat. The member for North Sydney—




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker—china plate, mate.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I have called member for North Sydney to order once—




Mr HOCKEY:
  I understand. I am letting you into something, Mr Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, no. I asked him before to refer to members by their titles—




Mr HOCKEY:
  Sure. It was a general statement.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  and I ask the member to withdraw that—




Mr HOCKEY:
  China—mate. Let me—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You have been asked to withdraw.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Okay, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott; whatever you want. I withdraw. I would say to the new Attorney—




Mr Dreyfus:
  Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I wish to raise a different point of order from the standing orders that you have been drawing attention to, which is that the member for North Sydney needs to direct his remarks to the chair.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the Attorney-General for his assistance. The member for North Sydney has the call.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I say to you that this is a government that cannot live within its means; and, when the government cannot live within its means, it defaults to higher taxes and new borrowings. The Labor Party, over five years, has introduced 27 new or increased taxes. Remember the alcopops tax, the flood levy, the carbon tax and now a mining tax that hardly raises a dollar? Only Wayne Swan could introduce a new tax that hardly raises a dollar and brings down two prime ministers. That man is a genius as Treasurer! And it leaves the budget worse off. Their mining tax package leaves the budget worse off. Their carbon tax package leaves the budget worse off. What does that mean when you add the borrowings, the $200 billion of new borrowings, that Labor is out there collecting? And let's be frank: whenever the government borrows money, it is borrowing future taxes from our children, because someone has to pay the money back. 


So the Labor Party's call on the Australian people is higher, much higher, than anything in the coalition years, because when we were in government for 11 years we did not borrow a dollar—not a dollar—but the Labor Party has borrowed over $200 billion. This is what the Labor Party does. It completely trashes the joint, tries to claim the high moral ground and leaves Australians to pick up the pieces and pay the bills. Labor writ large are a disaster for Australia, and the sooner they are gone the better.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (15:50):  We have seen, over the last couple of months, the full impact of revenue write-downs. In particular, most recently we have seen revenue write-downs of amounts in the order of $20 billion. These, in their broader context, represent the fact that somewhere in the order of $160 billion worth of revenue write-downs have been experienced over the last couple of years. That, in part, has been as a result of the global financial crisis and its ongoing effects. It has been about the impacts of the international economy and the challenges that have been faced right around the globe.


The fact remains that the Australian economy is one of the most resilient in the world. It is indeed the envy of most developed nations across the global economy at the moment. That is a fact that is beyond dispute. For all of the talking-down of the economy that we hear from those opposite, we know that when they travel internationally, as they do, they stand up in international fora and spruik very loudly just how successful the Australian economy has been in getting through difficult global challenges. Of course, we recognise that despite the underlying economic indicators—as strong as they continue to be, as resilient as they continue to be—the multispeed nature of our economy presents challenges across the economy and that there are some people who are not sharing in the wealth that those figures would otherwise indicate might flow through to them.


We make no apologies for having a fiscal policy that will support jobs. That is absolutely central to our DNA. If you look at the record of this government you will see that it was this government which protected the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Australians during the global financial crisis. While we were focused on protecting the jobs of hardworking Australians, those opposite were distracted by a whole range of things. We all recall that the Leader of the Opposition—he was not the Leader of the Opposition back then—did not even show up to vote when the stimulus package was before the parliament. The decision we have taken is that, given the write-downs in revenues, we no longer think it is appropriate to continue to make further cuts in order to return the budget to surplus because we believe further cuts at this stage will jeopardise job opportunities and the prospects of our economy more broadly. That is the decision we have taken in the national interest. If those opposite were honest about the challenges we face as a nation, if those opposite were honest about what has occurred since the global financial crisis, their contributions would be somewhat less hysterical than what we have seen here today. 


When it comes to the question of the surplus, those opposite speak as though it is beyond doubt that, if they are returned to government, they will simply return the budget to surplus. It is worth having a look at what they have had to say, because they have been all over the shop on this issue. I saw the member for North Sydney in here with bundles of photocopies. It is not hard policy work over the summer to be sitting at the Xerox machine photocopying pieces of paper to bring in here and to put them on the table and suggest that somehow the size of the bundle of papers you flop down on the dispatch box gives greater weight to your arguments. The only policy document, or anything that resembles a policy document, they have is the little leaflet we have seen them brandishing around. A little leaflet is not a substitute for real and costed policies. That is what the Australian people are expecting of the people who parade around as an alternate government. With the date of the election now having been determined, there will be increasingly greater pressure on the opposition to come clean not just on their future plans but also on the things they have already announced and on the true impact and cost of those plans.


On the question of the surplus, the little pamphlet—the poor excuse for a fig leaf protecting their lack of policy detail—says 'we will live within our means, get the budget back under control and pay back debt'. It is funny that they do not make a commitment to a surplus. A couple of pages later it goes on:


… we’ll immediately establish a Commission of Audit—to identify savings and efficiencies in all areas of government so we can start delivering real and sustainable budget surpluses into the future.


Once again, there is no commitment to a surplus. When Mr Abbott was  pressed on the question of the surplus he said, 'We have to see their figures before we can tell you exactly what we'll do.' We know how consistent the economic message has been from those opposite. In fact, on the very same day, when the shadow Treasurer was asked a question on the coalition's commitment to a surplus, he said:




Our commitment is emphatic. Based on the numbers published today we will deliver a surplus in our first year and every year after that.



The Leader of the Opposition says, 'We need more information'; the shadow Treasurer says, 'Don't worry—in our first year and every year in office we will deliver a surplus.' For a mob that want to run an election on the issue of trust, I think they are going to have to do a little bit more than expect the Australian people to make that gigantic leap of faith. It seems that the pressure of the statements made by the member for North Sydney then applied to the Leader of the Opposition, who decided he needed to firm up his position. On 28 January—this was three separate positions on the one-day—when asked: 'Joe Hockey has been saying that the coalition would be able to deliver a surplus based on the numbers available today. Is he right? Can the coalition deliver a surplus?' the Leader of the Opposition said, 'Yes, he is. We believe we can deliver surpluses in each year of the first term of a coalition government.' That was three positions in one day from two people. That is the sort of policy consistency we are getting. Then, the following day, Mr Hockey said:


Our commitment is emphatic … we will deliver a surplus in the first year and every year after that. 


It raises the question: if they are so determined, so committed and so certain that they are going to deliver a surplus, why will they not bring forward the policies they are going to take to the Australian people to show how they are going to pay for them? They cannot get the budget back to surplus while cutting taxes, which they tell us they are going to do, and increasing expenditure, as there is so much evidence they intend to do. It just does not add up.


The member for North Sydney announced on breakfast television to the world at large that the coalition does have a $70 billion black hole in their costings brought about by their commitment to repealing the carbon price and repealing the mining tax. But they have failed to be clear and honest with the Australian people about what they intend to do with the associated expenditure, with the compensation and with the other assistance to pensioners and to families and to tax cuts. 


Last night on television we saw Mr Pyne say that all of that is up in the air. So, when they run around the country saying they are going to repeal the carbon price, they also need to come clean on what they are going to do with the assistance. Are they going to rip away the family assistance? Are they going to rip away the increases in pensions? Are going to rip away tax cuts for small business? Are they going to unwind the tripling of the tax-free threshold which will mean that one million Australians will not have to submit a tax return because their first $18,200 will be tax-free?






Are they going to unwind that? Are they going to return it to $6,000? Are they going to do that and slug low-income people, middle-income earners and, in particular, those such as women and part-time workers? Is that what they intend to do? It is about time they became honest with the Australian people. There are only two policies that they have been honest about. They said they would scrap the schoolkids bonus. I noticed over the last week or two Mr Abbott running around saying that he is the best friend that Western Sydney has ever had. He might want to explain to the families of Western Sydney—the families of the 160,000-plus schoolkids whose parents receive the schoolkids bonus in order to support them in their return to school—how he is going to ease their cost-of-living pressures by ripping that money away. What is the impact of this? We know those opposite think that it does not get spent on school expenses. 


In the Penrith Press last week, Mrs Boorer, a mother with five children, had this to say about the schoolkids bonus: 'While it was always a stressful time—the return to school—it was made easier by the federal government's schoolkids bonus scheme. I've used the money to buy everything for school including uniforms, school shoes, joggers and stationery. I think it's great and I don't know how I would have got the money without it. As it is, the $1,230 we received in January did not cover everything, so without the payment I would have had to put everything on credit.' 


The way these characters opposite operate is that they talk about public finances but rip away assistance and rip away support. The net result is that families end up carrying the debt. If you want to talk about debt, have a look at the increase in indebtedness of families in this country over the entire time that those opposite were in office. That might give you a better picture of the impact of their policies. 


On the question of when their policies will be ready—the $70-billion question that the Australian people want answered—back in June 2011, Mr Hockey said, 'We intend to release our policies and costings by the end of next week.' We know that did not happen. We also know that Mr Robb, who is in the chamber—he has been pretty quiet of late—also backed the fact that that work had been undertaken and that the policies and costings would be released at that time. But they were not released. We have now heard from Mr Abbott, who says, 'The coalition will release our costings after the government releases theirs, after the budget and before polling day.' Thanks very much for that! Why don't you roll out your policies now and start giving the Australian people the opportunity to measure the impact of those policies? 


There has been a lot of inconsistency about when they will actually front up. But I think the person who gets the prize for the best contribution is the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, who on radio this morning came up with a slightly different take on the timing of the opposition releasing their costings. She was being interviewed by Fran Kelly, who said: 'You'll have all the numbers you need when the budget is released on 14 May, as of budget night. So there'll be no excuse, will there, for the coalition not to move on releasing costings for their policies?' Bishop said, 'Well, that's not correct, Fran.' Kelly said, 'Why not?' Bishop said, 'Well, the full impact of the budget is not known until 30 September.' That is after the election. Are you telling us that your position now is that you are only going to front up and provide the Australian people with your costings after the election? If that does not scare the living daylights out of Australians all around this country, then I will tell you what should. It is the fact that those opposite have said that they will do exactly what Campbell Newman did: they will set up a commission of audit and they will call in someone like Costello or some other individual to go through the budget line by line and work out which forms of assistance that are currently being delivered into the bank accounts of Australians all around this country—which payments, which services—need to be ripped away in order to fund the $70 billion-plus black hole that we already know they have. They have a $70 billion black hole because they have made these promises about cutting taxes. 


The member for North Sydney was jumping up and down saying, 'We will cut taxes.' What about his monster parental leave tax? It is a $12 billion tax to fund a parental leave scheme that shovels all of these benefits into the wealthiest parts of the country. Who is going to pay for it? Mums and dads and pensioners all around the country will pay for it, and they will pay for it when they pay for their groceries and at the bowser. In addition to that, they want to jack up taxes on superannuation for the lowest paid workers, because that is what you get under a Liberal government. (Time expired)

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2013-02-05,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (16:05):  Sadly, we start this year as we finished the last—with the member for Lindsay not even spending 30 seconds addressing the subject of the matter of public importance and not spending one second trying to establish how this government may in fact return to surplus. The bottom line is that they have no surplus—we have all heard that from the Treasurer's mouth, after hundreds of comments to the contrary—but they also have no plan. They have absolutely no idea: no fiscal strategy. We saw today the ducking and weaving and the avoidance of the issue. They have no idea how to get this country back on track financially. That is what is eating at the heart of certainty. That is what is eating at the heart of any sense of stability. It is why people are not spending. It is why they are paying off the mortgage. It is why companies are not investing around this country. And now we have the government trashing the messenger. Don't trash the messenger. We are just reporting the facts. As the Prime Minister likes to say, we are reporting the facts. Do not start that time-worn technique of attacking the messenger. 


The time has come for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to stop crying wolf about the economy and to start taking responsibility for the problems that they themselves have created—




Mr Dreyfus:


Crying wolf ?




Mr ROBB:
  Yes, crying wolf. It is a common statement. It might be a little bit below the echelons of the High Court and other forums. Crying wolf: we heard it again today from the Prime Minister in her answer to the first question, in her answer to the second question and in her answers to all subsequent questions about the surplus. All we heard was her blaming Treasury; it is all Treasury's fault now. It is all someone else's fault. We have heard endlessly year in, year out that it is someone else's fault; that they never get there because of someone else; that the dog ate her homework today. These are the sorts of things they are starting to resort to. 


The Treasurer says that delivering a surplus is all too hard, and he has given up. He is blaming a shortfall in tax revenue. We heard the Treasurer before Christmas—he is on the record—saying: 


But what we've had here is a huge revenue whack if you like, out of the blue, which has made it very hard to get to surplus in 2012/13. 


This is nonsense. There is no 'whack out of the blue'. There is no 'whack', in fact. If you look at the Treasurer's own MYEFO documents, the truth of the matter is that, over the first four months of this financial year, revenue to the government went up 9.2 per cent. I can tell you that there are a lot of households in Australia which could do pretty well with an increase of 9.2 per cent in revenue—pretty well indeed. The thing is that revenues are steadily growing but they cannot catch up with the rate of spending. This is the problem. They cannot catch up with the rate of spending—a rate of spending of four per cent ahead of last year already. There is already a four per cent increase. These are the ones who preach about fiscal rectitude, and in the first four months there is a four per cent increase off an already bloated spending base—a result of the excessive spending year in, year out. 


Labor do not have a revenue problem. They never had a revenue problem. They have a spending-and-forecasting problem. This is a government that has constantly and deliberately assumed unachievable levels of future revenue year in, year out. At every budget they make these unbelievable forecasts. They then go and spend that money, and when it does not come in it is, 'Woe is me; cry wolf; it's somebody else's fault.' The fact is that they made these unbelievably inaccurate, politically inspired forecasts on revenue, which they never reached, and then they spend it—by God, do they spend it! This government has caused this problem. 


If we look at MYEFO, we see that the company Macroeconomics—which is staffed by former Treasury and Finance officials—nailed it. Macroeconomics argues that the budget should already be in surplus by at least $15 billion, or around one per cent of GDP, at this point. How true that is. This is not a question of future surpluses. This government should have been in surplus a year ago. Macroeconomics go on: 'The Treasurer is in this predicament mostly because in the five budgets ending with MYEFO 2012-13 he has a track record as a net discretionary policy spender at around $120 billion, who failed along with his financial fiscal partner, Finance Minister Penny Wong, to ensure a return to surplus regardless of a weaker economy.' That is the point. Sure there was a GFC; it was five years ago, but there was a GFC. We had just one quarter of negative growth. Why did we have that? There are three or four reasons—and long before the stimulus, I might add. We had just one quarter of negative growth because this government inherited a situation where there was no debt. In fact, there was $70 billion in net reserves—a $20 billion surplus. 


Firstly, the government inherited the most healthy economy in the developed world. Secondly, this government had the benefit, as it should, from the flexible exchange rate. In the first quarter of 2009, the dollar, you might recall, dropped to 60c. The Chinese bought massive amounts of our resources to capitalise on the 60-cent dollar. We had the biggest trade surplus in the country's history. As well, interest rates dropped 3¼ per cent between October 2008 and the end of the first quarter in 2009. Many families had more money in their pockets because of the reduction in interest rates than they had had for many, many years. These things drove economic growth in this country. 


Then the government made the second raft of stimulus spending. They always avoid the fact that we said, 'You should support the first one'—and we did. In October there was a crisis of confidence; it needed to be addressed. We recognised it and we supported the government, but they never admit to that—just cheap politics. They are just trying to position us in a way which is totally irresponsible and which misrepresents the facts. The fact of the matter is that we supported sensible, stable spending when it was needed. What we did not support was reckless spending, which was invariably politically inspired, with pink batts and wasteful school halls. 


There were lots of other ways in which they could have reduced the cost. If they had really wanted to save jobs they would have reduced the cost of doing business with that spending, not splashed it around on politically inspired initiatives which ended up with the biggest waste in this nation's history. This is a government that had all the benefits. Since then, they have had a 150-year high in the terms of trade. They have wasted the mining boom. They have wasted the great strength of the economy that they inherited all for political gains—all to just parade their spending to incessantly buy votes all around the country. 


This is a government which has not sought to govern and manage the finances in the national interest. They have wasted the boom at a time when the rest of the world has found it more difficult—especially the northern hemisphere, where the GFC really hit, not the southern hemisphere. They had this 150-year high. In fact, the terms of trade today are still 30 per cent higher than when the Howard government lost office. You would not think that from listening to the Treasurer. Where is this 'whack out of the blue' if the terms of trade is still 30 per cent higher than it was five years ago? They have benefited from endless increases in revenue and economic growth, but all the while they have wasted it. They have spent it like drunken sailors. 


That is why we have a problem.


We will not be lectured by a Labor government that have $120 billion of unfunded promises sitting on the table and that have spent $172 billion more than they have received, have no surplus and have no plan to get back in control of our nation's finances. Instead of a government that must stop crying wolf, we need to have a government that start to take responsibility for the problems that they themselves have created.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:15):  It is a pleasure to rise today to speak on an important issue of economic management. When we talk about the importance of good budget management it is important to remember one simple fact: if the tax-to-GDP ratio today were the same as it was under the Howard government then the budget would be strongly in surplus.




Dr Emerson:
  By more than $20 billion.




Dr LEIGH:
  By more than $20 billion, I am informed by the minister. But if the tax-to-GDP ratio under the Howard government had been what it is today then many of their budgets would have been in deficit. That is a simple fact which those opposite cannot deny. Driving things at the moment are two big factors, a double-whammy on revenues. First of all, mineral prices have softened, and that has brought down corporate revenue. Second, the Australian dollar remains high. Why does the Australian dollar remain high? Because Europe is underperforming. With Europe underperforming, investors are looking around the world to where they can find AAA-rated government debt. And they are finding it in Australia, one of the few countries that maintain that AAA rating. Despite the fact that minerals prices are coming off, the Australian dollar remains high. So this double-whammy hits revenues, and this is the reason that revenues for 2012-13 are $20 billion down from what Treasury projected in 2010.


What should a government do under those circumstances? Prior to Christmas there was a suite of policy advice coming at the government from across the political spectrum. John Quiggin and Warwick McKibbin do not agree on every issue in public finance, but they were among the many economists who were saying that as revenue fell it was not the best approach to fill the government's revenue shortfall by making further budget cuts. The OECD and the IMF were among those saying the same thing. So that was what drove the Treasurer's announcement before Christmas.


But it is important to put this in a broader context. We have had a few bits of history being disinterred over recent times—we have just discovered where Richard III is buried. And, thanks to an IMF report, we have discovered a little bit about past budget practices in Australia. An IMF report released in January examined 200 years of government financial records across 55 leading economies. It identified two periods of fiscal profligacy in recent years. When were those periods? Well, if you listened to those opposite, you would be led to think that it was under the current government. But in fact that is not what the IMF found. The IMF found that those two periods of fiscal profligacy were under John Howard's term in office in 2003 and during his final years in office from 2005 to 2007.


Why did that fiscal profligacy occur? A report by David Hetherington and Dominic Prior from Per Capita called After the party: how Australia spent its mining boom windfall found:


The Howard Government gave at least $25 billion away in tax cuts and concessions … It used another $50 billion on inflated spending programs …


As a result, the report concluded, 'we missed the opportunity to invest $75 billion in long-term productive assets'. And the Howard government, of course, was unable to make the tough decisions that have been made under this government.


Stephen Koukoulas has observed that during their combined total of more than 20 years in office the Fraser and Howard governments never once cut real spending. Labor governments have cut real spending on five occasions since the mid-1980s. In the last five years we have found savings of $138 billion, and they have not been easy savings to find. When we means tested the family tax benefits and the private health insurance rebate, those opposite said we were playing 'the politics of envy'. When we phased out the outdated dependent spouse tax rebate, a measure that discourages work by secondary earners, we were told we were attacking the family. When we reduced the baby bonus for second and subsequent children, the member for North Sydney drew comparisons with China's one child policy. That is how serious those opposite are about finding savings.


But you do not have to take my word for it. The IMF's article IV report from 16 November said:


The authorities' adept handling of the fallout from the GFC, their prudent economic management, and strong supervision of the financial sector, has kept Australia on the dwindling list of AAA rated countries.


The OECD economic surveys Australia 14 December said:


Adjustment to the mining boom so far has produced favourable results, thanks to the robust macroeconomic policy framework and the largely decentralised wage setting system …


Authorities at the OECD think we have got the balance right on industrial relations, unlike those opposite.


At the same time we have been making the right investments. In my own electorate of Fraser the ANU has seen an increase in enrolments, up from 6,350 to 7,086. That is part of a nationwide increase of 150,000 in student numbers. ANU funding is up $130 million, and 15,000 more students nationally are getting youth allowance. And, as the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition did, I acknowledge the very generous donation today from Graham Tuckwell of $50 million to improve scholarship opportunities at the Australian National University.


This morning I joined the minister for transport, the member for Eden-Monaro, Senator Lundy and the member for Canberra at the sod-turning for the Majura Parkway, the biggest ever road investment in the ACT—$288 million, half federal, half ACT, which could teach the New South Wales government a lesson about co-contribution—an important road which will take the pressure off traffic in my electorate.


By contrast, those opposite have been coy about what will happen if they come to office. Senator Sinodinos said that the opposition was doing something like the dance of the seven veils, which does make one wonder whose head is going to be on the platter. Senator Abetz said that the opposition was offering a policy skeleton and that only further down the track would there be flesh on the bones.


But yesterday the cat was belled in the form of Senator Humphries. Senator Gary Humphries is now facing a preselection challenge from Zed Seselja, who assured the people of Brindabella of his undying loyalty just a few short months ago but has now decided that he would prefer to abandon them for a shot at the red carpet. When querying this on PM Agenda yesterday, the interviewer said that under an Abbot-led government the interests of the people of Canberra would not rate. Senator Humphries said, 'Well, it is a question then of making sure they are constrained in the knowledge that this impacts very badly on one of their colleagues.' Senator Humphries is now admitting that an Abbot government would impact 'very badly' on the ACT.


He said in another interview:


Canberra is going to be facing very heavy pressures. We know that this city will be the subject of some very tough decisions by an incoming government.


We know why that is: the member for Canning, in a previous debate, described public servants as those who feed on others. The member for North Sydney gets the Public Service numbers wrong every time he stands up to speak on them and thinks that there has been an extra 20,000 public servants, a number in which he appears to be including Defence Force reservists as public servants. That now seems to be their new target for public sector job cuts—20,000 public servants. Those opposite say that they have an aspirational target for job creation, but the only policy they have released on jobs is a target for job destruction. It is a target for getting rid of 20,000 Canberra public servants.


Let me just finish with an article that I would commend to members of the House on 'The limits of hairshirt economics' by Tony Abbott, from the Adelaide Review, November 1994. This is an article in which the Leader of the Opposition questioned the floating of the dollar. He said as follows:


The floating dollar remains an article of faith with the leadership of both main parties, notwithstanding its exceedingly dubious outcome for Australia—

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2013-02-05,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:25):  We have this first debate of this first day of the parliament this year appropriately on another major broken promise from this government. When we last sat, the Treasurer—who is not present for this debate, as usual—was still insisting that his budget would be in surplus. As the shadow Treasurer pointed out during question time and at the beginning of this debate, the Treasurer, together with the Prime Minister, promised on 500 occasions that the budget would be in surplus this year. Before he departs, I would remind the previous speaker that he gleefully jumped to his feet the day after the budget on a tax law amendment bill, from memory, and talked about how important it was to get the budget back to surplus.


We have had a lot of obfuscation from those opposite, but let me suggest that the previous speaker, who was an economist before entering this place, knows in his heart of hearts that this government's approach to the budget is dysfunctional. He, along with the Treasurer, promised that the budget would return to surplus. I think he believed the Treasurer. But what the Australian people now know is that the only thing you can believe about any government promise is that it will not be delivered.


We started this parliament with the Prime Minister announcing that she would deliver a carbon tax that before the election she pledged would never occur. All of last year, we heard the Treasurer and the Prime Minister proclaiming that they would deliver a budget surplus. 'No ifs, no buts'—that is a quote. All of those quotes, without any wriggle room, were repeatedly defiant. All we know is that, while they were still insisting in the dying days of last year's parliament there would be a surplus, they were preparing to ditch the pledge. That is why they brought forward the mid-year economic forecasts to October. That is why the announcement by the Treasurer was made once he could avoid the scrutiny of this parliament; it was made in the days leading up to Christmas.


If you look at this government's approach, it is not only its fiscal and economic mismanagement that concerns the Australian people, who pay the price for it every day; it is this government's deliberate approach of breaking promises and its looseness with the truth at every opportunity. There have been so many broken promises and so many solemn pledges, but this budget surplus pledge that was broken before Christmas will sum up and define this government right through until election day, an election that was called just a few days ago.


When you look at the words of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—their defiant words—it is quite clear that the public should judge them on two criteria. The public should judge them harshly on their broken promise and they should judge them according to their own words: 'You can't run this country if you can't manage its budget.' That was a proclamation from the Prime Minister on 14 April 2011. You have heard the other proclamations, day in, day out. Every member of the Liberal and National parties has sat here and heard the Treasurer and the Prime Minister every day promise a budget surplus and outline the necessity for it in terms of budget management, in terms of reducing cost-of-living pressures, in terms of budget responsibility.


All the time, those opposite had their fingers crossed behind their backs, because, when they make a promise and they cannot meet it, they push it out a year. We have seen it before on their budget management. Straight after the last election, they said that, for the financial year just gone, the budget would be $12 billion in deficit. By May 2011, it was $22 billion. By budget night, it was $44 billion. So it was a blow-out from—let's be generous and forget the $12 billion—a $22 billion forecast to $44 billion, in one year. And now the government expect the Australian people to believe anything they say on the budget. As I said last year in one of the final MPI debates of the year: with that sort of record for accuracy, if Wayne Swan were competing in the archery, the only safe place to watch would be on television. After that speech, the member for Bennelong pointed out that it would be equally safe to stand in front of the target, which he was quite right about!


But the serious point of all this is that the Australian people pay for Labor's failure. Labor's budget failure and budget deceit here in Canberra are paid for by families and small businesses right across Australia. As the shadow Treasurer pointed out, they are paid for in the net interest cost of that debt—$7 billion a year, just to keep it. That is to keep it; that is not to pay a dollar off. The latest projection is $147 billion—when they started with $45 billion in cash in the bank. As the shadow Treasurer pointed out, it is the families of Australia, the children of today, who will have to pay it back tomorrow. Those opposite expect the public to believe that, with their track record of mismanagement and deceit, they can be relied upon by the Australian public. I will tell you what the Australian people and the small businesses of Australia can rely on from the government. If the government have their way, they will do more of what they have done in the last four years. That is the only rock-solid certainty.


Five years ago—a Prime Minister ago—those opposite, including the minister at the table, the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness, were settling into a new government and a new parliament. Just months earlier, the then Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, had said, 'This reckless spending must stop.' Nearly $200 billion ago, he said, 'This reckless spending must stop'! I think those on this side of the House would agree with me when I say that, if you look back at every statement made by those opposite in the lead-up to the 2007 election, from the member for Griffith being a 'fiscal conservative' right through, it is very hard to find a single statement that turned out to be true. But there is one, and it was made by the member for Kingsford Smith, who said to a journalist, in an unguarded moment, 'Once we get in, we'll just change it all.' Hasn't he proved to be right!

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:35):  On this matter of public importance, when we start talking about budgets, fiscal positions, surpluses, deficits and where the country and the economy are at, we should at least start with facts; we should at least start by making some things clear. The reason we are in the position we find ourselves in today is not a matter of spending but a matter of revenue. One thing is clear and is borne out in the detail, the facts, all the work and all the data, and all the economists agree: what we are talking about today is not a matter of spending; this is a matter of revenues.


Any government and any Treasury, or Treasurer, will understand that your fortunes are based on two things in terms of what you can deliver in an economy, and they are how much you spend and how much you get in. We have been very good in terms of our position and what we have been able to deliver. There has never been a government that has needed to work harder to maintain a strong economy and grow jobs, but that is exactly what we have done. This has been a great challenge and one that the Gillard-Swan government has met. We have delivered. Not since the Great Depression have we seen a devastating global position where the global economy has collapsed and impacted greatly on the Australian economy. Never has there been a higher demand on the government to get it right, to make sure that, when you swing the pendulum to ensure continued growth and jobs, to ensure the future of the Australian economy, you swing the pendulum far enough that you get it right. If you do not swing that pendulum far enough, you miss the opportunity to save jobs, to continue growth, to look after the people you are meant to be looking after—the Australian public, the Australian community. Never before has an Australian government risen to that challenge in more difficult circumstances, but risen to the challenge we have.


After the global financial crisis and a continued downturn in global economies and markets—something that the opposition seem to flick away and say, 'It's been five years, so why haven't the government fixed it all yet?'—it seems that it is a little bit larger than just the Australian economy. When we talk about the global financial crisis, one that impacts directly on all of the OECD countries, we should at least be honest about the facts, honest about what happened, honest about what we needed to do. We were honest about the tough decisions we needed to make to ensure that we continued the growth and to make sure we continued to have people employed. They were the challenges that we met. At the same time the United States—the largest economy in the world which underpins the global economy—basically went into a deep recession. Europe, the OECD countries and every other economy in the world went into recession, but the Australian economy has remained resilient.




Mr Craig Kelly:
  China. What about China?




Mr RIPOLL:
  I will take the interjection, because China is, of course, an important part of our economy. Where have you been for the last 20 years? It is as if the member has just thought of it. The genius on the other side has just thought of saying 'China' because he thinks it has never been mentioned in this place before. Just like every other economy, China has its ups and it has its downs. If you have a look at the data you will notice that China has gone from plus 11 per cent growth to 10, to nine, to 8½, to eight, to 7½ per cent. While China remains a key part of our economy, it is not the only thing that we have and need to maintain.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr RIPOLL:
  This is the sort of interjection we get from the geniuses across the other side. Come up with something new! A year 12 student doing a report can come up with just saying 'China'. So, even though all of these things have taken place—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr RIPOLL:
  Don't you love it when you get their backs up? Don't you just love it? Don't you love it when you have hit that raw nerve? In 10 minutes they will be up; of course they will.


While all this has been going on globally we have met those challenges, but we have done a little bit more than that. If that was all that we had done then I would probably agree that we just had not done enough. It is not good enough just to say that we have tried to maintain growth—and we have done that—or, since we came to government, create a further 800,000 jobs. If that was it, if that was all that you did, maybe you would be open to some criticism that said, 'Well, you just haven't done enough.'


We did a lot more. When we came to government in 2007 we acknowledged something that had been hanging in the community for more than 20 years—through previous governments—that pensioners were doing it really tough and needed a massive increase. It was a Labor government that delivered that, and continues to deliver that. You cannot just wash that away and put it to one side and say that we did not manage economic growth. In our time in government we saw the creation of 800,000 jobs while the rest of the world lost 28 million jobs. Other economies were going backwards by miles and we had a resilient economy. It is still tough here; we all understand that. This is the point of this. It is still tough here and we still have a lot of work to do. But you need a government that can acknowledge this stuff, work with not only the good news in the good years but also the bad news in the tougher years, and that is what we have done. In fact, we have been recognised for that.


While the opposition were in government for almost 12 very long years—and they crow about their successes—not once could they achieve a triple-A rating across all three ratings agencies. Why is that? Because they did not do a good enough job. It is not good enough to just have money flowing in. What are you doing with it? What are you creating out of that money that is flowing in? Your task is not just to be a simple tax collector; it is about being a wealth creator. It is about creating jobs, creating an economy, productivity, innovation, supporting science, supporting education and supporting families. These are the tough things that we have to do. It is easy to do them when there is plenty of revenue coming in. It is just a little bit harder when those revenues start to diminish.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr RIPOLL:
  There is volatility and no-one can argue the volatility case. I will accept that if interjectors from the other side want to come in about volatility, iron ore prices, coal prices, resources and the high Australian dollar. We talk about this every day. You are not telling me anything new. But let's at least be honest about the facts, about the challenges that we all face and about what your response is. What is your response? What are you actually doing?


I am pretty proud to talk about our government's response and the things that we have done. Things that we have done include making sure we have a strong enough economy that has seen successive interest rates fall—decrease—which gives scope to the Reserve Bank of Australia. That means that, since Labor have come to government, families on a home loan mortgage of $300,000 are saving about $5,000 a year. They are saving $5,000 a year more than when the Liberals were in power. That is the difference. At the same time we have tripled the tax-free threshold. For ordinary people it is no longer $6,000; it is $18,200. That is the tax-free threshold. We have gone out there and we have recognised the need that, if you are going to keep an economy strong, you have to empower the people, empower the families by giving some of their hard-earned money back to them, and that is what we have done through the tax-free threshold.


It does not end there. We have recognised cost-of-living issues and pressures. So, what do you do? What is one of the direct ways you can help families, even in tough times? Sometimes you have got to help them a little bit more. You have got to make sure the economy keeps going and you do it through education. What better place could you do it than through education. The School Kids Bonus directly helps families, directly helps young mums and young dads and kids. One of the things that this mob is going to do if they get in is take that away.


The opposition have a big, giant crater of promises they have made, $70 billion worth, that they cannot fund. It is in black and white. That is what the shadow Treasurer said. How are they going to fund this? Easy. They will strip things away. They will strip away the bonuses for families. They talk about the different elements of how they are going to return to a surplus, but you have to go to the detail of what they are saying. They do not give you a date of when. They made a promise of guaranteeing there would be a surplus in every year of a coalition government, except now they have back-pedalled a little bit. Now they say, 'Well, it's when we can afford it.' There is no date, and they say, 'Well, we'll see.' So it has gone from the rock-solid guaranteed promise of 'every single year' to 'suddenly it doesn't happen' and then 'we will just see what happens in the future.'


I want to remind you about something else, which is really important. How do you build the nation? What do you do for the country? Things like NBN, great infrastructure projects. This government has spent more in two terms—in three terms—on infrastructure than any other government in the past has spent in any of its terms.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr RIPOLL:
  That is true. I am thinking ahead already. We have done more in those terms in delivering on infrastructure, but there is something that is really important in those two terms since we came to government, and that is that the economy today is 13 per cent larger than when we came to office. We have actually grown the economy. It is not something you can argue; it is just a fact—it is 13 per cent larger. You also have to flick the coin the other way and look at what these guys are going to do. They have already told us what they are going to do and it is going to hurt families.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (16:45):  Given that this is my first opportunity to speak since the summer break, I would like to wish all members and the parliamentary staff a very healthy and prosperous 2013. Like other members, I appreciated the opportunity to catch up with my constituents over the summer break. One of my favourite places to spend some time is my local surf club. There is a bloke at the surf club that everyone knows as Dingo. I turned up there the other day and Dingo said: 'Jeez, there's been some bad news for Julia Gillard: Minister Roxon and Minister Evans are both leaving. But there's worse news: Wayne Swan is staying.' I said, 'Dingo, you're a bit harsh on the Treasurer.' Dingo has got it in for the Treasurer for some reason. I basically tried to defend the Treasurer in the interests of bipartisanship. I do try to defend the Treasurer a bit. I say, 'He's not that bad.' I said, 'It's a hard job to defend him.' But Dingo has been adamant. He has kept saying, 'This Treasurer can't even add up.'


Next Sunday when I see Dingo, I am going to have to apologise to him, because I think he is right. I think this Treasurer really has been treating the Australian people like mugs. This Treasurer has been misleading the Australian people with his repeated promises and repeated assurances that he could deliver a surplus in 2012-13. Honestly, if the treasurer of my local surf club ran the books the same way as this federal Treasurer runs the nation's budget, he would be run out of town. I want to refer to the Treasurer's budget speech on 8 May 2012. There really is no bigger stage for an Australian Treasurer than delivering his plan for the future on that night—to stand before the mums and dads of Australia and explain how the nation's books are looking. This is what the Treasurer had to say. This was the Treasurer's opening line on the biggest stage of the year, on live television:


The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the strength of our economy, resilience of our people, and success of our policies.


He is no shrinking violet, our Treasurer, is he? He continued:


In an uncertain and fast changing world, we walk tall—as a nation confidently living within its means.


This budget delivers a surplus this coming year, on time, as promised, and surpluses each year after that, strengthening over time.


That is our Treasurer on his biggest night of the year. He went on to say:


A surplus provides our best defence against dramatic changes in the global economy.


This is probably the best line of all. The speech writer deserves a medal for this one:


The deficit years of the global recession are behind us. The surplus years are here.


There he goes, but, as it has turned out, it was all a con. It is a myth, a mirage—just another Labor broken promise.


Instead of a surplus, we have another deficit heading our way, and it is proudly brought to you by the same Treasurer who has delivered record deficits, one after another, throughout his time in the portfolio. Those opposite would have seen all those polling results, and they are probably wringing their hands trying to figure out what the problem may be and why there is an issue between them and the Australian public. I am afraid that this issue of breaking promises goes to the very core of the public's mistrust of the Gillard government. If the Australian people cannot believe their Prime Minister when she promises that there will be no carbon tax under a government she leads and if the Australian people cannot believe the very first sentence of the Treasurer's address to the nation when he delivers his annual budget, why should Australians believe anything anyone in this government tells them in the lead-up to the 14 September election?


The promised surplus was not just a passing mention; it was not something he dreamt up; it was on the biggest stage of the year for this Treasurer. He staked his entire political credibility on it. We have had the shadow Treasurer highlight for us today that the Treasurer has promised this surplus more than 300 times. Actually, the shadow Treasurer said it was 366 times,. He used terms like 'come hell or high water'. As any reasonable Australian knows, we have seen a bit of hell and a bit of high water this summer, but we still have not seen a surplus. We have seen the hell, we have seen the bushfires, we have seen the high water in Queensland, but we are still looking around for that surplus. This Treasurer was so confident about it, I thought I would take him on. I offered to bet the Treasurer a thousand bucks. He was boasting about his forecast surplus and I bet him in this place. I stood up here and I bet the Treasurer. I checked the Hansard just before. On 21 September, I came in here I challenged the Treasurer in his presence—he was in this place with me. I bet him a thousand bucks on his surplus promise. I said that, if he won the bet, I would pay a thousand bucks to his favourite charity, and if he lost the bet he would pay a thousand dollars to my favourite charity. But the fact that he would not take me on says a bit about this Treasurer, because I think he knew even then that he was conning the Australian people. He was misleading the Australian people with his repeated surplus promise even then. He was never prepared even then, in September 2011, to put his money where his mouth is, because that, I think, is increasingly becoming the Australian Labor Party's way: they will always spend someone else's money but never their own.


So the surplus promise has gone. It has disappeared. It is going to be replaced by another whopping big deficit, but, interestingly, we probably will not know what that deficit is when we all go to the polls on 14 September. The final figures may not even be in by then. So Australian people will not even know whether the Treasurer has outdone himself and delivered his worst ever result—whether it is going to be a personal-best deficit or just a run-of-the-mill $20 billion, $30 billion or $40 billion deficit. We do not know if it is going to be a personal best or not. We have a Treasurer who has presided over the four biggest deficits in Australian history, so he has got the record, but he is going for the five peaks. Can he top his own performance? It has all added up to the Rudd and Gillard governments combined borrowing $200 billion.


Keep in mind: this is from a government that inherited a budgetary situation of no debt whatsoever and money in the bank. That was the situation it inherited. I have only been around politics 20 or so years; I cannot recall an incoming government being so quiet about the state of the books. Normally the incoming government says: 'Oh no! There's a big black hole and things are worse than we thought!' I think this government came in and said, 'Let's be quiet about this—things are looking pretty good!' But it has managed to destroy it all in five years.


While you are borrowing $200 billion, the Australian people need to understand what that means in terms of the interest bill alone. We are talking $7 billion per year which needs to be repaid by the Australian people.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  How much?




Mr CHESTER:
  That is $7 billion! The member for Cowper is right to ask, because I ask the Australian people listening today: can you just imagine what we could do if we did not have to pay back Labor's debt? Could you imagine if we did not have to pay back the principle but just the interest alone—if we only had to pay back the $7 billion a year? This is Kevin Rudd's and Julia Gillard's gift to our children: this massive debt that they are going to have to repay. Think about what we could do, as members in this place in each of our own electorates, if we did not have to pay back that debt. If we are in the fortunate position sometime later this year to form government, imagine what you could do, the good you could do in your community, with $7 billion per year. Think of the hospitals we could be building. Think of the roads that we will not be able to build because of the debt, and the improved aged-care and childcare facilities—think of all the things we could be doing for regional Australia and the cities. Think of all the things we could be doing if we were not paying back that interest rate bill. It is interesting, because the interest rate bill alone would pay for the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


So, when it comes to economic management, we have this Treasurer and this government failing to deliver any certainty or stability for the Australian people and Australian households. At the same time, they are out there making new promises—casting grand ideas out there and throwing them up in the media as if they had been paid for. But the simple fact is: they have not been budgeted for, and projects like the National Disability Insurance Scheme will never be delivered by a Labor government because even if it wins in September this year it will not have the money to pay for them.


As we have just emerged from a summer of natural disasters, which will obviously have an impact on the budget bottom line, hopefully this government is not going to go back to the Australian people and demand another levy, because prudent governments should be preparing for such events and responsible governments would be making contingencies, in a nation such as ours, for the impact of such natural disasters.


On that note, and in conclusion, I will perhaps finish with a word of caution to members opposite, and perhaps even members on this side: the public will judge us very harshly in this place this year if we are seen to be wasting time talking about ourselves. I can assure you now that people in Bundaberg shovelling mud out of their living rooms do not care about the latest Newspoll, and the Gippsland farmers who are out there today rebuilding fences in my community could not care less if the caucus is leaking to the Australian media. They want us to be focused on their interests—which goes to the very heart of the debate we are having here today.



Those opposite have tried to claim that economic conditions have changed and that is the reason for their major write-down in revenue which has caused this broken promise on the surplus, but the bottom line remains unquestioned: this government is actually receiving more revenue than previous governments but has failed to manage the budget in an economically sustainable manner. Australians deserve better from their government than having this divided and distracted mess. Australians deserve better economic management and the coalition government which can deliver it after September this year. (Time expired)

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (17:14):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's report on Australia's oil refinery industry, together with the minutes of proceedings.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms OWENS:
  by leave—Australia is a net exporter of energy and has a positive energy future. In relation to oil, though, Australia is a net importer.


Following the closure of the Clyde and Kurnell oil refineries in New South Wales, refinery capacity in Australia will decrease by about 28 per cent and leave five operating refineries. Domestic refiners will produce just over half the fuel consumed in Australia, with the remainder being imported. Consequently, concerns have been raised about the viability of Australia's oil refinery industry, and the potential impacts of declining domestic refinery capacity on the economy, energy security and employment in the sector.


The most pessimistic view is that this is the beginning of the end of Australian refining, and the most optimistic view is that there is a future for Australian refining, albeit under increasing competitive pressure. The committee noted that during the last decade the oil industry has invested over $9 billion in its Australian refineries.


While Australia's proximity to the Asian region with its new mega-refineries does pose some challenges for domestic refineries, it also provides us with opportunities to take advantage of Asia's surplus refining capacity and to continue to strengthen supply chains in the region.


The changes in domestic refining capacity to date will not impact on Australia meeting its liquid fuel requirements. There are reliable, mature and highly diversified international fuel supply chains which provide Australia with economic security. The Australian Institute of Petroleum and refiners were confident about the reliability of Australia's supply chains and infrastructure to continue to meet local fuel demands, as it has done over many decades.


The key to our high energy security is our access to well-functioning markets for liquid fuels and supply chains with a high degree of resilience. This means that Australia can source its liquid fuel needs from a diversity of sources so that if one source becomes unavailable other sources can meet demand.


The energy white paper noted:


Our lack of oil self-sufficiency and the prospect of further refinery rationalisation does not in itself compromise or reduce our energy security …


The closure of the refineries will not lead to negative price outcomes for consumers. Australian fuel prices reflect an import parity price, which is the price in international markets. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission was clear in its advice to the committee that, as a result of import parity pricing, the retail price of petrol is not impacted by refinery closures. However, refinery closures do result in job losses. Evidence presented showed that the people employed in the oil refinery industry are highly skilled, productive and, as indicated by the average length of service, extremely loyal.


Where closures are inevitable, reducing undue stress and assisting workers to adjust to changing employment circumstances should be a priority for both industry and government. This can only occur where there is a level of certainty for workers, and targeted support. To date, structural changes have occurred in a relatively orderly manner, with long lead times between closures being announced and a workforce having to adjust. Efforts to redeploy and reskill displaced workers must remain a priority.


The committee believes that there is a future for Australia's domestic refining industry as part of our diverse and robust oil supply chains. Market forces will continue to operate to determine when a specific refinery is commercially viable and, where closures are inevitable, to adjust the supply chain to help ensure Australia's continued economic and energy security.


On behalf of the committee, I thank the organisations that assisted the committee during the inquiry through submissions or participating at the roundtable hearing in Canberra. I would also like to personally thank the people who came to that hearing representing the workers at Clyde, in my electorate, who are suffering from the closure of the Shell refinery. I also thank my colleagues on the committee for their contribution to the report, and the secretariat, who did an extraordinary job in a really complex area, largely over the Christmas break.


I commend the report to the House, and I move:

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (17:14):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's report on Australia's oil refinery industry, together with the minutes of proceedings.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms OWENS:
  by leave—Australia is a net exporter of energy and has a positive energy future. In relation to oil, though, Australia is a net importer.


Following the closure of the Clyde and Kurnell oil refineries in New South Wales, refinery capacity in Australia will decrease by about 28 per cent and leave five operating refineries. Domestic refiners will produce just over half the fuel consumed in Australia, with the remainder being imported. Consequently, concerns have been raised about the viability of Australia's oil refinery industry, and the potential impacts of declining domestic refinery capacity on the economy, energy security and employment in the sector.


The most pessimistic view is that this is the beginning of the end of Australian refining, and the most optimistic view is that there is a future for Australian refining, albeit under increasing competitive pressure. The committee noted that during the last decade the oil industry has invested over $9 billion in its Australian refineries.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2013-02-05,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (17:22):  It is great pleasure to talk on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012. Serious and organised crime is a genuine national security issue for our country. It threatens our economy, it threatens the well-being of the Australian people and it threatens our way of life. The opposition believes that all the resources and focus of the federal government must be brought to bear on this issue. It is very difficult to get an accurate estimate of the financial cost of organised crime to our community, but it is certainly very significant and, by some estimates, would be up to $15 billion. So the impacts of organised crime are serious not just for those directly affected but also for the community as a whole.



Sadly, since the government changed in 2007, the Labor government has pursued policies which have made it easier for criminals to prosper. They have made it easier by savaging our law enforcement agencies, by occupying the time and efforts of those law enforcement agencies on their self-induced border protection crisis and by failing in their duty to properly police what comes in and out of our country. Since they have come to government, Labor has axed 750 staff and significant funding from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, leaving our borders vulnerable to infiltration by serious criminal syndicates.Slashing funding for Customs has meant more opportunities for criminals to put drugs and guns onto our streets.




We 
saw shocking
 revelations late last year of Customs officers 
being directly 
involved in 
corruption at Sydney airport, 
including allegations of a
iding drug traffickers and
 laundering 
money 
for the very bikie gangs that are terrorising Sydney streets.


Under Labor
,
 less than 10 per cent of air cargo and less than 
five
 per cent of sea cargo are inspected when they enter Australia's borders
, 
giving criminals a better chance of successfully smuggling weapons, drugs and other contraband into our community.





Extensive cuts to the A
ustralian Crime Commission mean
 that the Commonwealth's capacity to provide intelligence on organised crime is severely limited.


Similarly
,
 cuts to the Australian Federal Police have impacted on their ability to function to their full 
cap
ability.


These cuts 
have 
come at a time 
when an enormous amount of police 
and law-and-order 
resources 
have been
 directed to dealing with Labor's self-induced border protection crisis
—a 
crisis that has seen over 32,500 people 
smuggled illegally into Australia on
 557 boats.





If the Minister for Home Affairs and the Labor Party 
we
re serious about stopping organised crime
, the first thing they would


do is not lecture the states about what the states


should 
be 
doing
. The first thing the federal Labor Party should do is do properly 
the job
 they have been given by the Australian people
.


It i
s an unfortunate fact that the
 cuts 
they have inflicted since they 
have 
come to office have allowed
 criminals a better chance of getting guns and drugs onto our streets
. A
ll of this is happening at the same time 
as
 they 
have 
reduc
ed
 funding to 
our
 law enforcement agencies, such as the Australian Crime Commission
, the Australian


Customs and Border Protection Service 
and the Australian Federal Police.


The Commonwealth
 government


is 
just 
not pulling its weight in this area. In fact
,
 they 
are 
systematically 
undermining 
the 
ability of the federal government to fulfil its law and order responsibilities.




While making legislative changes is
 not
 in itself 
enough 
to tackle organised crime, 
clearly the right legislative framework gives our
 law enforcement 
agencies a more
 workable 
way of tackling this very serious issue—and unexplained wealth 
laws 
are a very important part of that
.


This bill seeks to implement some of the recommendations made by the Parliamentary


Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which inquired into the Commonwealth's unexplained wealth 
legislation and reported early
 last year.

The committee made a total of 18 recommendations. Unfortunately, this bill implements only six of them. I am particularly disappointed by the failure of the government to embrace the recommendations of that parliamentary committee which involve the Australian Crime Commission pursuing unexplained wealth orders. The ACC has significant coercive powers to force witnesses to answer questions, and those significant powers—which are unavailable to other law enforcements agencies—would have been very helpful in pursuing proceeds of crime. But this is an agency that has been systematically attacked by the ALP for funding and staffing cuts. As a committee member I am disappointed to see that the recommendations which specifically recommended that the ACC be given this extra role have not been embraced in the legislation presented to the House by the government. I would like to have seen the government act faster to implement the other recommendations. I note that they have not formally responded to that report, even though it was handed down almost a year ago. Despite this, the coalition welcomes the measures contained in this legislation to strengthen our proceeds-of-crime framework. This will help our law enforcement agencies target criminals and crack down on organised crime. 


I turn now to some of the specifics of the bill. Part 1 of schedule 1 implements recommendations made in the committee's final report. During the course of the committee inquiry, the Australian Crime Commission informed the committee that serious and organised crime groups continue to prove resilient and very adaptable to legislative changes, law enforcement intelligence and investigative methodologies. I remember very distinctly that they said that the best way to tackle organised crime is to remove the proceeds of illegal activity. That is one of the most significant deterrents we can have to unlawful activity. The police in particular gave us some very vivid examples of hardened criminals who were reduced to tears when the police confiscated their luxury cars. This really hits criminals where it hurts—taking away the proceeds of their illicit activities. Indeed, doing that is one way to deliver heavy blows to organised criminals. 


That is why it is vitally important that the Commonwealth has a proceeds of crime framework which actually works and which our law enforcement agencies can use effectively to tackle organised crime.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee is currently inquiring into this bill. The Australian Federal Police Association and the Police Federation of Australia were supportive of it, particularly the measure to remove judicial discretion from unexplained wealth orders, noting: 'We would like to publicly state that we support the removal of judicial discretion for unexplained wealth restraining orders, preliminary orders and final orders. This brings unexplained wealth into line with other kinds of proceedings conducted under the Proceeds of Crime Act.' Both the PFA and the AFPA have been long-time supporters of strengthening Australia's unexplained wealth laws and have voiced their concerns about the weaknesses in the existing Commonwealth regime. I note that both of those agencies do a very good job of representing the voices of police men and women across the AFP and, more broadly, across the state and territory policing agencies. Since I have become shadow minister for justice, customs and border protection, they have spoken to me about the deficiencies within the current Commonwealth proceeds-of-crime framework. 


The bill also makes amendments to expand existing cross-border firearms trafficking offences in the Criminal Code and to introduce new aggravated offences for dealing in 50 or more firearms and firearm parts. The bill's explanatory memorandum notes that the amendments are aimed at expanding existing cross-border trafficking offences in the Criminal Code to deal with firearm parts. 


The coalition is particularly proud of its record in taking dangerous guns off our streets and therefore tackling gun crime. As all Australians will remember, in April 1996, Martin Bryant, a very disturbed man, used a semi-automatic rifle and a semi-automatic assault weapon to kill 35 people in a murderous rampage in Port Arthur, Tasmania. At the time, newly elected Prime Minister John Howard made the controversial decision to reform gun ownership laws. 




Mr Champion:
  Courageous.




Mr KEENAN:
  And it was a very courageous decision. Of course, it was highly controversial amongst owners of guns in the community, who rightly said that they had not committed these crimes and had lawfully owned these weapons. To take these weapons off the street involved an enormous amount of political courage from the Prime Minister and his cabinet at the time. Members of parliament had to go out and talk to people about why they believed it was necessary to crack down on these sorts of dangerous weapons. I think it is fair to say that, despite the controversy at the time, those gun laws have been incredibly successful in reducing our gun related homicide rate. They have also reduced the suicide rate in Australia. The Australian Institute of Criminology found that gun related murders and suicides fell sharply after those laws were introduced 1996. In the 18 years before the 1996 reforms, Australia suffered a rather astonishing total of 13 gun massacres—a massacre being a gun crime with more than four victims—causing over 100 deaths. I note there has not been a single massacre since 1996. Those figures probably provide some salient lessons for our friends in America. I do not think that any Australian would deny that today our country is safer as a consequence of the coalition's bold changes to gun ownership laws.


The coalition knows that organised criminal syndicates now seek to import their illegal guns from overseas. Sadly, I do not think this fact is sufficiently acknowledged by the present government. Indeed, the minister refuses to acknowledge the extent of the problem, even with evidence of illegal guns slipping through our borders and coming into New South Wales, as was the case with the Sylvania Waters post office in Sydney when in March last year 220 Glock pistols from Austria were imported via a gun dealership in Germany, using falsified documents. This was not discovered by the federal law enforcement agencies which are tasked with policing our borders. It is important to make the point that it was the New South Wales Police that discovered this significant importation of pistols. This highlighted the devastating effects of Labor's cuts on our border protection agencies, in that the Federal Police no longer had the ability to pick up such a significant importation of illegal firearms.


The cuts have meant a significant reduction in the higher rates of cargo inspections that were occurring under the previous government. When we left office in 2007, 60 per cent of air cargo consignments were inspected by Customs and Border Protection. Labor's significant cuts to the Customs cargo-screening budget has meant a staggering 75 per cent reduction in the percentage of air cargo inspections conducted under the coalition. We have seen a similar decrease in sea cargo inspections.


Labor's cuts have resulted in a $22 million funding cut to the Australian Crime Commission—the agency which, to my disappointment, is not more heavily involved in policing unexplained wealth. The astonishing number of 144 personnel have been taken out of the Australian Crime Commission. It is not a large agency, so that cut represents about 20 per cent of its personnel. 


Labor say they want to be taken seriously on law and order issues. You cannot be taken seriously when your record since coming into office has been to cut the Australian Federal Police, to savage Customs and Border Protection and to savage the Australian Crime Commission. Labor have demonstrated year after year a blatant disregard for tackling organised criminal activity by targeting these key Commonwealth law enforcement agencies for vicious cuts. The Australian Federal Police has been subjected to a $265 million cut since the Labor Party came to office. 




Mr Bowen:
  Is there any chance of talking about the bill?




Mr KEENAN:
  These funding cuts to Customs, the ACC and the AFP have clearly had a significantly impact on the ability of federal law enforcement agencies to do their job properly. The minister at the table says, 'Is there any chance of talking about the bill?'


This bill deals with the smuggling of guns across state borders. The point is that, when you cut resources—the number of personnel available—to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies, it impacts on the ability of those agencies to do their job. This is the problem with the government. They are more interested in spinning away their failure than they are in doing something to tackle the problems which their cuts have significantly contributed to. 


We are supportive of measures to combat gun crime. We are particularly supportive of anything we can do to take guns off our streets. Sadly, we are seeing on our streets the impact of these cuts to Customs. More and more guns have been smuggled into our country because of the very significant cuts that the Labor Party have made since they came to office. We in the coalition believe that the Commonwealth should do its job properly. The law enforcement role of the Commonwealth is to increase the ability of the states to fight crime. Of course, the states have primary responsibility for law and order within their home jurisdictions, but when the Commonwealth is not policing its borders and it is cutting Commonwealth law enforcement agencies then we are making the job of state law enforcement agencies harder. That has to stop. 


This Labor government has systematically made damaging cuts, and this has placed an enormous burden on our state police forces, who are called upon to deal with the consequences of more illicit drugs, more contraband and more illegal firearms on our streets because our borders have been penetrated by organised criminal syndicates. If the Minister for Home Affairs is serious about tackling organised criminal activity—and he says that he is—the first thing he should do is seek to rectify the damaging cuts that have been made to the agencies which he is responsible for. But unfortunately we have a minister who has not proved capable of doing that to date and, until he does so, he cannot be taken seriously when he comes into this place and says that law and order is a significant priority for the Labor government. 


The priority for the Labor Party at the moment seems to be to deflect blame for the fact that we have had this spike in the number of weapons coming into our country because of these cuts and their impact on our borders. Clearly, if you are going to cut resources—if you are going to cut the number of personnel in our agencies—it is going to hamper the ability of law enforcement agencies to do their job. You cannot possibly believe that these savage cuts will not have an impact on our law enforcement agencies to do what we expect of them. 


Due to the nature of the measures proposed in this bill, it is right and proper that it have an airing within the Senate committee process, and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is due to report back on the bill by 13 March. We will be scrutinising what they have to say once they report. Clearly, we will reserve our right to move amendments in the Senate if they highlight areas in which we should do so. We do support the measures contained within this bill. It is important that the Commonwealth have a workable proceeds-of-crime and wealth confiscation program, but, sadly, we do not believe that implementing six of the 18 recommendations that the committee—which was chaired by the member for Fowler, who is due to speak after me—reported on will achieve that. The member for Fowler will not say this, I suspect, but I am pretty sure that he will be very disappointed in his government's response, because he takes his responsibilities on that committee very seriously. He listened to what the police forces around the country had to say to us about these matters. So we will look to rectify and strengthen this framework when we come to office. But, until Australia gets the election it deserves, we will support these measures, albeit reserving our right to make appropriate amendments if the Senate committee highlights areas in which we should do so.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (17:41):  I rise to support the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The bill will amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 and strengthen our nation's fight against organised crime. The bill does this primarily by strengthening the laws related to the illegal firearms market, with the proposal to reduce firearms related crime nationally. The bill will also amend the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and enhance our law enforcement agencies' ability to attack organised crime by targeting unexplained wealth. 


When I first came into this place, following a by-election in 2005, I indicated in my first speech that issues such as drug related offences and firearms offences were not just matters for state and territory police. I indicated that these the importation of weaponry or drugs was something which the Commonwealth had a very clear and abiding responsibility for. I am pleased to say that this legislation follows the sentiments that I expressed in 2005, with the Commonwealth taking greater responsibility in the fight against organised crime. 


We understand that organised crime is a business and that, like any other business, will look for windows of opportunity. It will exploit state and territory boundaries; it will exploit constitutional difficulties. Therefore, it does require the Commonwealth, together with state and territory bodies, to be able to work in a cooperative manner to defeat the ravages of organised crime in our society. 


This bill creates new aggregated offences for trafficking 50 or more firearms or parts of firearms within a six-month period across state, territory or national borders. It increases the punishment for such serious offences to life imprisonment or 7,500 penalty points or both. It also, importantly, brings the maximum punishment for trafficking firearms in line with drug trafficking, recognising that the illegal firearms market poses as great a challenge to our law enforcement agencies and to the community at large as does drug importation and distribution. Interestingly, the Australian Crime Commission has estimated that the current market for illegal firearms in this country is about a quarter of a million firearms. Notwithstanding the illicit market, the total estimation of firearms throughout our community is 2.75 million. Therefore, it is very important that we keep track of legal firearms as well as be able to monitor those that fall into the illicit market. The fact is that, once these firearms are in the market, they can circulate for many years.


It is strange to relate that, even in the 2002 gun buyback, not many of the criminal elements would have traded in their weaponry at that particular time. With all the gun theft that we see—that is, theft of legal weapons, which come into the illicit market, which is one of the major concerns for most of our security agencies—these weapons will stay in circulation for a long time.


Increasing the maximum punishment for firearms trafficking is just one part of a much larger campaign to strengthen Australian gun laws. One of the other measures includes the establishment of a single national firearms register with a database of all weapons used in crime. This register will link together the 30 separate databases currently being used and, hopefully, prevent another 14,000 firearms being lost into the illicit market. We are also strengthening our firearms laws by establishing the Australian Ballistics Identification Network, which is able to analyse and link firearms obtained through previous crimes; by raising community awareness; and through more extensive training in firearms for Australian law enforcement agencies and other organisations. Illegal firearms trade is often a significant aspect of the work of the serious and organised crime groups. This bill ensures that we are better equipped to tackle the illegal firearms trade and, therefore, minimise the effect of firearms on our community.


Importantly, the bill also amends the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to improve our nation's ability to use unexplained wealth as a tool of law enforcement to combat serious and organised crime. It is important to me because, as chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, I am proud to see that the recommendations made through the committee's extensive inquiry into the Commonwealth's unexplained wealth laws are being adopted. Those recommendations were a bipartisan opportunity for members of the committee to come together and seriously look at the contemporary tools that our law enforcement agencies need to combat serious and organised crime. As a matter of fact, my committee has never once had a minority report. I commend all members of the committee for approaching their jobs seriously and with diligence.


The law enforcement committee has been working pretty hard in relation to unexplained wealth because we see this as one of the key methods of targeting serious and organised crime. Specifically, the amendments will broaden the search and seizure provisions to enable materials relevant to unexplained wealth proceedings to be seized by officers executing a search warrant. It will also allow the court extended time for the serving of notice of unexplained wealth orders and will also provide for increased scrutiny of those bodies, principally the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission, where these powers are used and greater scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement.


One thing that is quite apparent is that, in terms of policing and law enforcement, regrettably we as legislators will inevitably have to increase powers in order to protect our communities. Again, on a bipartisan basis, with the increase of those powers comes an increased level of oversight, and that is certainly the case in respect of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission.


I have nothing but respect for their officers—for the dedication and commitment they show in combatting crime—but in terms of protecting the integrity of the powers, and the circumstances in which those powers can be used, it is only appropriate that the level of oversight be at the high level we currently have.


In order to prevent and disrupt crime we must address some of those drivers that underpin criminal activity. As I said a little earlier, criminals are many things—they certainly participate in nefarious activities—but at the end of the day they are business people. They are in business to make money. They are profit driven. So, to disrupt their businesses you go about threatening their businesses and threatening their profits. Essentially, that is what unexplained wealth is about.


The Australian Crime Commission estimates that at the moment the cost of organised crime to Australian society is somewhere between $10 billion and $15 billion every year. That is not the effect on individuals or the economic effect of crime; if you take that into account, those figures are probably very conservative. Therefore, it is very important that we give the people that we charge with the responsibility of protecting our community the powers that they need to combat crime—not simply to arrest people after the event, bring them to trial and then punishment, but to deter and prevent criminal enterprise. If we are able to do that it means that we can prevent crime. If we can prevent crime it means we stop there being another victim of crime in our community.


I am glad this legislation is supported by both sides of the House, because this represents a huge step forward for Australian crime fighting. Having had the opportunity to spend some time with colleagues looking at some of the contemporary issues of law enforcement overseas, I can see that the suite of laws that are being presented at the moment through this bill puts us very clearly on a superior footing to most law enforcement agencies throughout the world. What we are adopting here is basically what has been recommended by Interpol back in, I think, 2004. Very few agencies have been able to achieve what Australia has been able to target through this suite of legislation.


Clearly, whilst there is no doubt that this legislation will put people's liberties at risk—particularly if their business is in a crime related field—it will do something that is not all that common in law enforcement: it will target the issue of preventing and disrupting crime.


Being the son of a police officer, I know only too well how my father would come home and celebrate when they took some serious criminal off the street. I know the father of the member for Cook would have been in the very same predicament. The member for Cook probably heard the same stories around the kitchen table at his place.


The fact is that contemporary crime fighting is not waiting around for a crime to be committed; it is not waiting around while a business advantage is being exploited by criminals; it is getting involved and doing something that actually shuts down criminal enterprise. Regrettably, people's liberties will be affected by that. We do not make any bones about that. In terms of the suite of tools that are necessary for policing, this is one of those which rate very highly.


I must congratulate Mark Burgess and officers of the Police Federation of Australia. Going back some, I think, three or four years, they were the first organisation that came to my parliamentary committee saying that this is what they thought policing requires in this country.


It was this government that took on that challenge to do something—make those changes and provide police officers with the necessary tools they need in contemporary crime fighting.


It cannot be only with the Commonwealth. There are a few constitutional barriers here; therefore, it requires a very concerted effort between the Commonwealth and state and territory bodies to work together with a common view of attacking serious and organised crime. To that extent, it will require a certain amount of coming together, sharing power to make sure that the proper aspect of this legislation is not only arrived at on paper but fully executed in the various courts around the land that are designed to put criminal elements out of business.


I am very pleased to be the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement—as I said, a body that has taken seriously its responsibility in looking at what is necessary in contemporary crime fighting. I am pleased to support this. And, as I said, as a son of a police officer, regardless of what my dad's view may have been earlier in the piece, I think this will actually put far more people on the criminal side out of business than simply waiting around for another drug deal on the street. I support the bill.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2013-02-05,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (17:56):  Also as the son of a police officer, like the member for Fowler, these issues are matters of close interest to me personally as well as in terms of my electorate in the seat of Cook—and I will refer later to the incidents that took place there last year with the smuggling of Glock pistols through a post office in my electorate. They are also of concern to me as part of the broader issue of national security, in which I have a keen interest, and these matters go directly, I think, to matters of national security.


When one is debating these matters in this place, never far from our mind are the tragedies, not only in our country but also in places around the world. Sadly, even quite recently, we have seen the horror and the tragedy of guns getting into the hands of bad people—into the hands of criminals who hold our society to ransom and to hostage and selfishly seek to impose their greed and their evil on others. There will be no debate in this place about the evils of these things. I think the sentiments and the intentions that sit behind this bill are respected and appreciated, and I commend the government in bringing this bill to the House. I also commend the minister, who has brought this bill to the House, on his appointment to the cabinet.


It is the job of a national government to protect our borders and to keep Australians safe behind those borders. That is the goal informing governments from this place. That is a core responsibility of a national government. At its heart, this is a bill about national security and especially about protecting our borders from the movement of illegal firearms and weapons parts. The measures contained in this legislation seek to better protect Australian communities from the clutches of criminal syndicates and ensure that they are not able to profit from the nefarious trade.


The coalition will support this bill in principle. We understand the intent behind it, and that is something we can identify with. But, pending further advice from the Senate committee, we reserve our position on other amendments and things that may be brought up as a result of those investigations. I would hope the government would work constructively with the opposition on the things that may come from that process. If things are identified then, in the spirit of the shared intention, they should attract support. The coalition remains committed to strong border protection, and we welcome the opportunity to discuss these matters in this place, because the truth is that when it comes to border protection more broadly the Australian people have already registered a pretty clear verdict about the government's competence in that matter.


Last year, Commissioner Andrew Scipione from the New South Wales Police Force—I would argue the most trusted and respected law officer in the land and over many generations—referred to the issue of guns being imported illegally overseas as the elephant in the room. He said that it is not just a border security issue but a national security issue. I could not agree with the commissioner more. Any piece of legislation concerned with removing guns from Australian streets should merit our close attention. Any bill that strives to make our neighbourhoods safer by virtue of making it harder for criminal syndicates to operate is worthy of scrutiny in this place.


This legislation would effect several key changes to both the Criminal Code Act and the Proceeds of Crime Act. Firstly, this legislation seeks to strengthen the investigative powers and Commonwealth prosecution of cases in relation to unexplained wealth. Secondly, this legislation seeks to expand existing offences for cross-border trafficking of firearms. The new regime would include aggravated offences with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for dealing in 50 or more firearms or parts within a six-month period.


As I said, we cannot fault the intent behind this legislation, but we have a duty to examine these matters closely to ensure that any unintended consequences do not compromise the outcome that we are trying to achieve. It was almost a year ago now that the New South Wales police discovered a gaping hole in our borders on gun control, with 220 Glock pistols allegedly smuggled right into the city of Sydney, guns that ended up on our streets in the hands of criminal gangs. Those guns found their way into my electorate of Cook, into the shire and into southern Sydney, allegedly through the Sylvania Waters post office. That alleged smuggling operation was described by Andrew Scipione, the Commissioner of Police in New South Wales, as perhaps the biggest illegal syndicate doing this type of illegal gun trafficking that Australia has ever seen.


What is worse, our Customs and Border Protection Service had no idea that it had happened. It had to be brought to their attention late into the investigation in order to effect the sting that saw the arrests that followed. They were not brought on board that investigation early. One still wonders to this day why the New South Wales police made the decision not to involve Customs and Border Protection earlier when they were aware that these guns were on their way to Sydney. That raises serious questions. I remember raising those questions in this place and proposing that we have a commission of inquiry into that incident to understand the failings in the system that had let that happen. That proposal was rejected by the government and ridiculed by others. But this incident was the canary in the mine.


What did we see at the end of last year? To our shock and surprise, we saw Customs officers involved in embedded corruption at our airports and our sea ports. That was going on. This was a serious matter. It was a matter that the New South Wales police had identified and brought to the attention of Customs. There is a serious need to deal with what is happening in our Customs and Border Protection Service. At the end of last year, there were revelations that as many as 20 Customs officials had been allegedly involved in extensive corruption at Sydney airport. As my colleague the member for Stirling has mentioned, these included allegations of aiding drug traffickers as well as money laundering for bikie gangs. An entire shift had been compromised. One Customs and Border Protection officer arrested by the AFP was charged with offences including conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of border controlled precursors, weapons offences, receiving a bribe and abuse of public office.


These crises do not happen in a vacuum. They have been allowed to occur and continue against a backdrop of mismanagement and chaos on our borders under this Labor government that the Australian people have watched with horror. Specifically in the area of Customs, they take the knife to the Customs budget, dropping from inspecting 60 per cent of air cargo inspections under the Howard government to just 8.3 per cent under this government. Those drastic cuts to cargo screening have allowed weapons and illicit drugs to come into this country and then onto our streets and into the hands of organised criminal syndicates. The people of Western Sydney know that. When the coalition left office, we were inspecting 6.2 million air cargo consignments. That figure today, taken from the government's budget papers, is 1.5 million.


At the same time there are about 10 million air cargo consignments. Today that figure exceeds 15 million, yet the percentage of air cargo consignments being inspected continues to shrink. It comes down to this: under Labor criminals now have a 90 to 95 per cent chance of successfully smuggling weapons, or rather, contraband, into our community. Those are terrifying odds.


It is all well and good to be implementing these laws to improve our powers to charge and prosecute offenders. And this an iterative process. The parliament should always be looking at ways we can better equip those on the front line with the resources, the authority and the legal backing they need to do their job to the best of their ability. But we must be mindful about how the guns are getting in in the first place. I turn to none other than the now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr. When he was Premier of New South Wales this is how he believed guns were getting into the country. All these guns, he said, 'the guns on our streets, the guns being traded, the guns that form this black market, have got into Australia through pretty porous borders.' That is what Senator Bob Carr said when he was Premier of New South Wales. Now he forms part of a government that denies this is the case. When he said this, air cargo screenings were many multiples over what this government is doing today, and the resources, proportionally, were greater at the time than they are today.


This is a government that has moved quickly, even today, and over the last few days, to try to divert attention, to say, 'It is not our fault. We just control what comes into the country. We need to shift the focus and say it is what is happening in state enforcement with our police forces.' What is important is that an incompetent federal government needs to take over the powers of state governments, which actually alerted them last year to the problem. They are the ones who blew the whistle. Customs did not know they were on fire on this issue until the New South Wales police turned up with a hose and put them out.


We do not want diversions and distractions from this government, for which they are well known when it comes to the issue of gun crime. We will see plenty of announcements and we have seen plenty of stern faces looking into the cameras, incredibly earnest, calling on people to lay down their swords and get together and work constructively on this issue. Well, here is a tip for the government: do your job well and the guns will not get into the country.


This government has not stopped the guns, it has not stopped the drugs and it has not stopped the boats, and the Australian people know it. You can go out there and argue about your alleged competence on our borders until you are blue in the face but the Australian people know that this government is the biggest failure on our borders in our nation's history. And they will be judged for it. That day is coming—14 September is coming—when this government will be judged for its failures on our borders. The people are waiting and they want to issue that judgment for your mismanagement and incompetence on our borders. We on this side of the House will work towards that day, not only continuing to prosecute that case but continuing to firm up and build further the policies that we know are necessary to get things right on our borders once again.


This government slashed 750 staff from our Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. They have stripped funding and personnel out of the agency, leaving it vulnerable. Clearly, a culture of corruption is evident in these agencies—in this agency specifically. It is about restoring the confidence of the Australian people in these agencies. The many hardworking enforcement officers who work in the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, like those who work in similar law enforcement agencies around the country, will be horrified—the good officers, the ones who want to do the right thing, the ones who want to be proud of their organisation and the job it does, because it is an important job. But you have to get the settings right. You have to allow those who want to do the right thing and uphold the integrity of their organisation to be the ones whose activities are rewarded—and rewarded in the sense of having an organisation that has the support, both in terms of the financial support for the resources provided and in terms of the political support, to do their job.


The failures of this government on borders are well known. They are not limited to the area of Customs. They are well known in the area of immigration. I note that yet another minister for immigration has entered into the revolving door of policy failure in these last few days.


He will not have big shoes to fill—because his predecessor allowed almost 25,000 people to cross our borders illegally into this country—but he is a minister who is returning to the scene of the crime. The now minister for immigration is the same minister who, along with the now departing Senator Evans, was responsible in large part for the unwinding of the controls that we had on our borders under the Howard government. So he returns to the scene of his crime and to the scene of failure when he previously served in the area of customs and border protection, only now to babysit this government's failure on our borders to an election.


The coalition will continue to stand up for national security in this country. We continue to believe strongly, as we demonstrated in government and stand ready to demonstrate again if elected at the next election, that we need to enforce the laws on our borders, strengthen the force of our borders and ensure that Australians are kept safe behind those borders by doing the federal government's job and working with the state governments to ensure that they can do their job, rather than trying to distract attention, as the minister has done today by alleging all sorts of things about New South Wales. It was the New South Wales police who set off the alert here on the issue of guns coming into this country, and the government should do its job. (Time expired)

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (18:11):  Last year the Australian Crime Commission did a national intelligence audit of the illegal firearms market in Australia. That audit estimated that, while there were more than 2¾ million registered firearms in Australia, the illicit firearms market consisted of around a quarter of a million weapons—around 250,000 long arms and, perhaps more concerning, about 10,000 handguns. Illegal firearms sourced through theft from licensed owners and firearms dealers consist in part of weapons that were made illegal in the 1997 gun laws, about which I will say more later, and deactivated firearms that have been reactivated.


This bill is a response by the Australian government to these concerning findings. It deals with the spread of illegal firearms by introducing new offences for aggravated firearms trafficking. It extends existing cross-border offences and introduces new basic offences for trafficking firearms across borders. Our aim is to hold traffickers responsible for the consequences of providing firearms to the black market. They are aiming to tackle the illegal firearms market from different angles—to seize the firearms, to break the code of silence and to improve our ability to trace firearms—and they complement other reforms the government is putting in place. These reforms include the rollout of the Australian Ballistics Identification Network, a national database which will allow police in states and territories to link up their information on weapons recovered from crime; better training, from the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which will happen in February this year; and an in-principle agreement with police ministers for a national firearms register. This national firearms register really is an important development, and I would urge those police ministers who are currently considering it to act immediately. I think it is vital that state and territory firearms registers are joined up. Australians move states or territories frequently and the information about those weapons should follow them.


These laws are also part of a package of reforms dealing with unexplained wealth.


As the Minister for Justice explained:


These laws will help us to catch criminals. Just like with Al Capone - you can catch criminals by following the money.


And through this broad suite of reforms we are cracking down on the illegal firearms market. In so doing we are supporting law-abiding recreational shooters. Law-abiding recreational shooters have the most to lose from an illicit firearms market in Australia because it is law-abiding firearms owners who are tarnished when these drive-by shootings occur, when crimes are committed with illegal weapons.


I am fortunate to have within my own electorate the firing range used by the Canberra Rifle Club. The Canberra Rifle Club is, I am told, the city's oldest surviving sporting body. It traces its conception back to a report in the Queanbeyan Age newspaper on 6 May 1913, nearly a century ago:


There was a representative gathering of riflemen at the residence of Mr. Hector McIntosh, Canberra, on Saturday last, to discuss the proposal of forming a rifle club at that place.


And there had previously been rifle ranges at the Black Mountain Peninsula picnic grounds and the Mount Ainslie summit road, but the club's present facilities are at a better location in the Majura Valley. They opened in September 1969 and, in passing, I note that they are just off Majura Road, near the Majura Parkway. The club's facilities will not be adversely affected by the construction of the Majura Parkway, the ACT's biggest road-building project, fifty-fifty funded by the federal and ACT governments and which it was my pleasure to attend the sod turning of this morning.


The range is named the McIntosh Rifle Range after Hector McIntosh, and since 1972 it has been the venue for the National Queen's Prize shoot. In 2004 the Canberra Rifle Club and Bungendore Rifle Club ran the inaugural Canberra Queen's Prize meeting, and they are a premier state and national rifle competition. The member for Griffith attended the presentation ceremony for the Queensland Queen's Prize in 2012.


The Canberra Rifle Club, importantly, has strict requirements for its members regarding firearms licences. Its rules say:


All members and users of the range may be required at any time to satisfy the Club that they hold a valid Firearms Licence as issued by the State or Territory in which they reside.


This is especially the case when purchasing ammunition or ammunition components from the Club. Consequently, you should carry your current Firearms Licence and your current NRAA Membership Card at all times.


This is an example of a well-managed and regulated facility for sport shooters.


That stands in stark contrast to the behaviour of some of the sport shooting associations in the United States. Following the Connecticut school shooting we have seen again on display the awful intransigence of the US National Rifle Association, a body which took a moderate stance in the 1930s when it supported federal gun control; which in the 1960s supported a ban on 'Saturday night specials' because, as they said at the time, they had 'no sporting purpose'; but which was taken over in 1977 by people like Harlan Carter, Wayne LaPierre and the like and found itself in the 1980s opposing bans on armour-piercing bullets, which were being used to kill police on US streets.


The debate on gun control in the United States is so different from the debate in Australia. In part that is because of the initiative that was taken in 1997 by then Prime Minister John Howard and Tim Fischer, Leader of the National Party, who were willing to take on the extremists in their own party to see a gun buyback passed. I think sometimes in this place we pay too little tribute to the other side of politics. I was in here about an hour ago speaking about the fiscal profligacy of the Howard government, but let me in a different spirit recognise the forward-thinking actions of the Howard government and Tim Fischer in the Australian gun buyback.


By tightening firearms legislation, by buying back around two-thirds of a million weapons, Australia achieved a substantial fall in the firearms death rate. Firearms homicide and suicide rates fell by about half and have stayed down. These are figures that are sometimes contradicted by shills speaking for the National Rifle Association or other bodies in the United States, but the facts do not lie: fewer Australians die as a result of firearms homicide and suicide thanks to the actions of the Howard government in 1997.


But we have to remain vigilant. We have to continue updating the laws to fit the times. This bill cracks down on the illegal firearms market. It is important that we keep the challenge in perspective. Australia's firearms death rate is low by international standards. Christine Neill of Wilfred Laurier University and I carried out two studies looking the Australian firearms buyback. We found when we looked at the time trends and when we looked across states it was very clear that the firearms buyback had saved lives.


Prior to the Port Arthur massacre Australia had experienced a mass shooting—that is, a shooting with five or more victims—on average every year for the previous decade. Since then we have not had a mass shooting in Australia. That could be coincidence but the odds of that are less than one in 100.


Importantly, we have brought down firearms suicide, because that is the most common form of gun deaths, and we have brought down firearm homicide. The United States, though, still experiences over 80 gun deaths every single day—a horrendous death rate. One of the things that we in Australia can do is to present to United States legislators who are dealing with this very complicated issue—President Obama and Vice President Biden are now considering a package of gun law reforms—a bipartisan model of dealing with gun deaths. This is a bipartisan model that does not undercut the role of sporting shooters but recognises, as I have in my own electorate, groups of sporting shooters who are committed to enjoying their sport with shooting licences and with gun registration. They recognise that good laws are essential if people are to enjoy sport shooting in a safe environment. They recognise that the scourge of gun death in Australia has, in the past, been too high and that it needs to come down.


So I would urge those opposite to try and refrain from some of the partisan politicking in this debate. One of the things that has traditionally characterised the firearms legislation debates has been their bipartisan nature. Then opposition leader Kim Beazley did not hesitate before supporting John Howard in the package of laws that were put in place after the Port Arthur massacre. I urge those opposite to be wary of point-scoring and to recognise the value that we can bring to this place from sober, sensitive, reflective debate over reducing gun deaths.


We will probably never reduce the number of deaths to zero but we ought to do all in our power to bring it down. And we ought to do all we can to tell the world the story of Australia's firearms regulation. It is a good story. It is a story of conservatives who were willing to stand up to extremists in their ranks, of bipartisan law reform, and of ongoing law reform recognising that, as criminals advance in their methods of evading detection, Australian laws have to move to keep pace.


I commend the bill to the House and I commend the work of the minister, who is here in the chamber, on this bill.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (18:24):  As a person who has more than a passing interest in this matter—in fact, my maiden speech to the New South Wales parliament 30-odd years ago was about gun laws—and as a person who had the honour, and I say 'honour', to represent the federal opposition at a huge rally in Sydney's Domain, where we indicated total support for former Prime Minister John Howard's gun law initiatives, I join with the previous speaker in expressing disquiet over the opposition's contribution to this debate. The member for Cook spoke of diversions and distractions. Quite frankly, I think that encapsulates the total performance of the opposition in this debate.


The opposition's leading speaker on this debate, the member for Stirling, said that the government had only implemented a number of the recommendations that came forward. He did not belabour his argument on any that were not pursued. He did not specifically declare that it was the end of the world if any of them were not pursued. He made some references to a Senate inquiry. He did not seem to have any ideas of his own. Then the member for Cook came along and tried to draw some sort of personal connection with gun problems in this country because a post office in his electorate was the site of the importation of guns. But I live in an area of Sydney which has been characterised by a huge spate of gun related incidents over the last year or so, so for me this a very personal issue.


For the opposition to come in here today, when the government has made serious efforts after a series of police ministers meetings in, I think, June and November last year, and say that this debate is completely about the number of customs inspections concerned with the illegal entry of guns into this country is appalling. Yes, of course both sides of politics would like to minimise the number of guns that, through importation, end up on the illicit market in this country, but if we look at a number of commentators on this problem we find it is very complex. In April last year, the member for Wentworth said that a fundamental requirement is more policing of gun offences in this country. The final report of the national investigation into illegal firearms noted that 44 per cent of the guns we are concerned about were those not surrendered or registered after the Port Arthur massacre, 12 per cent were stolen or the subject of staged theft in Australia, and a mere one-half of one per cent seemed to come from illegal importation. The Australian Crime Commission commented:


The illicit firearm market is predominantly comprised of firearms which have been diverted from the licit market through a variety of means.


It further commented:


Illicit handguns have principally been sourced by criminals who took advantage of differences in state and territory definitions of firearms and other loop-holes—which have been closed for over a decade.


It is a very complex problem, made up of so many elements. So for the opposition to come in here today and say, 'We're going to solve the illicit gun issue in this country by enhanced inspection of imported goods,' is just preposterous.


There are further examples of how complex the problem is. I note that Dr Bricknell, a leading criminologist, pointed to Queensland legislation, where it emerged that deactivated guns could be reactivated and the serial numbers transferred to working weapons. She analysed a major problem in Queensland legislation, a loophole that had partly led to this issue. I note that former Federal Police officer Nigel Phair, director of the Centre for Internet Safety at the University of Canberra, who has spent the last four years heading the High Tech Crime Centre, looked at the question of the failure of police authorities to move onto the internet, a major source, as he sees it, of gun problems in this country.


As I say, how guns enter this market is an extremely diverse, complex problem. It is not a matter just to be toyed with and played with by an opposition that is trying to connect this issue with the entry of people by boat into the country. The member for Cook's contribution was really about further haranguing the chamber on the number of boats coming into the country and border security et cetera. It had nothing to do with the issues that we are facing today. We see a variety of real measures in this bill. It will provide for the addition of an aggravated offence to existing cross-border offences based on the disposal, acquisition, taking or sending of 50 or more firearms. It will extend the coverage of the existing cross-border offences, including providing new offences to deal with international firearms trafficking. It will provide for the basic import-export offences to be punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. These measures are worthwhile and should be commended.


I also note that the shadow minister spoke about listening to the police force. That is his supposed way of dealing with this problem. I wish he would talk to the Queensland government about the police force views on guns in this country, because one of the first actions of the new government in Queensland was to appoint a gun committee for the state. I seem to remember the police force in Queensland going on national television to complain very vehemently about the total domination of this committee by people with commercial interests and other interests in promoting gun ownership in this country. We are seeing in Queensland a situation where the conservative side of politics is trying to, in a sense, please people in the gun lobby. It is nascent. It is not very strong, like in the United States. But this is a leading indicator of the real things that should be done about guns, not rhetoric about importation and the number of crates that are opened at the airports or the harbours. They are putting a committee up there to basically liberalise gun laws, to try and make sure that restrictions, controls and limitations are broken down.


Also, if we are so concerned with regard to gun homicides, gun suicides et cetera in this country, one only has to look at the recent experience in New South Wales politics as to where the agenda is going. I have been very critical of the previous Labor government in New South Wales for kowtowing to the gun interests in that state because they held a few votes in the upper house. And what have we seen since the government of New South Wales has come into power? Very swiftly the very controversial decision to allow shooting in national parks. That is deplored by the very public servants who dedicate their lives to their parks and safety—not just because of mercenary self-interest and the wages they get paid—coming out and absolutely moving towards industrial action because of the way in which that government is again kowtowing to the gun interest.


A series of measures have been supported by national police committees. They follow the 1996 National Firearms Agreement, the reaction of the federal government under John Howard to the Port Arthur disaster, the 2002 national agreement on handguns et cetera. In the spirit I indicated earlier of trying to be nonpartisan in a very important issue for the safety of Australians, I also take the point of commending the former Prime Minister for involving himself in the current debate in the United States. For those who are unaware, John Howard wrote a leading editorial in the New York Times, an opinion piece, last week about the way in which Australia's tougher gun laws after Port Arthur had led to improvements in the safety of Australians.


What is often lost in this debate on guns is that the question of criminal use is minor. Essentially, the real danger of guns is the use in domestic arguments between parties: the danger to the neighbour by the person next door who supposedly needs a gun to protect themselves and who, in a rage over how high the fence is or someone making too much noise, goes out and shoots their neighbour. The other serious reality with gun ownership in this country is the question of accidental death.


I am very much concerned with the performance of the opposition in this debate. After Port Arthur the opposition did the right thing by the Australian people by fully, totally, unequivocally supporting John Howard in a move toward tighter restrictions. If we move in the way that the Queensland government is at the moment in kowtowing to these interests, we will see the reality of what we see in the United States, where the presidential candidate for the Republican party last time, Mitt Romney—and it was so fake, so transparent—had to pretend he liked shooting. He had to go out there. Now we have had the President of the United States also having to parade around as a skeet shooter. Both sides of politics are so intimidated by the National Rifle Association that they have to lower their dignity, lower their morality, to do these kinds of things.


It is interesting to note the debate in the United States. It was only in 1977 that the NRA went down this road of taking total disinterest in the safety of the American people. Before that, they believed in things like making sure that there was a preservation of shooting rights for people in hunting, making sure that there was preservation of national parks et cetera. But an extremist element seized control in 1977, and we have seen the downward spiral since then.


The opposition attempts to give everyone a perception that there is rampant crime all over Western Sydney and that it is all caused by the importation of Glocks from Germany, that it is all related to the federal government's Customs failures. It is interesting to note the figures in Australia. There has actually been a substantial improvement in the low level of gun homicides in the country. For 2001 the rate was 1.06 per 100,000 people. But before 2001 the rate was never, ever, in any one year at all, lower than 1.67 per cent. That is in contrast, of course, to the United States picture, where 31,000 people are killed a year, and 16,700 of them are actually murdered. There is a rate of 867 guns per 1,000 citizens, and 30 to 40 per cent of homes own them.


If we allow a wider proliferation of gun ownership in this country, if more people have guns in their hands, then more people have a direct interest in preserving the rights of that lobby group, and its power is enhanced. These are the real issues at hand with regard to gun ownership in this country. The opposition is unfortunately trying to politicise this debate today where the government is providing a series of measures. The final throwaway line from the opposition was that they support the measures, but it was accompanied by a lot of rhetoric which was carrying on about border protection and every other issue except that which is at hand today. I commend the legislation.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Cabinet Secretary) (18:36):  Last year at my request the Australian Crime Commission conducted a national investigation of the illegal firearms market. They presented their report to police ministers in June of last year. It is a very serious document. It reveals a black market of a quarter of a million firearms in the hands of criminals. 


In the conduct of that investigation, the Australian Crime Commission traced 3,168 firearms that police had seized across the country. That tracing analysis found that 44 per cent of those weapons were not surrendered or registered after the Port Arthur massacre, 12 per cent of those firearms were stolen or involved in staged theft and less than one per cent of those firearms traced by the Crime Commission were illegally imported. In other words, the majority of those weapons that form part of this massive illegal black market are weapons that either were not handed in after the Port Arthur massacre or were stolen. In New South Wales alone, 10 firearms are stolen every week. In the last decade, 7,000 weapons have been stolen in New South Wales and not recovered. I read in a South Australian newspaper today that there have been more than 11,000 weapons stolen in South Australia in the last decade.


All of this fuels that black market. Criminals do try to import weapons. We have seen evidence of that. One illegal gun import is one too many. That is why I have established a Firearms Intelligence and Targeting Team inside Customs, and it is getting results. It is working with the New South Wales police, as well as the FBI, the ATF and the DEA in the United States. They broke a gun-running syndicate only late last year. It is also why I have brought forward this legislation, but it must be clearly understood that this is one small part of what is a massive illegal firearms market: a quarter of a million guns in the hands of criminals across the country.


If we are serious and if we are going to tackle this illegal firearms market then we need to tackle it from every angle—not just on the border but on the street. We need to make sure our police have got the powers they need to seize those weapons off the criminals that are infesting Western Sydney and shooting up streets. We need to make sure that our law enforcement authorities have got the powers that they need to break the code of silence surrounding people that are too afraid to talk and to give information to police. We have to improve our ability to trace the firearms that police do seize. We have got to strengthen laws—and this is an example of that—and harden the border.


I put a package of reforms to police ministers in June last year and got their in-principle support for a package. This legislation is the first of these reforms. It introduces tough new penalties for firearms trafficking across state and national borders. It creates new aggravated offences for people who traffic 50 or more firearms or firearm parts either within Australia or across its borders. The maximum penalty for these offences will be life in jail, which is the same maximum penalty for drug trafficking. Additionally, the bill expands existing offences to cover the trafficking of firearm parts as well as the trafficking of firearms. It will also create new offences relating to the trafficking of firearms across Australia's national borders. This will send a strong message that trafficking in firearms and the violence that it creates will not be tolerated.


As I said, this bill is just one part of a package of reforms that I took to state and territory police ministers last year. These reforms have been agreed in principle, but there is now a lot of work to do to ensure that they are fully implemented. They include, firstly, the establishment of a national firearms register. There are firearms registers in each state and territory. According to the federal agency CrimTrac, about 14,000 firearms disappear off these registries ever year and can slip into the black market. We need to fix this, and that is the purpose of a national firearms registry.


The next thing we agreed on was the in-principle rollout of an Australian ballistics identification network nationwide. This is effectively technology that enables police to identify, from the firearm they seize, the firearm's involvement in previous crimes. It is like DNA testing for stolen weapons. The New South Wales police have this technology and so do the federal police. We need to roll it out to all police across the country. That is what we agreed to in principle last year.


We also need to improve the skills and the training of our law enforcement officers across the country in the tracing analysis that they do of firearms. For that purpose, this month I am bringing to Australia experts from the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to train state police, federal police and Customs officers. I mentioned the Firearms Intelligence and Targeting Team that I have established in Customs and the work that it is doing. In addition to that, one of those officers has now been embedded inside the New South Wales police. This makes sure that officers are working together with a common aim. The next step is to embed Customs officers in similar squads and similar task forces right across the country.


If we are serious about this and if we are serious about making sure that we get these guns of the streets, I think we need to go one step further and give police the powers that they really need to go and get these guns. What I am talking about here is the power for police to randomly search serious repeat offenders for guns. Police know who most of these criminals are, but people are too afraid to talk. We need to give them the power to go and get these guns. If someone is a serious criminal and they have a record of using firearms then police should have the power to stop them and search them for guns at any time. South Australia has laws like this at the moment and I have asked state police ministers across the country to consider implementing this as well. If we are serious about this, if we are serious about tackling this a quarter of a million firearms on the streets of Australia, then this is what we have to do. We have to tackle this from every angle.


This bill also makes important improvements to laws that allow our law enforcement agencies to target unexplained wealth—the ill-gotten gains of the actions of organised criminals. They are very important reforms. They are the first stage in the implementation of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement. The Attorney-General's Department at the moment is consulting with our federal law enforcement agencies in preparation for the implementation of the other recommendations in that report. The key one in that report was the recommendation of the committee that the states and territories of this country refer their powers to the Commonwealth to create national unexplained wealth laws so that there are no soft spots across the country, no safe havens and no place for criminals to hide their assets—the same law across the country. It will give police more powers to seize the cash, the cars, the homes and the assets of these criminals.


I have spoken to police who are at the centre of the drive-by shootings in Western Sydney, and their advice to me is pretty plain. They say the best way to break these gangs is to seize their assets, to take their cash off them. A lot of them are gen Y criminals. It is all about the power and status that comes with the crime—and power comes from money, which enables them to pay off the people who are involved in the criminal enterprise. Take their cash and you take their power. They are often more afraid of losing their money than they are of going to jail. That is why these laws are so important.


As I said, money creates power in the criminal underworld. The more powers we can give our law enforcement agencies here, the more it can help to alter the balance of power on the street and undermine the influence of these criminals. If states do as our Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement has recommended—and it is a bipartisan recommendation; both sides of the House think this is the way to go—if states agree to give the Commonwealth these powers to create these laws, then states will have the option of using their existing unexplained wealth laws and asset seizure laws or using these laws as well. So they give up nothing. Any concern the states have that they will lose out from this is a concern that is misplaced. This will only add to the powers of state police and add to the ability of states to recover more assets.


In the course of this debate, one member of the opposition said that this was a good thing and asked why the government was not implementing it straightaway, and then another member of the opposition said that this was just a distraction. Well, the Australian Federal Police Association and the Police Federation of Australia do not think it is a distraction. The police in Western Sydney do not think it is a distraction. They think it is a critical part of the armoury that police need: seize their cash, seize their assets and shift the balance of power on the street. So I back these calls. I back the recommendation of our committee, and I will work as hard as I can this year to see it implemented.


I put this case to attorneys-general last year, twice. I asked them for these powers, and on both occasions they rejected that. I think that is a mistake. I think our committee got it right. I think it is a bad decision by the states to think that national laws here will not help. I will continue to prosecute the case for these laws and for national antigang laws this year. This is a good bill. I thank the opposition for their support for this bill. I commend the bill to the House.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2013-02-05,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (17:22):  It is great pleasure to talk on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012. Serious and organised crime is a genuine national security issue for our country. It threatens our economy, it threatens the well-being of the Australian people and it threatens our way of life. The opposition believes that all the resources and focus of the federal government must be brought to bear on this issue. It is very difficult to get an accurate estimate of the financial cost of organised crime to our community, but it is certainly very significant and, by some estimates, would be up to $15 billion. So the impacts of organised crime are serious not just for those directly affected but also for the community as a whole.



Sadly, since the government changed in 2007, the Labor government has pursued policies which have made it easier for criminals to prosper. They have made it easier by savaging our law enforcement agencies, by occupying the time and efforts of those law enforcement agencies on their self-induced border protection crisis and by failing in their duty to properly police what comes in and out of our country. Since they have come to government, Labor has axed 750 staff and significant funding from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, leaving our borders vulnerable to infiltration by serious criminal syndicates.Slashing funding for Customs has meant more opportunities for criminals to put drugs and guns onto our streets.




We 
saw shocking
 revelations late last year of Customs officers 
being directly 
involved in 
corruption at Sydney airport, 
including allegations of a
iding drug traffickers and
 laundering 
money 
for the very bikie gangs that are terrorising Sydney streets.


Under Labor
,
 less than 10 per cent of air cargo and less than 
five
 per cent of sea cargo are inspected when they enter Australia's borders
, 
giving criminals a better chance of successfully smuggling weapons, drugs and other contraband into our community.





Extensive cuts to the A
ustralian Crime Commission mean
 that the Commonwealth's capacity to provide intelligence on organised crime is severely limited.


Similarly
,
 cuts to the Australian Federal Police have impacted on their ability to function to their full 
cap
ability.


These cuts 
have 
come at a time 
when an enormous amount of police 
and law-and-order 
resources 
have been
 directed to dealing with Labor's self-induced border protection crisis
—a 
crisis that has seen over 32,500 people 
smuggled illegally into Australia on
 557 boats.





If the Minister for Home Affairs and the Labor Party 
we
re serious about stopping organised crime
, the first thing they would


do is not lecture the states about what the states


should 
be 
doing
. The first thing the federal Labor Party should do is do properly 
the job
 they have been given by the Australian people
.


It i
s an unfortunate fact that the
 cuts 
they have inflicted since they 
have 
come to office have allowed
 criminals a better chance of getting guns and drugs onto our streets
. A
ll of this is happening at the same time 
as
 they 
have 
reduc
ed
 funding to 
our
 law enforcement agencies, such as the Australian Crime Commission
, the Australian


Customs and Border Protection Service 
and the Australian Federal Police.


The Commonwealth
 government


is 
just 
not pulling its weight in this area. In fact
,
 they 
are 
systematically 
undermining 
the 
ability of the federal government to fulfil its law and order responsibilities.




While making legislative changes is
 not
 in itself 
enough 
to tackle organised crime, 
clearly the right legislative framework gives our
 law enforcement 
agencies a more
 workable 
way of tackling this very serious issue—and unexplained wealth 
laws 
are a very important part of that
.


This bill seeks to implement some of the recommendations made by the Parliamentary


Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which inquired into the Commonwealth's unexplained wealth 
legislation and reported early
 last year.

The committee made a total of 18 recommendations. Unfortunately, this bill implements only six of them. I am particularly disappointed by the failure of the government to embrace the recommendations of that parliamentary committee which involve the Australian Crime Commission pursuing unexplained wealth orders. The ACC has significant coercive powers to force witnesses to answer questions, and those significant powers—which are unavailable to other law enforcements agencies—would have been very helpful in pursuing proceeds of crime. But this is an agency that has been systematically attacked by the ALP for funding and staffing cuts. As a committee member I am disappointed to see that the recommendations which specifically recommended that the ACC be given this extra role have not been embraced in the legislation presented to the House by the government. I would like to have seen the government act faster to implement the other recommendations. I note that they have not formally responded to that report, even though it was handed down almost a year ago. Despite this, the coalition welcomes the measures contained in this legislation to strengthen our proceeds-of-crime framework. This will help our law enforcement agencies target criminals and crack down on organised crime. 


I turn now to some of the specifics of the bill. Part 1 of schedule 1 implements recommendations made in the committee's final report. During the course of the committee inquiry, the Australian Crime Commission informed the committee that serious and organised crime groups continue to prove resilient and very adaptable to legislative changes, law enforcement intelligence and investigative methodologies. I remember very distinctly that they said that the best way to tackle organised crime is to remove the proceeds of illegal activity. That is one of the most significant deterrents we can have to unlawful activity. The police in particular gave us some very vivid examples of hardened criminals who were reduced to tears when the police confiscated their luxury cars. This really hits criminals where it hurts—taking away the proceeds of their illicit activities. Indeed, doing that is one way to deliver heavy blows to organised criminals. 


That is why it is vitally important that the Commonwealth has a proceeds of crime framework which actually works and which our law enforcement agencies can use effectively to tackle organised crime.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee is currently inquiring into this bill. The Australian Federal Police Association and the Police Federation of Australia were supportive of it, particularly the measure to remove judicial discretion from unexplained wealth orders, noting: 'We would like to publicly state that we support the removal of judicial discretion for unexplained wealth restraining orders, preliminary orders and final orders. This brings unexplained wealth into line with other kinds of proceedings conducted under the Proceeds of Crime Act.' Both the PFA and the AFPA have been long-time supporters of strengthening Australia's unexplained wealth laws and have voiced their concerns about the weaknesses in the existing Commonwealth regime. I note that both of those agencies do a very good job of representing the voices of police men and women across the AFP and, more broadly, across the state and territory policing agencies. Since I have become shadow minister for justice, customs and border protection, they have spoken to me about the deficiencies within the current Commonwealth proceeds-of-crime framework. 


The bill also makes amendments to expand existing cross-border firearms trafficking offences in the Criminal Code and to introduce new aggravated offences for dealing in 50 or more firearms and firearm parts. The bill's explanatory memorandum notes that the amendments are aimed at expanding existing cross-border trafficking offences in the Criminal Code to deal with firearm parts. 


The coalition is particularly proud of its record in taking dangerous guns off our streets and therefore tackling gun crime. As all Australians will remember, in April 1996, Martin Bryant, a very disturbed man, used a semi-automatic rifle and a semi-automatic assault weapon to kill 35 people in a murderous rampage in Port Arthur, Tasmania. At the time, newly elected Prime Minister John Howard made the controversial decision to reform gun ownership laws. 




Mr Champion:
  Courageous.




Mr KEENAN:
  And it was a very courageous decision. Of course, it was highly controversial amongst owners of guns in the community, who rightly said that they had not committed these crimes and had lawfully owned these weapons. To take these weapons off the street involved an enormous amount of political courage from the Prime Minister and his cabinet at the time. Members of parliament had to go out and talk to people about why they believed it was necessary to crack down on these sorts of dangerous weapons. I think it is fair to say that, despite the controversy at the time, those gun laws have been incredibly successful in reducing our gun related homicide rate. They have also reduced the suicide rate in Australia. The Australian Institute of Criminology found that gun related murders and suicides fell sharply after those laws were introduced 1996. In the 18 years before the 1996 reforms, Australia suffered a rather astonishing total of 13 gun massacres—a massacre being a gun crime with more than four victims—causing over 100 deaths. I note there has not been a single massacre since 1996. Those figures probably provide some salient lessons for our friends in America. I do not think that any Australian would deny that today our country is safer as a consequence of the coalition's bold changes to gun ownership laws.


The coalition knows that organised criminal syndicates now seek to import their illegal guns from overseas. Sadly, I do not think this fact is sufficiently acknowledged by the present government. Indeed, the minister refuses to acknowledge the extent of the problem, even with evidence of illegal guns slipping through our borders and coming into New South Wales, as was the case with the Sylvania Waters post office in Sydney when in March last year 220 Glock pistols from Austria were imported via a gun dealership in Germany, using falsified documents. This was not discovered by the federal law enforcement agencies which are tasked with policing our borders. It is important to make the point that it was the New South Wales Police that discovered this significant importation of pistols. This highlighted the devastating effects of Labor's cuts on our border protection agencies, in that the Federal Police no longer had the ability to pick up such a significant importation of illegal firearms.


The cuts have meant a significant reduction in the higher rates of cargo inspections that were occurring under the previous government. When we left office in 2007, 60 per cent of air cargo consignments were inspected by Customs and Border Protection. Labor's significant cuts to the Customs cargo-screening budget has meant a staggering 75 per cent reduction in the percentage of air cargo inspections conducted under the coalition. We have seen a similar decrease in sea cargo inspections.


Labor's cuts have resulted in a $22 million funding cut to the Australian Crime Commission—the agency which, to my disappointment, is not more heavily involved in policing unexplained wealth. The astonishing number of 144 personnel have been taken out of the Australian Crime Commission. It is not a large agency, so that cut represents about 20 per cent of its personnel. 


Labor say they want to be taken seriously on law and order issues. You cannot be taken seriously when your record since coming into office has been to cut the Australian Federal Police, to savage Customs and Border Protection and to savage the Australian Crime Commission. Labor have demonstrated year after year a blatant disregard for tackling organised criminal activity by targeting these key Commonwealth law enforcement agencies for vicious cuts. The Australian Federal Police has been subjected to a $265 million cut since the Labor Party came to office. 




Mr Bowen:
  Is there any chance of talking about the bill?




Mr KEENAN:
  These funding cuts to Customs, the ACC and the AFP have clearly had a significantly impact on the ability of federal law enforcement agencies to do their job properly. The minister at the table says, 'Is there any chance of talking about the bill?'


This bill deals with the smuggling of guns across state borders. The point is that, when you cut resources—the number of personnel available—to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies, it impacts on the ability of those agencies to do their job. This is the problem with the government. They are more interested in spinning away their failure than they are in doing something to tackle the problems which their cuts have significantly contributed to. 


We are supportive of measures to combat gun crime. We are particularly supportive of anything we can do to take guns off our streets. Sadly, we are seeing on our streets the impact of these cuts to Customs. More and more guns have been smuggled into our country because of the very significant cuts that the Labor Party have made since they came to office. We in the coalition believe that the Commonwealth should do its job properly. The law enforcement role of the Commonwealth is to increase the ability of the states to fight crime. Of course, the states have primary responsibility for law and order within their home jurisdictions, but when the Commonwealth is not policing its borders and it is cutting Commonwealth law enforcement agencies then we are making the job of state law enforcement agencies harder. That has to stop. 


This Labor government has systematically made damaging cuts, and this has placed an enormous burden on our state police forces, who are called upon to deal with the consequences of more illicit drugs, more contraband and more illegal firearms on our streets because our borders have been penetrated by organised criminal syndicates. If the Minister for Home Affairs is serious about tackling organised criminal activity—and he says that he is—the first thing he should do is seek to rectify the damaging cuts that have been made to the agencies which he is responsible for. But unfortunately we have a minister who has not proved capable of doing that to date and, until he does so, he cannot be taken seriously when he comes into this place and says that law and order is a significant priority for the Labor government. 


The priority for the Labor Party at the moment seems to be to deflect blame for the fact that we have had this spike in the number of weapons coming into our country because of these cuts and their impact on our borders. Clearly, if you are going to cut resources—if you are going to cut the number of personnel in our agencies—it is going to hamper the ability of law enforcement agencies to do their job. You cannot possibly believe that these savage cuts will not have an impact on our law enforcement agencies to do what we expect of them. 


Due to the nature of the measures proposed in this bill, it is right and proper that it have an airing within the Senate committee process, and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is due to report back on the bill by 13 March. We will be scrutinising what they have to say once they report. Clearly, we will reserve our right to move amendments in the Senate if they highlight areas in which we should do so. We do support the measures contained within this bill. It is important that the Commonwealth have a workable proceeds-of-crime and wealth confiscation program, but, sadly, we do not believe that implementing six of the 18 recommendations that the committee—which was chaired by the member for Fowler, who is due to speak after me—reported on will achieve that. The member for Fowler will not say this, I suspect, but I am pretty sure that he will be very disappointed in his government's response, because he takes his responsibilities on that committee very seriously. He listened to what the police forces around the country had to say to us about these matters. So we will look to rectify and strengthen this framework when we come to office. But, until Australia gets the election it deserves, we will support these measures, albeit reserving our right to make appropriate amendments if the Senate committee highlights areas in which we should do so.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (17:41):  I rise to support the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The bill will amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 and strengthen our nation's fight against organised crime. The bill does this primarily by strengthening the laws related to the illegal firearms market, with the proposal to reduce firearms related crime nationally. The bill will also amend the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and enhance our law enforcement agencies' ability to attack organised crime by targeting unexplained wealth. 


When I first came into this place, following a by-election in 2005, I indicated in my first speech that issues such as drug related offences and firearms offences were not just matters for state and territory police. I indicated that these the importation of weaponry or drugs was something which the Commonwealth had a very clear and abiding responsibility for. I am pleased to say that this legislation follows the sentiments that I expressed in 2005, with the Commonwealth taking greater responsibility in the fight against organised crime. 


We understand that organised crime is a business and that, like any other business, will look for windows of opportunity. It will exploit state and territory boundaries; it will exploit constitutional difficulties. Therefore, it does require the Commonwealth, together with state and territory bodies, to be able to work in a cooperative manner to defeat the ravages of organised crime in our society. 


This bill creates new aggregated offences for trafficking 50 or more firearms or parts of firearms within a six-month period across state, territory or national borders. It increases the punishment for such serious offences to life imprisonment or 7,500 penalty points or both. It also, importantly, brings the maximum punishment for trafficking firearms in line with drug trafficking, recognising that the illegal firearms market poses as great a challenge to our law enforcement agencies and to the community at large as does drug importation and distribution. Interestingly, the Australian Crime Commission has estimated that the current market for illegal firearms in this country is about a quarter of a million firearms. Notwithstanding the illicit market, the total estimation of firearms throughout our community is 2.75 million. Therefore, it is very important that we keep track of legal firearms as well as be able to monitor those that fall into the illicit market. The fact is that, once these firearms are in the market, they can circulate for many years.


It is strange to relate that, even in the 2002 gun buyback, not many of the criminal elements would have traded in their weaponry at that particular time. With all the gun theft that we see—that is, theft of legal weapons, which come into the illicit market, which is one of the major concerns for most of our security agencies—these weapons will stay in circulation for a long time.


Increasing the maximum punishment for firearms trafficking is just one part of a much larger campaign to strengthen Australian gun laws. One of the other measures includes the establishment of a single national firearms register with a database of all weapons used in crime. This register will link together the 30 separate databases currently being used and, hopefully, prevent another 14,000 firearms being lost into the illicit market. We are also strengthening our firearms laws by establishing the Australian Ballistics Identification Network, which is able to analyse and link firearms obtained through previous crimes; by raising community awareness; and through more extensive training in firearms for Australian law enforcement agencies and other organisations. Illegal firearms trade is often a significant aspect of the work of the serious and organised crime groups. This bill ensures that we are better equipped to tackle the illegal firearms trade and, therefore, minimise the effect of firearms on our community.


Importantly, the bill also amends the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to improve our nation's ability to use unexplained wealth as a tool of law enforcement to combat serious and organised crime. It is important to me because, as chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, I am proud to see that the recommendations made through the committee's extensive inquiry into the Commonwealth's unexplained wealth laws are being adopted. Those recommendations were a bipartisan opportunity for members of the committee to come together and seriously look at the contemporary tools that our law enforcement agencies need to combat serious and organised crime. As a matter of fact, my committee has never once had a minority report. I commend all members of the committee for approaching their jobs seriously and with diligence.


The law enforcement committee has been working pretty hard in relation to unexplained wealth because we see this as one of the key methods of targeting serious and organised crime. Specifically, the amendments will broaden the search and seizure provisions to enable materials relevant to unexplained wealth proceedings to be seized by officers executing a search warrant. It will also allow the court extended time for the serving of notice of unexplained wealth orders and will also provide for increased scrutiny of those bodies, principally the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission, where these powers are used and greater scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement.


One thing that is quite apparent is that, in terms of policing and law enforcement, regrettably we as legislators will inevitably have to increase powers in order to protect our communities. Again, on a bipartisan basis, with the increase of those powers comes an increased level of oversight, and that is certainly the case in respect of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission.


I have nothing but respect for their officers—for the dedication and commitment they show in combatting crime—but in terms of protecting the integrity of the powers, and the circumstances in which those powers can be used, it is only appropriate that the level of oversight be at the high level we currently have.


In order to prevent and disrupt crime we must address some of those drivers that underpin criminal activity. As I said a little earlier, criminals are many things—they certainly participate in nefarious activities—but at the end of the day they are business people. They are in business to make money. They are profit driven. So, to disrupt their businesses you go about threatening their businesses and threatening their profits. Essentially, that is what unexplained wealth is about.


The Australian Crime Commission estimates that at the moment the cost of organised crime to Australian society is somewhere between $10 billion and $15 billion every year. That is not the effect on individuals or the economic effect of crime; if you take that into account, those figures are probably very conservative. Therefore, it is very important that we give the people that we charge with the responsibility of protecting our community the powers that they need to combat crime—not simply to arrest people after the event, bring them to trial and then punishment, but to deter and prevent criminal enterprise. If we are able to do that it means that we can prevent crime. If we can prevent crime it means we stop there being another victim of crime in our community.


I am glad this legislation is supported by both sides of the House, because this represents a huge step forward for Australian crime fighting. Having had the opportunity to spend some time with colleagues looking at some of the contemporary issues of law enforcement overseas, I can see that the suite of laws that are being presented at the moment through this bill puts us very clearly on a superior footing to most law enforcement agencies throughout the world. What we are adopting here is basically what has been recommended by Interpol back in, I think, 2004. Very few agencies have been able to achieve what Australia has been able to target through this suite of legislation.


Clearly, whilst there is no doubt that this legislation will put people's liberties at risk—particularly if their business is in a crime related field—it will do something that is not all that common in law enforcement: it will target the issue of preventing and disrupting crime.


Being the son of a police officer, I know only too well how my father would come home and celebrate when they took some serious criminal off the street. I know the father of the member for Cook would have been in the very same predicament. The member for Cook probably heard the same stories around the kitchen table at his place.


The fact is that contemporary crime fighting is not waiting around for a crime to be committed; it is not waiting around while a business advantage is being exploited by criminals; it is getting involved and doing something that actually shuts down criminal enterprise. Regrettably, people's liberties will be affected by that. We do not make any bones about that. In terms of the suite of tools that are necessary for policing, this is one of those which rate very highly.


I must congratulate Mark Burgess and officers of the Police Federation of Australia. Going back some, I think, three or four years, they were the first organisation that came to my parliamentary committee saying that this is what they thought policing requires in this country.


It was this government that took on that challenge to do something—make those changes and provide police officers with the necessary tools they need in contemporary crime fighting.


It cannot be only with the Commonwealth. There are a few constitutional barriers here; therefore, it requires a very concerted effort between the Commonwealth and state and territory bodies to work together with a common view of attacking serious and organised crime. To that extent, it will require a certain amount of coming together, sharing power to make sure that the proper aspect of this legislation is not only arrived at on paper but fully executed in the various courts around the land that are designed to put criminal elements out of business.


I am very pleased to be the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement—as I said, a body that has taken seriously its responsibility in looking at what is necessary in contemporary crime fighting. I am pleased to support this. And, as I said, as a son of a police officer, regardless of what my dad's view may have been earlier in the piece, I think this will actually put far more people on the criminal side out of business than simply waiting around for another drug deal on the street. I support the bill.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2013-02-05,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (17:56):  Also as the son of a police officer, like the member for Fowler, these issues are matters of close interest to me personally as well as in terms of my electorate in the seat of Cook—and I will refer later to the incidents that took place there last year with the smuggling of Glock pistols through a post office in my electorate. They are also of concern to me as part of the broader issue of national security, in which I have a keen interest, and these matters go directly, I think, to matters of national security.


When one is debating these matters in this place, never far from our mind are the tragedies, not only in our country but also in places around the world. Sadly, even quite recently, we have seen the horror and the tragedy of guns getting into the hands of bad people—into the hands of criminals who hold our society to ransom and to hostage and selfishly seek to impose their greed and their evil on others. There will be no debate in this place about the evils of these things. I think the sentiments and the intentions that sit behind this bill are respected and appreciated, and I commend the government in bringing this bill to the House. I also commend the minister, who has brought this bill to the House, on his appointment to the cabinet.


It is the job of a national government to protect our borders and to keep Australians safe behind those borders. That is the goal informing governments from this place. That is a core responsibility of a national government. At its heart, this is a bill about national security and especially about protecting our borders from the movement of illegal firearms and weapons parts. The measures contained in this legislation seek to better protect Australian communities from the clutches of criminal syndicates and ensure that they are not able to profit from the nefarious trade.


The coalition will support this bill in principle. We understand the intent behind it, and that is something we can identify with. But, pending further advice from the Senate committee, we reserve our position on other amendments and things that may be brought up as a result of those investigations. I would hope the government would work constructively with the opposition on the things that may come from that process. If things are identified then, in the spirit of the shared intention, they should attract support. The coalition remains committed to strong border protection, and we welcome the opportunity to discuss these matters in this place, because the truth is that when it comes to border protection more broadly the Australian people have already registered a pretty clear verdict about the government's competence in that matter.


Last year, Commissioner Andrew Scipione from the New South Wales Police Force—I would argue the most trusted and respected law officer in the land and over many generations—referred to the issue of guns being imported illegally overseas as the elephant in the room. He said that it is not just a border security issue but a national security issue. I could not agree with the commissioner more. Any piece of legislation concerned with removing guns from Australian streets should merit our close attention. Any bill that strives to make our neighbourhoods safer by virtue of making it harder for criminal syndicates to operate is worthy of scrutiny in this place.


This legislation would effect several key changes to both the Criminal Code Act and the Proceeds of Crime Act. Firstly, this legislation seeks to strengthen the investigative powers and Commonwealth prosecution of cases in relation to unexplained wealth. Secondly, this legislation seeks to expand existing offences for cross-border trafficking of firearms. The new regime would include aggravated offences with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for dealing in 50 or more firearms or parts within a six-month period.


As I said, we cannot fault the intent behind this legislation, but we have a duty to examine these matters closely to ensure that any unintended consequences do not compromise the outcome that we are trying to achieve. It was almost a year ago now that the New South Wales police discovered a gaping hole in our borders on gun control, with 220 Glock pistols allegedly smuggled right into the city of Sydney, guns that ended up on our streets in the hands of criminal gangs. Those guns found their way into my electorate of Cook, into the shire and into southern Sydney, allegedly through the Sylvania Waters post office. That alleged smuggling operation was described by Andrew Scipione, the Commissioner of Police in New South Wales, as perhaps the biggest illegal syndicate doing this type of illegal gun trafficking that Australia has ever seen.


What is worse, our Customs and Border Protection Service had no idea that it had happened. It had to be brought to their attention late into the investigation in order to effect the sting that saw the arrests that followed. They were not brought on board that investigation early. One still wonders to this day why the New South Wales police made the decision not to involve Customs and Border Protection earlier when they were aware that these guns were on their way to Sydney. That raises serious questions. I remember raising those questions in this place and proposing that we have a commission of inquiry into that incident to understand the failings in the system that had let that happen. That proposal was rejected by the government and ridiculed by others. But this incident was the canary in the mine.


What did we see at the end of last year? To our shock and surprise, we saw Customs officers involved in embedded corruption at our airports and our sea ports. That was going on. This was a serious matter. It was a matter that the New South Wales police had identified and brought to the attention of Customs. There is a serious need to deal with what is happening in our Customs and Border Protection Service. At the end of last year, there were revelations that as many as 20 Customs officials had been allegedly involved in extensive corruption at Sydney airport. As my colleague the member for Stirling has mentioned, these included allegations of aiding drug traffickers as well as money laundering for bikie gangs. An entire shift had been compromised. One Customs and Border Protection officer arrested by the AFP was charged with offences including conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of border controlled precursors, weapons offences, receiving a bribe and abuse of public office.


These crises do not happen in a vacuum. They have been allowed to occur and continue against a backdrop of mismanagement and chaos on our borders under this Labor government that the Australian people have watched with horror. Specifically in the area of Customs, they take the knife to the Customs budget, dropping from inspecting 60 per cent of air cargo inspections under the Howard government to just 8.3 per cent under this government. Those drastic cuts to cargo screening have allowed weapons and illicit drugs to come into this country and then onto our streets and into the hands of organised criminal syndicates. The people of Western Sydney know that. When the coalition left office, we were inspecting 6.2 million air cargo consignments. That figure today, taken from the government's budget papers, is 1.5 million.


At the same time there are about 10 million air cargo consignments. Today that figure exceeds 15 million, yet the percentage of air cargo consignments being inspected continues to shrink. It comes down to this: under Labor criminals now have a 90 to 95 per cent chance of successfully smuggling weapons, or rather, contraband, into our community. Those are terrifying odds.


It is all well and good to be implementing these laws to improve our powers to charge and prosecute offenders. And this an iterative process. The parliament should always be looking at ways we can better equip those on the front line with the resources, the authority and the legal backing they need to do their job to the best of their ability. But we must be mindful about how the guns are getting in in the first place. I turn to none other than the now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr. When he was Premier of New South Wales this is how he believed guns were getting into the country. All these guns, he said, 'the guns on our streets, the guns being traded, the guns that form this black market, have got into Australia through pretty porous borders.' That is what Senator Bob Carr said when he was Premier of New South Wales. Now he forms part of a government that denies this is the case. When he said this, air cargo screenings were many multiples over what this government is doing today, and the resources, proportionally, were greater at the time than they are today.


This is a government that has moved quickly, even today, and over the last few days, to try to divert attention, to say, 'It is not our fault. We just control what comes into the country. We need to shift the focus and say it is what is happening in state enforcement with our police forces.' What is important is that an incompetent federal government needs to take over the powers of state governments, which actually alerted them last year to the problem. They are the ones who blew the whistle. Customs did not know they were on fire on this issue until the New South Wales police turned up with a hose and put them out.


We do not want diversions and distractions from this government, for which they are well known when it comes to the issue of gun crime. We will see plenty of announcements and we have seen plenty of stern faces looking into the cameras, incredibly earnest, calling on people to lay down their swords and get together and work constructively on this issue. Well, here is a tip for the government: do your job well and the guns will not get into the country.


This government has not stopped the guns, it has not stopped the drugs and it has not stopped the boats, and the Australian people know it. You can go out there and argue about your alleged competence on our borders until you are blue in the face but the Australian people know that this government is the biggest failure on our borders in our nation's history. And they will be judged for it. That day is coming—14 September is coming—when this government will be judged for its failures on our borders. The people are waiting and they want to issue that judgment for your mismanagement and incompetence on our borders. We on this side of the House will work towards that day, not only continuing to prosecute that case but continuing to firm up and build further the policies that we know are necessary to get things right on our borders once again.


This government slashed 750 staff from our Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. They have stripped funding and personnel out of the agency, leaving it vulnerable. Clearly, a culture of corruption is evident in these agencies—in this agency specifically. It is about restoring the confidence of the Australian people in these agencies. The many hardworking enforcement officers who work in the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, like those who work in similar law enforcement agencies around the country, will be horrified—the good officers, the ones who want to do the right thing, the ones who want to be proud of their organisation and the job it does, because it is an important job. But you have to get the settings right. You have to allow those who want to do the right thing and uphold the integrity of their organisation to be the ones whose activities are rewarded—and rewarded in the sense of having an organisation that has the support, both in terms of the financial support for the resources provided and in terms of the political support, to do their job.


The failures of this government on borders are well known. They are not limited to the area of Customs. They are well known in the area of immigration. I note that yet another minister for immigration has entered into the revolving door of policy failure in these last few days.


He will not have big shoes to fill—because his predecessor allowed almost 25,000 people to cross our borders illegally into this country—but he is a minister who is returning to the scene of the crime. The now minister for immigration is the same minister who, along with the now departing Senator Evans, was responsible in large part for the unwinding of the controls that we had on our borders under the Howard government. So he returns to the scene of his crime and to the scene of failure when he previously served in the area of customs and border protection, only now to babysit this government's failure on our borders to an election.


The coalition will continue to stand up for national security in this country. We continue to believe strongly, as we demonstrated in government and stand ready to demonstrate again if elected at the next election, that we need to enforce the laws on our borders, strengthen the force of our borders and ensure that Australians are kept safe behind those borders by doing the federal government's job and working with the state governments to ensure that they can do their job, rather than trying to distract attention, as the minister has done today by alleging all sorts of things about New South Wales. It was the New South Wales police who set off the alert here on the issue of guns coming into this country, and the government should do its job. (Time expired)

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (18:11):  Last year the Australian Crime Commission did a national intelligence audit of the illegal firearms market in Australia. That audit estimated that, while there were more than 2¾ million registered firearms in Australia, the illicit firearms market consisted of around a quarter of a million weapons—around 250,000 long arms and, perhaps more concerning, about 10,000 handguns. Illegal firearms sourced through theft from licensed owners and firearms dealers consist in part of weapons that were made illegal in the 1997 gun laws, about which I will say more later, and deactivated firearms that have been reactivated.


This bill is a response by the Australian government to these concerning findings. It deals with the spread of illegal firearms by introducing new offences for aggravated firearms trafficking. It extends existing cross-border offences and introduces new basic offences for trafficking firearms across borders. Our aim is to hold traffickers responsible for the consequences of providing firearms to the black market. They are aiming to tackle the illegal firearms market from different angles—to seize the firearms, to break the code of silence and to improve our ability to trace firearms—and they complement other reforms the government is putting in place. These reforms include the rollout of the Australian Ballistics Identification Network, a national database which will allow police in states and territories to link up their information on weapons recovered from crime; better training, from the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which will happen in February this year; and an in-principle agreement with police ministers for a national firearms register. This national firearms register really is an important development, and I would urge those police ministers who are currently considering it to act immediately. I think it is vital that state and territory firearms registers are joined up. Australians move states or territories frequently and the information about those weapons should follow them.


These laws are also part of a package of reforms dealing with unexplained wealth.


As the Minister for Justice explained:


These laws will help us to catch criminals. Just like with Al Capone - you can catch criminals by following the money.


And through this broad suite of reforms we are cracking down on the illegal firearms market. In so doing we are supporting law-abiding recreational shooters. Law-abiding recreational shooters have the most to lose from an illicit firearms market in Australia because it is law-abiding firearms owners who are tarnished when these drive-by shootings occur, when crimes are committed with illegal weapons.


I am fortunate to have within my own electorate the firing range used by the Canberra Rifle Club. The Canberra Rifle Club is, I am told, the city's oldest surviving sporting body. It traces its conception back to a report in the Queanbeyan Age newspaper on 6 May 1913, nearly a century ago:


There was a representative gathering of riflemen at the residence of Mr. Hector McIntosh, Canberra, on Saturday last, to discuss the proposal of forming a rifle club at that place.


And there had previously been rifle ranges at the Black Mountain Peninsula picnic grounds and the Mount Ainslie summit road, but the club's present facilities are at a better location in the Majura Valley. They opened in September 1969 and, in passing, I note that they are just off Majura Road, near the Majura Parkway. The club's facilities will not be adversely affected by the construction of the Majura Parkway, the ACT's biggest road-building project, fifty-fifty funded by the federal and ACT governments and which it was my pleasure to attend the sod turning of this morning.


The range is named the McIntosh Rifle Range after Hector McIntosh, and since 1972 it has been the venue for the National Queen's Prize shoot. In 2004 the Canberra Rifle Club and Bungendore Rifle Club ran the inaugural Canberra Queen's Prize meeting, and they are a premier state and national rifle competition. The member for Griffith attended the presentation ceremony for the Queensland Queen's Prize in 2012.


The Canberra Rifle Club, importantly, has strict requirements for its members regarding firearms licences. Its rules say:


All members and users of the range may be required at any time to satisfy the Club that they hold a valid Firearms Licence as issued by the State or Territory in which they reside.


This is especially the case when purchasing ammunition or ammunition components from the Club. Consequently, you should carry your current Firearms Licence and your current NRAA Membership Card at all times.


This is an example of a well-managed and regulated facility for sport shooters.


That stands in stark contrast to the behaviour of some of the sport shooting associations in the United States. Following the Connecticut school shooting we have seen again on display the awful intransigence of the US National Rifle Association, a body which took a moderate stance in the 1930s when it supported federal gun control; which in the 1960s supported a ban on 'Saturday night specials' because, as they said at the time, they had 'no sporting purpose'; but which was taken over in 1977 by people like Harlan Carter, Wayne LaPierre and the like and found itself in the 1980s opposing bans on armour-piercing bullets, which were being used to kill police on US streets.


The debate on gun control in the United States is so different from the debate in Australia. In part that is because of the initiative that was taken in 1997 by then Prime Minister John Howard and Tim Fischer, Leader of the National Party, who were willing to take on the extremists in their own party to see a gun buyback passed. I think sometimes in this place we pay too little tribute to the other side of politics. I was in here about an hour ago speaking about the fiscal profligacy of the Howard government, but let me in a different spirit recognise the forward-thinking actions of the Howard government and Tim Fischer in the Australian gun buyback.


By tightening firearms legislation, by buying back around two-thirds of a million weapons, Australia achieved a substantial fall in the firearms death rate. Firearms homicide and suicide rates fell by about half and have stayed down. These are figures that are sometimes contradicted by shills speaking for the National Rifle Association or other bodies in the United States, but the facts do not lie: fewer Australians die as a result of firearms homicide and suicide thanks to the actions of the Howard government in 1997.


But we have to remain vigilant. We have to continue updating the laws to fit the times. This bill cracks down on the illegal firearms market. It is important that we keep the challenge in perspective. Australia's firearms death rate is low by international standards. Christine Neill of Wilfred Laurier University and I carried out two studies looking the Australian firearms buyback. We found when we looked at the time trends and when we looked across states it was very clear that the firearms buyback had saved lives.


Prior to the Port Arthur massacre Australia had experienced a mass shooting—that is, a shooting with five or more victims—on average every year for the previous decade. Since then we have not had a mass shooting in Australia. That could be coincidence but the odds of that are less than one in 100.


Importantly, we have brought down firearms suicide, because that is the most common form of gun deaths, and we have brought down firearm homicide. The United States, though, still experiences over 80 gun deaths every single day—a horrendous death rate. One of the things that we in Australia can do is to present to United States legislators who are dealing with this very complicated issue—President Obama and Vice President Biden are now considering a package of gun law reforms—a bipartisan model of dealing with gun deaths. This is a bipartisan model that does not undercut the role of sporting shooters but recognises, as I have in my own electorate, groups of sporting shooters who are committed to enjoying their sport with shooting licences and with gun registration. They recognise that good laws are essential if people are to enjoy sport shooting in a safe environment. They recognise that the scourge of gun death in Australia has, in the past, been too high and that it needs to come down.


So I would urge those opposite to try and refrain from some of the partisan politicking in this debate. One of the things that has traditionally characterised the firearms legislation debates has been their bipartisan nature. Then opposition leader Kim Beazley did not hesitate before supporting John Howard in the package of laws that were put in place after the Port Arthur massacre. I urge those opposite to be wary of point-scoring and to recognise the value that we can bring to this place from sober, sensitive, reflective debate over reducing gun deaths.


We will probably never reduce the number of deaths to zero but we ought to do all in our power to bring it down. And we ought to do all we can to tell the world the story of Australia's firearms regulation. It is a good story. It is a story of conservatives who were willing to stand up to extremists in their ranks, of bipartisan law reform, and of ongoing law reform recognising that, as criminals advance in their methods of evading detection, Australian laws have to move to keep pace.


I commend the bill to the House and I commend the work of the minister, who is here in the chamber, on this bill.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (18:24):  As a person who has more than a passing interest in this matter—in fact, my maiden speech to the New South Wales parliament 30-odd years ago was about gun laws—and as a person who had the honour, and I say 'honour', to represent the federal opposition at a huge rally in Sydney's Domain, where we indicated total support for former Prime Minister John Howard's gun law initiatives, I join with the previous speaker in expressing disquiet over the opposition's contribution to this debate. The member for Cook spoke of diversions and distractions. Quite frankly, I think that encapsulates the total performance of the opposition in this debate.


The opposition's leading speaker on this debate, the member for Stirling, said that the government had only implemented a number of the recommendations that came forward. He did not belabour his argument on any that were not pursued. He did not specifically declare that it was the end of the world if any of them were not pursued. He made some references to a Senate inquiry. He did not seem to have any ideas of his own. Then the member for Cook came along and tried to draw some sort of personal connection with gun problems in this country because a post office in his electorate was the site of the importation of guns. But I live in an area of Sydney which has been characterised by a huge spate of gun related incidents over the last year or so, so for me this a very personal issue.


For the opposition to come in here today, when the government has made serious efforts after a series of police ministers meetings in, I think, June and November last year, and say that this debate is completely about the number of customs inspections concerned with the illegal entry of guns into this country is appalling. Yes, of course both sides of politics would like to minimise the number of guns that, through importation, end up on the illicit market in this country, but if we look at a number of commentators on this problem we find it is very complex. In April last year, the member for Wentworth said that a fundamental requirement is more policing of gun offences in this country. The final report of the national investigation into illegal firearms noted that 44 per cent of the guns we are concerned about were those not surrendered or registered after the Port Arthur massacre, 12 per cent were stolen or the subject of staged theft in Australia, and a mere one-half of one per cent seemed to come from illegal importation. The Australian Crime Commission commented:


The illicit firearm market is predominantly comprised of firearms which have been diverted from the licit market through a variety of means.


It further commented:


Illicit handguns have principally been sourced by criminals who took advantage of differences in state and territory definitions of firearms and other loop-holes—which have been closed for over a decade.


It is a very complex problem, made up of so many elements. So for the opposition to come in here today and say, 'We're going to solve the illicit gun issue in this country by enhanced inspection of imported goods,' is just preposterous.


There are further examples of how complex the problem is. I note that Dr Bricknell, a leading criminologist, pointed to Queensland legislation, where it emerged that deactivated guns could be reactivated and the serial numbers transferred to working weapons. She analysed a major problem in Queensland legislation, a loophole that had partly led to this issue. I note that former Federal Police officer Nigel Phair, director of the Centre for Internet Safety at the University of Canberra, who has spent the last four years heading the High Tech Crime Centre, looked at the question of the failure of police authorities to move onto the internet, a major source, as he sees it, of gun problems in this country.


As I say, how guns enter this market is an extremely diverse, complex problem. It is not a matter just to be toyed with and played with by an opposition that is trying to connect this issue with the entry of people by boat into the country. The member for Cook's contribution was really about further haranguing the chamber on the number of boats coming into the country and border security et cetera. It had nothing to do with the issues that we are facing today. We see a variety of real measures in this bill. It will provide for the addition of an aggravated offence to existing cross-border offences based on the disposal, acquisition, taking or sending of 50 or more firearms. It will extend the coverage of the existing cross-border offences, including providing new offences to deal with international firearms trafficking. It will provide for the basic import-export offences to be punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. These measures are worthwhile and should be commended.


I also note that the shadow minister spoke about listening to the police force. That is his supposed way of dealing with this problem. I wish he would talk to the Queensland government about the police force views on guns in this country, because one of the first actions of the new government in Queensland was to appoint a gun committee for the state. I seem to remember the police force in Queensland going on national television to complain very vehemently about the total domination of this committee by people with commercial interests and other interests in promoting gun ownership in this country. We are seeing in Queensland a situation where the conservative side of politics is trying to, in a sense, please people in the gun lobby. It is nascent. It is not very strong, like in the United States. But this is a leading indicator of the real things that should be done about guns, not rhetoric about importation and the number of crates that are opened at the airports or the harbours. They are putting a committee up there to basically liberalise gun laws, to try and make sure that restrictions, controls and limitations are broken down.


Also, if we are so concerned with regard to gun homicides, gun suicides et cetera in this country, one only has to look at the recent experience in New South Wales politics as to where the agenda is going. I have been very critical of the previous Labor government in New South Wales for kowtowing to the gun interests in that state because they held a few votes in the upper house. And what have we seen since the government of New South Wales has come into power? Very swiftly the very controversial decision to allow shooting in national parks. That is deplored by the very public servants who dedicate their lives to their parks and safety—not just because of mercenary self-interest and the wages they get paid—coming out and absolutely moving towards industrial action because of the way in which that government is again kowtowing to the gun interest.


A series of measures have been supported by national police committees. They follow the 1996 National Firearms Agreement, the reaction of the federal government under John Howard to the Port Arthur disaster, the 2002 national agreement on handguns et cetera. In the spirit I indicated earlier of trying to be nonpartisan in a very important issue for the safety of Australians, I also take the point of commending the former Prime Minister for involving himself in the current debate in the United States. For those who are unaware, John Howard wrote a leading editorial in the New York Times, an opinion piece, last week about the way in which Australia's tougher gun laws after Port Arthur had led to improvements in the safety of Australians.


What is often lost in this debate on guns is that the question of criminal use is minor. Essentially, the real danger of guns is the use in domestic arguments between parties: the danger to the neighbour by the person next door who supposedly needs a gun to protect themselves and who, in a rage over how high the fence is or someone making too much noise, goes out and shoots their neighbour. The other serious reality with gun ownership in this country is the question of accidental death.


I am very much concerned with the performance of the opposition in this debate. After Port Arthur the opposition did the right thing by the Australian people by fully, totally, unequivocally supporting John Howard in a move toward tighter restrictions. If we move in the way that the Queensland government is at the moment in kowtowing to these interests, we will see the reality of what we see in the United States, where the presidential candidate for the Republican party last time, Mitt Romney—and it was so fake, so transparent—had to pretend he liked shooting. He had to go out there. Now we have had the President of the United States also having to parade around as a skeet shooter. Both sides of politics are so intimidated by the National Rifle Association that they have to lower their dignity, lower their morality, to do these kinds of things.


It is interesting to note the debate in the United States. It was only in 1977 that the NRA went down this road of taking total disinterest in the safety of the American people. Before that, they believed in things like making sure that there was a preservation of shooting rights for people in hunting, making sure that there was preservation of national parks et cetera. But an extremist element seized control in 1977, and we have seen the downward spiral since then.


The opposition attempts to give everyone a perception that there is rampant crime all over Western Sydney and that it is all caused by the importation of Glocks from Germany, that it is all related to the federal government's Customs failures. It is interesting to note the figures in Australia. There has actually been a substantial improvement in the low level of gun homicides in the country. For 2001 the rate was 1.06 per 100,000 people. But before 2001 the rate was never, ever, in any one year at all, lower than 1.67 per cent. That is in contrast, of course, to the United States picture, where 31,000 people are killed a year, and 16,700 of them are actually murdered. There is a rate of 867 guns per 1,000 citizens, and 30 to 40 per cent of homes own them.


If we allow a wider proliferation of gun ownership in this country, if more people have guns in their hands, then more people have a direct interest in preserving the rights of that lobby group, and its power is enhanced. These are the real issues at hand with regard to gun ownership in this country. The opposition is unfortunately trying to politicise this debate today where the government is providing a series of measures. The final throwaway line from the opposition was that they support the measures, but it was accompanied by a lot of rhetoric which was carrying on about border protection and every other issue except that which is at hand today. I commend the legislation.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2013-02-05,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Cabinet Secretary) (18:36):  Last year at my request the Australian Crime Commission conducted a national investigation of the illegal firearms market. They presented their report to police ministers in June of last year. It is a very serious document. It reveals a black market of a quarter of a million firearms in the hands of criminals. 


In the conduct of that investigation, the Australian Crime Commission traced 3,168 firearms that police had seized across the country. That tracing analysis found that 44 per cent of those weapons were not surrendered or registered after the Port Arthur massacre, 12 per cent of those firearms were stolen or involved in staged theft and less than one per cent of those firearms traced by the Crime Commission were illegally imported. In other words, the majority of those weapons that form part of this massive illegal black market are weapons that either were not handed in after the Port Arthur massacre or were stolen. In New South Wales alone, 10 firearms are stolen every week. In the last decade, 7,000 weapons have been stolen in New South Wales and not recovered. I read in a South Australian newspaper today that there have been more than 11,000 weapons stolen in South Australia in the last decade.


All of this fuels that black market. Criminals do try to import weapons. We have seen evidence of that. One illegal gun import is one too many. That is why I have established a Firearms Intelligence and Targeting Team inside Customs, and it is getting results. It is working with the New South Wales police, as well as the FBI, the ATF and the DEA in the United States. They broke a gun-running syndicate only late last year. It is also why I have brought forward this legislation, but it must be clearly understood that this is one small part of what is a massive illegal firearms market: a quarter of a million guns in the hands of criminals across the country.


If we are serious and if we are going to tackle this illegal firearms market then we need to tackle it from every angle—not just on the border but on the street. We need to make sure our police have got the powers they need to seize those weapons off the criminals that are infesting Western Sydney and shooting up streets. We need to make sure that our law enforcement authorities have got the powers that they need to break the code of silence surrounding people that are too afraid to talk and to give information to police. We have to improve our ability to trace the firearms that police do seize. We have got to strengthen laws—and this is an example of that—and harden the border.


I put a package of reforms to police ministers in June last year and got their in-principle support for a package. This legislation is the first of these reforms. It introduces tough new penalties for firearms trafficking across state and national borders. It creates new aggravated offences for people who traffic 50 or more firearms or firearm parts either within Australia or across its borders. The maximum penalty for these offences will be life in jail, which is the same maximum penalty for drug trafficking. Additionally, the bill expands existing offences to cover the trafficking of firearm parts as well as the trafficking of firearms. It will also create new offences relating to the trafficking of firearms across Australia's national borders. This will send a strong message that trafficking in firearms and the violence that it creates will not be tolerated.


As I said, this bill is just one part of a package of reforms that I took to state and territory police ministers last year. These reforms have been agreed in principle, but there is now a lot of work to do to ensure that they are fully implemented. They include, firstly, the establishment of a national firearms register. There are firearms registers in each state and territory. According to the federal agency CrimTrac, about 14,000 firearms disappear off these registries ever year and can slip into the black market. We need to fix this, and that is the purpose of a national firearms registry.


The next thing we agreed on was the in-principle rollout of an Australian ballistics identification network nationwide. This is effectively technology that enables police to identify, from the firearm they seize, the firearm's involvement in previous crimes. It is like DNA testing for stolen weapons. The New South Wales police have this technology and so do the federal police. We need to roll it out to all police across the country. That is what we agreed to in principle last year.


We also need to improve the skills and the training of our law enforcement officers across the country in the tracing analysis that they do of firearms. For that purpose, this month I am bringing to Australia experts from the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to train state police, federal police and Customs officers. I mentioned the Firearms Intelligence and Targeting Team that I have established in Customs and the work that it is doing. In addition to that, one of those officers has now been embedded inside the New South Wales police. This makes sure that officers are working together with a common aim. The next step is to embed Customs officers in similar squads and similar task forces right across the country.


If we are serious about this and if we are serious about making sure that we get these guns of the streets, I think we need to go one step further and give police the powers that they really need to go and get these guns. What I am talking about here is the power for police to randomly search serious repeat offenders for guns. Police know who most of these criminals are, but people are too afraid to talk. We need to give them the power to go and get these guns. If someone is a serious criminal and they have a record of using firearms then police should have the power to stop them and search them for guns at any time. South Australia has laws like this at the moment and I have asked state police ministers across the country to consider implementing this as well. If we are serious about this, if we are serious about tackling this a quarter of a million firearms on the streets of Australia, then this is what we have to do. We have to tackle this from every angle.


This bill also makes important improvements to laws that allow our law enforcement agencies to target unexplained wealth—the ill-gotten gains of the actions of organised criminals. They are very important reforms. They are the first stage in the implementation of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement. The Attorney-General's Department at the moment is consulting with our federal law enforcement agencies in preparation for the implementation of the other recommendations in that report. The key one in that report was the recommendation of the committee that the states and territories of this country refer their powers to the Commonwealth to create national unexplained wealth laws so that there are no soft spots across the country, no safe havens and no place for criminals to hide their assets—the same law across the country. It will give police more powers to seize the cash, the cars, the homes and the assets of these criminals.


I have spoken to police who are at the centre of the drive-by shootings in Western Sydney, and their advice to me is pretty plain. They say the best way to break these gangs is to seize their assets, to take their cash off them. A lot of them are gen Y criminals. It is all about the power and status that comes with the crime—and power comes from money, which enables them to pay off the people who are involved in the criminal enterprise. Take their cash and you take their power. They are often more afraid of losing their money than they are of going to jail. That is why these laws are so important.


As I said, money creates power in the criminal underworld. The more powers we can give our law enforcement agencies here, the more it can help to alter the balance of power on the street and undermine the influence of these criminals. If states do as our Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement has recommended—and it is a bipartisan recommendation; both sides of the House think this is the way to go—if states agree to give the Commonwealth these powers to create these laws, then states will have the option of using their existing unexplained wealth laws and asset seizure laws or using these laws as well. So they give up nothing. Any concern the states have that they will lose out from this is a concern that is misplaced. This will only add to the powers of state police and add to the ability of states to recover more assets.


In the course of this debate, one member of the opposition said that this was a good thing and asked why the government was not implementing it straightaway, and then another member of the opposition said that this was just a distraction. Well, the Australian Federal Police Association and the Police Federation of Australia do not think it is a distraction. The police in Western Sydney do not think it is a distraction. They think it is a critical part of the armoury that police need: seize their cash, seize their assets and shift the balance of power on the street. So I back these calls. I back the recommendation of our committee, and I will work as hard as I can this year to see it implemented.


I put this case to attorneys-general last year, twice. I asked them for these powers, and on both occasions they rejected that. I think that is a mistake. I think our committee got it right. I think it is a bad decision by the states to think that national laws here will not help. I will continue to prosecute the case for these laws and for national antigang laws this year. This is a good bill. I thank the opposition for their support for this bill. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (21:30):  This Saturday just past, at four o'clock in the afternoon, some 600 owners of classic cars gathered with their cars in Lilydale to participate in the second annual classic car Remembrance Cruise to commemorate the anniversary of the Black Saturday fires. The drive is the inspiration of two people, Stacey and Troy Kinsmore, in memory of their close friend Kate Ansett and her partner, Steve Fisher, who died at Toolangi on Black Saturday. Last year, the first drive took place to raise awareness and to raise money for the local Healesville Country Fire Authority. The cars gathered at Lilydale Industrial Estate, at Stacey and Troy's business, before cruising to Healesville via Yarra Glen, Dixons Creek, Toolangi and Chum Creek.


The purpose was to reflect, remember and rededicate to the memory of those who lost their lives. You could not drive on that drive, as I did, without reflecting as you drove through the winding roads through Toolangi and down to Healesville. Everyone who participated who paid a registration fee made a practical contribution to fundraising for the CFA. At the historic Healesville Railway Station many other families came and contributed, as well, as you would expect, to raffles and to donations to the CFA.


This is a step that Stacey and Troy Kinsmore wanted to take. The first cruise last year, on the third anniversary, was a very big step for them. In the period that followed the Black Saturday fires they knew they wanted to do something to honour the memory of their friends, but it took some time and some healing before they settled on what it was they would do. This is now an institution that will take place every year. It will raise money every year and it will raise community awareness every year. As you know, Speaker, as a fellow member from Melbourne, it was more than 200 Saturdays ago, but of course it feels like last Saturday, even yesterday, for all those affected by the fires.


I had the privilege of helping Stacey and Troy just a little in the organisations. They deserve congratulations, and I wanted to mention them in the House, along with Wendy Bennett, who conducted the official proceedings. As I said, funds raised go to the local Healesville CFA and also to the Kate Ansett Bushfire Recovery Fund, which Stacey and Troy have established. This was a great local community event, a time to reflect and remember, and I wanted to congratulate them in this House for all they have done and all I know they will do in the years ahead.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the member. I, also, bizarrely, had a constituent who was lost in the fires, and I think we also reflect on that sad time today.
