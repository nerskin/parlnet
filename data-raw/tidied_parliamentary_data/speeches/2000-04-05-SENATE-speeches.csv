"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-04-05,"—Madam President, as mentioned previously, this government will certainly not be supporting the second reading amendment. Just to bring to an end my comments yesterday, I would even be surprised if the Labor Party could support the second reading amendment. It talks about the GST being unfair. It may not be well known out there in voterland and it may not be well known amongst people who even more closely observe the parliamentary scene, but the truth of the matter is that the Labor Party will now incorporate the GST as part of their next election platform.
—And you just go on believing that.
—That is what your people say, Senator Conroy. I know that you are a shadow junior minister and that there are certain frustrations in being a shadow junior minister. I understand that: I have been there and done that, Senator Conroy, so I well understand that you may not be in the loop. In fact, I do not think a great many senators are in the loop of what the Labor Party has decided. 
I am an observer of the public scene and an observer of public policy, and it is very clear to me that the Labor Party will now incorporate the GST as part of their election platform. Therefore, to be suggesting that the GST is an unfair tax just seems to be quite absurd. It is part of what I have described in the past as the politics of deceit: you are either going to support a GST or you are not. The truth of the matter is that, despite the 72 hours of long and incredibly tedious debate in this place, the Labor Party has decided to support a GST.
Where the Labor Party's policy differs, Madam President, is that the Labor Party says there will be some roll-back. What we need to know is exactly what is in the Labor Party roll-back. Some issues were raised by Labor senators in their debates, but the truth of the matter is the Labor Party is unwilling to specify whether its concerns will form part of the roll-back or not, and that is causing a degree of uncertainty. The sooner the Labor Party can get its act together, the better.
The other issue which is worrying people is the Labor Party's attitude to tax cuts. If you are going to have a roll-back, you are going to have to find the money from somewhere. You are not going to take it off the states: that is a guarantee you have already given to the Labor states. Therefore, you have to take it from somewhere and the truth of the matter is that it will probably come off the income tax cuts which this government will be delivering in full on 1 July, which are the largest tax cuts in Australian history.
A number of issues were raised by the Labor Party—issues of compliance. Probably to deal with those particular matters, I should draw the attention of the chamber to a very interesting article prepared by Mr Chris Jordan, Chairman of the New Tax System Advisory Board.
—A paid flunkey of yours.
—Senator Conroy, I do not think it helps public debate when everyone who expresses a view that does not agree with yours is described in the most disparaging terms possible. I never feel that helps public debate. I know that you have got a bit of a reputation in this area and I know this might sound good in Labor Party circles, but in terms of wanting to have a more edifying public debate, frankly it does not sound good. People are entitled to express a view which may not concur with yours without being subjected to personal attacks and vilification. 
—Bring him to estimates.
—I think he would be absolutely petrified about facing up to you, Senator Conroy! That would really worry him! 
—Hansard does not record sarcasm, so I am glad that is on the record. It doesn't read so well.
—The fact of the matter is that Senator Conroy and Senator Sherry are probably well known for their personal attacks. It is not my style, actually. Senators have noted that that is not my style in this chamber. I play it straight. I play the ball.
—You ought to be in the ruck for Carlton this weekend if that is the case.
—I do not know why Senator Conroy's obsession with Carlton seems to have so marked this debate. I have no idea what it has to do with the bill before this chamber. 
This article on the issue of compliance was the substance of quite a number of matters which were raised by opposition senators. As I said, I draw their attention to Mr Chris Jordan's article, which was published in the Sun Herald on13 February. I will just quote some extracts, which are worth putting on record. He said:
In fact, compliance costs relating to the introduction of the GST for most small businesses will be negligible and many can expect to enjoy substantial long-term benefits.
—Have you ever met with any small businesses?
—Senator, I know that you probably have as a union boss. You have probably gone around and tried to intimidate many small businesses.
—Yes, I am. Madam President, the fact of the matter is that if Senator Conroy had met any people in small business, he would know how concerned they are about union power and the impact that unions have. Mr Jordan went on:
For companies that are already computerised, the cost of updating record-keeping and meeting compliance requirements will be very low. 
Then there was an attack on Mr Langford-Brown, which I thought was most unfortunate. I know Senator Sherry would not wish to associate himself with Senator Conroy's comments;  nonetheless, there was an unfortunate attack. Let me indicate again a part of the article which deals with the issues that were raised in evidence before the taxation committee. Mr Chris Jordan went on to say:
No-one using paper-based systems needs to spend money on computer hardware or software to meet compliance requirements. They will still be able to comply at very little cost.
A record-keeping booklet has been released containing details about the sorts of records that you will need to keep under the new system. It gives examples of cash payments and cash receipt books, and also includes sample sheets, which can be photocopied and used by businesses.
Then he went on very sensibly to say:
However, many businesses will take advantage of the practical guidance and financial assistance on offer to carry out a more substantial upgrade of their record-keeping ... systems.
His comments are certainly worth recording and worth noting. It may assist the Senate and those who wish to read the debates if I seek to incorporate his article in the Hansard.
Leave granted.
The article read as follows—

BURDEN OF COMPLYING IS NO MORE THAN A MYTH.
By Chris Jordan, chairman of The New Tax System Advisory Board *
Some media have carried exaggerated reports on the cost of compliance to small businesses with the introduction of the new tax system.
In fact, compliance costs relating to the introduction of the GST for most small businesses will be negligible and many can expect to enjoy substantial long-term benefits. 
A recent Ernst & Young report found that it was a misconception that the cost of compliance would be high.
The report stated that  some longer term benefits for business are not inconsiderable and include fiscal benefits and learning the importance of cashflow, updating of book-keeping systems and allowing better management reporting and increased knowledge.
For companies that are already computerised, the cost of updating record-keeping and meeting compliance requirements will be very low.
The Ernst Young report noted that two of four specific companies studied will not  face additional costs in becoming GST compliant because   the software upgrade was   included in an existing  licence.
No-one using paper-based systems needs to spend money on computer hardware, or software to meet compliance requirements. They will still be able to comply at very little cost.
A record-keeping booklet, has been released containing details about the sorts of records that you will need keep under the new system. It gives examples of cash payments and cash receipt books, and also includes sample sheets, which can be photocopied and used by businesses.
However, many businesses will take advantage of the practical guidance and Financial assistance on offer to carry out a more substantial upgrade of their record-keeping and financial systems. The Ernst &Young report said many small businesses in New Zealand enjoyed many benefits from similar GST-prompted upgrades when a new tax system was introduced in that country.
The Government is developing useful tools and services to help companies upgrade, but the biggest incentive is an immediate tax write-off for GST-related plant and software for businesses with an annual turnover of  less than $10 million
Businesses with an annual turnover of under $10 million will also receive a voucher with a face value of $200 when they register for an Australian Business Number (ABN) and GST.
This voucher can be used to help meet any expenditure related to the implementation of the GST in their business. It can be put towards purchasing, training or even upgrading software or accounting systems from registered suppliers.
Businesses can gain access to the list of registered suppliers offering discounts on equipment and services in several ways.
With the $200 certificate, businesses can gain access to discount suppliers through the GST start-up website (www.gststartup.gov.au) or when they receive their certificates they will also receive a booklet which lists all registered suppliers of equipment advice and training.
There are more than 1,000 registered suppliers offering in excess of 6,000 products, with more being added all the time. Many are offering discounts which average about 20 per cent. Larger discounts of  up to 80pc apply on some other items.
At the same time, the Tax Office is preparing free, simple record-keeping software to help businesses meet minimum record-keeping standards. Tax agents received pre-production copies of the software in December, with the final version due for release to the public later this month.
Management of small businesses after July 1 will also be easier because complex wholesale taxes will be abolished and businesses will have a single tax reporting form - the Business Activity Statement. This means fewer tax forms, less reporting to the ATO and quicker and easier ways of dealing with the ATO, including via the Internet.
* The New Tax: System Advisory or Board provides independent advise to Government on the implementation of  the new tax system.
—I think that deals with many of the issues which were raised on the compliance front.
A number of questions were raised by Senator Sherry, in particular, which I plan to deal with in the committee stage of the bill as I am actually waiting for my advisers on this issue. Mr Blair Comley is now coming in. Mr Blair Comley is always welcome in this chamber and has made many valuable contributions to the debate. As we get into the committee stage I will deal with some of the issues that Senator Sherry raised. I know Senator Sherry was very anxious to receive some response. 
I will conclude my remarks by saying that we will not be supporting the second reading amendment, and I am amazed that the Labor Party, which now supports the GST, will be supporting it as well. There will be a day of reckoning for the Labor Party when the public start to wake up to the fact that the Labor Party will not be repealing the GST; the Labor Party will be sticking with the GST in the next election. Mr Gary Gray has a different view to Senator Conroy. Senator Conroy attempted to discuss the electoral consequences of the GST. He discussed those before the last election, and we are on this side and Senator Conroy is on that side. I noticed Mr Gary Gray has a different view to Senator Conroy on the electoral consequences. Senator Conroy, I think there will be a heavy price to be paid by a party that is not fully frank with the public about what its policies are. There will be a very heavy price to pay. People will look very closely at the debates we have had on the GST and particularly closely at the Labor Party contributions. (Time expired)
Amendment not agreed to.
Original question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time. ",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TAX ADMINISTRATION) BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-04-05,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2000 covers three areas of tax law: an anomaly in the sales tax legislation which would have imposed sales tax on the value of modifications to motor vehicles made for disabled access; secondly, a more beneficial and certain valuation method for certain types of employee share ownership schemes which involve a public offer to overcome a potential anomaly where employees can face tax on a larger discount than they actually receive; and, thirdly, technical amendments to the ultimate beneficiary provisions which are anti-avoidance provisions dealing with change of trusts. 
The sales tax law will be amended to ensure that the part of the value of a motor vehicle that represents the additional cost of making the vehicle suitable to be driven by or used to transport a person suffering from a physical impairment will be free of sales tax. The amendment will overcome an inconsistency in the current sales tax legislation. Currently, under item 98 of schedule 1 of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992, there is an exemption which frees from tax any goods, that is to say, parts, used in the modification of vehicles for disabled persons' access or use. However, in some cases this benefit is effectively removed as modifications represent the process of manufacture that renders the value of the modification as being subject to sales tax. The amendments fix this unintended anomaly and are particularly necessary to meet the transport needs of the Paralympics. These changes were announced last November and are to apply retrospectively from 26 June 1998. Labor supports these amendments.
The second group of amendments deals with employee share schemes. It is proposed to insert an alternative method, that is to say, public offer price, for determining the market value of shares acquired under an employee share scheme. This method will be used when a public offer is made in a listed public company and an offer of shares or unlisted rights to acquire shares under an employee share scheme is made in association with that public offer. 
Currently, market value of a listed share or right is determined by reference to the weighted average of the prices at which the shares were traded during the one week period up to and including the day of acquisition. If there is no trading during that period, the price is determined by the tax commissioner, usually by the public offer price. Under the new rules, the price will be determined by reference to the public offer price. Under these changes, it is claimed to be fairer to employees as it will eliminate the artificial discounts which can arise under the current rules and which are subject to tax. If a company makes a public offer of shares for, say, $8 and offers those shares to employees at a modest discount of, say, $7.80 and if those shares trade at above $8 during the week before the issue of the shares for, say, $8.30, then the employee will face tax on the amount of $8.30 minus $7.80 which is 50c, even though the real discount they have received is only 20c. The proposals avoid that anomaly. They are of benefit to employees. Labor will support them.
The third area of amendment concerns what are known as the ultimate beneficiary provisions involving trusts. They are anti-avoidance provisions which deal with the problem of income being avoided or evaded by it being distributed through a chain of trusts and the ultimate beneficiaries not complying with their obligations. In response to that problem, the government introduced the ultimate beneficiary provisions which impose tax at the maximum marginal rate on trustees who fail to identify the ultimate beneficiaries of the moneys which they distribute from their trusts. These rules were strongly supported by Labor when they were introduced last year.
This bill contains a number of proposed technical amendments. These amendments aim to improve the administration of the ultimate beneficiary provisions. The major proposals are, firstly, to allow trustees to recover from beneficiaries any tax paid by trustees on their behalf when their distributions from the trust did not have the tax taken out; secondly, to allow corrections of statements from trustees concerning ultimate beneficiaries. Labor supports these amendments. 
With regard to trusts, we know members of the other side of this chamber have a love affair with their use of trusts in order to avoid tax. Trusts to members of this government are their preferred tax avoidance vehicle. Just as people have a favourite football or rugby team, members of the government have a favourite tax avoidance vehicle—trusts.
The interesting thing about the changes to the ultimate beneficiary provisions is that a number of Liberal members have multiple trusts. In particular, Senator Heffernan has interests in no less than seven separate trusts, of which a couple, from memory, are unit trusts. One can therefore see Senator Heffernan spending a bit more time doing his tax returns this year as he sits down to work out the ultimate beneficiaries of all those trusts through his complex web of trust arrangements. This indeed could be bad news as it may mean Senator Heffernan has to spend less time stalking the press gallery on behalf of the Prime Minister and more time filling in all those ultimate beneficiary disclosures. We know why Senator Heffernan is such an avid user of trusts to avoid tax, because he has stated as much. On 11 March 1998, Senator Heffernan was reported in the Herald and Weekly Times as saying:
The use of trusts by farmers to reduce tax was essential to keep family farms operating and to enable farmers to pass their properties to their children.
Added to this, who did the Queensland National Party send with their hired legal gun, Mr Cleary from Cleary Hoare, to try to nobble the government's policy to tax trusts as companies? None other than Senator Heffernan.
—On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: I just heard Senator Conroy quite explicitly call Senator Heffernan a tax avoider. He was then going to explain why he could make that accusation. I regard calling any senator a tax avoider—which is what Senator Conroy has just done—as entirely unparliamentary and a clear reflection on that senator. Senator Conroy should be required to immediately and without any warranties withdraw.
—Madam Deputy President, on the point of order: `tax avoider' is not an accusation of illegality. `Tax evader' would be an accusation of illegality. I know it is hard for members of the Liberal Party to differentiate. Alan Mitchell did a particularly interesting column this week in which he pointed out that it is just a polite way to describe tax evaders and crooks. But tax avoidance is not—last time I checked the dictionary—an accusation of illegality.
 (Senator Crowley)—I think the point is that the description that is ascribed to Senator Heffernan is not a matter of illegality. There is strictly no point of order. It is perhaps less than graceful, but it is not strictly a point of order.
—It is unparliamentary to call a senator a tax avoider. That is a disgrace.
—What is a disgrace is your lot's use of trusts and tax avoidance, and not paying your tax—you have done this for years. You are a disgrace!
—You did nothing about trusts for 13 years. You are a hypocrite.
—Oh, dear oh dear. You are a shocker.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Campbell certainly knows that calling someone a hypocrite is definitely unparliamentary, because he corrected me in this respect last week. So I suggest that he does withdraw, again without any conditions.
—Senator Campbell, would you withdraw.
—Withdraw what, Madam Acting Deputy President?
—I will tell him what he has to withdraw, Madam Acting Deputy President—that he called Senator Conroy a hypocrite. He knows very well what he has to stand in this place to do. He is showing disregard for the chair. 
—I said the Labor Party are hypocrites for doing nothing for 13 years. I did not call him a hypocrite.
—Senator Quirke, the chair appreciates your assistance, but it is not necessary. 
—I will not withdraw calling the Labor Party hypocrites, because they are.
—Senator Campbell, if you call a person a hypocrite, you must withdraw that.
—I did not. And I won't—I called the Labor Party hypocrites. They are hypocrites, and I will not withdraw it.
—As I understand it, that is not a matter that requires a withdrawal. I call Senator Conroy.
—It is always interesting to watch how sensitive the government senators are. We know that so many of them have to stand up and declare their interests in this issue so regularly because they have all been engaged in using trusts in this manner for years. It is no surprise to see you so sensitive, all of you over there, as you get exposed continually on this issue.
—You go and call me a tax avoider out there, you gutless wonder.
—`Tax avoider' is not an accusation of illegality. 
—You go and defame me outside this place. Walk out there and—
—You know the tax law as well as I do, Senator Campbell.
—Senator Campbell, I ask you to withdraw that expression of `gutless wonder'.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, `gutless wonder' cannot be regarded as unparliamentary if `tax avoider' is not. I refuse to withdraw that. I would ask you to reconsider your ruling.
—It is unparliamentary, Senator Campbell. Would you please withdraw it.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, you have now ruled that to call a senator `tax avoider' is parliamentary but to call this gutless wonder a gutless wonder is not. I will withdraw that in deference to your position as Acting Deputy President, but I say to this person opposite that he should walk 10 yards out there and call a senator a tax avoider, and let us see who is acting legally.
—Senator Campbell, we would be assisted if you would do just what you were asked.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.
—On what point, Senator?
—On the point of order. I believe that that was not an unconditional withdrawal.
—There is no point of order.
—Well, I am making one. It was not an unconditional withdrawal, and I believe that is what the senator was asked to give.
—I think that Senator Campbell has withdrawn.
—As I said, it is no surprise to see the spivs on the other side taking this so personally, because it goes directly—
—Senator Conroy, please withdraw the word `spivs'.
—I was not referring to any individual. I said, `spivs on the other side'.
—If you wish to spend your debating time asking the chair to rule on these finer points of order, please feel free. I am advised that calling the other senators in this chamber `spivs' is not parliamentary. Please withdraw.
—I withdraw.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I do think there is a serious matter in relation to calling a senator a tax avoider. I respect your ruling. But I would like you to refer it to the President for a further discussion. I am not reflecting on the ruling at all. 
—Senator, I shall see that that is done.
—Tax avoidance may or may not be legal. I regard tax avoidance as immoral, as does the government. I think accusing a senator of being a tax avoider is a very serious accusation and an imputation. Regardless of precedent, if previous Presidents have said that `tax avoider' is parliamentary, I consider the standard is too low. I think that we should be about raising standards. I know that you, Madam Acting Deputy President, would agree with me in that quest.
—I am glad that you view tax avoidance as such a heinous crime. I am looking forward to the whole string of resignations off your front bench.
I was just saying how the National Party hired their legal gun, Mr Cleary from Cleary  Hoare, to see if they could try and nobble the government's policy to tax trusts as companies. Who did they send? None other than Senator Heffernan. And why wouldn't they? A man with seven separate trusts obviously knows the benefit of using trusts to avoid tax and the threat his government proposes to tax them as companies poses to this most lucrative of Liberal Party pastimes—tax avoidance. The amendments in this bill, although generally minor, are just another testament to the incompetence of the minister responsible for tax administration, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. He could not even get something as simple as the ultimate beneficiary disclosure provisions right the first time round. And this is the minister responsible for the detailed design and implementation of the GST.
In regards to GST implementation, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate another looming GST problem in regards to its impact on retail grocers. These matters were brought to the attention of the House of Representatives by my colleague, Mr Kelvin Thomson, but they are worth repeating here. As many senators are no doubt aware, the National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia have been campaigning for some time on what they see as discrimination under the wholesale sales tax regime as it applies to independent grocers. Their point is that, unlike the major supermarket chains, the independent grocers bear the burden of sales tax on their wholesaler's warehousing and distribution costs before the tax is levied on the last wholesale sale. They had been pressing the government to reform the wholesale sales tax system to end that discrimination and to level the playing field. Of course, the government's response has been to say that the introduction of the GST is going to solve all of that because we will not have wholesale sales tax any more—everything will be all right. Indeed, the National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia have even said that on that basis they were prepared to support the introduction of the GST. But the issue they raise now is that the major supermarket chains are endeavouring to perpetuate the present discrimination under the GST. The major chains have commenced negotiations to amend their trading terms with all vendors so that from 1 July 2000 they can maintain the same dollar takings they currently receive from trading terms, including rebates, promotional allowances and settlement discounts which are now paid on a tax inclusive basis. This government claims to be the government of small business!
My colleague was provided with an edited extract from a document that had been sent by a major chain to its vendors, explaining how their trading terms will need to change under the GST. In the document, the chain indicated that, consistent with the ACCC guidelines, it will maintain its net dollar margin in its gross margin—that is, the mark-up between cost and selling price in relation to goods acquired from the vendors and any services supplied by its vendors. What does this mean? The concern that the retail grocers have is that the trading terms are now being set in a way that will perpetuate the current sales tax discrimination. Far from the GST being a means by which the discrimination could be ended, it effectively means that it will be perpetuated. The association are quite right in saying that this should not be allowed to happen. 
One reason why it might go on is that the government house rejected the findings of the parliamentary committee that examined this area of retailing. The parliamentary committee came up with a recommendation for a mandatory code of conduct which embraced the general principle of like terms for like customers and disclosure of terms by suppliers on a confidential basis to the ACCC. If we had an arrangement like that, you would expect that the ACCC would be able to identify any kind of continuation of unsatisfactory supply arrangements for those independent grocers and stamp it out. Unless the government is prepared to act to adopt some of those recommendations concerning like terms for like customers and is prepared to require disclosure of terms by suppliers on a confidential basis to the ACCC, we will have the unfortunate prospect that independent grocers will continue to find that they are being supplied products on a less satisfactory basis than large retail chains.
The next thing that I want to bring to the attention of the Senate concerns the application of the GST to guide-dogs.
—Oh, no!
—That is right. They are beating up on guide-dogs now. The Guide Dog Association of Victoria in particular are concerned, having received a ruling from the Australian Taxation Office on the provision of pet food and veterinary expenses for guide-dogs. This GST private ruling on food for guide-dogs which was issued in January indicates that the purchase of food for a guide-dog or the payment of veterinary expenses will be subject to the GST.
—The wholesale sales tax was not applied to the purchase of pet food for the guide-dogs, you idiot! It had a sales tax exemption. At the retail outlet where they purchased the pet food, they fill in certificates, and so on.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. It appears that Senator Conroy described Senator Campbell directly, as opposed to anyone on this side, as an idiot. I ask that Senator Conroy withdraw it.
 (Senator Crowley)—Senator Conroy, it is unparliamentary to call a colleague an idiot.
—I withdraw.
—I take no offence from a lowlander.
—The display of ignorance from the senator from Western Australia as he again tries to misrepresent the position with the wholesale sales tax is part of the government's propaganda to prop up their ever drowning GST, and it again needs to be highlighted. I repeat: the purchase of pet food for guide-dogs had a sales tax exemption—just so you do not get it wrong and embarrass yourself again. At the retail outlet where they purchased the pet food, they filled in certificates and so on and they were able to have the 22 per cent sales tax deducted at that point. They did not have to pay the sales tax, whereas now they are subject to GST on dog food and on veterinary services. The association points out that guide-dogs are worth in excess of $18,000 each but are provided free of charge to people with a vision impairment.
—I am glad you are on the big ticket issues. We want to talk about guide-dogs; he wants to talk about sideburns. That is typical of the ridicule, and that is exactly why the Australian public are so opposed to a GST and to what this government is doing. The public were misled before the last election. Anybody who has raised any issue at all about the inconsistencies between what they were told and what is happening today are being ridiculed and demeaned. That is how the guide-dog associations are being treated, and that is how small business is being treated. It is being displayed time and again in this chamber, particularly by the likes of Senator Campbell. 
Back to the guide-dogs, because we are not going to be distracted by spurious comments about sideburns by Senator Campbell's spurious attempts to distract from the debate about the impact of the GST on the guide-dog associations. The association points out that guide-dogs are worth in excess of $18,000 each but are provided free of charge to people with vision impairment. Guide-dog associations around Australia receive some government funding but rely primarily upon corporate sponsorship and community donations. This significant level of community support reflects, in its view, a public perception that guide-dogs should be provided free of charge to enable vision impaired people to move freely and safely around their communities. Guide-dogs provide an equal opportunity for guide-dog users to live independently. 
The association makes a fair point that people with a physical disability who require a wheelchair will not be required to pay a GST on the wheelchair designed to improve their mobility—indeed, the express provisions of the bill before the Senate are designed to improve the ability of disabled motorists. But there is a different situation for those who are guide-dog users. The association makes the point that most guide-dog users are on a fixed income such as a blind pension. There is a risk that users may need to compromise the nutritional quality of their guide-dog's food ration to the detriment of the dog's guiding ability over the longer term. The association is also concerned that guide-dog users may be reluctant to attend their veterinarian for their guide-dog's six-monthly routine veterinary examination. These are matters of real concern to the owners of guide-dogs, and I think they are entitled to be concerned about the tax office's private ruling concerning this issue. On this basis, I hope the government is able to take into its consideration the representations that have been made to government. The government should be reviewing the tax office ruling concerning guide-dog food and veterinary services.
The question has to be asked: why is the government discriminating against blind people with guide-dogs as compared with other people with a physical disability? Why have blind people been singled out for this callous, uncaring and heartless treatment by the government? This government is led by a Prime Minister who promised to govern for us all—except he failed to qualify: providing you are not part of a minority group, disabled in some way, unemployed, a single mother or on a disability pension.
In conclusion, the opposition supports this omnibus bill but notes once again that the Senate is being asked to clean up just another mess as a result of the incompetence of the Assistant Treasurer. Will he present to this chamber a bill that does not need further amending? This applies particularly with respect to the changes required to the ultimate beneficiary trust provisions. I say to Senator Kemp and those opposite: when are you going to get it right? How many more times will the Senate be called upon to clean up your mistakes brought about by your incompetence and your abysmal administration of both the taxation laws of this country and the ATO in general. Recent events show that the ATO has serious systemic problems that have arisen under the stewardship of Senator Kemp. Morale is at an all time low, the implementation of the GST is one disaster after another, and now we have the Petroulias fraud case. If this is how Senator Kemp keeps on top of his brief, I would hate to see what would happen to tax administration in Australia if he ever took his eye off the ball.
In finishing, there is a very interesting article in today's Financial Review which talks about the private binding rulings. We have been trying to get from the government some sort of answer on this, and it has been hiding behind the fact that there is a legal case. That is not good enough. Morale in the tax office has clearly been affected by this. It affects all Australians when private binding rulings are of concern. There are revenue implications. The government will not be able to run and hide by using the line that it is a court case. We will be seeking and pressing for answers to when this first arose, when did people first become aware and why the government will not give us the answers on this.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-04-05,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2000 deals with three unrelated matters—two of which are largely uncontroversial and improve tax law but the other raises a number of issues. The bill alters the calculation of the market value of shares for calculations under provisions dealing with the taxation of employee share ownership schemes where an employee share offer is made in conjunction with a public share offer by a listed company. Those amendments do not appear to raise any issues for us, but I will wait for the committee stage to see if there are any further points to be raised in the debate. The bill also exempts from sales tax the additional cost of manufacturing motor vehicles for use by or in relation to disabled persons. That is obviously an amendment to be welcomed. It will improve facilities for those persons. That amendment does not raise any issues of concern. 
The section of the bill that does raise a number of issues is the section covering the amendments which deal with the provision of ultimate beneficiary statements by certain trustees. Ultimate beneficiaries within trusts have long needed greater exposure and transparency from a tax perspective. The Australian Taxation Office has moved over time to improve that area. I recall some years back actually successfully getting an amendment passed to the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997 which introduced far better disclosure of trust backgrounds where applications for government assistance were being made. It appears to me that the ultimate resolution of these issues concerning ultimate beneficiaries and matters related to closely held trusts should be the focus of government and Treasury attention when the final drafting of the legislation which is intended to tax trusts as companies is before us. Australia is relatively unique internationally in using trusts to excess for the purposes of operating businesses and making sure that tax issues are addressed to the benefit of beneficiaries rather than to the benefit of tax revenue. 
From our point of view, the issues relating to these provisions do not go far enough to address the surrounding difficulties with having trusts fully taxed appropriately. But there is also another side to it. The way in which the legislation has developed and the way in which the tax office have to carry out their investigation of closely held trusts result in a very high compliance cost, and that high compliance cost can affect innocent taxpayers. We support the view that ultimate beneficiary statements should be maintained to curb blatant tax avoidance. That is a laudable objective and it is an objective supported by the Senate. However, the Taxation Institute of Australia has raised with Treasury, the government, the opposition and us a number of problems. I am given to understand that the Labor Party will be addressing some questions to the government with regard to those problems during the committee stage, and obviously the minister's answers will be of interest. 
The legislation concerning ultimate beneficiary statements is already in place. Therefore, this bill is just an amendment bill and does not address the fundamental premise surrounding those statements and the treatment of closely held trusts in existing tax law. As I have already indicated in my remarks, it is my belief that when the legislation covering taxing trusts as companies comes before the Senate we will be able to take a fresh broom to the whole area and from the Treasury perspective, the government perspective and, hopefully, the Senate perspective really clean up an area which has worried, as far as I am aware, all political parties. I will restrict myself to those remarks. I think we will develop these issues far more in the committee stage. ",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-04-05,"—The legislation that we are considering—the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2000—is yet another tax bill. I find it quite amazing that the Liberal and National parties have continued to claim that they are about simplifying the tax system when we are dealing with yet another piece of legislation with regard to the taxation system which adds to the thousands of pages of legislation. Goodness knows how many bills there are. I will have to at some stage calculate that. But we are adding yet again to the complexity.
—About 45 a year.
—About 45 a year—and this is the coalition government that argued that this so-called taxation reform would simplify the system. This legislation has a number of elements to it that deal with the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992, employee share schemes and closely held trusts. To follow on from some of the comments that Senator Murray made, it is my intention to ask a number of specific and detailed questions in the committee stage about ultimate beneficiary statements, but I will leave that to the committee stage. 
In my speech in this second reading debate, I want to make some comments about the wholesale sales tax system, which this bill does go to in a number of areas of its operation. The Australian wholesale sales tax, I contend, is an effective and flexible way of taxing a range of targeted goods at the point of wholesale rather than at the retail sales point. We have had in the last year or so, and particularly in the run-up to the last election, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Liberal-National Party generally making a series of criticisms about the existing wholesale sales tax system. Most of these criticisms, I would contend, were unjustified. 
I want to deal with a number of the statements made in what I would describe as the government's propaganda document, Tax reform: not a new tax, a new tax system. For example, under the heading `An unfair system', it says:
The tax mix in the Australian economy has been moving over the past two decades towards a higher share of direct taxation and a lower share of indirect taxation. Over the 1980s, indirect tax (comprising principally excise and wholesale sales taxes on goods) represented 7.2 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) compared with 5.8 per cent of GDP over the 1990s. 
It goes on to make the point: 
The share of indirect tax as a proportion of revenue to the Commonwealth Budget has fallen from 27 per cent in the 1980s to 24 per cent in the 1990s ...
It makes a further series of statements, for example:
The current tax system is ineffective. It provides a crumbling base from which to derive the necessary revenue to fund essential government services.
I will just make this side point about `necessary revenue to fund essential government services'. It is somewhat hypocritical of the Liberal-National Party to claim that a GST is all about providing revenue for essential government services when the same government has spent the last four years cutting essential government services in a whole range of areas, including health and education. But I will put that aside. 
The document goes on to talk about a complex system. It says:
The current tax system is unnecessarily complex. Income tax legislation has grown from about 120 pages to more than 7,000 as a result of 60 years of patching and filling. 
That is what we are doing at the moment with the so-called new tax system: we are patching and filling. And we will continue to do that because, frankly—I think very honestly—every government in the world is continually patching and filling its tax system for a whole lot of very necessary reasons. It goes on:
A new and properly structured tax system can fix the problems of unfairness, uncompetitiveness, ineffectiveness and complexity that plague the existing system.
Those are just a few of the claims—false claims, I believe—that were made and are still made by the current government, particularly about the wholesale sales tax system. It was the Howard government which legislated for two new WST rates to apply to beer, spirits and wine, with the additional Commonwealth revenue being handed to the states and the territories to make up for the abolished state franchises taxes. 
The type of GST that the Liberal-National Party is now putting in place will not have the flexibility of Australia's WST system to handle the state franchise tax crises if they occur again. It is interesting to note that the WST was introduced in 1930. That is about the time, certainly it is the era, when the GST/VAT was invented by the French. So the WST is not an old tax in comparison with VATs. Since then, the tax has been significantly improved to give effect to various government policies, including concessions and provisions for measures preventing the double taxation of goods. These policies led to the introduction of multiple rates of tax in 1940 to put more of the revenue raising effort onto luxury goods. I think that is a good thing. I think it is a good thing that an indirect tax taxes luxury goods at a higher rate than the so-called necessities of life—unlike a GST. 
There is a wide range of miscellaneous exemptions for goods used by particular persons or particular organisations, such as schools and charities, and there are exemptions or reduced rates of tax on goods used as inputs in goods-producing industries. The WST is a single stage tax on goods manufactured in or imported into Australia for use in Australia. It applies only to goods but it is not limited to sales of goods. For example, as is well known, the WST does not apply to most services, fresh food, water or energy—in other words, most essential goods. The tax applies at the wholesale level. This means that the standard 22 per cent WST rate would usually be less of a tax burden than, for instance, a 15 per cent GST on the full retail price. The concessional WST rate of 12 per cent would certainly be less of a tax burden than the current 10 per cent GST that the Liberal-National Party is proposing. Why is that? Because the WST applies at the wholesale point, and the 10 per cent GST applies at the retail point. So the final impact on price to the consumer under a 10 per cent GST is actually greater than a 12 per cent wholesale sales tax. Manufacturers and wholesalers register and quote their certificate numbers to buy goods tax free. Generally only manufacturers and wholesalers are liable to pay the tax, not retailers, and this is an essential and critical difference between a wholesale sales tax and a goods and services tax. 
I will turn to the rates of tax. As I have mentioned, most essential goods are exempt from the WST. Some of the exemptions, including food and clothing, apply unconditionally. There are other exemptions, and I will not go through the full list now. If you set aside the two special wholesale sales tax rates introduced by the Howard government in 1997 for alcoholic drinks, there are five main rates of tax that can apply to goods: the zero rate, which applies to most necessities; the concessional rate of 12 per cent, which, as I have explained, effectively is a lesser tax burden than a 10 per cent GST; the rate of 22 per cent, which applies to passenger motor vehicles up to the luxury car tax threshold; the higher rate of 32 per cent; and a special rate of 45 per cent, which applies only to that part of the value of a luxury car which is above the luxury car threshold. In 1997-98 it was $57,721.
Certainly the wholesale sales tax was not perfect, but then no tax ever is perfect. There is a range of claims that were made about the wholesale sales tax, and I have alluded earlier to some of those claims in the Liberal-National Party propaganda document that was produced for the election. There is a number of claims that I think are false. And there is a number of reasons why I think a wholesale sales tax is an efficient instrument of taxation. The wholesale sales tax, as I have mentioned, is collected by wholesalers and manufacturers. There are very few retailers who collect the wholesale sales tax. I do not know the precise number but I think it is close to 200,000 businesses that collect wholesale sales tax. By comparison, with the GST we will have well over two million businesses of various sorts collecting the GST. That is clearly more inefficient. That is a clear example of inefficiency in terms of its collection. What we are going to have, of course, is a whole new group of mainly small businesses which will be brought into the tax system and forced to become tax collectors for the GST, and that does not happen with the wholesale sales tax.
I have also mentioned the different rates which apply to a wholesale sales tax. I think that is a good thing. It is a good thing, certainly from a Labor Party perspective and from my own personal perspective, that we tax goods progressively, if you can do it practically—and a WST can and does do it practically. It is a good thing that luxury cars, the BMWs and Mercedes, are taxed at a higher rate than cars used more generally in the community. A GST certainly does not do that. A GST applies the same tax rate, 10 per cent, to all goods and services. So, in terms of efficiency, a WST is an efficient tax. There is a much smaller number of collectors, it is easier to administer and it is easier to supervise. I think the total cost to revenue of the administration of the WST is slightly less than 0.5 per cent of revenue collected. On efficiency grounds, I believe there are very strong arguments for a WST over a GST.
There was one other area where the WST was severely criticised—again, I think unfairly. That was with respect to revenue collected. The point was often made, and incorrectly made, that a WST did not tax services. It is true that a WST did not directly tax services, but indirectly it did tax at least part of the services economy. A good example of the taxation of the services economy is electronic goods. Electronic goods are a function of a growing services economy and therefore the WST did at least in some part tap into the growing services economy. This issue of the revenue collection from a WST was dealt with in the Senate Select Committee on a New Tax System chaired by my colleague Senator Cook, and my other colleague Senator Conroy and I were members of this committee. We did receive some evidence about the revenue trends from a wholesale sales tax. This was prepared by Mr Dixon and Ms Rimmer from the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University. There are some remarks, I believe accurate remarks, made by them in that first Senate report. It was a very good report. Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, you were also a member of that committee and we had our differences, but I think the material and the documentation in the report that was put together are an excellent example of the processes of the Senate. On page 199 their study refers to revenue in the absence of the GST. It says: 
ANTS (e.g. p. 8) implies that a major change in indirect taxation is necessary because, without increases in tax rates, the present array of indirect taxes will raise insufficient revenue in relation to Australia's future public sector requirements.
As I have said, that claim is a bit rich and somewhat hypocritical coming from the Liberal-National Party when they have been cutting public sector expenditure in areas like health and education. It goes on:
However, ANTS includes no explicit revenue forecasts.
I would say to the Senate that, if the Liberal-National Party is making out a case that the wholesale sales tax is crumbling, why were no revenue forecasts included in their document? The authors go on to say:
We find no evidence to support the ANTS proposition. As shown in Chart 10.1, in our basecase forecasts, indirect taxes collected by the whole of the public sector grow slightly faster than GDP. These forecasts were made with no changes in ad valorem tax rates.
The bulk of indirect taxes are collected on consumption and intermediate usage of goods and services. In our basecase forecasts, collection of consumption taxes is projected to grow at about the same rate as GDP. Among the main contributors to these taxes are some fast-growing consumption items ...
And I said earlier that it is a function of a services economy—
... (e.g. Electronic equipment, Scientific equipment, Cars, and Entertainment) ... Collection of taxes on intermediate inputs is projected to grow faster than GDP. The main contributors are intermediate sales of Petrol, Oil and gas, Commercial printing, Banking services, Insurance, Electronic equipment and Motor vehicles. Intermediate sales of all these commodities and associated tax collections are projected to grow faster than GDP over the next eight years.
Underlying our forecasts of tax collections are forecasts of GDP growth averaging 6 per cent a year ...
To go back to the government's propaganda document, the Tax Reform: not a new tax, a new tax system package that was released in the lead-up to the last election, how did the government get it so wrong? I would contend that they were deliberately misleading. They have really fudged the true picture in relation to indirect taxes. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in the quote from page 6 that I referred to earlier about excise and wholesale sales tax and in some of the other material that I provided to the Senate today. It is certainly true that indirect taxation in the area of imported goods and tariffs has been declining significantly, and that has been the result of a significant reduction in tariffs in this country over the last 20 years. That is one area of the indirect tax system that I would contend has been declining in revenue not because of the changing nature of the economy but as a direct result of a policy to reduce tariffs in this country.
To conclude my remarks, the wholesale sales tax system is an efficient way of collecting revenue. It is certainly a lot more efficient to have up to 200,000 businesses collecting a wholesale sales tax than well over two million collecting a GST. It is also very efficient in terms of the cost to government of collecting that revenue. The cost to the well over two million new tax collectors—mainly small business—of compliance with a GST will be significant. A variety of figures have been used in the debate, but we do know that it will be significant. It will be an additional burden to small business. The WST does not do that. The wholesale sales tax is not crumbling and is not in significant decline; it is still a substantial revenue earner for this country. My final point is that it is a progressive tax. It is a good thing to have a progressive, indirect tax that can be applied efficiently at higher rates for classes of goods that would certainly be classified as luxury goods. ",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,2000-04-05,"—On behalf of the opposition, I wish to move a second reading amendment in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2000. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate expresses its concern with the fundamental unfairness of the Government's approach to taxation reform generally, including:
(a) the fundamental unfairness of a goods and services tax (GST);
(b) the enormous compliance burden faced by small business from the GST; and
(c) the failure of the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) to ensure the competent administration of the taxation system, as evidenced by the number of taxation laws amendment bills presented to the Parliament.”
I think it is appropriate to make only a couple of quick remarks on this small change in relation to the bill. The amendment is very similar in nature to the second reading amendment with respect to the A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill (No. 1) 2000 which was moved earlier this week. In fact, the arguments for these amendments are largely the same—that is, that the system that the government is about to inflict on the people of Australia is basically an unfair system. My colleagues here have argued the merits of the existing system and, with those remarks, I will hand over to Senator Conroy.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-04-05,"—In my brief comments on this second reading amendment in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2000, I want to further emphasise the problems that are taking place with this government's GST. We have seen a cave-in from the government under pressure from business. A headline from the Age on 30 March reads `ATO bows to GST backlash'. The article says:
The Australian Taxation Office has bowed to pressure from the business community and will make sweeping changes to the centrepiece of the tax revolution, the business activity statement.
We are seeing, yet again, this government trying to find ways to reduce the impact of the GST. It knows that the GST is slowly, debilitatingly draining its electoral support. It knows that the Australian public has caught up to the government and knows that it was misled, and misled terribly, in the lead-up to the last election. Senator Kemp has frequently spoken in this chamber—as recently as this morning—and said that the Australian public passed its judgment on the GST. What the Australian public passed its judgment on was not what the government is now foisting upon it. The public cannot trust the promises that were made and the propaganda it was subjected to—propaganda that the government is again subjecting it to, with millions of Australian taxpayers' dollars being used to pay for this government's outrageous mishandling and misrepresentation of its GST package.
The business community are saying, `We don't want to pay the cost. We're the ones who demanded that the government introduce the GST. We're the ones who forced the government to introduce the GST,' and once again the government is rolling over to the pressures from business. As the Age reported, business will not have to answer the majority of the 20 questions on the GST calculation sheet included in the two-page form, and the tax office will also accept reasonable estimates for the remaining answers. The tax office issued a 147-page book to explain the form. That is 147 extra pages on top of—I think somebody has actually done the calculation—five million new words in the tax act. This is the new simple tax! This is the tax which this government claimed is going to make the tax act simpler.
At the end of the day, Senator Murray, you will also be held accountable. The Democrats cannot escape the fact that they have been a party to one of the worst travesties and to some of the worst misleading of the Australian public that we have been witness to in many years. You are the ones who are saying, `We have to have this advertising campaign.' At the end of the day, Senator Murray, you will be held accountable as well. 
 (Senator Ferguson)—Senator Conroy, address your remarks through the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Australian public will hold the Democrats responsible, just as it will hold the government responsible. The tax office has issued a 147-page book to explain the form. Under the new rules, though, a business will be required to disclose only its sales, exports and GST-free sales and purchases—the basic data to calculate its tax bill. One senior accountant described the questions previously as `a cavity search on every business'. That is what this government is subjecting the Australian business community and small business to—a cavity search on every business.
Mr Ian Langford-Brown, who has been an apologist for this act, appeared before the Senate committee—as I said yesterday—and Senator Murray, Senator Ferguson and a number of other senators in this chamber were present. They witnessed Mr Langford-Brown telling us how this was going to be the simplest of taxes. His own colleagues have described this simplest of taxes as `a cavity search on every business'. Once again, I reiterate that this tax is a dog's breakfast. We have not yet seen the conurbations. It has now been nine months since the government and the Democrats did their dirty deal about the GST and petrol prices and we have seen more red tape and more intrusiveness from this government with its fuel rebate debate. 
Welcome back, Senator Kemp. We have almost completed the debate. In your summing up, you might want to tell us where the conurbations are. Where have they gone? We even had the extraordinary claim last week in relation to the government's planned fuel rebate that we might have the South Australian conurbations system. We might have a transitory system, it is claimed by the Democrats. We may even have service stations getting coupons. We would like to know. The Australian public would like to know. Senator Kemp, it does not wash to say that we have to keep it secret right to the last minute just in case the oil companies work out how to rort it. How dumb do you think they are? If they can rort it in a month's time, they can rort it in two months time. Any system that you design along these lines is going to be nothing more than a fraud because anyone who has studied the economics of taxation knows that tax incidence means that in the end the tax will be passed on to the consumer. So any pathetic attempt by this government to hide who will actually end up paying this tax will not succeed. In South Australia, the oil companies are accused of pocketing the money. Of course, they deny it, but they would say that, wouldn't they? And how on earth are you going to present to the oil companies the voucher system, the conurbations or any other of these ludicrous propositions? How will you try to hide the onerous impact of this tax on ordinary Australians? How are you going to do it? Tell us today, Senator Kemp. You have the chance. You do not need to go the 10 steps to courage out there; you can do it right here at the microphone.
—I can see that you are stung.
—I am absolutely stung! What has really stung the Australian public is the con job that you have put on them and they want to know the answers to these questions. They are the people who have really been stung and they are the ones who are going to sting you at the next election.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-04-05,"—Senators will know that I was not in the chamber for much of the debate. I suspect my advisers will tell me that I have missed nothing and, if that is what they advise me, they will probably be right. I did manage to get the elements of the speeches and, following a briefing from my colleague Senator Campbell, it is a bit hard to believe that we have had yet another wide-ranging debate in the second reading stage, none of which seems to deal too much with what is before the chamber. We always welcome Senator Hogg back into the chamber, after his contributions. 
Let me make a number of observations. Again, I do not want to keep on knocking the quality of the speeches in the second reading debate. I was able to draw attention to that yesterday and I think my remarks yesterday befit the quality today. We will not be supporting the second reading amendment moved by Senator Quirke because it happens to be wrong in every respect. There is also a personal reason why I will not be supporting it: it makes a rather ungracious comment about me, which is a bit of a pity. After the debate yesterday, particularly the contribution by Senator Quirke, I thought there was a wider appreciation of the role I am playing in this chamber, but I can see that there has been a hit-back in the second reading amendment. For a variety of reasons, the government will certainly not be supporting the second reading amendment which has been moved.
Apart from anything else, it does draw attention—and I think Senator Murray would agree with this—to the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. We have got the `fundamental unfairness of a goods and services tax'. That is not the view of the shadow cabinet. The shadow cabinet has now signed on to a goods and services tax. I know that is not the image or the impression the Labor Party is seeking to create out there, but I do want Labor Party members of parliament to understand that every time they raise the issue of a goods and services tax I shall be raising with them their hypocrisy and their deceit. I will be seeking to explain to the public exactly what the Labor Party is doing. The Labor Party will now be going to the next election with a goods and services tax. It has mentioned that there will be a roll-back but it has never indicated just what the roll-back will be. It has refused to guarantee the very substantial tax cuts. 
Rather than reaping any bitter harvest from its tax reforms, the coalition is a reforming government and has carried out wide-ranging reforms in the national interest in this country. Tax reform is one of those very important reforms. The Labor Party has refused to accept this, except to recognise in its own platform, as it goes to the next election, that there will be a goods and services tax. I invite anyone in this chamber in the Labor Party to stand up and deny that that is the case. The answer is that they will not be able to do it.
This bill contains three measures. As I said, this has not been apparent from the debate so far, except in the contribution from Senator Murray. His contribution, as I said yesterday, is always interesting. It is not always that I agree with Senator Murray, but he brings a standing to this chamber with the dignity with which he approaches his duties. He never plays the man, Senator Sherry. You would be well advised to note the demeanour of Senator Murray, who never plays the man in this chamber. He just plays the issues, and that is certainly how it should be.
The bill contains three measures, all of which are good news for taxpayers. The sales tax measures ensure that the extra cost of making a car suitable for use by the disabled will not be subject to sales tax. The amendment will apply to dealings on or after 26 June 1998, that being the date the New South Wales government announced the release of 400 additional wheelchair accessible taxi licences. The amendment will therefore assist to ensure that the transportation needs of disabled participants at the Sydney Paralympic Games in 2000 are met.
The employee share scheme recognises that the market value of shares and unlisted rights to acquire shares under an employee share scheme, often in association with a secondary or subsequent public offer of shares, is more equitably reflected in the public offer price of the share. The final measure relates to the closely held trust provisions. These provisions require trustees to give details of the ultimate beneficiaries to whom the income is distributed where the distributions are made through a chain of trusts. The bill will maintain the integrity and nature of these provisions whilst easing the compliance burden on trustees. I commend the bill to the house.
Amendment not agreed to.
Original question resolved in the affirmative.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-04-05,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.3) 2000 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2000, and to specifically look at the area of defence and what has happened recently. On page 14 of the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements 1999-2000 for the defence portfolio, there is a statement:
In order to accommodate the increased price of outputs it has been necessary to defer capital expenditure. The more significant of these deferrals have occurred in the major capital equipment program which has meant alterations to `White Book' programming.
The financial impact of the major capital equipment deferrals was set out in a table that appeared below. The significance of this was that an amount of some $380 million was changed out of the budget from the traditional white book or capital budget expenditure of the Department of Defence and transferred to recurrent expenditure. I am reliably informed by those who have been around this place for a lot longer than I have that this is the first time in living memory that this has taken place. This is a very significant change within the defence portfolio because one of the key things for the operation of a successful defence force is the maintenance and the purchase of new equipment for our defence forces. So we had $380 million being transferred out to meet recurrent expenses.
This should not happen, but it has happened under this government. It should not have happened because there is absolutely no reason to cut back the essential programs that were outlined and that were listed in the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements. It has affected things such as the FFG upgrade implementation, the light tactical aircraft capability, the P3C update implementation, the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile, the high frequency network modernisation, the new submarine and the FA18 Hornet upgrade.
—For Senator Abetz's information, this $380 million was taken out of capital expenditure to meet recurrent expenditure. If one looks at the evidence that was given at the last estimates, Dr Ian Williams, who at that stage was the First Assistant Secretary, Resources and Financial Programs, said in the Hansard, on page 68:
Within the defence budget, there is also a fairly significant shift in which we have taken largely from the capital budget and put into the operating area. I can run you through, in broad terms, the figures there. Essentially, you will see a shift in the capital budget in cash terms of about $750 million. There is a reduction in the size of the capital budget.  
On the same page, Dr Ian Williams said, `There has been a real reduction in the expenditure planned for this year on major equipment, and that is about $380 million, so that is a real effect.' What Dr Williams put to the defence estimates committee was that there was a real and substantial reduction in the capital expenditure at a time when it could be least afforded by Defence—at a time when there was a need not to cut into the capital budget but surely to boost the capital budget. This is a time when there is a need to ensure that those projects that are in the pipeline are being pursued as fast as can reasonably be expected. Of course, the $380 million was taken from this vital area.
Dr Williams pointed out that the increase that he was referring to in additional money was essentially taken from the investment area and put into employees expenses. He drew to the attention of the committee that the money that was coming out of capital expenditure was in effect being placed into employee expenses. When that was pursued, and it was done so at some length, it was found that the employee expenses were mainly wages. So what we had was a real reduction in the expenditure on capital equipment being placed into the wages - to pay the wages of those people in the defence forces.
To clarify this, and it appears on page 72 of the Hansard of 9 February, I asked Dr Williams:
Are you able to identify where the major pressures are occurring currently in the defence budget? Are they in wages, capital equipment?
Dr Williams replied:
What you would see from here is a reflection that the increase in employee expenses and cash flow indicates that that is an area where there is pressure for increases. That can be seen largely in the fact that the personnel pay rises, for example, are not fully supplemented. We have supplementation around about the CPI—not quite—and any additional amount has to be borne by the defence budget. That is what you are seeing with the pressure there. Obviously, in removing some funds from the investment program to provide an offset, that has provided a short-term pressure on the investment program in the current year.
I respect Dr Williams' answer, I would submit that it puts pressure on the outyears as well. But, as Dr Williams clearly explained, the money was taken out of the capital budget to pay for the conditions of employment of people within the Australian defence forces.
One would hope that the conditions of employment within the Australian defence forces would remain competitive with those out there in the private and public sectors. One of the difficulties that are facing our defence forces is the fact that they are worried about the retention of military personnel in the various arms of the Defence Force. When one reads a recently released report from the Australian National Audit Office on the retention of military personnel—report No. 35—one sees that one of the important issues related to retention is the rate of remuneration received by those people in the defence forces. It does not augur well for the future if, as Dr Williams indicated clearly at the additional estimates, the government will only supplement the increases in wages to Defence personnel by around about the CPI and, if there are increases that are in excess of the CPI, we are then going to see an ongoing pressure on the Defence budget into the future. So one would expect that we may well see in the future further difficulties arising with the transfer of money from the capital budget area into other recurrent expenses such as wages and those expenses that may occur from time to time.
One thing that Dr Williams did indicate to us at the estimates was that the pressure on the investment program would have been much worse had it not been for the reasonable cost savings that had been realised under the Defence Reform Program. On page 72 of the Hansard of 9 February, Dr Williams, in response to a question from me on the role that the Defence Reform Program played with respect to the savings and the impact on the investment program for the capital budget, indicated:
Had the DRP not been introduced, then the current investment program would have been lower by that amount than what we now have.
That is a cause for real concern because it indicates that had there not been the recurrent savings that had been realised out of the DRP—the Defence Reform Program—there would have been an even greater cut in the capital budget expenditure of our defence forces. This must loom as something of real concern because this picture had not been presented in either the estimates or the supplementary estimates that occurred prior to the release of the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statement. One then asks oneself: what are the difficulties that are confronting Defence? I will come to that in a few moments. But what is really going on in Defence and who knows what is happening are very important questions to ask. What is happening with the funds of the Department of Defence? An article in the Australian of 30 March under the headline `Army searches for ghosts in the ranks' says: 
A Melbourne-based Army Reserve regiment has been accused of containing 100 troops who had withdrawn from service but were being kept on the books to maintain funding.
If it is happening there, what other things are happening in Defence that we do not know about? What else is happening if that is but the tip of the iceberg? 
I will now turn to an earlier Australian National Audit Office report which looked at the Army individual readiness notice. In that report, the ANAO said that, after a three-year program to look at the Army individual readiness notice, the Army were unable to identify the cost of the program on an annual basis and that the costing of the program was difficult to put on paper. So one asks oneself the question: just what else is unknown within the Department of Defence? The $380 million that was transferred out of the capital budget area—the white book—not only could have been retained but should have been retained to complete projects which were already well in advance or in the pipeline, and the defence forces could have looked elsewhere to make savings to meet the recurrent expenditure that they have to meet. 
One must put this in its complete perspective, because if one does not keep advancing those items in the white book and they keep slipping back further and further, the capital budget expenditure slips as well. As that slips, one finds that we are heading into a period when the defence forces are going to suffer block obsolescence of major items, such as ships, planes and so on. When we reach the crunch period for block obsolescence in the defence forces, which will be in about 2007, there will be a need for Defence to spend somewhere between $80 billion and $106 billion to overcome the block obsolescence that is facing our defence forces. Of course, if this has been made worse by the deferral, and the ongoing deferral—and one would hope that that does not happen—of items in the white book, then we are going to have a real problem indeed within our defence forces. 
There has been an amount of pain within the defence forces over a period of time with the implementation of the Defence Reform Program. That was designed to shift the resources from the blunt end, people sitting at desks, to the sharp end, the IT and equipment end. Of course that has not materialised to the extent that it was promised.
—Your words.
—No, they are not my words, Senator McGauran. They are the words of those I have spoken to in the defence forces—the people on the ground. They have not seen the manifestation of the so-called savings that came out of the Defence Reform Program, and that has caused a distinct morale problem within the defence forces. It has also caused retention problems, and it has not achieved the aims and the ends that it was meant to achieve. 
We have had this dark picture painted for us of the transfer out of the very important equipment area—the white book—in Defence to recurrent expenditure, and if we accept that there may have been some problems at that time in the defence budget, my friend Senator Schacht, who always enjoys Defence estimates—
—Twelve years of them.
—Yes. He would, nonetheless, like myself, be surprised to find, no more than a week after the additional estimates of 9 February—on 17 February—that there was an address by Alan Hawke, the Secretary to the Department of Defence, to the Defence Watch Seminar, titled `What's the matter? A due diligence report'. It is interesting to look at some of the things that Alan Hawke had to say in that address. He said: 
The current state of Defence's financial situation against the Forward Estimates might best be described as parlous.
This is something that is of grave concern, and I see Senator McGauran nodding and agreeing. It is of grave concern that, for the first time, we saw $380 million taken out of the white book and transferred into recurrent expenditure. One week after we had various people from the Defence department before estimates trying to paint a not so bad picture of their position, we had Dr Alan Hawke confirming for us that Defence's position was parlous indeed.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2000-04-05,"—As the Senate would be aware, the island of Taiwan completed its historic presidential election on 18 March. It is historic in the sense that, for the first time in some 50 years, the Nationalist party lost power or government over the island's 21 million people. The history of the Nationalist party is well documented. It had ruled mainland China since approximately the 1920s, interrupted during the Second World War by the invasion of the Japanese. It subsequently fled to the island of Formosa, now Taiwan, in 1949, following the communist takeover of the mainland. 
The island, though prospering materially over the years of Nationalist rule, lived under strict militarist rule. Perhaps it can be said that, during the early development of the island, and in the midst of the Cold War, the people accepted a lack of democratic rule and restrictions to their personal freedoms as a trade-off for their security. However, once the Cold War ended, the move to democracy became inevitable, as it has for many nations post the Berlin Wall collapse. 
Responding to domestic and international pressure, the Nationalist party, or the KMT Party, introduced direct elections for president. In 1996 the first elections were held, which the Nationalist party won—an obvious statement that the people were not yet willing to break from their long-time protectors. However, with a better organised opposition, the people of Taiwan broke with the past and elected Mr Chen from the Democratic Progressive Party. Taiwan had finally established its democratic credentials, a peaceful transfer from one ruling party to another—from all that represented history to history anew.
Equally significant was the message the people sent via the ballot box to mainland communist China. The DPP candidate, Mr Chen, was not the favourite candidate of the communist government, principally for his and the DPP's past statements on an independent Taiwan. Though the DPP did not carry this policy into the election, supporting a One China policy, but with conditions, it was their past record that was enough to disturb the communists in Beijing—enough to threaten the island in none-too-cloaked terms with military action.
Post election, the message to mainland communist China from the people of Taiwan is clear: the people are now in charge of Taiwan, Taiwan is a democracy and public opinion greatly shapes what the government can and cannot do. Above all, the people's presidential choice shows that they cannot be intimidated by threats from the communists, and the people of Taiwan have clearly made the point through the ballot box that they do not want integration, Hong Kong style, with communist mainland China. No longer can world diplomatic judgments be made on simply the jousting of old foes, the communists and the Nationalists. A new force is on the diplomatic scene, and it is 21 million Taiwanese armed with the shield of democracy. Taiwan's greatest defence against mainland China may have once been its military strength or, more likely, its strategic alliances. Today its greatest defence is democracy. The ballot box is more forceful than the barrel of a gun—look at East Timor. Under serious threat its democratisation will rally the free world, should the Beijing threat intensify or materialise.
Equally, the serious objection of Beijing's Ambassador to Australia to the visit to Australia early last month of Taiwan's Vice-Foreign Minister and his subsequent dinner with several federal parliamentarians is ill-founded in the sense of how the democratic processes work in this parliament. I do not doubt that many parliamentarians would attend a dinner for an equivalent dignitary from mainland China, and they are also entitled to do so for a Taiwanese dignitary, particularly given that Taiwan has one of the largest friendship groups in this parliament and moreover we embrace their move to full democracy. It is a matter of understanding democracy, Mr Ambassador. ",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-04-05,"—I rise to make a few comments on various items listed under these bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1999-2000 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1999-2000, as there is a number of elements within these bills which refer to the Northern Territory. These two bills will see the total additional appropriation of $2,541 million and they have been subject to the most recent round of the Senate estimates committee hearings. 
First of all, I refer in particular to the Defence item under Appropriation Bill (No. 3). One of the major additional appropriations in this bill is the allocation of $40 million to the Department of Defence to cover the government's decision to increase the readiness of a second brigade to 28 days notice to move, which is a change in the pace of the draw-down to 50,000 full-time ADF personnel. This announcement was made on 11 March last year and refers to the 1st Brigade, which is a mechanised unit based at Robertson Barracks, some 10 to 15 kilometres outside the city of Darwin. The ALP supported this move at the time in preparation for the possible East Timor peacekeeping operation. The 1st Brigade was originally moved from the outskirts of Sydney to Robertson Barracks in 1996 as part of our initiative to move the Army north. The presence in Darwin and Katherine of the defence forces has now become a major and welcome part of the landscape in the Northern Territory and in particular in Darwin, not only because of their contribution to the community but because of the economic benefits to businesses. The defence forces have worked tirelessly to involve the community and operate on the basis of being an integral part of our community. 
In his press release of last year, the Minister for Defence outlined the amounts of money that had been allocated in achieving efficiency gains. I refer the Senate to that press release, which was headed `Defence Reform Program delivers increased defence preparedness'. In it Minister John Moore says:
The Government's decision is a prudent and necessary measure which gives Australia maximum flexibility to respond to contingencies at short notice. The Defence Reform Program is ensuring that resources allocated to Defence are well managed and keenly focused on the delivery of Defence capability.
But, as my colleague Senator Hogg has just pointed out in this debate on these bills, it is disturbing to find that, by the end of the financial year last year, it was reported that Australia's military chiefs were forced to withdraw funding bids that would have blown out the Defence budget by a ridiculous $900 million. It is no secret that the peak military body, the Defence Executive Committee, had to meet to deal with this budget blow-out, and such reports are extremely concerning. It would seem that Australia's future defence capability is being compromised through bad budget management. Cutting Defence's major capital equipment budget directly undermines our country's future military capability. It is irresponsible to use the capital budget simply as a contingency fund. The minister uses rhetoric about enhancing military capability and the Defence Reform Program delivering huge funds for the sharp end of defence. This has been completely exposed, of course, in the 1999-2000 Defence portfolio additional estimates document. In delivering his speech on this bill, Senator Hogg more than adequately outlined the relationship between a defence readiness policy and a possible overexpenditure in the budget and what that means for our defence forces. 
This bill also provides for an appropriation of $40.48 million to the Australian Federal Police, mainly for its participation in the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor. In September last year, the Northern Territory played a major role during the East Timor crisis and showed a spirit of generosity and humanity that I am proud to say was second to none. The whole Territory community pitched in to help establish a safe haven in Darwin for almost 2,000 East Timorese evacuees who were fleeing the violent turn of events in their country following the independence referendum. It was a concerted effort by government, business, the defence forces, the Northern Territory police and the Australian Federal Police based in Darwin, the churches, community organisations and the local East Timorese. All Territorians united, volunteering their time and working tirelessly to make the East Timorese evacuees as comfortable and as welcome as possible. I welcome the opportunity in this appropriation bill to acknowledge that effort and to pay tribute not only to the Australian Federal Police but to all Territorians who were involved in that effort. 
Finally, let me go to the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1999-2000, which seeks money from the consolidated revenue fund for purposes other than the ordinary annual services of government—purposes such as payments to states and spending on new programs. One of the main elements of this bill is the allocation of $25 million to the Department of Transport and Regional Services to increase the Commonwealth's contribution to the construction of the proposed Alice Springs to Darwin rail link. This project has been a long time coming—since 1886, in fact, when work commenced on the Darwin to Pine Creek railway and the Northern Territory was still under South Australian control. Mind you, some people may still wish that were the case. Since then, the railway project has been on and off the agenda both federally and at a state and territory level. In fact, whether or not we are going to get a railway has virtually become a standard joke in the Territory because many Territorians do not believe that it is going to happen in their lifetimes. The NT is probably the only jurisdiction in this country that has a minister for railways when it does not have a railway.
Having said that, the railway project has bipartisan support in the Territory parliament, as it will benefit the Territory. It is a major infrastructure program estimated to cost $1.2 billion, and it has the potential to create jobs, skills development for Territorians and prosperity for businesses. Construction is expected to commence in May 2000. That is right—we are less than six weeks away, so we are led to believe, from the first turn of the soil. It is expected to be completed by mid-2003, and it is going to be 1,410 kilometres long. But, unfortunately, the funding for the project falls heavily on the shoulders of the Northern Territory on a per capita basis. If you take a look at the per capita breakdown of funds that the Northern Territory, South Australia and the Commonwealth will contribute, you will see that the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister stand to be criticised. Territorians will be paying a very high price for this railway. If the Chief Minister were serious in his attempt to stand up for Territorians and in his continual harping to that effect, then he would have done something about this inequality. That is what he should have done, but he has failed to put an adequate case to the Prime Minister and to protect the positions of Territorians.
When you break down the figures of the funding that is allocated for the railway, the Northern Territory is paying a very heavy per capita cost. The contribution from the Northern Territory in rail funding is $862 per head. In South Australia the contribution is $101 per head, and the national contribution is $9 per head. There is a vast difference between the national funding of $9 per capita and the South Australian government commitment per capita of $101, but in the Northern Territory we are expected to commit $862 on a per capita basis. We know the former railway minister said that we needed $300 million from the federal government, and Kim Beazley for the Labor Party promised up to $300 million. We have been conned and misled, and the Chief Minister has done little to convince his Liberal mate that we need far in excess of $100 million. The leader of the NT opposition, Clare Martin, is right when she says that, at a time when money is being allocated to the Federation Fund and to funds to celebrate the millennium, the Chief Minister could not even persuade the Prime Minister that this was a millennium project, that this was a project for the future of Australia and that it deserved a major commitment and investment by the federal government. 
Late last year, Senator Tambling said in this chamber: 
It is anticipated that, at the peak of the construction phase, there will be 7,000 new jobs generated in construction, associated areas and spin-off industries.
However, this remains to be seen, as I believe the Territory government has lost focus on the potential jobs growth for Territorians from this project. We are now told that only 960 jobs, of an anticipated 7,000, will go to Territorians. The rest will go to people who will come from interstate. This is of concern to Territorians, because claims of economic growth by the Territory government have not translated into jobs growth. Whilst the national trend for unemployment has been falling steadily since early 1997, unemployment in the Northern Territory has been increasing almost notably since September last year. Then, the number of jobs in the labour market was 98,400; in January this year, the figure was 87,300—a stunning reversal over four months of 11,100 jobs in the labour market. In September last year, the total labour force was estimated at 102,500, with a participation rate of 73.5 per cent—that is the number of people, in percentage terms, either working or seeking work. That combination left us with an unemployment rate of just four per cent. By January 2000, we had just 87,300 people employed of a work force estimated at 92,500. If we compare the data between September 1999 and January 2000, we see a shrinkage of 10,000 and, alarmingly, a participation rate of just 66.2 per cent. This is a collapse of 7.5 per cent in the participation rate and is an estimated 5.3 per cent rate of unemployment.
Territorians need jobs, and the message we get from the Northern Territory government is that the railway will bring jobs. But the Northern Territory government will not say what those jobs will be, nor will they say what skills or training are needed for Territorians to be able to compete for these jobs. There is no comprehensive plan by the Northern Territory government as to how this grand plan will translate into detail and benefit Territorians. There has not been a skills audit done. There is no proposal as to how these needed jobs will come to Territorians or how people in remote communities can access these opportunities. What practical skills are needed in order to get a job in some aspect of this railway project? This is an important and very significant opportunity for Territorians to be able to build jobs for Territorians. Two major projects are coming offline in the middle of this year around this country—that is, a motorway on the Gold Coast and, of course, the Sydney Olympics project. There will be skills available when those projects are finished, but if we do not have training and opportunities in place for Territorians, the skills that are needed for the jobs to build the railway will have to be imported and will leave the Territory after the railway is built.
Only last week, it was announced that the Northern Territory University signed a memorandum of understanding with a South Australia based company to provide training for the railway project. This will provide training to develop skills in laying rail and maintaining the rail. This project is due to start construction in May, but only now are training opportunities being signed off. Employment and training issues should have been sorted out by now. The railway has been a prime focus of the Territory government, especially in the last few years, but their silence has been deafening on the issue of jobs for Territorians. They have squandered the employment and training opportunities offered by this $1.2 billion project. The call by Labor for a jobs strategy has been ignored. There is no basis for the figure of 7,000 as the number of jobs that will be generated by this project, and it will be most unfortunate if only 960 of these jobs go to Territorians. With proper planning and strategy, the government could have ensured that many more Territorians were job ready and ready to participate in training opportunities offered by the project.
In closing, I want to comment on the recent development regarding the possible employment conditions of people working on the railway. We are aware that the Territory Construction Association, with the encouragement, of course, and assistance, no doubt, of the Office of the Employment Advocate, has taken a roadshow around the Territory promoting the use of Australian workplace agreements. This is neither with the involvement of the unions concerned nor in consultation with the Northern Territory Trades and Labour Council. We have very serious concerns about the role of AWAs in maintaining adequate standards in relation to wages and conditions. We have extreme concerns about the promotion of AWAs for prospective employees in the railway project. The secrecy associated with AWAs means that it is difficult to ascertain whether or not they lead to employees being worse off, although I suspect that there is evidence to show that in fact they are. For example, it is a fact that 43.2 per cent of all AWAs in Victoria demonstrated a link between individual agreements and a system of award regulation that is difficult to maintain. Similarly, the fact that almost 30 per cent of AWAs in the 1997-98 period were with new employees also demonstrates that AWAs are being used for the most vulnerable employees. We know there is a strong possibility that, with the promotion of AWAs, there is no role for the union movement in regulating wages and conditions of those employees. That is the area which is of utmost concern to the trade union movement in the Northern Territory. 
We notice that Mr Houlihan has been in town of late and, with the push by the Territory Construction Association and the Office of the Employment Advocate to promote AWAs, one cannot help but be suspicious about the connection between the three. I am aware that there have been contracts signed with consortiums in other major projects around this country which make the use of AWAs a condition under that contract. I call upon the Northern Territory government to guarantee to the trade union movement in the Northern Territory, and to the potential employees of the consortium or subcontractors associated with the railway project, that they will consult, inform and involve the trade union movement and the unions concerned on the employment opportunities and the prospects for all workers. The Darwin to Alice Springs project will be of national significance in the next four years. Let us hope, with this unfortunate push towards AWAs and the current lack of consultation with the trade union movement in the Northern Territory, that it does not become the third most nationally significant industrial dispute that we have to entertain.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-04-05,"—Today I would like to congratulate the government. This is unusual for me. Occasionally in politics, the actions of foolish, naive and incompetent ministers can lead in time to the correction of their mistakes and possibly, hopefully, lead to an improvement in public policy. I am here to congratulate the government for its movement towards the establishment of a new form of quality assurance agency within universities. There is a long way to go, and maybe more needs to be said about the particular details of the quality assurance agency that MCEETYA considered at its meeting last Friday, but I do think the history of this matter ought to be examined in the proper context. The appropriation legislation is one means by which these things can be done.
Specifically, what I am referring to today is the foolish action of the minister for territories, Senator Ian Macdonald, in accepting the assurances of some dubious persons with regard to the establishment of Greenwich University on Norfolk Island. In 1998 it was Senator Macdonald who accepted the claim that the establishment of Greenwich University on Norfolk Island was for the purpose of education on the island itself. This is despite the fact that the prospectus of the Greenwich University referred to their claim that they were, in practice, a global university. This is despite the fact that Greenwich University had a long history of abusing its reputation with regard to its actions in a number of states in the United States. In fact, the New Zealand government, from recollection, had rejected its overtures to seek to establish itself as a cuckoo in the nest in New Zealand. The Victorian government had said, `No, we are not going to have a bodgie outfit like this.' But this was not enough for this minister, the minister for territories, Senator Ian Macdonald, well-known expert on educational issues as he is. He says, `Of course they can establish it. There is no difficulty in that whatsoever. Hang the consequences as far as our international reputation is concerned.'
—He did not say that; it was subject to approval, Senator Carr. 
—It was subject to approval? What occurred was that the minister got advice, presumably from somebody: it is not quite clear from whom, but it would appear that it was a great educationalist like Senator Macdonald. He understood that the establishment of a global university of such dubious reputation on Norfolk Island was not going to have any consequences for the rest of our educational institutions. What a naive fool he is to accept such a proposition.
 (Senator Ferguson)—Order! Senator Carr, you will withdraw that, thank you.
—I withdraw it. What I do say, though, is that one has to question the competence of this minister with regard to his administration of his responsibilities in respect of the issues that he embarked upon regarding the establishment of the Norfolk Island university. 
What has come to be understood is that our international reputation for excellence in education is of critical importance to the success of the industry in this country as a whole. Increasingly, higher education operates within an international environment. This is a government that says to workers in this country, `Think of yourselves in terms of the international market. Accept second best, accept reductions in wages and conditions, and accept reductions in your standards of living because you have to operate as part of the great global economy. Don't worry too much about what the consequences are for your living standards or your family's.' But when it comes to international education, he says, `Any group of hillbillies can move in. We don't particularly mind so long as we get an assurance from those people that they will operate only on the island of Norfolk.' What an extraordinary proposition. That was the case that was put to us by the minister for territories at the Senate estimates. I am going to go into some detail on the question of his behaviour at the Senate estimates later on in this debate.
What is established now is that the reputation of Australian educational institutions internationally is critical to the maintenance of the value of Australian qualifications in terms of the people who will pass through those institutions, to the marketing of Australia internationally as a source of quality education, to it having the capacity to operate on the basis of attracting fee paying students and, in terms of it being what is now our fourth largest export industry, to the maintenance of its place within the international community. We are up against pretty stiff competition in the world. What has become increasingly apparent is that, throughout the world, other governments are prepared to actually get behind their educational industries to make sure that there is a proper quality assurance mechanism and to make sure that the people who engage in education in countries that we have to directly compete with on the global market are producing a quality product. But that is not the case in this country under the sort of incompetence we have seen from Senator Macdonald, who interposes himself—
—Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Senator Carr is misleading the Senate. He knows that that approval is not in the portfolio responsibilities of Senator Macdonald.
 (Senator Ferguson)—There is no point of order, Minister.
—The minister is very sensitive about this issue because he knows that Senator Macdonald gave the direction to the Administrator at Norfolk and sought his direction to do so. He did that in December 1998.
What we do have in this process is a clear example of where one minister, who is unable to fulfil his responsibilities to the rest of the government, let alone to the rest of the country, engages in this matter in such a way as to see this university established at Norfolk, which then directly threatens the reputation of the rest of the university system in this country. We are now seeing the direct result in a whole series. This was the great bridgehead that was established in terms of undermining our reputation. There were, of course, others that followed. Senator Macdonald was the unfortunate minister who did not seek effective advice and did not seek to establish the bona fides of this crowd out at Norfolk. 
—He does not have to register universities; he is the minister for territories.
—The minister for territories, as you well know, Senator, said that under the Norfolk Island Act, which is an act of the Australian parliament, a bill was established with regard to the Greenwich University and was presented to the responsible minister, Senator Macdonald, who then gave formal approval to the bill which duly established the university on Norfolk. That approval was given before the approval of the AQF. His actions led to the establishment of that university and let that university be able to claim throughout the world that it was a properly established university. 
What we have had since that time is other universities being run up the flagpole such as the University of Asia. The Department of the Treasury was quite happy to allow that so-called university to seek registration. We have seen other examples of service agreements being established by various universities to operate with a range of bodgie colleges in the private college market to the point where we are now seeing our international reputation further undermined. We are seeing examples of unethical behaviour and serious breaches with regard to the administration of our visa regime in this country. This is the behaviour of a government that is, frankly, not able to cope with the changed circumstances.
I come back to my main point, which is that the incompetence of Senator Macdonald in giving a direction to the Administrator of Norfolk Island to sign off on that piece of legislation, establishing the university on Norfolk Island, in the longer term has actually done us a favour. His incompetence, his naivety and his gullibility have led to the establishment—after serious complaints in this chamber, I might say, and by a number of the states—through the MCEETYA processes, of a new accreditation framework. Despite the fact that Minister Kemp has sought to pre-empt the process, we now see that some action has been taken by MCEETYA to seek to clean up the actions of this incompetent minister. These measures were demonstrably necessary as a result of the activities of a number of universities. I have drawn them to the attention of the Senate in the past. One university was operating out of a grog shop in Adelaide—claiming to be a university but operating out of a grog shop in Adelaide.
—What was the name of the accredited university?
—St Clements University was seeking to claim to the rest of the country that it was a university, and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission was used in this way to seek to give it registration under the Trade Practices Act. As I understand it, this action taken through—
—You can't register a university under the Australian Trade Practices Act.
—That is exactly the point. You can claim, up to this point, to be a university under the Australian Trade Practices Act, and that is exactly what was happening and why it was necessary, under the Treasury rulings, to ensure that the actions of any private company seeking to claim to the world that they were a private university have to be regulated. We have the example of The Australasian Institute, TAI, which is claiming on its web site to have formal links to Australian universities such as the University of Ballarat. Action was taken in that case to force TAI to desist from its action. We have the example of the Business Institute of Victoria, which was registered in that state. It eventually went into liquidation, but it did enormous damage to our reputation in the process of its activities. It was registered to offer courses in training, cleaning and security but was offering university courses in MBAs. What action was taken by this government on that matter? Up to this point, it would appear, very little. All we hear is that the mirror has been taken out and the government is taking a good look into it. There are numerous examples of changes occurring in the international education industry, and this government has failed to respond to those unless it is pressured to do so by bad publicity. We need to maintain the quality of Australian qualifications for our graduates, and we need to develop within the international market a clear reputation for quality on all occasions. We do not have that at the moment. That is why the action is so desperately needed. 
What strikes me about these circumstances, however, is that Greenwich has yet to be resolved in a complete sense. I understand there is a committee examining whether or not that university will meet the requirements of the AQF. It is important—since Senator Ellison has been so concerned about the issues that I have pursued—to go through some of the history of this matter. The mistakes of the government and the misjudgment, mistiming and misapprehension of this minister have clearly demonstrated just how pathetic a bungler he is. We note the way in which he was clearly misled about the nature of that university and failed to take the necessary action to ensure that this government's reputation internationally, and for that matter this country's reputation, was protected. We saw how the actions of Senator Macdonald, in his imprudent approval of that university and his direction to the Administrator of Norfolk Island, indeed placed in question our reputation internationally.
In 1972 the International Institute of Advanced Studies was founded in Missouri. It changed its name in 1989 to Greenwich University. In 1990 Greenwich University established its administrative offices in Hawaii. It then sought to infiltrate New Zealand and establish a presence in that country and was rebuffed. In 1993 Greenwich University approached the Victorian government to establish itself in that state. It was rebuffed there. It then moved on to Norfolk Island and the sorry saga of this minister began. In 1998 Greenwich University was established under Norfolk Island company law. In December 1998, Greenwich University regulations were made subject to Norfolk Island law, and on 9 December 1998 the Greenwich University Act was passed by the Norfolk Island Assembly establishing Greenwich University under Australian law. It sought the approval of the minister, Senator Ian Macdonald. Senator Macdonald gave that approval to the bill, which duly established the university as, at that time, a new entry on the Australian education scene.
—It had to be subject to AQF—
—That was not the case at the time. I want to be clear about that, Senator Ellison. Are you then claiming that it does not exist under Australian law? You would be terribly mistaken if you were. Just recently, the Acting Chief Minister of Norfolk Island requested MCEETYA to place Greenwich University on the higher education institution self-accrediting list. On 21 January 1999 Senator Macdonald did that and recognised Greenwich University courses under the Australian Qualifications Framework. That was well after the horse had bolted and well after this government had approved the establishment under law of this university. We are told that, when the committee report comes down on the question of the bona fides of the university, the Norfolk Island Assembly will re-evaluate its legislative standing. I look forward with interest to see whether or not that occurs. We find a quite serious legal issue arising here: the extent to which the incompetence of this minister has jeopardised the reputation of our international universities and the framework of this new Australian quality assurance measure.
I will come back to the point of this, given that this matter is about to close for matters of public interest to be brought on, which is that the incompetence and the foolish gullibility of this minister may well in the longer term produce some positive outcome—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I wish the word `foolish' to be withdrawn. It is totally inappropriate.
 (Senator Ferguson)— Minister, I do not think that it is unparliamentary language, and I think I will allow it to stand.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2000-04-05,"—Today I would like to say a little more about the impact of high medical defence organisation premium levels on procedural medical practice and to suggest a solution to this problem, namely, the use of structured settlements in awards. Under structured settlements, rather than receiving a lump sum award, plaintiffs or awardees, as they might be called, would receive a guaranteed stream of income for life by way of an annuity. I believe, for reasons that I shall later outline, that this measure would have a significant impact in reducing the cost push pressure on medical defence organisation insurance premiums associated with the future care component of damages awards.
When I last spoke about this matter I pointed out that there were three main reasons for the increase in medical defence insurance premiums. These were: large damages awards for future care of plaintiffs in medical negligence cases; the decline in cross-subsidisation of medical defence organisation premiums; and a long-term underfunding of liabilities by medical defence organisations. It is difficult to estimate the effect that the increases in premiums has had, with the evidence to a large extent being anecdotal. But there are undoubtedly fewer GPs doing surgery, anaesthetics or particularly obstetrics as a result of high medical defence organisation premiums. In specialist medicine, particularly in obstetrics, the number of doctors practising in high risk areas has diminished. More specifically, a 1997 study conducted by the University of Adelaide found that 26.3 per cent of South Australian rural GPs who practised obstetrics in 1994 had since abandoned their practices. Of these, almost 57 per cent cited rising indemnity insurance as the reason, 34 per cent cited poor remuneration, and 29.5 per cent said they feared litigation. In 1993, there were six GPs practising obstetrics in Newcastle, New South Wales. However, as the Australian Doctor reports, by 1999 this figure had declined to just three, and by June of the same year the three remaining GP obstetricians formally ended their work in this field.
The problem is compounded in rural areas throughout the country as the number of deliveries is relatively limited when compared with urban areas, where there is a higher population. The average rural GP in obstetrics does 36 confinements a year. Clearly, the lower the number of confinements the less financially viable obstetrics practice becomes because no distinction is made between the number of confinements annually and the medical indemnity insurance premiums paid by obstetricians either in the city or the country. The same subscription fee is paid also regardless of the number of babies the doctor delivers, whether it is 10 or 200 per year. The difficulty in attracting specialist and GP obstetricians to regional areas is only further compounded when there is little or no financial incentive for them to enter, practise and remain in such areas.
Dr David Mildenhall, President of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, has acknowledged this source of concern. He has said:
We are aware that decreasing numbers of obstetrics-trained doctors are going to rural areas.
This view is confirmed by the National Association of Specialist Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which believes:
The end result will be significant reduction or absence of private specialist obstetric practice in some areas.
This is particularly referring to rural areas of Australia. Similar considerations apply to both surgery and anaesthetics performed by specialists and GPs in rural areas.
In answer to this problem, governments across the country have recognised the implications for doctors and have taken various measures to alleviate the very high insurance premiums that procedural doctors are having to pay. In New South Wales, specialist obstetrician gynaecologists have successfully lobbied the New South Wales government to get liability for negligence actions relating to public patient births to be covered by the New South Wales government's professional indemnity arrangements rather than through private medical defence organisation coverage. The New South Wales Rural Doctors Association has also negotiated with the department of health to implement a grants system for obstetrics and anaesthetics in rural areas, and similar arrangements are now in place in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. In Western Australia, an arrangement has been made between the WA health department and the Western Australian Centre for Rural and Remote Medicine whereby rural proceduralist medical practitioners have their insurance premiums subsidised by WACRRM, which is given a grant for this purpose by the Western Australian government. 
But the subsidising of premiums is only a stopgap measure and does not address the key causes of the burgeoning levels of medical defence organisation subscription fees. The most important cause of rising medical defence organisation premiums is of course the significant increase in the future care component of quantum damages. A so far untapped possibility in dealing with this problem is the use of structured settlements as a means of bringing the ever growing cost of the future care component of damages under control. The introduction of structured settlements is a measure supported by all stakeholders, including the Australian Medical Association, the medical defence organisations themselves, claimants and lawyers who work in this field. 
There are various models which could be adopted for structured settlements in these medical cases. One possibility outlined by the Structural Settlement Group is for plaintiffs to receive one-third of their damages in the form of a lump sum, with the remainder being used to purchase an annuity from a life insurance company, thereby guaranteeing the plaintiff a flow of income for life by way of periodic payments which would be indexed to inflation. 
One of the difficulties with the present lump sum situation is that damages are awarded on the basis of an assumed life expectancy and on an estimation of future care needs. This means that often damages awards will be either too excessive or insufficient, neither of which is desirable. Some awardees spend their lump sum awards irresponsibly and others, no matter how frugal, will simply find that the award was not enough to meet their needs for the rest of their lives. Structured settlements, by contrast, are about shifting the risk from plaintiffs to established life insurers who are in a better position to bear this burden. Structured settlements also have the advantage of reducing the burden on the social security system, as presently those who have been injured and are unable to work, and who have exhausted their damages, have no option but to take up social security benefits of one kind or another. 
The argument some people use about the level of awards given for future life care needs is that judges take plaintiffs' inexperience in handling large sums of money into consideration when awarding damages and sometimes award more than they should in order to compensate for this. It is then the medical defence organisations who have to wear this extra cost. Because many plaintiffs are inexperienced in investing large sums of money they are sometimes unable to maximise investment income. This is taken into consideration by judges when discounting the final award based on projection for future investment earnings, which tends to be conservative. However, under structured settlements, damages awards would be in the hands of insurance agencies who have a long history of responsibly managing money and will be able to maximise investment returns. This will in turn have a direct impact on the overall quantum of damages awarded in such medical cases. Dr Richard Tjong, Chairman of the United Medical Protection Society, which is the largest medical defence organisation in this country, supports structured settlements and believes that they will result in smaller damages awards. Dr Tjong has said: 
For those people who don't believe in what structured settlements will do for us, it's simply to do with the way courts project investment income in the hands of inexperienced plaintiffs, inexperienced in managing large sums for a lifetime. The courts allow for a very conservative discount rate for each investment income. The AMPs of this world are in the best position to manage these patients' trusts. Therefore, the up-front lump sum [of damages] would be smaller. 
He means `were structured settlements introduced'. Currently there is no incentive for plaintiffs to take the damages in the form of periodic payments as these are subject to taxation. Conversely, damages taken in the form of a lump sum are not. To encourage plaintiffs to take their damages in this form, there needs to be legislative change so that structured settlements are tax exempt. I hope that the government will give favourable consideration to implementing tax exemption of awards made under structured settlements, not only in medical cases but in a variety of other damages cases.  
In conclusion, anecdotal evidence suggests that the rapid rise in medical defence organisation subscription fees has had a clearly detrimental impact on medical practice, especially on both specialist and general practitioner obstetricians and gynaecologists. A key factor in the level of insurance premiums has been the trend towards very large payments to cover the life needs of awardees. The message I want to convey today is that structured settlements would have the effect of relieving this cost push pressure on medical defence insurance premiums in the manner I have outlined. 
Finally, given the serious impact on medical practice of the high insurance premiums, I would urge governments to legislate to establish structured settlements. This measure would go a considerable way to providing a solution to the high cost of medical defence organisation insurance premiums and, significantly, assist in the preservation of medical services, such as obstetrics and anaesthetics, in regional areas.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-04-05,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), to questions without notice asked today.
Madam President, we have seen today another abysmal performance from a minister who should be performing better. This minister has dragged this country into a social policy crisis and, in doing so, he has proven that he is not up to the job. Unfortunately, his performance again today reinforces the perception that the Australian public has. Unfortunately, what this minister has done hurts Australia's reputation. It provokes reaction; it divides. It divides our people from a position where he, as Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, should have a higher responsibility than many other ministers. His portfolio is about trying to conciliate the problems and the divisions in our society, not exacerbate those problems. What he did on the weekend, what he has done continually in this portfolio and what he has done again today has basically been to exacerbate those divisions. In doing so, what he has given us today is more evidence of his incompetence, his lack of appreciation of the job and his lack of appreciation of that high responsibility to help unite Australia, not divide it. 
Today we had a minister who told us that the term `stolen generation' was mere rhetoric, but then proceeded to tell us that it was more than rhetoric. We had a minister who tried to tell us that `generation' in one context means something else in another. This minister claims that everyone else is invoking semantics when he himself over the weekend used the biggest semantic argument of the lot. This minister is not on top of the portfolio. This minister continues to state that the term `stolen generation' does not emanate from the HREOC report when all you have to do is to flick the report over to page 225 to find reference to the stolen generation. His response to questions from Senator Ridgeway in terms of health funding showed that he not only did not appreciate the degree of the problem but also did not appreciate how you could fix it. 
In respect of the Grants Commission, we had more evidence of a minister who is bent on excluding Aboriginal Australians from the consultative participation process. He basically said today that he looked around but could not find an indigenous Australian good enough for that particular task. That, I think, is the greatest slur on these people. Let us understand one thing: these people are hurting from a continual barrage of abuse, neglect and snobbery from this particular government. It was epitomised this morning in the Melbourne Age by Michael Long of the Essendon Football Club in his letter to the editor. He says:
How do I tell my mother that Mr Howard said the stolen generation never took place? How does he explain to me why none of my grandparents are alive?
How do I explain to my mother, who was the most loved, trusting mother figure to all who knew her that Mr Howard is just the same as the people who were in power back then, cold-hearted pricks.
How do I tell my mother that her grandchildren were never affected by the stolen generation, that they don't know their aunties and uncles, their people?
Does Mr Howard understand how much trauma my grandmother suffered. It ripped her heart out, what she went through. Even when she died, her baby was never returned home.
If you put yourself in their shoes—I have three children—and people come knocking at my door, grabbing my children, putting them in the back of a truck, yelling, screaming. Over my dead body, Mr Howard.
Back then my mother had no choice but to go. It was wrong. It did happen. It was Government policy.
My mother was taken when she was a baby, taken to Darwin and put on a boat—she had never seen the sea before—screaming and yelling, not knowing what was happening and then crying herself to sleep. I call that trauma and abuse. I am so angry anyone could do this to a child just because their skin was a different color.
Mr Howard, I can't tell my mother because she has been dead for 17 years. Who is going to tell her story, the trauma and lies associated with her people and their families? Mr Howard, if you just walked in their shoes you would understand.
I am all for reconciliation, Mr Howard. I am part of the stolen generation. It's like dropping a rock in a pool of water and it has a rippling effect, so don't tell me it affects only 10 per cent. No amount of money can replace what your Government has done to my family.
I have always respected Michael Long, and I think Australians owe him a debt of gratitude for the way he has put this on the record today. This person continues to hurt; his family continues to hurt. This is one of thousands of families that hurt because of this government's deliberate policy. Laurie Oakes also got it right this morning when he said: `The government needs to be careful how it plays the wedge politics game.' He is so right. No responsible government would even contemplate it. It is worth remembering that.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2000-04-05,"—The behaviour of the Labor Party over the past few days in relation to this issue has been nothing short of disgraceful. When the history of this period of Australia is written, the behaviour of the Labor Party and certain people within it will not be presented in a very good light at all. What Senator Herron did in his excellent submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee was detail some facts. I would recommend it to anybody who is genuinely interested in the welfare of our indigenous community.  
For an example of how Sir Ronald Wilson, in the Bringing them home report, got it so embarrassingly wrong, I would refer people to page 18 of Senator Herron's submission. In the Bringing them home report, a lady, Joy Williams, was cited as being a typical stolen child. Her case was used by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission as one of the examples of a stolen child. The whole criticism of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's methodology was that none of the alleged evidence had, in fact, been tested. Were the stories that were being told in fact capable of substantiation?
—You don't want to cross-examine her, do you?
—And Senator O'Brien said, `Did you want to cross-examine?' Well, isn't it interesting? Ms Joy Williams's case came before the Supreme Court of New South Wales and it recently found that Williams, who it was alleged had been taken from her mother, had in fact been voluntarily placed into care by her mother. That is the finding of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Are we going to be told by the Labor Party that that judicial body is racist, that somehow it has deliberately turned and twisted the facts to come to this conclusion? Of course they cannot, because they rely on the same judiciary—as we do—that delivered the cases on Mabo, Wik and other issues. But this is just one example—albeit a very good and glaring one—of where a well-motivated and undoubtedly sincere Sir Ronald Wilson just accepted chapter and verse a tale which, when it was scrutinised, was found to be completely without foundation. Ms Williams is now referred to as one of the stolen generation; in fact, she was voluntarily handed over by her mother.
There are other cases. The Gunner case is another and the Cubillo case is another. The Wilson inquiry never sought to take evidence from people who were in charge of the policies of the time. They are still alive. Indeed, there are hundreds and thousands of children in this country whose parents were involved in the policies of the time and who are now having their parents labelled as being akin to SS officers perpetrating the horrors of the Holocaust. I can tell you that not a single person involved in the SS would ever have said that the treatment of the Jews in the Holocaust was somehow designed for the benefit of the Jewish people. That would never have been asserted. Yet there are very genuine Australians whose parents were involved in the welfare policies of the time, which were accepted on a bipartisan basis and on the basis of the social views of the time, and they were genuine and well motivated. The Australian Labor Party seeks to tag all our fellow Australians who were involved in those policies—policies, might I add, that applied equally to white, unmarried single mothers.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-04-05,"— In relation to many of Senator Herron's answers to questions today one could excuse the minister for simply being out of his depth. But in relation to the answer to the question that I asked Senator Herron, one can only come to the conclusion that the minister has misled this Senate. I asked whether the minister had been involved in the removal of the names of two indigenous candidates from a list put forward to cabinet by the Commonwealth Grants Commission for appointment to the inquiry into the distribution of funds for indigenous programs.
In answering the question, Senator Herron attempted to focus only on the first part of the question because he knew that the answer to the second part of the question was, `Yes, I was responsible for removing those two names.' Then the minister sought to say, `Well, people are removed from these lists because perhaps the selection process is not right, because they are not the right people, because they do not want the part-time position that they apparently have been proposed for.' When you look at the actuality of this matter—and in fact I have answers to questions on notice from the Minister for Finance and Administration on this very selection process—one finds that there was a consultancy set up through an independent tender process, selected by the Minister for Finance and Administration, to select the short list of people to be put to cabinet and ultimately to the Governor-General for appointment to these positions. Kathleen Townsend Executive Solutions Pty Ltd was appointed according to Commonwealth procurement guidelines. In fact, they were one of five applicants for the consultancy. They were required to establish a list by 22 October 1999. They were given specific requirements for the selection of the commissioners by the government, by the Minister for Finance and Administration. An elaborate set of requirements was set down, and it was required that they be met. This consultancy was paid $50,000. 
	A list of names was put forward as a result of that. Then Senator Herron tried to tell us that, `You even had people who were put forward by these consultants who withdrew.' Yes, it is true in this case that there was a person who was on the list who withdrew, but I know for an absolute certainty that the person on the list who withdrew withdrew following Senator Herron's decision to remove the names of those two indigenous people from the list, and specifically because of that action by Senator Herron. That person did not want to lend any legitimacy to any appointment, given the corruption of the process that was effected by Senator Herron. And whom did Senator Herron seek to replace those two indigenous candidates with? Mr Bruce Reid, former member of the House of Representatives from Victoria, and Mr Miles, former member for Braddon in the state of Tasmania, neither of whom has a great connection or experience with or understanding of the background of services to indigenous people. Yet they were to be put on that list in place of two indigenous candidates independently selected by a consultant appointed by the government after a proper and extensive process of selecting the consultant and the selected consultant being armed with guidelines specified by the government. As far as I am aware, none of those guidelines were challenged by Senator Herron in his contribution today.
As I said earlier, one might say that the minister was simply out of his depth when answering the questions that were put to him in many respects. But in relation to the question that I asked one can only say that the minister has misled the Senate. The minister knows that he was responsible for withdrawing the names of those two indigenous people. He knows that the process by which their names arrived on the list was a proper one. He knows that the withdrawal of the other candidate was down to his action in removing those names from the list. Frankly, he darned well better get into this chamber and correct the record quick smart because he is now on the record as having misled the Senate. Frankly, I know it is unparliamentary to say that he knowingly misled but—

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-04-05,"— I agree with Senator Bolkus that we have heard much rhetoric and semantics over the last few days. Every time in this place that I have had the opportunity to speak I have referred to the failure in this country of the Left's perception of history, their failure to celebrate the Australian national achievement, their failure to be relevant with respect to the economy, their failure in the Cold War, and their consistent failure on virtually every social, economic and cultural issue. However, I want to make a concession. On the issue of indigenous Australians, without doubt it is our greatest national blemish. This country has achieved so much in so many areas of endeavour but, with respect to indigenous Australians, we have failed in the past. What is important, however, is what we do in the future. There has been an enormous amount of rhetoric and a lot of emotion attached to this issue. But, as Senator Herron has said over the last few days, a job is worth a thousand tears and a tonne of rhetoric. What is important are outcomes for indigenous Australians.
Senator Abetz outlined the government's response to the HREOC report, and I will not address that any further. But I know that the Howard government is committed to improving the things that matter to all Australians and, in particular, to indigenous Australians. They are indigenous health, housing, education and the sponsoring of economic development. As Senator Ferris said yesterday, there is also the subject of violence. As someone who used to teach criminology, I can attest to the fact that violence in Aboriginal communities is a cancer in those communities and is the most horrendous thing, particularly for Aboriginal women. 
More broadly, what is extremely important--and this gets back again, I suppose, to misunderstanding by the Left in this country about where we are going--is that over the next 10 to 20 years in the area of welfare we will move increasingly to a philosophy of mutual obligation. That will be increasingly important also in Aboriginal affairs. In large measure, the livelihoods of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders will be improved by promoting self-reliance and economic independence. We must break the shackles of welfare dependence. Senator Herron consistently has said--and the government agrees with him--that the only way Aboriginals in this society can move forward is to assume a culture of entrepeneurship and break the welfare cycle. 
Noel Pearson himself has spoken about the `poisonous welfare drip'. That is what poisons Aboriginal communities consistently. It is not a matter of money. Over 13 years in government the Labor Party spent $16 billion on Aboriginal welfare. Yet despite all that expenditure, life expectancy for Aboriginal people was 15 to 20 years less than it was for the general population. The incidence of infectious diseases was 12 times higher than it was for the average Australian. I have been to those communities, and so many Aboriginal infants had compromised immune systems from the word go. Indigenous infant mortality was three to five times higher than for other Australian children. And only a third of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids completed schooling, compared to a national average of 77 per cent. 
This is not a matter of money. If it were simply a matter of money we would have progressed. It is not. It is a matter of inculcating a sense of responsibility and a sense of pride. When that comes, we will move forward in this debate and get above the rhetoric of the opposition, which has nothing else to offer except that.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2000-04-05,"—I was very fortunate in 1997 to be a delegate to the National Reconciliation Convention. I was there on the day when the report Bringing them home was presented to the convention. It was a momentous event. It was an event that started a process that was referred to by the minister—the process of peeling back and seeing the truth for what it really was. It was the culmination of an inquiry where hundreds of indigenous people had told their stories freely and honestly and told them not in an adversarial situation. These are very personal and hurtful events that have occurred to these people. To suggest, as Senator Abetz has done, that they should be examined in a court of law is atrocious. 
—He is disgusting. 
—Yes, I agree. The receipt of the report was, as I said, a first major step in this nation dealing with a shocking part of our history. There is, I think, agreement amongst this chamber that that part of our history actually occurred. There is no doubt that thousands of children were taken from their mothers without their consent and often never seen again. That is fact and that is something that this nation needs to deal with and move on from. 
I refer to the quote that Senator Herron referred to today. I did not write it down, so I do not know the exact words, but I think I have the intent. He talked of a philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer, and the three stages of truth. He said that the first stage was ridicule; something like scepticism was the second stage; and the third stage was something like vindication and acceptance. The receipt of the Bringing them home report was the first major step that we took as a nation to accepting the history that we have, the history that we all accept occurred. 
Subsequent to that, we have had the Sorry Day events, we have had the Sorry books, we have taken on a number of events as a nation to increase community understanding of our true history, of the truth that we experienced as a nation. But with the events of the last week I believe that we have wound back the clock to the first stage, to the stage of ridicule. We have seen Senator Herron ridiculing the history, the truth, of our nation. Indigenous people who came to that inquiry and told their stories openly and honestly have had their experience questioned. The hurt and pain that these people are feeling now are obviously not registering with Senator Herron.  
The other group of people who have been hurt in this last week are the non-indigenous people, including the churches, who have come to the reconciliation process and accepted our history, accepted that children were taken from their families. The events of the last week have said to those people: `We do not value what you believe was our history. We do not value the apologies that you have given, the apologies the churches have given.' That is what Senator Herron is telling our nation. Senator Herron is showing no leadership on this issue. He is winding back the stages of truth that he himself quoted, to the stage of ridicule. He, as the representative of these issues in the government, is allowing our nation to step back in time so that we cannot accept our history and then move on. At the reconciliation convention that was one of the clear messages: we as a nation have to recognise our history. Senator Herron has done nothing towards that.
I want to quickly say that Senator Herron may have mislead the House today, and I refer him to page 225 of the report. The words `stolen generation' are also recognised in the bibliography. One final point: yesterday Senator Herron said that no-one in the indigenous community had raised the issue of the stolen generation with him. Well, he has not spoken to the women under the tree at Napranum, has he?

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-04-05,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to a question without notice asked by Senator Harris today, relating to the goods and services tax and the sale of livestock.
In relation to Senator Kemp's reply to my question on livestock, I would like to place on record some figures that will clearly indicate the impost the GST is going to place on the livestock industry. When you analyse the situation you find, for instance, that if one abattoir processes 6,000 cattle per week at an average of $450 per head, the total cost of cattle production is $2,700,000. A GST added to that means an extra $270,000 is required for payment of the cattle. That is only from one single abattoir. 
Livestock slaughtered in New South Wales for the week ending 3 December saw 37,963 cattle and 184,643 sheep and lambs killed. Based on an average price of $450 for cattle and $25 for sheep and lambs, that is $17,083,350 in cattle and $4,016,075 in the value of sheep and lambs—a total of $21,099,425 paid by the processors, giving a GST component of $2,169,942. That is the amount of money that the industry has to find on a weekly basis with the implementation of GST. No calculation has been worked out for goats or pigs, nor do the figures take into account the purchase and sale of store cattle. If they were combined in that figure, the industry in New South Wales alone would have to find, with the implementation of the GST, in the vicinity of $4 million per week. Such a figure will have a huge impact on everyone's cash flow, especially meat processors who are already slugged with exorbitant AQIS and government charges. Many rural towns depend on abattoirs. They are large employers who contribute grossly to the respective towns' livelihoods.
The figures are only for New South Wales. The GST becomes a multimillion dollar slug on the livestock industry right throughout Australia. The fact that the government will not actually earn any taxable income from a livestock GST shows how ludicrous the GST on livestock is. The meat processing industry has always been a volatile one, and the impost of a 10 per cent GST will only make it more difficult for many operators to remain viable. Cattle and lamb prices are relatively good at the moment, and the beef industry is probably the brightest light in rural Australia at the moment. The industry is concerned that a 10 per cent GST, which processors will have to pay, may be offset in a 10 per cent reduction in returns to the producers.  
The fact that there is no GST applicable on any live export of cattle or sheep shows another flaw in the GST package. What is the difference between a steer being slaughtered or a steer being sent to Indonesia? The industry has clearly indicated that its preference is for the government to roll over the primary producers' sales tax exemption number and, therefore, take livestock out of this ludicrous loop that the government has put it in with the GST.

Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
TRADE OUTCOMES AND OBJECTIVES STATEMENT 2000
STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT
5 April 2000
This year's Statement paints a promising picture for Australian exporters.  Exports recovered through 1999 from the effects of the East Asian economic crisis with total exports rising, in trend terms, in each of the last eight months of the year.  The February 2000 trade figures released last Thursday confirmed what is now a ten month trend, with exports 15 per cent above their level of February 1999.   
One of the things that helped us through a tough trading environment last year was the diversified base of Australian exports. As the TOOS outlines, Australian exports are now divided fairly equally across agriculture, minerals, manufactures and services. And while low commodity prices and a stronger Australian dollar took the edge off our traditional commodity exports in 1999, exports of services and manufactures were each up by six per cent. 
The international economic outlook described in this year's Statement is the best we've seen since the start of the East Asian economic crisis.  Forecasters expect a more balanced level of growth among the major economic regions, and a global economic growth rate exceeding 3 per cent.  Growth in world trade is forecast to strengthen to around 6 per cent in 2000, up by more than 2 percentage points on the previous two years.
All this is very good news for Australian exporters, particularly the boost from increasing demand in East Asia and recovery in the region's exports.  Australia's exports to East Asia are now growing strongly, up 37 per cent on their level of a year ago.  But to take advantage of these developments, Australia must maintain its competitive edge.
The very fact that Australia was able to outperform almost every other OECD country during the Asian economic crisis shows just how far the Government has moved our country towards the cutting edge of global competitiveness.  
The Government will be looking to make Australia's competitive position even stronger through the introduction of the New Tax System on 1 July.  Our total reform package, including the GST and reforms to the business tax system, will stimulate stronger investment and boost growth in key export sectors.  The abolition of old wholesale and state taxes, as well as reform of fuel excises, will lift a $3.5 billion burden from the shoulders of Australian exporters.
Our political opponents still have no policy alternative. For example, they have no alternative to offer the owner of Malibu Boats in Albury who told me in February that, with the implementation of the GST on 1 July 2000, he will be able to sell his boats at 1997 prices.
Mr Speaker, TOOS 2000 outlines how the Coalition Government will continue our highly successful, multi-pronged strategy of boosting sales of Australian goods and services on world markets.
The World Trade Organisation remains the primary vehicle for Australia to advance its broadly based and geographically diverse trade interests.  The Government remains committed to launching a new market access-focused round of multilateral trade negotiations at the earliest opportunity.  In the meantime, we are pushing ahead on the mandated WTO negotiations on services and agriculture, and will be working towards the incorporation of these negotiations in a broader WTO round.  
Our WTO agenda also involves improvement of our capacity to utilise the dispute settlement process and our negotiations on bringing new members into the WTO. 
Australia continues to actively pursue its rights and defend its interests in WTO dispute settlement.  In 1999, complaints were initiated by Australia against US safeguard measures on lamb and Korean restrictions on imported beef. We now have a WTO panel established in the lamb case, and next month we will receive the panel report on the Korea beef case. And we continue to work for mutually satisfactory outcomes on cases relating to automotive leather and salmon.
Australia stands to reap big gains from the expanded membership of the WTO.  Late last week, Australia reached an in-principle agreement on market access for Saudi Arabia's joining of the WTO.  This deal provides the basis for export growth beyond the $1 billion per year mark achieved for the first time in 1999.  It builds on our success in concluding market access negotiations with nine trading partners last year, most importantly China.
Mr Speaker
Regionally, we also have a busy calendar in the coming year.  APEC offers opportunities for rebuilding political momentum for a WTO round, and for advancing our business-oriented agenda on such issues as reducing compliance costs, improving the ease of business travel, improving access to information and developing sensible and transparent regulatory environments.  Australia will have an important opportunity to advance our Asia-Pacific trade agenda this year when I host the APEC Trade Ministers' Meeting in Darwin in June.
The proposal for a free trade area by 2010 between the ASEAN countries and the Closer Economic Relations (CER) partners - Australian and New Zealand - is a key priority this year. My predecessor, Tim Fischer, is doing an excellent job as Australia's representative on the AFTA-CER task force which will report its recommendations in October this year. I also welcome the enthusiastic endorsement this proposal has received from Australian business groups.  
This year we will continue the bilateral strategies to increase Australian exports that have been the hallmark of our Government's trade policies.  I've already led a successful visit by an Australian trade delegation to Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East, and visits to other key markets are planned for later this year.  
The Market Development Task Forcewill continue to coordinate a whole-of-Government approach to areas of significant export potential for Australia.  And market access teams in the automotive, textile, clothing and footwear, information industries, processed foods and agriculture sectors will pursue new opportunities in 2000.
Austrade continues to play a major role in promoting Australian products abroad, and in helping Australian companies identify and take advantage of international opportunities.  In particular, Austrade has broadened its operations into rural and regional Australia through the innovative TradeStart and Export Access programmes, giving those outside metropolitan areas the chance to move their business into international markets.  Austrade is also helping Australian firms position themselves for the growth of e-commerce.
The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) will continue to complement activities of the commercial market by providing exporters with a range of internationally competitive insurance and finance products.
Mr Speaker
The importance of international trade to regional Australia, and of exporters in regional Australia to our national trade effort, are key messages from this year's TOOS.  Regional Australia has around one-third of Australia's workforce, and generates more than half of our exports. One in four jobs in regional Australia depends on exports, compared to a figure of around one in five jobs nationally.
To make this important information more widely known in our community, my Department will be issuing a series of brochures for individual regions across Australia this year, which will highlight a number of successful exporters in each region.  They illustrate the importance of exporters in local economies, as well as how the Government's efforts to open up overseas markets can benefit individual regions.
Mr Speaker, the 2000 Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement strongly reaffirms the Government's commitment to an outward looking and internationally competitive trading position for Australia.  The effort put in by our exporters, in the cities and in the bush, demands the recognition and enthusiastic support of all Australians.
TOOS 2000 shows how our Government aims to boost export opportunities for Australia, and to win greater market access at every level - multilaterally, regionally and bilaterally.  The Statement is an indispensable tool for anyone who wants to learn more about Australia's present and future trade environment.  
I commend it to the House, and I table the document and my statement.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Australia's Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement 2000</title>,Ministerial Statements,19,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-04-05,"—I seek leave on behalf of Senator Conroy to incorporate Labor's response to the Trade outcomes and objectives statement 2000 in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows
Labor's Response to the Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement
Statement to Parliament
Senator Stephen Conroy
5 April 2000
I would like to be able to stand up today and say that all was well with Australia's trade. Ideally, I wanted to note that the thousands of businesses that export, and the 1.7 million workers whose jobs depend on exports, had been well looked after by this government.
But I cannot. Australia's trade today is in a parlous state. Figures released earlier this year showed that we actually exported less in 1998-99 than in 1997-98. Exports dropped by 3 percent, or more than $2 billion. This was the first fall in exports for at least 20 years. That is, the first fall in exports since the days when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister and John Howard was his Treasurer.
A record trade deficit
The result is a record trade deficit. In 1999, Australia recorded its biggest ever trade deficit, by a substantial margin. The gap between what we import and what we export has now grown to $16 billion. When Labor left office, Australia had a trade surplus. We currently have a Trade Minister who last Thursday put out a press release headed “Good trade figures” just because the monthly trade deficit had snuck below $1 billion. 
This is a government which prides itself in good economic management. Yet when it comes to trade, its record is so woeful that it has to resort to moving the goalposts. Once, “Good trade figures” meant a trade surplus. Under the Howard Government, apparently, it means anything less than a $1 billion monthly trade deficit.
When we look at the detail, the problem becomes even more disturbing. In the case of our agricultural exports, processed food fell faster than unprocessed food. In manufactures, elaborately transformed manufactures fell faster than simply transformed manufactures. Under the Howard Government, our exports are being dumbed down.
The fall in Australia's clever exports is hardly surprising when two other statistics are taken into account:
under this Government, total Commonwealth spending on education decreased by more than $500 million - down from 1.99% of GDP to 1.9 % of GDP; and
government and business expenditure on research and development have fallen in absolute terms since the Howard Government came to power - Australia's Chief Scientist predicts that without a change of policy, our overall expenditure on research and development will fall further - from 1.7% of GDP in 1998 to 1.4% in 2002, whilst that of Korea, Finland and the United States will remain at 3.2%, 3.0% and 2.8% respectively.
With diminishing spending on education, training, research and development, is it really any surprise that our smart exports are falling the fastest?
A record current account deficit
Turning to the current account, the numbers only Set worse. Our current account deficit for 1999 was $34.6 billion. You guessed it - another record. But our current account deficit isn't just a national record. This time, the Howard Government has gone one better. Each week, the Economist magazine publishes a table on its second-last page, listing the current account deficits for 15 developed countries. Australia's current account deficit, at 4.9% of GDP, puts us in last place. The Economist also includes a poll of its forecasters for 2001. Again, we are placed dead last. Thanks to the Howard Government, our current account deficit is officially the worst in the developed world.
APEC
The Howard Government's declining interest in APEC seems to have occurred largely because they have taken it for granted. A decade after Labor took the bold initiative to create it, the Howard Government seems to have forgotten that without APEC, Australia's economic and strategic future in the Asia-Pacific region would be profoundly different. APEC demonstrates Australia's commitment to our closest neighbours. It brings the region's leaders together each year, building the personal relationships that are so critical to creating a safer, more prosperous world. And perhaps most importantly, it commits APEC members to the path of openness.
A critical step for APEC was the 1994 Bogor Declaration, in which members committed to achieving free trade and investment by 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for developing economies. Under Labor, the countries of the Asia-Pacific committed to economic integration, not isolation. For the sceptics, it is always important to reiterate that integration is not inevitable. It was a choice that our region made six years ago, and one that can still be reversed. Sometimes, autarky can be closer than we think.
APEC's Bogor Declaration and annual leaders' meetings are now in jeopardy. Australia used to be one of the key driving forces behind APEC. Now, John Howard and Mark Vaile seem content to let it languish. Without new impetus from the nation that pushed for APEC's creation, the next few years may see member economies start to find excuses for not meeting the Bogor targets. Inaction by the Howard Government could also lead to the cessation of the annual leaders meetings. After the failures of recent years, leaders may soon ask themselves, why bother? Will the next US President - be he George W Bush or Al Gore - continue to devote two days every year to a forum that seems to have lost its way?
World Trade Organisation
The other trade body of critical importance to Australia is the World Trade Organisation. It is worth noting how little this Government did in the lead-up to last November's Seattle WTO meeting. Despite our key position as permanent chair of the Cairns Group, Mr Howard rebuffed calls from Bill Clinton to travel to Seattle to help make the meeting a success. In fact, Mr Howard was so disengaged from the process that he did not publicly mention the WTO once in the whole week leading up to the Seattle meeting. He and Mr Vaile are not responsible for the failure of Seattle to launch a new round. But had it succeeded, they certainly would not have deserved much of the credit.
Following the shambles at Seattle, negotiations on agriculture and services began in early February 2000. But any substantial boost for our exporters will clearly have to wait until a new WTO round commences. When it comes to achieving this goal, Labor is again detecting a real sense of pessimism in the Howard Government. In public, they proudly proclaim that they are doing everything they can to initiate new negotiations. In private, they say that there is no point doing anything until after the US Presidential election in November 2000 As much is clear from today's Trade Objectives and Outcomes Statement, which provides commentary on Seattle, but no plan for the future. 
This is a fundamental mistake. Whatever the complexion of the new President and his administration, they are likely to be favourably disposed to a new round. In reality, the biggest hurdle standing before a new round is coming to grips with the needs of the developing countries. They comprise around two-thirds of the WTO's 135 members, and their message at Seattle was clear: no round until we are satisfied it will be on terms that provide us with a greater expectation of growth than did the Uruguay Round.
The Howard Government needs to start urgently coming to terms with the developing country agenda if a new round is to be launched. This requires listening to leaders from Africa, Asia and Latin America. It means promoting plans like the one proposed in UNCTAD in February, to remove all tariffs on exports from the world's 48 least developed countries. And it means taking some serious steps to build the capacity of developing countries to conduct trade negotiations.
China and the WTO
Finally, the government should be doing more to speed up China's entry into the WTO. China's accession will bring direct economic benefits - as much as $10 billion per year - to Australia. Industrial tariffs will come down from an average of 24 percent in 1997 to 10 percent in 2004. Agricultural tariffs will fall from 31 percent to 14 percent. We will gain better services access in areas such as banking, law, accounting, construction and telecommunications. But there are important intangible benefits too, as we increasingly integrate China with the rest of the world, strengthen the hand of the economic reformers, and make space for more democracy and individual freedoms for ordinary Chinese.
Today's statement suggests that Australia's responsibility for bringing China into the WTO ended when we concluded our bilateral negotiations. This is utterly myopic. As the Shadow Trade Minister, Senator Peter Cook, told a meeting at Chatham House, London last Friday, the Howard Government should be doing more to bring negotiations between the European Union and China back on track. Mr Howard and Mr Vaile need to send a clear message to Europe through our diplomatic channels - bringing China into the WTO is too important to be left solely to the trade negotiators. We should be sensitive to the severe internal strains that China's domestic reforms are causing, and do all we can to bring the world's most populous nation into the WTO as speedily as possible.
Conclusion
Labor welcomes this year's Trade Objectives and Outcomes Statement. We hope that this will be the year when the government will get serious about turning around our record trade deficit and current account deficit. The best place to start would be with the key multilateral bodies - APEC and the WTO. Let's hope that 2000 will be the year when APEC is brought out of the doldrums and new WTO talks are launched, with China at the table. Perhaps then, Australia won't break too many more records before next year's TOOS.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Australia's Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement 2000</title>,Ministerial Statements,19,1

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-04-05,"—Before the lunch break, I was explaining to the Senate the strange tale of how incompetence and buffoonery leads to circumstances where the government is forced to take action and rectify the serious faults created by government ministers. I was talking about the situation where the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government directed the Administrator of Norfolk Island to give assent to a law of the Norfolk Island assembly to establish a university known by the title of Greenwich University. This is a tale of how this august, new Australian seat of learning at Greenwich, located on an external territory of this count-ry, was established. The Senate will re-member that it came into existence at the behest of the island's legislature. The Min-is-ter for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Macdonald, sought by his own actions to direct the ad-min--istrator and acted in an incompetent way to produce a set of circumstances where he has probably had a greater influence over education policy than many of the ministers he himself says are responsible for education. His actions have led to the establishment of a review panel, after a little bit of publicity in this place and pressure from various states pointing out the inadequacies of his be-hav-iour. The review panel was moved to propose the establishment of a new quality assurance frame-work in this country, which I would like to look at in greater detail when we act-u-ally see the proposition presented to the parliament.
The measures came about as a result of Senator Macdonald being duped. He was duped by people at Norfolk Island. He was duped by the person who presents himself as the `Duke of Branagh', a person who claims to have distinguished academic record but who, in fact, as I understand it, secured his academic credentials from a university which has accreditation through the Shoshone tribe of Nevada. He presents himself as a person that has royal titles. He claims to be the regent of the French royal house of Anjou. He is said to be a justice of the peace and a Knight Grand Cross of the Sovereign Order of St John. He says he has various other titles associated with St John of Malta and that he has `distinguished records of achievement', to the point where, as I understand it, he is a member of the Brimeyer organisation. He claims to be able to assert some linkage to Russia through His Highness Prince Alexis II. So he is the sort of person you would want to have running an Australian university! He is the sort of person you would want to have going round the world and explaining that this is a quality outfit! 
What does this minister do? He accepts the assurances that this Internet university could only be applied to Norfolk Island. `It was for domestic purposes only,' he said to the Senator estimates hearing; `It was only a minor matter,' a matter that had been presented to us as an issue we should not be unduly concerned about. The government has said to us in the Senate estimates hearings that the Commonwealth government has established a committee to review Greenwich University's academic and financial credentials, and only after the Commonwealth is satisfied that Greenwich University's credentials are equivalent to the credentials of other Australian universities would it recommend to the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs that Greenwich be listed on the AQF registers. 
We look forward to holding this government to this assurance that they have given us. We look forward to examining the report that comes forward establishing whether or not Greenwich University has academic and financial credentials equal to the rest of universities in Australia.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-04-05,"—Senator Carr was on a theme that could well have justified another five or 10 minutes or more speaking time. He has done a lot of work in that very serious area of just how we can guarantee across the board that the level of education in this country is high—not that we have simply got one or two universities in each state that are very good but that the level of our education is high, no matter where.
As Senator Carr pointed out, there have been some difficulties in our being able to say that as Australians, and I think this matter will be developed tomorrow. I am very pleased that Senator Carr, who will be leading that debate, has indicated that that will be so. There have been some interesting contributions to debate in this chamber over the last hour or so. The issue of fisheries is a very important one, and it appears before us again. It is an issue of finding the right balance between exploiting a resource, making sure that that resource is preserved to ensure that there are resources in the future and ensuring a society that is well balanced and can produce not only money but the quality of life that we want. In that context, recently there has been some industrial action in Melbourne in the building industry, and other industries as well, about the length of hours people work. You can take a cynical approach about that, but the point made by people like Dean Mighell, the Secretary of the Electrical Trade Union, and Martin Kingham, the Secretary of the CFMEU, is correct: what people want now is not simply loads and loads of money but the ability to earn a decent living and to live a life of some quality.
We are discussing appropriation bills, which of course cover all areas of our lives. It is in that context that I have mentioned these matters. The appropriation bills are about how money is to be distributed to various parts of the community—to various organisations and to people in the community. We need to have a system of fairness—a system of justice across Australia that we can be proud of. There has been a great deal of discussion this week about mandatory sentencing, and there have been some very deep insights given about that. Mandatory sentencing raises the whole issue of whether or not we are going to have a legal system that is fair. The legal system must be fair not only in the criminal law but in general law, because the law does not only deal with whether a person goes to jail. In question time today, Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Justice and Customs, talked about the number of people that have been jailed and the length of time that they have been jailed. She was talking about people who deal in drugs, and saying that people who deal in drugs deserved to be punished severely, given the sorts of crimes they commit. If we are going to jail people, as we should if they commit a crime, we have to make sure that they are the ones that committed the crime. Therefore, we have to ensure that the people who investigate—the police, the National Crime Authority and other bodies at state level—are properly funded. Not only should those people who discover these crimes be funded properly but also those who become defendants should be funded properly. 
Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, this raises the issue of legal aid, about which you have had much to say over the years and about which you have written much. I will use a dramatic example to show just how important it is. In last Saturday's Age there was an article headed `DNA tests open prison doors'. It had a paragraph in it about a situation in the United States of America, where they have the death penalty. Fortunately that is not the situation here, but it points out nevertheless the very necessary process we must go through to ensure that the person who is charged is the person who committed the crime. Two things happen if you get the wrong person: a person is unjustly punished, and the person who should be punished is let go, both of which circumstances should be avoided. The article in the Age last Saturday, headed `DNA tests open prison doors', said: 
More than 6,000 people have been sent to death row in the United States since 1976, and 80 of them have later been cleared on the basis of DNA and other evidence.
It is a chilling thought that 80 people over that time may have been executed although innocent. This is in the United States. No doubt, as the death penalty is involved, there would have been strict rules of evidence applied to see that those people were properly convicted, and yet that large number of people were convicted wrongly. Whether we are talking about a legal system in the United States or here, we should have a system that ensures that decisions are properly made and are correct. The work that you have done in this area, Mr Acting Deputy President, has helped towards ensuring that people are properly represented and that the prosecution and the defence are properly financed.
The issue of a good legal system does not stop within Australia; it spreads right around the world. There are now international standards, which have been much talked about during the debate on the issue of mandatory sentencing. Let us hope that everybody who has served a mandatory sentence was guilty of an offence. But, even presuming that they were guilty of an offence and  jailed, the question remains: were they imprisoned in contravention of these international covenants? People ask, `What have international covenants, international standards and international criteria to do with us?' The answer of course is everything, because of information technology, because we now trade around the world and because you or I could catch a plane and be in Ireland—where, no doubt, you would like to be, Mr Acting Deputy President; back to the homeland—within a day.
—He can't speak Irish, though.
 (Senator McKiernan)—Order!
—In any event, Mr Acting Deputy President, I know that your great love for Australia does not completely obliterate that regard you have for Ireland. But the point I want to make is that the social and commercial intercourse and all sorts of connections between countries are now at such a state that we do need to have, as it were, an international understanding. That is what these international treaties and covenants are all about: to recognise the growing need for those sorts of things. They developed, as we all know, during and after the Second World War. When that vast tragedy occurred in Europe and in the Pacific, people said, `There's got to be something better than this.' President Roosevelt declared the four freedoms; there was the Atlantic Charter and the declarations of human rights and the meeting of the United Nations. The first president of that was Dr Evatt, a person who deserves to be given great credit and reverence for the work he did. But since then there have been other conventions, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and so on. They are standards by which people should live. They are standards by which we say we should live and by which we say people around the world should live. Yet there has been a great attack on that international understanding voiced in parliament over the last couple of weeks or so, and that is a tragedy not only for Australia but also for the world generally.
I think there is a need in that context to have something like a bill of rights in Australia, which would give a local articulation to those international covenants. We do have, of course, a lot of acts that already do that, such as the Racial Discrimination Act and all those other acts that have followed. There is an interesting article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 3 April this year, written by George Williams, a lecturer at the Australian National University. He talks about the need for a bill of rights. He says:
It might be argued that we are simply at par with other comparable nations.
What he is saying is that, when we look at ourselves, we say, `We are going fairly well.' And I think we are. This is a country that can hold its head high in terms of its regard for civil rights and in its regard for the rule of law. Mr Williams continues: 
However, Australia differs in one crucial respect. We are alone in not having developed a statement setting out our rights and freedoms. Other common law nations have done this: Canada in 1982; New Zealand in 1990; even the United Kingdom (from which our own system is derived) in 1998. 
We have been left behind, our legal system quarantined from human rights developments in other nations with which we had shared a common legal framework. While each of these nations, like Australia, had relied upon the common law tradition to protect rights, they have recognised the need to supplement this with a Bill of Rights.
I think that, if we had a bill of rights, the situation that has now occurred in the Northern Territory with the mandatory sentencing laws would not have occurred. We have got to a point where the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory has to prove that he is as hairy chested as anyone. I think it has got to the point now where, no matter what his personal beliefs, he is being pushed into a corner where he cannot do the right thing—that is, to follow these international understandings, to adopt the criteria that operate in other countries similar to ours and to set aside these laws or at least change them so that they do not contain mandatory sentencing. If there were a bill of rights, that could be done because it would not be a particular issue at a particular time; there would be a rule of law which stretched over the operation of how laws in this country operate which would persist right throughout the country and right throughout generations. Therefore, it could be set aside without any loss of face by people like the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, and he would not have to be hairy chested about the situation. 
I began this speech talking about educational institutions and universities—the matter that Senator Carr was talking about, and I mentioned Mr Williams from the ANU. There is a need for universities to speak out. There is great capacity in our universities to analyse issues for the good of the community generally, not just for the good of the education system. These include issues of our rights and how we are treated by the law. People in the university, like Hilary Charlesworth, who has given evidence to our committees on several occasions, and Deborah Cass, contribute greatly. But universities need more funding, because they are too reliant on the need to satisfy high criteria—not in terms of moral worth but in terms of getting money, whether from the private sector or from the government sector. I think there is a fear growing in these universities, which is bad to see. It was not there in the old days, but of course the old days are always better. The book by Tony Coady from Melbourne University on this subject is well worth reading. 
I think there is a mood in government circles in Canberra at the moment which goes against the acceptance of a rule of law and which is in danger of becoming very mean and very limited, so that the law tends to crush people rather than let them expand and walk free as dignified citizens. One of the worst things about mandatory sentencing is the loss of reputation it causes to those who are locked up. Loss of reputation is dreadful for anybody, whether you are a member of parliament, a member of a bench or a young Aboriginal child. It is a shocking thing and it should not be visited lightly on people, as it is with mandatory sentencing.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-04-05,"—I rise in this debate to address some issues in relation to activities within the Department of Health and Aged Care. The first issue I wish to address is the very important issue of tardiness, to put it politely, on the part of this department in replying to questions on notice at estimates. If people read the Community Affairs Legislation Committee estimates report of March 2000, they will find a unanimous report criticising this department for its failure to provide answers by the due date. But it is not just a failure to reply by the due date; it is almost a failure to reply, full stop, on some occasions.
On 1 December of last year, we had the supplementary estimates to the budget estimates process, and a number of questions were taken on notice by the department. It was expected that the answers would be received by the committee secretariat by about 17 or 18 December. We know that that is a short time frame, and we know that Christmas intervened, but by 17 January this year, when nothing much had appeared, it became more serious. From my recollection, we began to see the odd reply come through about a week later. This is the department that has a whole series of questions on notice about its handling of issues such as MRI: how much did the minister know? What actually took place? What was the minister's involvement? This is about administration, lack of transparency and what people may or may not have known. This is serious scrutiny into the work that this department has been doing and what it and its minister have been up to.  
We now come to the issue of the additional estimates on 7 March this year. In the week leading up to that, bundles of answers came back. But, as senators well know, you do not prepare for estimates, if you are going to do it properly, in the last 24, 48 or even 72 hours—or even in the last week. There are hours and hours, days and days, of careful scrutiny of previous answers and issues that have to be checked to formulate ongoing questions. 
In fact, on the day of estimates itself we were still receiving replies from the department. They took on notice some criticisms and statements that I wished to make and made on that day, saying that I wanted the department to explain to us why, as late as Friday of the previous week—this is on 4 February—we were still receiving a significant number of answers to questions placed on notice. I think it was about 21 January that we started to get answers back. The secretary to the department was not there, but Mr Borthwick, the most senior officer at the table, was not able to give any reason as to why the answers were late in coming back. He said, `I think I do not have a particularly good answer to that, Senator.' I think it is an appalling answer. I am appalled at this. This is not good administration. As far as I am concerned, under the Westminster system administration begins at the top; administration begins with the ministers. If you want to take it further than that, it goes up through the cabinet to the Prime Minister, but I will stay with the ministers at this stage because that will do. 
So they could not answer that specific question. They could not answer why on one occasion I had asked a question and all they had given to me in the reply, which appeared two days before estimates, was a copy of an extract from the New South Wales parliament Hansard. I already had that—that is what I had used to base the question on. How come it takes a Commonwealth department two months to give me an answer when all they give me is an extract from a New South Wales parliament Hansard which is on the public record? It did not require a great deal of authority and approval through various sources to actually pass it on to us. It did not answer the question, but that is beside the point. They could not give me that answer.
The reporting date for having the answers back for 7 February was in about the middle of March. And guess what? We still wait. We have not received any answers that I am aware of from the Department of Health and Aged Care to the questions taken on notice on 7 February. The only thing that I have received is the correction of an answer that was given that was not correct in relation to immunisation schedules. This is not good enough. Estimates are about the careful scrutiny of the administration of an expenditure of moneys and also the administration of departments. I have to say that, if the answers to questions on notice are any indication, there is something gravely lacking in the administration of the Department of Health and Aged Care, both in the health area and in the aged care area. It is not good enough. This department is repeatedly doing this and is making a habit of it. 
I would draw people's attention to the committee report, which says:
1.11	The Committee is particularly concerned with the lateness of answers to questions on notice by DHAC because it has observed that a pattern has been developing of the Department providing answers to outstanding questions in the final days leading up to the next estimates hearing. The Department was put on notice that the Committee would be taking a much harder view if this practice continues. 
1.12	The Committee is also concerned at the piecemeal way in which answers to questions on issues requiring multiple answers are being provided by DHAC. In some cases there is a considerable time lag in the issue being answered in its entirety. While the Committee appreciates answers being provided as expeditiously as possible, this progressive provision of answers to questions with multiple parts can be frustrating and makes it more difficult for Senators and their staff to keep track of the complete answer to a question. 
It also makes scrutiny more difficult. One has to wonder why this is taking place. I draw the attention of senators to this particular report. This is a unanimous report. At estimates itself I complained, Senator Chris Evans complained and the chair registered her concerns and support for our complaints. This is not one group of senators going off on a fishing expedition or whatever and being unfair and unreasonable to the department. This is the committee as a whole being critical of the way the department is handling this particular issue. I think the Department of Health and Aged Care really does need to stand warned that, if this practice and behaviour continue, I do not know how long it is going to be held in front of an estimates committee next time, because there are a number of issues within that department that require very close and careful scrutiny. We are still trying, as I said, to get to the bottom of what happened with the MRI issue. We now, of course, have aged care, and there have been many questions and issues covering that. Now, subsequent to the estimates, we have had the Riverside case. There are many issues to be canvassed, but how can we be sure that we are going to get a fair go at canvassing those issues, to enable transparency and scrutiny and therefore good administration and good governance to occur, if the department does not do the right thing? 
I am gravely concerned about the behaviour of this department, and I am gravely concerned about the ministers and their apparent lack of nerve and will to ensure that their department provides the Senate with the answers within an appropriate time. Neither of the ministers that handle that department are in this house. One would not want to be accused of being unparliamentary but one has to wonder whether this is a chance for them to ignore a request from the Senate. I hope that is not the situation and I do not want to reflect badly on anyone, but I am very concerned and I think the Senate has a right to be concerned because this is ignoring a request by the committee. It is ignoring something that we have done on behalf of the Senate. It is not good enough on the part of this department, and it needs to do something about it. It does not matter what side of politics you are on, the issue of good governance, scrutiny and transparency is something that we all should hold very dear and regard as very important, because good governance is what makes a democracy work. Ignoring requests and legitimate questions is not the way that good governance takes place.
There are a couple of other health issues that I wish to canvass, one of which I canvassed with the department in December and about which I think I got good answers. It was in relation to an ad that appeared in the Sun-Herald, a Sydney Sunday newspaper, on 28 November—that was the first time I saw it. It was put out by the Sydney Heart Image Adventist Health Group, and it says `Simply the most important advertisement you will ever read'. It goes on to talk about a CT process to scan coronary artery calcium levels, known as the CACS or the coronary artery calcium score. I asked questions about this because I had concerns that this could have been another way of tapping into the public purse for money to prop up the incomes of some of the medical practitioners. I wondered when I read it, having a nursing background, whether advances in the treatment of cardiovascular disease had taken place that I was not aware of. The ad talks about being `good news' and says that this test will show what the calcium levels are within your coronary arteries and that it will be a good marker and indicator for the risk of heart attack. It also says that `prevention is better than cure' and implies that treatment can be undertaken if you have a high coronary artery calcium score. It also tells you what to do if you get bad news, and poses the question `Should I take the test?' It says:
Heart attacks begin to occur in apparently healthy men and women from approximately 40 years of age. If you are over 40 and have one or more of the following:
Cigarette smoking
Family history (close relative experiencing sudden heart attack or stroke)
Borderline or high blood pressure
Borderline or high cholesterol
Diabetes
Menopause 
Obesity and/or a sedentary lifestyle
Chest pains
you should take the test.
It is saying that basically everybody should take the test. Menopause applies to over half the population, therefore they are saying that all women past menopause should take the test. I hasten to add that this is a test that is going to cost you money, and nowhere in this ad does the cost of this appear. 
I asked the department some questions at estimates, and I had some very interesting answers from Dr Primrose and Professor Smallwood. Dr Primrose said:
The coronary artery calcification score is not one of the criteria—
that is, for preventative treatment—
save for a subsidy of lipid lowering drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme ...
He wondered what treatment they were proposing. I do not think anybody would be placed on lipid lowering drugs unless they had a high lipid score as well. There has been so little scientific evidence that has been put up for evaluation that one would not know what to do with a high coronary artery calcification score. 
I might refer to the evidence of Professor Smallwood, who is an eminent physician and can comment better than I could. His comment was:
I would regard the claims as extravagant. I certainly am not aware of any established cardiac units using that index as part of their general assessment of patients. We would need to see a lot more evidence than certainly they are putting up and I think undoubtedly the claims are extravagant.
He repeated that the claims were `extravagant'. So I think that it is very important that people know that the claims being made in these advertisements are, in Professor Smallwood's assessment, extravagant. That assessment is from a gentleman who has a great deal of knowledge and is highly recognised and respected within his profession. The head of the department, Mr Podger, suggested that I might like to refer this to the ACCC and/or the state Health Complaints Commission. I know that the ads soon stopped appearing—until about three weeks ago. They are on again. I have to ask myself why. Is this another way that some radiologists think they can tap into some reasonable money? I have concerns when there is nothing that I know of in medical literature coming out on this, and certainly that observation would appear to be supported by Professor Smallwood, who said on 1 December that they were extravagant claims. This is a screening test and it will cost people money, so I urge people to be very cautious and careful about undertaking this test. If they have concerns about their cardiac state, they should see their GP and have it checked out through some reputable organisation. I had had a high respect for the Adventist Health Group in Sydney, but I now have grave concerns after seeing the ad.
The other issue I wish to canvass today is the issue of immunisation. I strongly support the immunisation of children—in fact, I support the immunisation of everybody against every disease that is possible, because I have actually seen most of those diseases. I have nursed a number of patients with those diseases, sometimes where the patient has died. If anybody ever wants to contract a disease like diphtheria, I suggest that they do not, because a diphtheria death is not particularly pretty. Neither is it pretty to see a six-week-old baby with whooping cough. The immunisation levels within the community are so low that six-week-old babies can get whooping cough and require hospitalisation. I never want to see that. I am concerned about what almost appears to be a pulling back by the federal government from a national program, because there have been some very marked improvements in immunisation in recent years. A couple of years ago, the NHMRC recommended the change from the whole cell whooping cough vaccine in triple antigen to the attenuated part, called DTPA. The NHMRC recommended it, but the minister rejected that recommendation. 
We now have that approved and it is being used. And surprise, surprise: as predicted by the professionals, we are seeing fewer side-effects and fewer reactions and I think we are seeing more parents who are happy to have their children immunised. We are now seeing what is called a multivalent vaccine—that is, the inclusion within the DTPA of hepatitis B—and that is very good. We are seeing vaccines that have the DTPA and Hib. We are also seeing vaccines which are just plain DTPA and a vaccine which is hepatitis B and the HIV vaccine. 
I am very concerned that we do not seem to be able to get a clear answer to both the questions I asked in December, when I did not get clear answers because somebody was away sick from the department that day. I put a lot of questions on notice and these answers came back late, as I said. It was difficult to ask the same series of questions, but basically I had to. I have not been given a clear outline as to what they expect the outcomes to be, nor what they expect the schedule to be, nor what the minister is likely to recommend, save to say that they have changed the word `interchangeable' to the words `equivalent in outcome'. There is a big difference when you are going to be dealing with the differing types of vaccine. I will be critical of that. I am critical of the Department of Health and Aged Care and will remain so until they actually get their act together and start complying with requests from committee hearings for answers.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-04-05,"—I want to speak tonight about the diesel fuel rebate in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1999-2000 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1999-2000. Charges to road transport are accounted in two ways: in access charges and in usage charges. Tonight we will be dealing with usage and tomorrow we will be dealing with access. I understand we will be going into committee and we will have an opportunity to ask the minister questions in relation to some of the additional costs that are being sought from the government to administer this scheme. This scheme represents a hotchpotch deal that was agreed to between the government and the Democrats. I think the Democrats thought that, in some form or other, by agreeing to this scheme they were making some sort of environmental statement. However, as I would like to point out during the course of my speech, I believe that they have failed in a number of significant ways. The most obvious part of this scheme is the fact that Australia is divided into two zones: a conurbation zone and a non-conurbation zone. Vehicles over 4.5 tonnes, whatever their size, will be able to have access to the rebate if they are in the non-conurbation zone, but vehicles between 4.5 tonnes and 20 tonnes will not have access to the rebate.
At the moment, the Australian people are waiting for the government to make the announcement about where and when the zones or the boundaries start and finish. For some months now people in the industry have been involved and have been negotiating with the government to have these lines drawn on the maps. We have been waiting a long time. This scheme is to be introduced in July, only a few months away, and a lot of people need to have their systems in place so that they can ensure that they are going to make the right application for the rebate. It is a ridiculous scheme in the first place because heavy vehicles which should have access to it will be excluded and there are other people who will have access to it who possibly have some sort of question mark about them. I can only conclude that we are waiting for the lines and boundaries to be announced because the government is having a look at its marginal seats to make sure that it is not going to impinge upon people like Larry Anthony and others who are in a zone where they will be impacted upon if the rebate is not accessible to them.
I want to talk about some of the difficulties that have been highlighted by the proposals in the scheme. The first thing is that already, particularly in the construction industry, owners of vehicles that are slightly less than 20 tonnes are being advised by the likes of Boral, Pioneer and others to upgrade their vehicles so that they will be eligible for the rebate scheme when it comes in. That is all well and fine for them, but as I understand it, from the push from the Democrats, their line is that they have this concept about being environmentally conscious and looking after our environment and all the other things you would expect them to say. However, I think what will occur as a result of this encouragement of heavier vehicles in the urban regions is that we will see further congestion, we will see more pavement and bridge repair and we will see more need for parking because this has not been gone into properly by the Democrats. This scheme will encourage heavier vehicles. It will ensure that all those things that they are frightened about with road transport will be impacted upon even greater. I am a bit concerned that this will lead to more of the heavier vehicles operating on suburban roads when we should be trying to make them go on the highways. 
Another aspect of this is that thousands of vehicles will not be eligible for this rebate. They will be paying the 37c per litre, but vehicles outside those conurbations will be paying only 20c per litre. So people who live in the metropolitan areas will have no cost reduction or little cost reduction in the price of goods and services because they have been discriminated against by the government in the proposed scheme.
Another aspect of this scheme is the administration and compliance costs. Lorry owner-drivers, particularly the single operators, are already having to purchase computers, become computer literate, and make sure that their accounting and cross-accounting, and all the other things associated with this, are in order. One of the stated aims of the National Road Transport Commission has been to ensure that there is a reduction in administrative costs for road transport. They believe that if those administrative costs are reduced for road transport, that will have a knock-on effect for the consumer. However, I believe that as a result of the introduction of this scheme, and because of the conurbations for which we are still waiting to find out the divisions and boundary lines, administration costs will actually increase for the transport industry. That will mean that there will not be the flow on to the consumers that the government was hoping would occur. I do not see any evidence that there are going to be anything other than extra administration costs, particularly for the single operator.
The Democrats tried to display that the deal done was some sort of environmentally conscious one, but I feel, as one of my colleagues in the House of Representatives said, that they got done in this deal. I assume that what was behind some of the decision making by the Democrats was that if they are going to keep fuel prices high, they will not only discourage road transport operations but also discourage private car use. Only half of the decision making of people to use their private vehicle is on the basis of either the price of fuel or the level of their own incomes. The major reason for people making a decision about private vehicle use is town planning dimensions. If you have a situation where you have people in increased densities, then you will have less private car use. Where you have urban sprawls, as we have particularly in the Sydney and Melbourne regions, you will encourage people to use their private cars. This deal does not address that at all, because what has happened in this deal is that nearly 80 to 90 per cent of buses in Australia are less than 20 tonnes. No matter what the government or the Democrats say, this is a disincentive for any person to even think about using private or public bus transport.
The average bus size in this country is about 16 tonnes. As a result of a lot of safety and amenity measures that have had to occur over the last few years, the vehicles have actually increased in weight. Disabled access, airconditioning, seat strength and roll-over strength have occurred in the last few years as a result of industry reforms to make travelling safer for bus passengers. However, they will not have access to this rebate. An industry expert, Mr Robert Gunning, whom I saw being questioned at the estimates committee, said that he believed that, as a result of the increases, they will have to increase their fares by about three per cent because they believe that there will be a nine per cent increase in their running costs.
The other interesting aspect of this is that, at the moment, buses do not pay sales tax—they are sales tax exempt. However, as a result of the GST, they will be paying a sales tax. Here we have a deal that has been done between the government and the Democrats which, in one way or another, is meant to try to discourage private car use in this country; but in the built-up areas private bus fares are going to rise. People are going to be discouraged from going onto private buses. That will feed people back onto the road. That will cause further congestion. That will also cause that air and noise pollution that you would think the Democrats would be concerned about. None of this has been addressed by the government in this deal that they have done with the Australian Democrats. As I said earlier, as one of my colleagues quite accurately stated in the House of Representatives: the Democrats obviously got done on this deal, and done badly. This is not environmentally sensitive. This will encourage further private car use, if that is what the Democrats thought was not going to happen. 
In concluding, I want to make a few comments in relation to this scheme as it will continue to evolve. As I understand it, this scheme will end in two years. I think it is going to be replaced by something called an energy credit scheme. What this constitutes I have no idea at the moment. I am not sure whether the government has published any papers on it or not, but I suspect we are going to find people being either punished or penalised for holding onto old vehicles. I make no judgment on this, but Australia has one of the oldest fleets in the OECD. What I think will occur, if this is what the government is up to with the Democrats, is that people will be punished or penalised—and it will be particularly single lorry drivers. They will be the ones who will be penalised by this because they are the ones who are maintaining what would be seen to be less efficient or less popular or less pollution friendly vehicles on the road. I think we will see this occur as a result of the introduction of that scheme.
But there is more and more that the people behind this scheme are up to. Already we have had a situation develop in Tasmania where the NRTC has been trialing what are called global positioning systems. This is a means by which they are looking at mass distance charges for vehicles so that they can implement and charge even heavier costs to the road transport industry and, thus, the consumer. This did not work all that well in Tasmania, as I understand. But that has not stopped the NRTC. They already have what is called an intelligent vehicle trial through their intelligent access project. They are already trying to update and upgrade this scheme, making it more and more clear what they are on about, which is to have what is called electronic road pricing. We already have it in Melbourne, where there are electronic gantries making sure that, on the road that goes to and from the airport, people are charged according to the time they go through. That aspect is being investigated. This was rejected by a lot of the industry back in 1992—mass distance charges. However, somehow or other they are still talking with the NRTC to ensure that that will not come through. There are other things some of these social engineers are considering. There are already papers published on something called a `congestion charge'. We have the Orwellian `tax to reflect the social value of clean air', we have the mass distance charges, and we are also waiting to see what the energy credit scheme will lend itself to.
In 1992 I was one of a number who vigorously opposed the introduction of two zones and two zones of charges in this country. The NRTC and the government representative at the time were very much in favour of having two classes of registration cost in this country: one for New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Canberra and a lesser charge for Queensland, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia. We vigorously resisted the government in that in 1992, and those charges were dropped. However, I am a bit surprised that, at this stage, people in the industry have been prepared to accept zonal charges or conurbation and non-conurbation charges from this government. It is something I think they will live to regret.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-04-05,"—Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1999-2000 in particular and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1999-2000 seek to appropriate moneys from the consolidated revenue fund for the ordinary annual services of governmentthat is, recurrent services, for example, running costs and recurrent expenditure on already established programs. Major additional appropriations in the bills are: the defence department—$740 million needed to cover the government's decision to increase the readiness of the 2nd Brigade to 28 days notice to move; and the Department of the Treasury—$118 million appropriated to the Australian Taxation Office for various costs relating to the implementation of the goods and services tax and related changes to the tax system. One of the major items there was $60 million per year to cover increased administration costs arising from the partial removal of food from the GST base.  
In regard to the Department of Defence, there are a couple of areas that I want to deal with. The first relates to the Defence Housing Authority and the provision of housing to defence personnel. That has the capacity to very significantly affect the overall Defence budget. I have found it very interesting to investigate a range of matters in the provision of housing and how the Defence Housing Authority goes about the provision of housing for defence personnel, particularly in the north of this country—in Townsville, Queensland, and Darwin in the Northern Territory.
The Defence Housing Authority has a very important responsibility and one that was, in many respects, neededthat is, to upgrade housing for defence personnel because that has been in much need of an upgrade since the early eighties. I therefore do not want to reflect on the right—indeed, it is a deserved right—of defence personnel to have appropriate housing, at least to community standard. In the past they have not had that. But I have to say that, in recent times, the operation of the Defence Housing Authority in striving to meet this objective seems to have swung the pendulum in terms of the quality of housing. Indeed, it seems to have gone way past what I understand to be Defence's objective in the provision of housing to its personnel. The Defence Housing Authority operates in effect as a government business enterprise and operates on commercial grounds. In doing so, it is not really able to determine whether it is a private sector company operating purely out of a profit motive or whether its principal motive is, as it should be, the provision of housing for defence personnel.
Some of the more recent issues that have come to notice, particularly in Townsville and Darwin, relate to the provision of housing and the Defence Housing Authority as a player in the housing market per se. The Defence Housing Authority either constructs houses on a contract basis on land that it has acquired or buys housing land packages, or from time to time it can rent from the private rental market. The opportunity has developed for the Defence Housing Authority's influence in certain markets in certain places to possibly distort what would otherwise be the market rent and housing costs. The Defence Housing Authority is in a unique position where it buys or builds houses or apartments and then offers them for sale to the private sector. On top of that, when it sells those properties to the private sector, be they individuals or private companies, it offers with them a lease-back program, which is for a minimum of six years and can be up to 12 years with guaranteed levels of income.
In many instances you might say that is of no real effect but, in a market where the provision of housing is so important for defence personnel, it can have an impact on the general market rates and the cost of housing. I would argue that that has been the case in Darwin, and it has been possibly the case in Townsville. No other developer, as such, in the private marketplace is able to offer the types of rental agreements, lease-back agreements, that defence housing is able to offer.
How does this affect the defence budget? Where we have the Defence Housing Authority building or proposing to build or purchase apartments or houses that are, as I said, potentially above what would be the normal public standard and at a cost which is significantly high, the rentals attached to them would be in excess of $500 a week. My information is that the Department of Defence itself, and rightly so, provides a rental subsidy. Defence personnel do pay a level of rent depending on their rank, and that ranges from around $100 a week—and this is the soldier's contribution—through to somewhere in the order of $170 a week for a high ranking officer. Where the rent is over and above that, the Department of Defence subsidises that. I have no disagreement with that. It should. But the worry is the level at which it ultimately has to subsidise that housing.
The Department of Defence, as I understand it, has a cut-off point of around $300 per week. If you were a mid-ranking officer, for instance, renting one of the new high-rise apartments that the Defence Housing Authority purchased in Darwin--and the rent indicated for those properties is up to $525 per week--you would be likely to pay around $146 per week, leaving the remainder to be picked up by the Department of Defence, which is more than $300 a week. It is very important that the Defence Housing Authority and, in particular, the Department of Defence have a very long hard look at it and that the Department of Defence very specifically sets down the guidelines for the Defence Housing Authority in the provision of housing. 
It is worth noting that the Defence Housing Authority, in appearing before the Joint Committee on Public Works, proposed to purchase some 50 house and land packages in Parap Grove in Darwin to the tune of around $17 million. Those house and land packages were put to the Public Works Committee as being essential for the provision of housing for defence personnel in Darwin. It subsequently turned out, following questioning from the Public Works Committee, that somehow this $17 million purchase was not needed—it was too expensive, because they were some of the concerns that the Public Works Committee raised, and it was no longer necessary to meet the housing needs of Defence in Darwin. You are talking about 50 houses here.
They also proposed to build, I think, three 12-storey apartment blocks in Carey Street in Darwin. The argument put to the committee was that those apartments were going to be three- and four-bedroom apartments because that was the requirement Defence had given the Defence Housing Authority. It was going to cost in the order of $30-odd million. Again, the rental rates that would have had to have been paid for those would have certainly exceeded, I think, the $300 a week subsidy that the Department of Defence would pay because, as was put to the committee, some of the rents would be in excess of $500 a week.
I reiterate that I think that the soldiers and the people associated with defending this country, our defence personnel, have every right to expect housing of a reasonable community standard. We should not deny them that, and they have every right to expect some form of subsidy towards their rent because they play a very important role and are often placed in very difficult circumstances in the service that they provide to this country. But we also have a responsibility to ensure that an authority that is charged with the responsibility of providing housing to them does so in a way that ensures the best return for the taxpayers' dollar. It is worth noting that Defence has not been without its difficulties from a budgetary point of view in a whole range of areas. This is but one. I notice that a most recent Audit Office report has raised concerns in another area. Again, that is why we need to monitor this very closely, and we should.
Another aspect of this relates to the implementation of the GST. Much has been said about the GST. Much was claimed by the government both before and after the last federal election. This was, in their words, a new tax package that would deliver benefits for all Australians--benefits such as cheaper cars, cheaper petrol, cheaper this, cheaper that. It would be easily implemented, cost-effective and for business it would be a boon. Earlier today I went to a question with regard to the Yellow Pages business index, which very clearly identified that small business does not think things are going too well. Indeed, I asked a question earlier today about how the tax office was going in meeting its obligation in terms of the money it has been allocated under these appropriation bills to achieve its objective of getting everything in place for the commencement of the GST on 1 July. In particular, I went to the question of Australian business number registrations and how many had been processed, et cetera. 
To put this into some context I might read in part a statement issued by the tax office, by the commissioner. One aspect of this relates to the `reply in five'that is, if you provide written advice the `reply in five' will deliver the world's best practice administration to ensure that all taxpayers receive the support they need in the transition to the new tax system. In effect it says: `If you email or ring up, you can get a reply in five.' I tried to test that out and sent in a query to the `reply in five' on 27 March. To date, I have not received a response. I was reading a letter to the editor in the Mercury, a Tasmanian newspaper, that really summed it up for a lot of small business people. It is headed `GSTeed off':  
I have recently set up a new small business. Wanting to do things properly, I heeded the Federal Government's advice and registered for the new tax system early. Tax Commissioner Carmody says--
he is quoting from a previous report in the Mercury of 25 March--
`I want to reassure businesses that we are absolutely on target to issue all ABNs received by the 31 May deadline before the July 1 start of the new tax system.' 
Well Mr Carmody you are going to have to burn the midnight oil if my experience is anything to go by. 
My application was mailed early December. Having received no notification of my number today (14 weeks later) I telephoned the 1300 number to check its progress. 
During what seemed an eternity as I waded through the recorded information and listened to the lovely music I was encouraged by the news that `applications are taking 28 days to process at present'. 
When I finally got to speak to a live human being—although his enthusiasm suggested he was little more than a robot—we spent a long time while he went back and forth to his computer searching for the status of my application. At one point I was told applications can take up to seven weeks; at another, when the robot had apparently forgotten to switch me back to the lovely music, I heard him muttering `I am sick of this f... silly system.' 
Well, I'm sick of it too Mr Carmody. I was finally advised by your robot that my enquiry would be logged on the computer and `if you don't hear anything within ten days or so call us back on this same 1300 number and if we haven't located it you will have to fill in another application.' 
This incensed me. Why should I have to ring? It's your `f... silly system' that's caused the problem. You ring me when you've fixed it. 
By my estimate 10 days from today (March 27) plus 56 days to process my replacement application takes us into June and with the rush of last minute applications the department is receiving I don't hold out much hope of seeing an ABN or GST guide before 1 July. 
So much for assurances, Mr Carmody. I think you've been rubbing shoulders with too many politicians. 
He is right. He has probably been rubbing shoulders with the minister for no answers, Rod Kemp. Insofar as ABNs are concerned, we know that just two months ago there were over one million applications. Of these, only 757,500 notifications have been issued out of the 2.5 million possible estimate of ABN registrations. We do not know how many of those are interim ABNs. Therefore, until we know all of those things we do not know whether the money appropriated in this bill is ever going to be enough to actually cover the cost of the implementation of this tax system—this tax system that was supposed to be so simple. We will never know--sorry, we will know; we will find out. I suspect that the cost will be very much higher. It will be interesting to see how the government deals with applications that have been given interim status and are proved to be ultimately wrong as so much information is still missing regarding what the ongoing cost is going to be. The government has a long way to go on this issue. I just hope for the sake of small business people and for Australians generally that they start to get some things right.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-04-05,"—I wish to make a short but important contribution to this second reading debate this evening on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1999-2000. I say `important' because the matter I want to address is the future of a scheme that underpins no less than 1,600 jobs in the state of Tasmania. That scheme is the Tasmanian Wheat Freight Subsidy Scheme. Senators may recall that the government was forced to extend the operation of this scheme early last year. It was forced to do so by pressure from those industries directly dependent on the scheme. In addition, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association and, of course, the Labor Party during the last federal election secured an extension for the Tasmanian Wheat Freight Subsidy Scheme. However, according to the then responsible minister, Mr Vaile, in a media statement dated 19 February 1999, the scheme was to be extended only until the new taxation system was operating. I would like the current minister, Mr Truss, to confirm that February statement. What I would like to know, what I think the Senate would like to know, and what, I am sure, those affected Tasmanian industries and their employees would want to know is whether or not this small but essential scheme will end on 1 July this year.   
I would like to remind the Senate of the role that this scheme plays. It subsidises the transportation cost of bulk grain, which underpins a number of key Tasmanian industries: the chicken industry, the stockfeed industry, the bakery industry and the pork industry. These industries employ directly and indirectly approximately 1,600 employees. I am sure that I do not have to say that, with the multiplier effect, 1,600 employees would mean that there are a great deal more Tasmanian people employed as a spin-off from the employment of those 1,600. 
I assume that Mr Truss will attempt to argue that the changed tax arrangements scheduled to come into effect on 1 July this year will remove the freight disadvantage facing those Tasmanian industries. That appears to be the position that the previous minister, Mr Vaile, took in that February media release that I referred to. I must say that I assume that that press release was underpinned by a detailed financial analysis of the benefits of the current system to those industries compared with the impact of the new taxation system on their costs. If there is such an analysis, then I for one would like to see it. I am sure that the chicken industry, the pork industry, the stockfeed industry and the baking industry would also like to see that documentation. If there is no such financial analysis, then I assume that such a financial analysis will be completed, and completed well before 1 July this year. I think it is important that all those industries that rely on the Tasmanian Wheat Freight Subsidy Scheme are properly consulted about the scheme's future before it disappears or, indeed, before any changes are made to it. I look forward to a commitment from the minister, Mr Truss, that he will not take any action that will significantly disadvantage those key Tasmanian employers.
Let me say that there has been a great deal of debate about the basis of the government's calculations on the inflation effect of the GST, for instance, promises that it will have no effect on the cost of petrol in rural and regional Australia. Those calculations have been demonstrated to be quite wrong. So I think it is important that, if the government intends to axe this scheme from 1 July—which I must say is the only conclusion that can be drawn from the media release of the then minister, the Hon. Mark Vaile, on 19 February 1999—there ought to be certainty in the community that there will not be a catastrophic effect on employment. My office has been in touch with people representing some of those industries, and at this stage they are not so convinced. They are of the view that the maintenance of the scheme in the coming environment that they are aware of is critical to the maintenance of jobs in my state. Again, I look forward to a commitment from the minister, Mr Truss, that he will not take any action that will significantly disadvantage those key Tasmanian employers.
Whilst I am on my feet, I have one other comment on another matter. There has been some comment in the media quoting Mr Dick Smith on problems with air space in the state of Tasmania, alleging that there were great dangers involved in the current air space management scheme. Mr Smith visited my office quite some time ago. I have not been able to locate the date in my diary, but I think it is about two years ago. 
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator O'Brien, does this relate to the bills before the Senate?
—It does in the sense that it is to do with the financing of the operations of government. I will be very brief, Mr Acting Deputy President. In my office, Mr Smith indicated that what was needed was actually a downgrading of the management of air space, not an upgrading. I found suggestions that there was not a sufficient scheme in place at this time to fly entirely in the face of suggestions that what was needed was the closing down of the air traffic control towers, for example, at Launceston Airport, so that the location specific costs which ought to apply to that airport would not make landing at the airport too expensive. I really do think that there has been a great lack of consistency by Mr Smith and it is no wonder that his comments have been attacked by the leaseholders of the airport. I do not think that they can be given any weight at all. ",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2000-04-05,"—I rise today to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1999-2000 with regards to defence and the allocation of almost $800 million to the Department of Defence in that bill. From what I can tell of the bill, the allocation does not include provision for the continuing problem of the impact that changes to the fringe benefits tax will have on defence service personnel, despite government promises to the contrary. The particular impact of the government's A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Tax Reporting) Bill on defence personnel is unfair and unjust in the extreme. The legislation requires employers to report fringe benefits on the group certificates of individual employees, impacting on child support, HECS and superannuation surcharge liabilities and on the entitlements to family payments.
This issue was raised in the Senate and the House of Representatives in August last year and attracted considerable debate. At that time, opposition members expressed their concerns that the changes to the fringe benefits tax would hit defence personnel very hard and very unfairly. It was very clear to us that unless defence personnel were granted an exemption many of them would face increased child support payments, an increased superannuation liability and decreased family payments because of this requirement. Defence personnel themselves were shocked to learn in mid-1999 that the government had failed to exempt them from these requirements. They pointed out, and rightly so, that the fringe benefits they receive, like subsidised housing and free recreation leave travel, compensate them for the inherent hardships of service life such as being compulsorily posted away from their home city or town. It was absurd for the government to imply that compensation measures for the hardships of service life were simply perks or examples of tax minimisation. When it was revealed in the official Army newspaper of 27 May 1999 that ADF married quarters housing would be reported on soldiers' group certificates as being worth $17,669 a year, they were further outraged. Adding such an amount to their pay would clearly have a massive impact on soldiers' liability for child support payments and their eligibility for family payments.
After growing unrest from defence personnel and a strong campaign by the opposition to address these problems, the Minister for Defence, Mr John Moore, and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, Mr Bruce Scott, announced on 19 August 1999 that housing assistance provided to Australian Defence Force personnel would be `totally exempt from FBT reporting requirements'. In making the announcement, Minister Moore said:
The Government's decision reflects the fact that Defence provides housing assistance to personnel, not as part of their remuneration package, but to allow us to send ADF personnel wherever they are required to serve.
Minister Scott said in the same media release:
The decision to exempt housing assistance provided to ADF personnel in Australia applies to ADF personnel who are subject to the Defence Force Discipline Act (1982) and who must serve wherever the Government demands ... 
As a result of today's announcement, the amounts paid by Defence for housing assistance for ADF personnel will not be reported on individuals' Group Certificates.
...  ...  ...
By totally exempting the ADF members' housing assistance from the reporting measure, the Federal Government has addressed the primary concerns of ADF families ...
The Federal Government has addressed the concerns of Defence families about major losses to take-home pay due to the loss of Government benefits and increased payments such as child support.
At the time, that sounded like a step in the right direction. But subsequent Senate estimates hearings and correspondence from serving defence personnel raised doubts about whether the government had indeed totally exempted housing assistance to defence personnel from its FBT reporting requirements. One of the areas where the government has broken its promise to totally exempt housing from the FBT relates to the eligibility of defence personnel to receive family payments that are provided by Centrelink. The housing assistance paid to defence personnel is being used when Centrelink calculates their eligibility for family payments. Because of this, some personnel are now totally ineligible for any assistance, while others have had their benefit reduced.  
As a result of the doubts raised, the shadow minister for defence science and personnel, Mr Laurie Ferguson, wrote separately to the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, Mr Scott, to clarify this situation. He particularly sought clarification as to the exact impact that subsidised accommodation now had on defence personnel's eligibility for family payments and on any potential child support liability. In relation to family payments provided by Centrelink, the shadow minister received a reply from Senator Newman's chief of staff, Rod Nockles, dated 20 January 2000. It said:
... from 1 July 2000, housing benefits received by Defence Force families will have no effect on family assistance ... Centrelink will, therefore, need to collect relevant information until FA (Family Allowance) is replaced by the Family Tax Benefit in July 2000.
This means that until 1 July housing assistance will continue to be taken into account in determining the eligibility of defence personnel for family payments. The assessment of child support liabilities is even more confusing. Senator Newman's office supplied the shadow defence science and personnel minister, Mr Laurie Ferguson, with this advice regarding how defence housing assistance would impact on child support liabilities. The letter said:
Employer provided benefits are not currently considered in determining child support liabilities, unless the payee requests that they be included under a departure from the formula. From 1 July 2000, fringe benefits will be taken into account, although Defence housing benefits and certain other allowances will be exempt. 
That information from Senator Newman seemed to clear up the situation somewhat, until Mr Ferguson received totally different advice from the office of Mr Bruce Scott, the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. On the very same issue, a letter dated 16 March 2000 from Mr Scott's defence adviser, Brad Fuller, said:
Although housing assistance will be excluded from FBT reporting, it may at any time be considered by the Child Support Agency (CSA) in child support assessments. The amount of child support that individuals are required to contribute to the support of their children is unrelated to the ADF exclusions from FBT reporting and is a matter that should be addressed through the CSA.
This is absolutely outrageous. We have here two ministers giving conflicting advice on matters that are of concern to the 70,000 serving defence personnel. One wonders on this side of the chamber if the ministers on the other side of the chamber actually talk to each other. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-04-05,"—Earlier today, I outlined some matters relating to the Trust Bank in Tasmania and went to the question as to why there is a need for a full investigation of those matters. However, the time did not permit me to address some of those issues in a more complete context. As I said earlier, I have been accused of pursuing falsehoods, conducting a vendetta or not pursuing the matters through the appropriate avenues. Nothing could be further from the truth in that respect because I made every effort to do it, as I said earlier, including a visit to the Reserve Bank Governor.
The circumstances are very clear as to why there is a need for a full investigation. This bank, even by the admission of its own chairman, was going to hit the wall, and the only explanation for why it was going to do that is that the management were not up to it or were, at the very least, negligent or incompetent or grossly negligent. I want to go to the critical issues surrounding this bank because, unfortunately, the state and the Premier are saying that an inquiry can prove nothing, can do nothing and that all of the allegations that have been raised either have been answered in the past or are simply the outcome of people trying to create confusion. Let me try to clear up the confusion surrounding these matters for the very few people who seem to be confused about them.  
I will go to one matter in the first instance, and that relates to the employment of Mr David Airey by the Trust Bank board. Mr Airey started work at the Trust Bank in April 1999 on a salary package of $425,000 per year and a contract, as I understand it, for three years. He was brought to the bank—and I use his own words—`for the purposes of finding a 49 per cent equity partner'. He, in his own words, said very clearly: `When I got there the float was not on.' To me that means—and, I think, to most Tasmanians it means—that the board at some time prior to Mr Airey's start had determined that, for whatever reason, the float, which was part of the 1997 legislation, was not on. But they probably did negotiate with Mr Airey prior to his commencement date a contract relating to his employment and it was quite possible that it did include a 1½ per cent share option should the bank go to a share float. To use Mr Airey's words, when he got there the float was not on, so you would have thought that the board would have said to Mr David Airey on day one, `We have decided that the share float is not an option. We therefore need to speak with you about a part of the agreement that we have with you,' and clarified and removed what was an ultimate payment of $1.2 million to this person for zip, for squat. He got $425,000 a year for three years and seven months plus $1.2 million for a 1½ per cent share option for a share float that never occurred. That needs to be explained. That allegation ought to be addressed. It ought to be investigated because, as I said, the dates do not stack up. 
I will now turn to the second date. Mr Airey says—and I think this was confirmed by Mr Gerald Loughran, the chairman of the board—that he and consultants informed the board in June of 1999, just two months after he started, that the 49 per cent equity partner option was not a goer and that the only way to go was a 100 per cent sale option. What is interesting about that is that on 8 October 1999 the state Treasurer issued a press release saying that he had agreed to a further two-month extension for the bank board to continue to seek an equity partner. Yet, by all accounts, the board had determined in June that it was not going to seek an equity partner. And there is another date: August 1999, when—probably, according to board minutes—they may well have been some way down the road in their negotiations with a potential 100 per cent owner. On top of that, as I said before, in the 1998 Trust Bank annual report the chairman said that they employed an international investment bank to advise them on the equity issue. Nobody has been told who that investment bank was, how much it cost and what advice it gave and when it gave that advice to the bank, in particular the board.
It is abundantly clear to all but a few that the management of this bank was in disarray; indeed, probably worse than that—in my view, it was worse than that. But what I find almost unexplainable is the legislation that went to the question of indemnifying the former officers of the Trust Bank. It has been said that they have been indemnified against the performance or non-performance of their duties. But not only that—the legislation actually stops any court action. The legislation says: `No action in any court or tribunal may be commenced.' That means you cannot commence any action unless you are able to establish one of two things or both; that is, that the officers of the bank have acted in a fraudulent way or have been grossly negligent. That is a greater indemnification than was offered by the bank to its own officers when it insured them for indemnity. 
The fact of the matter is: you cannot even pursue these people under the Corporations Law, as you could when they worked for the bank and the bank had them indemnified. You cannot pursue them for issues that relate to matters of trust and the upholding of their responsibilities under various other legislation, including the Corporations Law. That is grossly unfair. All I am saying is that the law is the law, and there were laws that were applicable to these people. If they have breached those laws, the Tasmanian public have a right to have the laws applied. They should get nothing less than that. I hope the Tasmanian people will write to their state and federal parliamentarians and ask them for this matter to be pursued, because it is not right that the state lost over $200 million as a result of a debacle by so few people who were paid so much.
