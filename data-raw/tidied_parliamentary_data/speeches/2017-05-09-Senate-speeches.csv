Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (12:40):  Labor supports the Biosecurity Amendment (Ballast Water and Other Measures) Bill 2017 to ensure that Australia is fully legislatively compliant with the ballast water convention when it comes into force internationally on 8 September 2017. Each year, around 200 million tonnes of ships' ballast water is discharged in Australian ports from 13,000 ship visits from some 600 overseas ports. Australia is particularly vulnerable to biosecurity incursions, as many cargo ships arrive here without cargo, meaning that they require large quantities of ballast water to stabilise the vessel. Labor understands the importance of our biosecurity systems and that a strong biosecurity regime will contribute to our economy. Australia's reputation as a clean, green and safe producer of food is due to our strong biosecurity systems.


In 2008, Labor commissioned an independent review of Australia's quarantine and biosecurity arrangements. One biosecurity: a working partnership, the report of what was also known as the Beale review, found that Australia's biosecurity system operated well but could be improved. The Beale review proposed significant reforms to strengthen the system by revising legislation; targeting resources to the areas of greatest return from a risk management perspective; sharing responsibility between government, businesses and the community; and improving transparency, timeliness and operations across the continuum. It also recommended that the Commonwealth should extend its legislative reach to cover the field with respect to international and domestic ballast water regulation. In 2012, Labor introduced a new biosecurity bill to replace the century-old Quarantine Act to ensure that Australia was able to deal with new biosecurity threats. It included legislative changes with respect to the management of international and domestic ballast water. Sadly, the bill lapsed at the dissolution of the 43rd Parliament.


When the current government re-introduced the Biosecurity Bill in the 44th Parliament, it excluded the requirement to ensure that Australia was fully legislatively compliant with the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments, or the ballast water convention. The government's reasoning was that, until the ballast water convention comes into force on 8 September 2017, a more flexible transitional scheme should be in place to allow vessels to meet the requirements of the proposed biosecurity legislation through ballast water exchange without making it mandatory for all vessels to have a ballast water treatment system. This gave businesses the flexibility to choose their most cost-effective option to meet the requirements.


However, the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources stated in his speech on this bill that, in addition to the risks posed by recent outbreaks of zika virus, there is also the potential that 'invasive and harmful aquatic organisms, such as white spot in prawns, can be transported in ballast water'. On the basis of the agriculture minister's reasoning, the current government's decision that it was better to give businesses more flexibility to choose their own most cost-effective option in meeting requirements of the ballast water convention may have caused the prawn industry irreparable damage. The Department of Agriculture is investigating the current outbreak of white spot disease in prawns that has destroyed the prawn industry in the Logan River area, and the Senate inquiry will further investigate the biosecurity failings.


The government has also come to the opposition with some eleventh-hour amendments to the bill. The minister's office has provided clarification regarding this amendment, and Labor accepts that it is a small drafting error that removes any doubt about the intent of a provision that exempts Australian and foreign vessels from committing an offence of discharge of ballast water in Australian waters if certain conditions are fulfilled, mainly that the discharge is part of an acceptable ballast water exchange and there is an approved discharge to the ballast water reception facility.


Schedule 2 of the bill relates to additional vector management powers that are needed under the Biosecurity Act to ensure Australia is not left vulnerable to significant human health risks. The need for these powers is demonstrated by raising global detections of mosquito-borne zika virus. The bill seeks to reduce the likelihood of incursions of vectors that could pose a human health concern and provides powers to manage potential incursions when they are detected. The Department of Health has worked with state and territory counterparts and communicable disease experts to ensure the amendments address contemporary public health concerns posed by exotic mosquitoes. These amendments will be supported by nationally consistent arrangements to support collaboration across different levels of government.


When ballast water is taken up, as I have mentioned, the marine organisms can be picked up with it and then released when the ballast is discharged, and, because of this, ballast water is recognised as a major source of the spread of marine pests around the world, including pests such as bacteria, small invertebrates, eggs, cysts and larvae of various species. It has been estimated that 10,000 different species are moved around the world in ballast water tanks each day. Introduced marine pests can cause serious environmental and economic damage—for example, an invasion in Australia of the Northern Pacific seastar was introduced to my home state of Tasmania through ballast water from Japan in the 1980s and to Victoria through ballast water in the 1990s. It has reduced shellfish production in Tasmania and has damaged marine ecosystems in both locations.


I want to take a few moments of the Senate's time to read an article from Dr Louise Goggin. Dr Goggin began her career as a marine biologist, and I quote from an article that she has written about the seastar:


From my window in Hobart, I look out over the Derwent River. It's a fantastic view across the slate-grey sea. But below the tranquil surface of the Derwent, there is a battle raging between the locals and some aggressive new arrivals - northern Pacific seastars. The first of these seastars probably arrived as stowaways on ships from Japan about 20 years ago. They thrived in the cool Tasmanian waters and bred so furiously that there are now almost 30 million of them in the estuary.


The seastars could not have made the trip unaided because currents do not carry them this way. They were brought here in ships. The young seastars, swimming near the surface, were probably sucked up with tonnes of water, used as ballast to stabilise empty vessels. A single vessel can take 70,000 tonnes of ballast water - enough to fill 32 Olympic swimming pools and carry millions of young seastars.


The seastars would not have been alone - each day, around 3000 marine organisms are transported around the globe in the ballast water of ocean-going vessels. These invaders, along with the ballast water, are dumped at their destination to make way for precious cargo. In 1993, 121 million tonnes of ballast water were dumped into Australian ports - equal to one quarter the volume of water in Sydney Harbour. That's a lot of stowaways. Many of them will not survive the voyage, but those that do can settle in their new homes and, if conditions are right (as they were for the northern Pacific seastars), form plagues.


The northern Pacific seastars flourished because they left behind their natural predators, parasites and competitors. And they aren't fussy eaters.


The Labor Party will be supporting this bill that we have before us today, and we do so to ensure that Australia is fully compliant with the ballast water convention, which, as I have said, comes into force on 8 September this year. We also do so because the Labor Party supports strengthening ballast water management. The definition of ballast water management is that it provides that ballast water management has the same meaning as it does in the ballast water convention, which currently provides:


… mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological processes, either singularly or in combination, to remove, render harmless, or avoid the uptake or discharge of Harmful Aquatic Organisms and Pathogens within Ballast Water and Sediments.


As I have said, each year around 200 million tonnes of ballast water is discharged into Australian ports by over 13,000 ship visits from over 600 overseas ports. Australia is particularly vulnerable to biosecurity incursions, and I have outlined some of those. The story about the sea star and what has happened in Tasmania is of particular concern, and also, of course, there is what happened in Victoria.


Labor support this bill because we understand the importance of our biosecurity system and that strong biosecurity will contribute to our economy. Australia's reputation as a clean, green and safe producer of food is because of our strong biosecurity systems. However, we always have to be vigilant, and Labor will always support legislation that provides for a strong biosecurity system. I mentioned the Beale report, which was commissioned by a former Labor government. The Beale report recommended that the Commonwealth should extend its legislative reach to cover the field with respect to international and domestic ballast water regulation. We are very pleased to be able to support this bill. We ask that the Senate consider the bill and support it, as the Labor Party is doing here today.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-05-09,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (12:53):  Food quality in particular and our biosecurity in general are extremely important to the people of Australia and the people of Queensland. As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to make some comments in support of the Biosecurity Amendment (Ballast Water and Other Measures) Bill 2017, but also to raise a significant issue that we have learnt about. Our rural sector is under pressure, so we need this biosecurity bill to provide some security for the rural sector in particular and for Australians in general. Our serious concerns refer to item 6, to change section 9 of the Biosecurity Act, which changes the definition of 'ballast water convention'. The proposed amendment adds the words 'as enforced from time to time' to the convention definition. I must say that alarm bells rang for us in One Nation when we read that amendment as we have a fundamental distrust for United Nations conventions and agencies. The idea of supporting a bill that prospectively binds Australia to future amendments to a United Nations convention is enough to give us serious doubts.


Honourable senators will not be surprised to learn that we immediately sought advice from Minister Joyce's office about the provision. The advice we received is that section 9 means what it says, namely that if the ballast water convention is amended in the future then that amended convention is the one to which the Biosecurity Act will refer. Of course, any amendment to the convention must, however, be ratified by Australia before it becomes binding on our country, and this is the reassurance I have received from Minister Joyce's office. No changes will be made to the convention without the proposals being agreed to by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, following a detailed inquiry and analysis of the implications of the changes.


I am further advised by the minister's office that no changes to the ballast water convention will be made without Australia's approval, and those changes will then be incorporated into Australian law by legislation passed by this parliament. The legislation currently before the Senate, and which One Nation senators are intending to support, cannot be altered by the United Nations without the approval of the Australian parliament. Our senators will not tolerate giving the United Nations a blank cheque on any matter, especially one as important as seawater ballast, nor will it cede sovereignty of our country to the United Nations. On this basis alone, One Nation senators will support section 9 of the bill. As I said, we had serious concerns about the automatic amendment provision in item 6, section 9, but we have been reassured by the minister that it will still need to be passed through and ratified by this parliament independently.


We are particularly concerned about the United Nations. I have said in the past, on repeated occasions, that we need to exit from the United Nations. We are concerned because the United Nations has become a trojan horse for destroying national sovereignty around the world. One Nation senators were in unity when we toured the Murray-Darling Basin last week. We learned a lot and we saw the impact of United Nations regulations being pushed through the Murray-Darling Basin, driving the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, along with the grubby interstate politics that is pushing that plan. We will be having much more to say about the Murray-Darling Basin in coming weeks, once we complete our research. We know that farmers in particular are under threat from having their property rights seized and removed. We know that they are under pressure from overregulation and energy prices, as is small business in our country. We also know that farmers are facing pressure from banks. Yet we have apparently signed more than 7,000 treaties! And we know that the United Nations' Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, or the 'Agenda 21' as it is known, which was signed by Paul Keating's government in 1992, is undermining the sovereignty of this country.


We support the government in its bill to improve biosecurity. This is needed to protect the key competitive advantage we have in the rural sector—the quality of our rural products. But we make it clear that we do not accept any ceding of our country's sovereignty to any foreign body. It would be ironic indeed, would it not, if we protected the biosecurity and then failed to protect the security of the people of Australia. So, with our qualification on item 6, section 9, we will be supporting this bill.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-05-09,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:59):  The Biosecurity Amendment (Ballast Water and Other Measures) Bill 2017 amends the Biosecurity Act 2015 to further strengthen Australia's biosecurity system and grant further powers to manage biosecurity risk. This bill is consistent with the Australian government's commitment to ensure biosecurity risks are fully managed and biosecurity systems remain effective to changing biosecurity and human health risks.


Protecting our enviable pest and disease status is an ongoing challenge. Biosecurity risks are changing significantly and growing in complexity. In 2014, the CSIRO identified megatrends expected to impact biosecurity in the future, such as growth in global food demand and markets, and increased movement of goods, vessels and people around the world. The government is responding to this challenge. Agricultural industries are a large contributor to the Australian economy and it is essential to protect them and our export markets by keeping them free of pests and diseases. We cannot afford not to.


Commonwealth funding for biosecurity has increased since 2012-13. The total expenditure this financial year for biosecurity is $749 million. This is an increase of $145.5 million, or 24 per cent, since 2012-13. The total investment in biosecurity to date, since 2013-14, is $2.72 billion. This includes funding of up to $200 million under the ag white paper, specifically for the purpose of improving biosecurity. This investment is being used to strengthen biosecurity surveillance, increase scientific capability, improve information systems and analytical capacity, and build community-based engagement.


The bill also builds on the Biosecurity Act 2015, which this government delivered. It focuses on measures in relation to ballast water management for ships and provides additional powers to control exotic vectors carrying harmful human diseases. The ballast water measures will provide additional protection for coastal environments from the risk of marine pest incursion by legislating for the use of more-effective ballast water treatment technologies. These additional powers are needed under the Biosecurity Act to ensure that Australia is not left vulnerable to significant human health risks. The bill seeks to reduce the likelihood of incursions of vectors that could pose human health concerns and provides powers to manage potential incursions when they are detected. The need for these powers is clearly demonstrated by the rising global detections of the mosquito-borne zika virus.


The bill will also position Australia to ratify the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments by introducing a nationally consistent approach to ballast water, in line with the requirements of the convention. We do not lose any powers of control by the ratification. In fact, we gain international consistency in the management of ballast water. The convention was first signed by the Howard government, in 2005. It is an important global initiative involving over 50 countries, representing over 53 per cent of the world's merchant fleet shipping tonnage. Australia was a driving force and played a leading role in the development of the convention, and it is important that we ratify it ahead of its entry into force on 8 September this year to uphold our positive international reputation for biosecurity management. It is worth noting that the convention also makes special provision for the Great Barrier Reef.


Ballast water is now recognised as a major source of the spread of exotic marine pests around the world. Each year, around 200 million tonnes of ships' ballast water is discharged into Australian ports by 18,000 ships visiting from some 600 overseas ports. Australia is particularly vulnerable as many cargo ships arrive here without cargo and, therefore, with a large quantity of ballast water which needs to be discharged when filling ships with our exports to the global marketplace. If the organisms that arrive are surviving the transport and discharge process, they may become established in the environment and populations may flourish. The Northern Pacific sea star, for example, is a major pest introduced into Australia by ballast water.


While Australia has had, since 2001, ballast water management requirements to prevent new marine pests arriving in Australia, domestic movements are not subject to ballast water regulation, excepting for vessels arriving in Victoria from other domestic ports around Australia. This bill will enable a comprehensive set of domestic ballast water management arrangements to be put in place to lower the risk of marine pests being spread through ballast water between parts of our pristine coastline. Ships will be required to have ballast water management plans while in Australian waters and to discharge ballast water in accordance with the convention. This will reduce the risk of invasive marine pests entering Australian waters, as well as between Australian ports. Additionally, it will protect Australia's vulnerable fisheries industries and environment by reducing the risk of potential invasion and of harmful aquatic organisms being introduced into Australia's marine ecosystem. The bill will further strengthen our strong biosecurity system.


With expanding international and maritime trade it is in Australia's interest to implement more-uniform and stringent requirements to manage the risk of vessels introducing marine pests into Australian waters. It is also in Australia's interest to continue to reduce the likelihood of incursions of vectors, such as mosquitoes, that could pose human health concerns, and to provide powers to manage potential incursions when they are detected. These amendments mean there is much less risk of viruses, including viruses such as zika, carried by vectors such as mosquitoes being established. They also mean our unique marine life will be better protected.


Finally, can I reinforce—and reaffirm to Senator Roberts—that the rules around making any changes to the convention will be subject to the usual treaty-making procedures and parliamentary scrutiny. Can I thank the opposition and the crossbench for their support of this bill and commend the bill to the house.

 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:59):  The Biosecurity Amendment (Ballast Water and Other Measures) Bill 2017 amends the Biosecurity Act 2015 to further strengthen Australia's biosecurity system and grant further powers to manage biosecurity risk. This bill is consistent with the Australian government's commitment to ensure biosecurity risks are fully managed and biosecurity systems remain effective to changing biosecurity and human health risks.


Protecting our enviable pest and disease status is an ongoing challenge. Biosecurity risks are changing significantly and growing in complexity. In 2014, the CSIRO identified megatrends expected to impact biosecurity in the future, such as growth in global food demand and markets, and increased movement of goods, vessels and people around the world. The government is responding to this challenge. Agricultural industries are a large contributor to the Australian economy and it is essential to protect them and our export markets by keeping them free of pests and diseases. We cannot afford not to.


Commonwealth funding for biosecurity has increased since 2012-13. The total expenditure this financial year for biosecurity is $749 million. This is an increase of $145.5 million, or 24 per cent, since 2012-13. The total investment in biosecurity to date, since 2013-14, is $2.72 billion. This includes funding of up to $200 million under the ag white paper, specifically for the purpose of improving biosecurity. This investment is being used to strengthen biosecurity surveillance, increase scientific capability, improve information systems and analytical capacity, and build community-based engagement.


The bill also builds on the Biosecurity Act 2015, which this government delivered. It focuses on measures in relation to ballast water management for ships and provides additional powers to control exotic vectors carrying harmful human diseases. The ballast water measures will provide additional protection for coastal environments from the risk of marine pest incursion by legislating for the use of more-effective ballast water treatment technologies. These additional powers are needed under the Biosecurity Act to ensure that Australia is not left vulnerable to significant human health risks. The bill seeks to reduce the likelihood of incursions of vectors that could pose human health concerns and provides powers to manage potential incursions when they are detected. The need for these powers is clearly demonstrated by the rising global detections of the mosquito-borne zika virus.


The bill will also position Australia to ratify the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments by introducing a nationally consistent approach to ballast water, in line with the requirements of the convention. We do not lose any powers of control by the ratification. In fact, we gain international consistency in the management of ballast water. The convention was first signed by the Howard government, in 2005. It is an important global initiative involving over 50 countries, representing over 53 per cent of the world's merchant fleet shipping tonnage. Australia was a driving force and played a leading role in the development of the convention, and it is important that we ratify it ahead of its entry into force on 8 September this year to uphold our positive international reputation for biosecurity management. It is worth noting that the convention also makes special provision for the Great Barrier Reef.


Ballast water is now recognised as a major source of the spread of exotic marine pests around the world. Each year, around 200 million tonnes of ships' ballast water is discharged into Australian ports by 18,000 ships visiting from some 600 overseas ports. Australia is particularly vulnerable as many cargo ships arrive here without cargo and, therefore, with a large quantity of ballast water which needs to be discharged when filling ships with our exports to the global marketplace. If the organisms that arrive are surviving the transport and discharge process, they may become established in the environment and populations may flourish. The Northern Pacific sea star, for example, is a major pest introduced into Australia by ballast water.


While Australia has had, since 2001, ballast water management requirements to prevent new marine pests arriving in Australia, domestic movements are not subject to ballast water regulation, excepting for vessels arriving in Victoria from other domestic ports around Australia. This bill will enable a comprehensive set of domestic ballast water management arrangements to be put in place to lower the risk of marine pests being spread through ballast water between parts of our pristine coastline. Ships will be required to have ballast water management plans while in Australian waters and to discharge ballast water in accordance with the convention. This will reduce the risk of invasive marine pests entering Australian waters, as well as between Australian ports. Additionally, it will protect Australia's vulnerable fisheries industries and environment by reducing the risk of potential invasion and of harmful aquatic organisms being introduced into Australia's marine ecosystem. The bill will further strengthen our strong biosecurity system.


With expanding international and maritime trade it is in Australia's interest to implement more-uniform and stringent requirements to manage the risk of vessels introducing marine pests into Australian waters. It is also in Australia's interest to continue to reduce the likelihood of incursions of vectors, such as mosquitoes, that could pose human health concerns, and to provide powers to manage potential incursions when they are detected. These amendments mean there is much less risk of viruses, including viruses such as zika, carried by vectors such as mosquitoes being established. They also mean our unique marine life will be better protected.


Finally, can I reinforce—and reaffirm to Senator Roberts—that the rules around making any changes to the convention will be subject to the usual treaty-making procedures and parliamentary scrutiny. Can I thank the opposition and the crossbench for their support of this bill and commend the bill to the house.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:06):  My question is to the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham. Modelling reveals that as a result of the education package announced by the minister last Tuesday, fees for some Catholic schools could jump as much as $5,000, with parents at 78 New South Wales Catholic schools facing fee increases of more than $1,000 per child per year. What modelling has the government undertaken to determine the impact of its so-called Gonski 2.0 on school fees? Will the minister assure Australian parents that they will not pay more as a result of his reforms?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (14:07):  I thank Senator Farrell for his question about the Turnbull government's new $18.6 billion worth of additional investment into Australian schools. I thank Senator Farrell for his question and the opportunity to talk about our commitment to ensure that school funding across Australia is delivered on a fair and consistent basis free of special deals, free of differential treatment, but on the basis of need, just as David Gonski recommended.


Senator Farrell has asked some specific questions in relation to New South Wales schools in the Catholic system. I am pleased to inform Senator Farrell that the New South Wales Catholic school system will receive on average per student growth over the next four years of 3.8 per cent—3.8 per cent per student growth. This is well above any measure of inflation that exists today, well above wages growth today and is real, strong growth into the future. That means there should be no need for fee increases but absolute opportunity for additional investment in those schools as there will be in schools right across Australia in terms of investment into additional resources to help students who need it. This will target assistance to those students who need it most, give the best support to students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, give more support to students with disability, give additional assistance to students in small, rural, regional and remote areas, ensure that there is extra assistance going where it is required to those who need it most in a manner that guarantees—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my left! I cannot hear the minister, let alone Senator Farrell, who asked the question.




Senator Kim Carr:
  It is great to be back, isn't it?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Absolutely, Senator Carr. Of course, the disorder from those opposite is because they do not like hearing about the fact that the Turnbull government is doing what they did not have the courage to do. They never had the courage to make sure that they actually had a consistent school-funding model—they had to do a bunch of different deals across the country. (Time expired)

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (14:10):  No, Mr White is not correct. As I indicated, across the New South Wales Catholic school system, our model will deliver 3.8 per cent growth per student. It will also, though—if you want to talk about the government school system, Senator Farrell—deliver 4.9 per cent growth per student.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Senator Collins interjects with the question of how long. I am pleased to tell Senator Collins that, over the decade, the projection in the Catholic schools system in New South Wales is growth of 3.6 per cent per student—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  No, 3.8 per cent for all states.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  It is 3.6 per cent per student, Senator Collins, specific to New South Wales, and, for the government sector in New South Wales over the decade, it is growth of 4.8 per cent per student. This is strong growth across every schooling sector—Catholic, independent and government—above inflation, above wages, enabling real additional investment to support Australian students who need it.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (14:12):  I have had numerous meetings with the National Catholic Education Commission and discussions with other representatives. My office has had numerous discussions with individuals. My department has undertaken a national roadshow and had discussions with different sectors and different individuals. On 3 April, for example, I worked through, with Ms Cronin and others, each of the issues in the submission they made to us and talked about those different factors. So there has absolutely been consultation, and consultation has been ongoing over recent weeks and recent days. We continue to have discussions to talk about the implications of this package and, importantly, to make sure they understand that, across their systems, there will be strong growth in funding that enables them to continue to invest in providing the choice to parents to choose a Catholic school education and resources and support for their students to get the best for the future.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:11):  I move: 


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) and the Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to education funding.


I note in particular that the Minister for Education and Training gave no information on government fee modelling, or the modelling of the fee impact on schools, because their education deal is a dog of a deal. 


You cannot succeed in a conniving manner forever. Eventually, the truth catches up with you. Former Prime Minister Howard learnt this, although it took years, in the 'children overboard' affair. Mr Turnbull should have learnt this lesson when he lost his leadership last time over the Godwin Grech saga, but now we have him and his education minister conniving their way through the Gonski education reforms. Mr Turnbull says he is not joining the Orange Lodge, but his and his education minister's attack on Catholic parish schools is an abuse of process and understanding. Senator Brandis should be ashamed of himself for allowing this through cabinet. He just does not get the Catholic education mission and is prepared to spin untruths to hide his real agenda, contrary to the Gonski recommendations.


I thought I would spend some time this week with the 'book of Gonski'. Mr Turnbull and Senator Birmingham claim that they have had a conversion on Gonski. Let's remind everyone what the real Gonski is. They should be ashamed of what they have done—this contrivance that they have delivered—and I will spend time this week debunking all of those myths. Let's have a quick recap of history. Mr Abbott, just before he became Prime Minister, said the difference between him and Labor on Gonski was wafer-thin. Then he came into government and he stopped the whole reform process. This is all history we know, so it is no surprise that Mr Gonski is relieved that we have moved back to needs-based funding. I would be relieved too.


Sure, the visual images of David Gonski last week gave the government some credence. But Mr Gonski, let us be clear here, simply agreed to conduct a review into how the Commonwealth government's funds should be used. That is all he agreed to. To his credit, David has always been very careful not to enter the school funding wars. But the government sought to co-opt him into their conniving. Mr Gonski's good name and reputation have been tarnished by this process.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  There is no question, Senator Brandis, that there is an enormous calibre gap between Mr David Gonski and this minister for education. Fortunately we have the record. It is in this report—what Mr Gonski recommended—and, quite contrary to what this government is claiming, Mr Gonski never recommended that the Commonwealth should apply a one-size-fits-all formula—never, ever did he recommend that. That is because unlike the education minister, Mr Gonski has a clear grasp of the complexity of school education funding.




Senator Brandis:
  That is why he endorsed the policy.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  No, Senator Brandis, he did not endorse your policy. He said, 'I'm relieved essentially that you've adopted an SRS needs based approach.' But let's have a look.




Senator Brandis:
  You have probably never met him.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I have met him many times, Senator Brandis. In fact, he has commended the work I did in philanthropy, if you must know, and in fact I had responsibility for delivering one of his recommendations, which he was very pleased about. But let us go back to what he did say. The complaint that Catholic Education has is that in his recommendation 20 and his recommendation 21, he said, 'Needs based funding should be rolled out in a particular way' and it has been shifted by this government— (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2017-05-09,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:17):  One thing that Minister Birmingham could not do is undo the rotten $17 billion of waste of the Gillard memorial halls. But I tell you what he did do. He got rid of the 27 dirty little deals that Ms Gillard did with various education authorities around Australia. Madam Deputy President, our home state of Western Australia, as usual, was done over the worst by the then Labor government. I will tell you why it was. Where Senator Birmingham will be moving to 80 per cent funding for the Catholic system in WA at the moment, under what were the changes from Ms Gillard it is 67 per cent. It moves up to 80. Which state group did worst under the dirty little Gillard deals? It was Western Australia. Isn't it absolutely amazing. The other instrumentality that did the worst under the 27 dirty deals was the Northern Territory. Do you know one of the common links between WA and the Northern Territory at that time? Senator Smith can remember. They were Liberal governments.


What is Minister Birmingham doing? He is moving to a fair figure across Australia. Senator Collins and others have jumped up and down and talked about the Catholic schools' catholicity. I remind you, Madam Deputy President, I was a member of Catholic Education Western Australia for nine years from the 1980s to the nineties, which allows me to answer the allegations of Senator Farrell. Only late last week, as Senator Smith would expect, I engaged with the head of Catholic Education Western Australia in a very, very robust and useful discussion. Where do you think that sent me? It sent me straight on to Minister Birmingham. Through that dialogue on Friday night, when the rest of you were probably having a beer and a chardonnay, Senator Birmingham, Mr Tim McDonald and I were conversing on the best way forward in terms of consultation and negotiation. That led on Saturday of this very last week to further communication between Senator Birmingham, the CEO for Catholic Education in WA and my good self. As we know—those who are interested and those who want to stop throwing nonsense at Minister Birmingham would know—in fact the negotiating team from national Catholic Education were meeting with Minister Birmingham only yesterday afternoon. So that is the level of consultation we have.


Is everybody happy? No, they are not. Why might they not be happy? Let me go back to the 27 dirty little deals. Some of the states, some of the independent and possibly even some of the Catholic systems appeared to be adversely advantaged or disadvantaged. Minister Birmingham is proposing to achieve within 10 years a situation in which all Catholic and independent school funding will be at 80 per cent and all states' funding through the Commonwealth will be at 20 per cent. You may well ask: who then funds the balance of the states' education? Under the Constitution of Australia, it is the states themselves that do that funding. But let me go back to the 80 per cent for a moment. The Catholics and the independents move up not to 100 per cent but to 90 per cent, principally through fees. It is the case that children in Australia are taught at 90 per cent efficiency by the Catholic and independent schools. In other words, it is 10 per cent cheaper, because they run their schools so much more efficiently.


In the few moments available to me I will go to another excellent component of Minister Birmingham's work on consultation with the sectors. The independent and Catholic schools, through capital funding over the next 10 years, will receive $300 million of extra capital funding for new school-related buildings. There will be $50 million as a catch-up, because the last government did nothing about relativities between 2009 and when they lost government in 2013. Then there will be an added $250 million for new capital for new schools, for extension and expansion of schools.


Yes, it is a fact that, under our Catholic system, co-responsibility—in the case of WA across the state—is one of the finest principles. Whilst the minister is looking at a per student weighting, he has assured me that the overall funding will return to the sector so that co-responsibility funding can continue under his regime. I congratulate him.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:22):  In question time today there was a simple question asked of the Minister for Education and Training, and that was: what fee modelling has been done? He failed to answer that. He waffled on about roadshows, sideshows and whatever show he was putting on. The minister also alleged that he had 'all this consultation'. He had all this consultation in the last few days, by the sounds of it. Even the good senator leaving the chamber now, Senator Back, was just talking about consultation in the last few days. Apparently this is a policy that was put together over many, many months. But, now, when educators and parents are coming out and saying, 'This is not good enough,' suddenly there is consultation.


So what do we have here? We have Mr Turnbull's education policy, which amounts to $22 billion in cuts to the original Gonski education funding proposed by Labor—




Senator Brandis:
  No, it does not.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Yes, it does; $22 billion in cuts to the original Gonski education funding proposed by Labor and previously agreed to, as alluded to by my colleague Senator Collins, by the Liberal Party. What we see here under this new policy is more recycling and a poor imitation of Labor's policy initiatives. It is immediately apparent that this government has no long-term vision or credible policies of its own. We know that, after this $22 billion of cuts, it is likely that no public school will reach its fair funding level. It has taken only a few days for the Liberals' new school funding policy to fall to pieces.


Today, Senator Back talked about people throwing nonsense about. Let us look at who he says is throwing nonsense about. It is clear that, prior to announcing what is effectively a watered-down version of Labor's original Gonski initiative, Mr Turnbull did not consult with his own party. The Liberal Party are in revolt over this issue. They do not want you to know, but that is exactly what is happening. It is a complete shambles, and a shambles brought on by the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham. He has brought this on. He has done no real consultation at all, and that was shown even in Senator Back's contribution, talking about consultation over the last few days. While Mr Turnbull was out of the country, the Acting Prime Minister, Mr Joyce—he is apparently one of the people that Senator Back was talking about as people throwing nonsense about—was already flagging changes when he stated on 4 May that there could be 'tweaking'. He said, 'We never completely close our minds.' The Assistant Treasurer, Michael Sukkar, was quoted in TheDailyTelegraph on 5 May:


Victorian Liberal frontbencher and Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar suggested the government would have to modify its plans to ensure schools were satisfied.


Mr Abbott and Liberal MPs are threatening a party room revolt and suggest Mr Turnbull might dump the new policy. Again on 5 May, TheSydney Morning Herald stated: 


Tony Abbott has predicted Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull could dump—


his newly announced— 


… education funding reform.


It then quoted Mr Abbott as saying:


This will, I'm sure, be heavily discussed in our party room on Tuesday …


Marginal seat Liberals were also quoted in The Australian on 4 May as saying:


… the education funding package was ""absolutely outrageous"" and declared more voters would ""abandon"" the party, as they urged Mr Turnbull and the Education Minister to reconsider the changes.


These are some of the quotes that Senator Back in his contribution talked about as nonsense. Members of the Liberal Party, members of their own caucus, are not happy. They have also said:


… if ""this is not fixed and soon"", there would be a partyroom showdown … ""I have no idea what they are thinking … I can't believe it,"" …

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:27):  It is worth reminding people that today is the eve of the federal budget. Indeed, it is the first parliamentary sitting day since an extended recess—when senators were not on holiday; they were working in their constituencies. So the Labor opposition in the Senate had various options today when it came to question time. It could have attempted to present an alternative economic plan for the country, but it did not. It could have tried to undermine the government's very, very successful response to the energy crisis, but it could not and it did not. It could have tried to undermine the government's historic media reforms that were announced just days ago, but it did not; it could not. Instead, we have had a very lacklustre campaign to try and undermine the government's historic, much-needed reforms to Australia's education system.


If you want to listen to people who are informed on this debate, then you cannot go past my Western Australian colleague Senator Chris Back, who, in his very wise and tempered contribution, talked about his firsthand experience having been on the Western Australian Catholic Education commission for a long period of time. It is unfortunate that Hansard does not capture screeching and loud voices, because what we have heard thus far in this take-note debate is screeching, is loud voices—but I am sorry to inform senators on the other side that loud voices, screeching voices, do not make weak arguments stronger.


Let us get to the substance of the issue. There are two particular points that, in the limited time available to me, I would like to highlight. The first is whether or not the previous Labor government did in good faith reflect David Gonski's education reform aspirations, and the answer to that is no. Secondly, I would like to reflect on a part of the world that I know quite well, the federal electorate of Cowan—indeed, Madam Deputy President might know it well—in Perth's northern suburbs, and just detail for people what are the real dollar advantages to be achieved on the ground in local schools in a pretty tough part of Western Australia, I might add. When I go through those schools, some of them are Catholic schools, and they absolutely benefit.


I will speak briefly, if I may, to the accusation that this government is not living up to the David Gonski ambitions when it comes to education reform. I want to turn briefly to an article that Glenn Savage has written in The Conversation. Those of you who know Glenn Savage will know that he is from the Melbourne Graduate School of Education, based at the University of Melbourne. What does Glenn Savage have to say? He says:


The new reform is good policy for two main reasons. 


First, it seeks, in principle at least, to correct some of the compromises and corruptions—


his words—


that marred the original Gonski reforms, leading to many different deals being done across the nation and to a highly inconsistent application of the SRS.


He goes on to say:


Second, states will only get funding if they agree to use the money for reforms proven ""to support better outcomes for students"".


This will broaden the focus from simply debating how much schools get, to the equally important question of what schools do with the cash.


Glenn Savage goes on to respond, specifically, to the issues around what the true aspirations and ambitions of David Gonski's education reforms are for our country. Glenn says:


The original Gonski review was designed to introduce a fairer, more transparent and needs-based federal funding model. If such a model had actually been produced, over-funded non-government schools would have lost some money.


But this never happened. Instead, early in the review process, the Labor government promised that ""no school would lose a dollar"" as a result of the reforms.


Instead of a ""needs-based"" model, Labor delivered a model that injected significantly more money into schooling, but also protected the vested interests of Catholic and independent schools.


There is simply no denying this fact. As original Gonski review panellist member Ken Boston recently put it, ""the Gonski Report was filleted and the flesh thrown away"", leaving a deeply unfair set of arrangements.


The Gonski report was filleted and the flesh thrown away, leaving a deeply unfair set of arrangements. That is why this government has taken upon itself to embark upon not just a historic reform but a historic reform that delivers fairness, transparency, equity and a needs based approach to public education.

"Kitching, Sen Kimberley",ALP,2017-05-09,"



Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (15:32):  Today I asked a question of the Attorney about the new Gonski 2.0. Like most of the government's policies, there is nothing original and everything is tired. What a tired and weary government it is. When the Prime Minister and education minister announce one thing and the Deputy Prime Minister and Assistant Treasurer say another, Australian parents, teachers and principals are rightly concerned.


There is a little bit of circus in this. Who would not want to sit back with popcorn and watch the coalition party room, with all of its multiple divisions once again renting the air? What we are seeing is something that may become known as 'government by Turnbull'—that is, secrecy and no consultation. Then comes a shock announcement driven by bureaucracy; waved through by dud, visionless ministers; signed off by a callous, clueless, incompetently led cabinet; and then a backlash from those in the real world. In this case, it is from Catholic school teachers, principals, parents and students. What follows the backlash? The backflip.


Given the cruelty and callousness of these cuts, given the grave concern that this attack on Catholic education is causing in the real world—a world that one cannot see from a $50 million Sydney harbourside mansion—and given the inevitability of backlash-backflip cycles in this bungling mess of a government, why not just get the agony and misery over and done with?


The Scripture tells us that, where there is no vision, the people perish. If you do not stand for anything you will fall for everything. Imagine the once great Liberal Party of Menzies sticking the knife into Catholic schools. Lest I tell those opposite their own history—a history for which they seem to have scant regard—in the early 1960s Menzies extended funding to Catholic schools. At the same time, a young John Howard used his leadership of the Young Liberals to support the pro-state aid, as it was termed, for Catholic schools policy of the federal Liberals. When he became Prime Minister he still believed in this policy. Imagine having a Prime Minister who believes in a policy for more than a media news cycle! Indeed, Mr Howard said at that time that it was a matter of justice that Catholic schools be supported.


There has been some discussion around the funding models. I want to point out the government's own Quality Schools, Quality Outcomes document. It is readily available on the department of education's website, but it obviously is not a very easy document for those opposite to find. That report from May last year—a whole year ago, a very long time for this government—says:


All schools need to have certainty in their funding arrangements to ensure effective planning and support for students.


In fact, the government seem to have done a complete 180 from their position on school funding last year. The report says:


For the 2018 to 2020 school years, recurrent school funding will be indexed by an education specific indexation rate of 3.56 per cent, with an allowance for changes in enrolments. This measure reflects more accurately the growth in education costs by focusing on factors specifically related to the education sector. Consequently, as a result of using this index, the Australian Government will provide an additional $1.2 billion over four years from 2017-18.


What a long time ago May 2016 was for this government.


The government are trying to sell this policy by saying that the $2 billion they have quoted is an increase from the previous figure of $1.2 billion, but the reality is that the Gonski 2.0 policy will reduce funding by $22 billion over 10 years compared to Labor's policy. After those 10 years, 85 per cent of schools will still be short of the resource standard. As the Quality Schools, Quality Outcomes report makes clear, this time last year the government had committed to fixed indexation. They made out that it was the best thing since sliced bread, but the substance of this policy only commits to fixed indexation at a rate of 3.56 per cent until 2021. After that there will be a shift to floating indexation. I will not go too far into the details of the policy, as it is available in the Quality Schools, Quality Outcomes document. (Time expired)

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (15:46):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  Australia has developed a significant national resilience and adaptation capability and is well positioned to meet the challenge of climate change. In December 2015, the Australian government released the National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy. The strategy sets out how Australia is managing climate risks for the benefit of the community, economy and environment. For example, we are providing guidance relating to transport infrastructure through the Australian Transport Assessment and Planning Guidelines. These guidelines cover public road and rail transport and include appropriate guidance on climate change adaptation for transport planning and project appraisal.


Question agreed to.

Pursuant to standing order 75, I propose that the following matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion:


The Turnbull Government's enthusiasm to waste $1 billion propping up Labor's Adani mine, which shows they're working for billionaires, not for the future of everyday Australians.


Is the proposal supported?

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2017-05-09,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:01):  Thank you very much, Mr President. It is good to be back—and that breastfeeding was perfectly timed; she has just finished, thank you very much.


I rise to speak today about what a complete waste of money and a foolish idea spending $1 billion of public money on the largest coalmine in the southern hemisphere would be. The Adani mine is the best and the most appalling example of the way in which the big parties are working for the big end of town and not actually for communities or, for that matter, for the planet. Australians know that our political system is broken and that our economic system is rigged against everyday people. The same system that lets greedy bankers rip off everyday people, with the full protection of politicians, is the same system that is going to let—over our dead bodies—Adani take unlimited groundwater from Queensland when about 90 per cent of the state is in drought. This is the same system that lets property developers steamroll local residents with insider deals, and it is the same system that wants to hand a billion dollars of taxpayer money—your money—to a multinational mining company. And this is the system that allows political donations to buy influence and to buy policy results, which is exactly why we see the dominance of gambling, alcohol, tobacco, property developers and, of course, the mining sector. They tend to get their way, and the community is utterly forgotten. Adani, the banks, insurance companies and the big end of town have got their well-paid lobbyists and they have got their well-connected former politicians. We know about the revolving door between MPs in this place, or their staffers, and the resources sector; it goes back and forth, and it is a very cosy relationship which borders on corruption. All we have got is people power. But, thankfully, I think that is going to be enough.


When ordinary people stand up, we can win, and the growth of the community movement in the last few months, with a new coalition of environment groups launching the Stop Adani campaign, has really generated some interest in this issue, and people now know what a foolish and ridiculous spend $1 billion of taxpayers' money would be on a polluting coalmine that will further endanger the Reef, which has just faced back-to-back bleaching episodes. Never before in the Reef's history has so much of it bleached, and never before has it happened two years running. Yet this government, with the full support of Labor in Queensland, are happy to bend over backwards to fast-track approvals, and now want to give $1 billion to this project. You could not design a more ridiculous situation. It is clear that, for the donors, it is payday; they have made their donations, and now they are getting the results that they want.


Unfortunately, no-one has done as much to grease the wheels for this coalmine proposal as Queensland Labor. They have given a water licence, with unlimited and free groundwater, for the life of the mine. Nobody else gets that sort of special treatment. Farmers and other water users are asked to be very careful with their water use. They have multiple levels of bureaucratic process to go through. They have to tighten their belts in a drought situation; the mining industry do not. They get free and unlimited groundwater.


The Queensland government also want to offer Adani a royalty holiday. They have been very cagey about this. They will not actually tell us how long the royalty holiday is going to be for. Nobody else gets a holiday on their royalties, but they have, once again, picked up a Campbell Newman idea that the first mover in the Galilee Basin would get a freebie and not even have to pay for the pleasure of ripping coal out of this planet's core and burning it, worsening climate change. Again, you could not think of a worse deal.


To silence the community, the Queensland Labor government have also created a special legal loophole for Adani in relation to their water licence. The community can no longer have a say on whether they think that is a good use of our precious water and, hence, they cannot go to court even if the decision made is a poor one either on the merits or on the process.


They have approved the mine at every level, they have lobbied for federal taxpayer funding to come out of this Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, the NAIF, despite going to the election saying that they would both save the reef and not spend taxpayer dollars on this project, and they have gone to India recently to beg the head of Adani to build the mine. What is less well known than all of those appalling facts is that the Queensland government has the power to veto the billion dollars that Mr Malcolm Turnbull and this government want to give to Adani. Queensland Labor could block that $1 billion loan to Adani, and they could announce that today, if they so wished.


Before the election, Labor said that they would not give any money to Adani's coal railway to nowhere, and now they have been actively facilitating that loan. As a Queenslander and as someone who cares deeply about the reef and about a safe future for the generations to come, I think that Queensland Labor needs to veto that NAIF money. If, indeed, the Liberal government is going to insist on giving free taxpayer money to this overseas company with a billionaire at its helm to trash the reef, then Queensland Labor needs to stand up and say, 'We will not accept that money.' They have that power under the NAIF Act and they need to use it.


Of course, federal Labor could also weigh in on this issue, and should do so. They have been quite prevaricating. One minute they are saying they love the coal industry; the next they are saying, 'Oh, but it's got to stand on its own two feet, but we might think about giving them taxpayer money.' They are all over the shop on this one. We know that the Liberals have thrown their lot in with the coal industry. That is beyond question. We know Labor often do that also, but they need to come clean on what their actual position is, and Mr Bill Shorten needs to announce that if his lot were to form government he would require a review of the environmental approvals for this company, because what has come to light in the last few months is their appalling environmental track record.


Our environmental laws need reform, but they do at least require that sort of thing to be considered, and when the track record is so appalling and when new information has come to light now, since the approvals have been issued, there is the ability to reconsider those approvals. So, in short, Labor need to come out and say that they would reconsider those approvals and they would look at the dodgy environmental history of this company. That would send a very strong message and could help to kill this mine.


We know that regional Queensland is crying out for jobs. We know that it is crying out for jobs that will last, that are not subject to a boom-and-bust cycle, that are not killing workers with black lung, which is resurgent in Queensland. We thought we had killed that off decades ago, but black lung is back and it is here, in a Queensland coalmine, coming to you. We need jobs in those areas, but we need jobs that do not kill the workers and do not kill the reef. It is not that hard to think about positive, this-century options for job generation, but Labor are blinded by the money coming from the coal sector, and the donors continue to get their way.


Other, lesser heard voices in this debate have been the voices of the local Indigenous people. The Wangan and Jagalingou mob, whom I meet with regularly, and their lead spokesperson, Adrian Burragubba, who is a deeply honourable man, have been opposing this mine from the outset. There have been all sorts of dodgy tactics, which have meant that the group has been infiltrated, there have been attempts at bribery of the process, and people who are not even from country have been ferried in to stack the process. What is really clear is that the legitimate traditional owners of that area do not want this mine. They do not want their groundwater ruined. They do not want their sacred spaces trashed and dug up and turned into an open-cut coalmine. No means no, yet this government is completely deaf to them, such that we now have a bill to ram through a reduction in native title rights just so the Adani mine can get up. What an absolute farce—and what a real abrogation and an insult, once again, to our first nations.


There is a lot of talk about job creation, and we love job creation. We also love the 70,000 jobs on the reef. They are at risk from a continued bleaching episode, driven by climate change, which will be made worse by this coalmine were it ever to proceed. So it is a bit rich of Minister Canavan and others on that side to be trumpeting the potential for jobs from this proposal when the company itself has massively backtracked and said: 'Oh, actually, we weren't telling the truth when we first told you it was going to be 10,000; it's going to be more like 1,464. Soz about the arithmetic error.' Yet we hear nothing from that side about the 70,000 reef jobs that are at risk from climate change, which will be turbocharged by this mine. So do not buy the lies from that side or from the company, who distance themselves from their original projections anyway.


If we think about jobs, there are some recent proposals for solar thermal plants for Queensland—in fact, up to six, by a company that has a demonstrated positive environmental track record offshore—that could generate 20,000 jobs in clean renewable generation in Queensland. That is the sort of job creation we want to see. Those jobs will last. They will help us keep the lights on. They will not trash the reef. And they will not kill their workers with a disease that we thought was eradicated decades ago. That is the sort of positive planning that needs to be done, rather than the dog whistling to One Nation with this propping up of last-century so-called technology in an effort to pander to people who are desperate for jobs. They do not want promises of fake jobs; they want real jobs, and they deserve that.


We know that our reef cannot withstand another bleaching event. And, as Terry Hughes has said, it is a choice between the reef and new coal. The decision is pretty clear to the Australian Greens. It is now over to the government and to Labor to cast their lot. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-05-09,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:11):  For those who might be listening to this debate on the Adani mine, one can understand why the Greens political party is on the downwards slide. Unfortunately perhaps for democracy, nobody takes any notice of them anymore, and the previous speech exemplifies just why: it was full of inaccuracies and deliberate misstatements of the facts. For example—just to pick up a couple, and time does not allow me to show the lie of everything that was just said in that speech—the suggestion that the local Indigenous people have been bribed to support the mine is just not true. If Senator Waters had attended the hearing in Brisbane of the inquiry into the native title amendment, she would have heard from the local Indigenous people there that they had a number of meetings and that the local Indigenous people support this proposal. And she would have heard the same from Indigenous groups right around.


Senator Waters also said that the Commonwealth was going to be handing out free money to Adani to trash the reef. Well, there is no free money. In case Senator Waters is not aware—and I am sure she is, but that does not stop her deliberately misstating the facts—the North Australia Infrastructure Facility is a loan based facility. It is a loan from that particular organisation which has to be repaid by the recipient. And it is not the government, Senator Waters. NAIF is a completely independent group, a company set up under its own legislation. It makes the decisions. It is not subject to federal government direction or, in most cases, veto.


The Greens continue to misstate the facts. Any speech by the Greens now will always include—you can bet your bottom dollar, whatever they are talking about—that it is going to destroy the reef. Again I say that Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of carbon emissions in the world. If it is carbon emissions that are causing climate change and if climate change is affecting the reef, then nothing we do in Australia is going to have any impact upon that, Senator Waters. And I keep challenging you and your colleagues to tell me how that is going to be the case, but never do you respond to that, because it is an argument that you cannot respond to. So I disregard entirely anything the Greens might say on these issues. I take no notice of them, and most Australians no longer take any notice of the Greens political party at all.


I am entering into this debate because I am fascinated, I am curious and I cannot wait to hear what Senator Chisholm is going to say on behalf of the federal Labor Party in relation to this MPI discussion. It is not often that I agree with state Labor. It is not often that I will praise the Labor Premier of Queensland. But on one point, I must say, the Queensland state Labor Party and the Queensland state Labor government have done the right thing on this particular issue. They are supporting Adani because they, like me, appreciate that this means 10,000 jobs for people in Central Queensland and North Queensland, where I live, work and see the despair of huge unemployment. This project, which is a first-class and state-of-the-art facility, will provide enormous numbers of jobs during construction—something like 8½ thousand. There will also be 3,900 permanent direct jobs in these coalmines.


It is not just Adani, of course. Once the common-user railway line is built it will be used by other mines in that area. So it is not going to one particular producer. It will be used by everyone. This provides real jobs. I know that Queensland state Labor are interested in this. But I would be fascinated to hear, Senator Chisholm, what you are going to tell us about the federal Labor position. It seems to vacillate every day. We still do not know what Mr Shorten and Mr Dreyfus are going to do about this native title amendment. The Queensland Labor government totally support the government's amendment to the native title legislation to deal with that unusual and unexpected court decision that changed the whole process. As part of it, it could have meant that all of the coalmines in the Galilee Basin, plus the existing mines at Weipa and the ongoing work of the aluminium industry in Gladstone, would have been shut down completely. But so far we have the Labor Party vacillating on whether they are for it or against it.


When my committee dealt with this, it appeared that the Labor Party were totally supportive. One of the Labor senators wanted to make some further inquiries, but we generally got the—




Senator Chisholm:
  Which one?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It was Senator Dodson who was there. You were not, unfortunately. That was a pity, because it was very important for Queensland. Senator Dodson wanted to check something. Since then, Mr Shorten—or Mr Dreyfus, apparently; he seems to control Mr Shorten—seems to be putting different things in the way of that particular resolution of an issue which means real jobs for Queensland. I will be delighted and fascinated to hear what the Labor senator is going to say in relation to federal Labor's position.


We on this side believe in jobs. We understand the enormous importance of these projects to employment in my state of Queensland in particular. Senators will know that in Townsville at the present time there is 10.9 per cent unemployment. In Mackay, there is 6.8 per cent unemployment. In Rockhampton it is 7.2. Even the AWU—not a union that I have a great regard for usually—understands the importance of this and is supporting the Queensland Labor government in its bid to get these projects underway.


There have been over 300 very strict environmental conditions on this proposal. It is one that will be carefully monitored by both the Queensland and Commonwealth governments. Those conditions and the oversight of both governments will ensure that there is no damage to the local ecology or to the environment of that part of Queensland, or to the Great Barrier Reef or anywhere else. Those conditions are very strict, but Adani has accepted them.


This work will bring electricity and a slightly increased standard of living to millions of people in India that the Greens will always talk about at the appropriate time in this chamber—helping disadvantaged people in Third World countries. But when there is an opportunity to do something tangible to help those people, to give them the electricity that the Greens take for granted every day—they can go and flick a switch and enjoy the benefits of electricity—they do not seem to want that to happen to people living in India who do not have the benefit of those facilities.


I will listen intently to what the next speaker will say about federal Labor's position. I hope it will be a rousing endorsement of the Queensland Labor government's position on this, which of course reflects the position of the Liberal National Party of Queensland and the federal coalition in relation to this much-needed project that will help those poorer people in India and will provide real and permanent jobs in a part of Queensland that is currently suffering substantially from unemployment, caused principally by the mining turndown in other parts of North Queensland.


The matter of public importance that we are debating today refers to $1 billion. I am not quite sure where that is coming from or what is being wasted. As I say, any money that might come from the NAIF—and that is a matter for the NAIF board to determine, not the federal government—will be a loan that will have to be repaid at some time in the future. So the proposition put before us today that we are debating is completely nonsensical. It is put up by the Greens political party, who—I am pleased to say—most Australians now take no regard of.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-05-09,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (16:21):  It is always a pleasure to follow Senator Macdonald. We well know that Winton in Western Queensland is the home of a dinosaur museum, but there are other dinosaur exhibits in regional Queensland—particularly in Townsville, where Senator Macdonald is from. It is pleasing to follow him after his endorsement of Premier Palaszczuk, a very good friend of mine. He neglected to mention the great work of the Mayor of Townsville, Jenny Hill—also a good friend of mine—who is out there fighting for this project; of Mayor Strelow in Rockhampton, whom I spoke to last week about this project; and of local regional mayors, who are talking up the importance of this project because they know that it means so much to them for local jobs.


What was interesting in Senator Macdonald's speech was that he talked about the high rate of unemployment in a lot of these regional towns. Since we last sat, I have visited Townsville, Bowen, Mackay and Gladstone. I have spoken to a lot of people on the ground there who are suffering from the economic downturn. The saddest thing about it is that the federal government have done nothing about it. They talk about NAIF—they talk about its importance—but it has spent zero dollars. It has not contributed one thing or created one job, other than that of the CEO, whom they appointed from down south. The only money it has spent is on a CEO and its executive structure. It has not actually spent one cent on a project in northern Australia. Whilst the government can talk a big game on it, NAIF has not done one thing to create a job apart from some fat-cat salaries. 


We saw the government 12 months ago going around regional Queensland, promising money for jobs packages. Here we are, hours before the federal budget this year, and they have still not spent one cent on those job packages—including in the Bowen Basin, which, as Senator Macdonald said, has a high level of unemployment, along with Townsville. I know, particularly through the travels I have done over the last month, that there are really strong concerns from locals about their economic future and what opportunities are before them. That is something that the Labor Party has been very strong on and will be addressing between now and the election campaign, to ensure locals have those strong job opportunities.


It is really sad to hear from the Greens—and what a sad political movement they have become. Once a principles based organisation, now they have basically become a left-wing version of shock jocks. After sabotaging the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in 2009—a national scheme Labor had produced that would have brought down carbon emissions that the Greens were responsible for knocking off—we see them going around the country, project by project, trying to knock off these resources projects. They give no thought to local economies and how important these projects are for local jobs. If you spend any time in these communities, you get an understanding from locals of how important it is that they have opportunities for themselves, and, particularly, from those people who have kids who are about to finish high school, the feedback I get is: what is their economic future in regional Queensland?


Labor has been very clear on its position in regard to the Adani coalmine: it has to stack up commercially and financially, and it has to meet the stringent government approvals that are set in place. That has been the absolutely clear message from Bill Shorten over a period of time now, and it is supported by the federal Labor Party. I was with Bill in regional Queensland over the last month, and he has been very strong in his language around this so that people understand where he is coming from. 


But all we see from the Greens is pandering to the inner city with no consideration of what is good for regional Queensland. This project is important for regional Queensland because of the unemployment that we see in these towns. Townsville has gone into double figures for unemployment, and across regional Queensland we see a higher level of unemployment compared with the south-east corner. And this is whilst the federal government has been sitting on its hands in regard to the local infrastructure.


As I mentioned, NAIF, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, has not spent one cent on job-creating projects in regional Queensland, despite all the talk we hear from Senator Canavan and others in this chamber. It is really sad to see that, even when the federal government do spend money—like on the Mackay Ring Road, which is a very important local project to that economy, with about $500 million to $600 million being spent on it—local contractors miss out. It really is not good enough that, even when they are coming in and spending money, not enough of that money is going to local contractors so that local communities can benefit. Instead, contractors are coming from down south, scooping up the money, doing the work and then taking it with them. The federal government need to do much better to ensure that, when they do spend money on local projects, it is local contractors who are getting the work so that the local community can benefit.


Then there is the sad case of the jobs packages, which Senator Nash went around spruiking over the election campaign that went for two months. Yet here we are, a year later, with not one cent having been spent and not one job having been created. It really is not good enough for this government to talk a big game on this but fail to deliver. 


It is clear from the way that Senator Waters talked about this, and from what you hear other Greens say about this issue, that they have not spent time in regional communities in Queensland. If they had, they would understand the importance of this project for these communities. As I mentioned, I did a jobs forum in Cairns and I spent time in Townsville. I went with the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, to Bowen, where we had a strong response from locals there. I did a northern Australia jobs forum with the shadow minister for northern Australia, Jason Clare, in Mackay; and I also did a jobs forum with Matt Thistlethwaite, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, in Gladstone, over the last month. These have been really important opportunities for me to listen to locals, to get feedback from them and to use that to influence Labor policy as we get closer to the election.


We understand the importance of fighting for local jobs and of creating opportunities for locals to get employment not only now but into the future—and, particularly, where the TAFE and training system fits in with that so that people can see a future for themselves where they grew up, in their local communities and, often, where their families have spent time as well. It is really important, and Labor understand the importance of these local projects to regional communities. They will be at the forefront of our policymaking before the next election.


In terms of the NAIF, there are concerns about its governance. This is something that Wayne Swan, the member for Lilley, has raised in the other chamber. He has written to the Auditor-General asking his office to investigate potential risks in the fund, saying: 


I am concerned the real risk of maladministration may lead to significant losses to the Commonwealth in the future and the misallocation of resources due to political pressure and poor governance, resulting in funds failing to be allocated to more worthy purposes.


So this government cannot have it both ways. On one hand, they are saying that the NAIF is independent and will make decisions itself. On the other hand, the minister is pushing his preferred projects, such as the Adani rail line and his other pet project, the coal-fired power station. And he is trying to do this with minimal scrutiny.


There is one issue they have not addressed. To be eligible for financial support Adani must demonstrate the assistance would be, from the investment mandate of NAIF, 'necessary to enable the project to proceed or to proceed much earlier than it would otherwise'. In December last year, a NAIF spokesperson said: 


This is something that governments of all political persuasions have done in the past and I assume will do in the future, it doesn't necessarily mean it's make or break for the project.


This has been said on multiple occasions. They are also on the record as saying that government funding is not necessary for this project to happen.


The government have not adequately dealt with this. They are trying to use NAIF to fund this rail line, but Adani have been on the record, on multiple occasions, saying this is not necessary. The government definitely have questions to answer around how that will transpire. Given their track record, I expect more loans schemes with no concrete funding, more back-of-the-envelope accountability and more platitudes about the regions but a failure to deliver.


Federal Labor has been clear. The government needs to meet the tough legislation that is set up. It needs to stack up financially. This is an important project for regional Queensland.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-05-09,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (16:31):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia I rise to speak to the Greens' fatuous MPI. Our Greens colleagues would have us discuss a statement which, in fact, is a fallacy of many questions, variously asserting that investing in infrastructure somehow benefits billionaires at the expense of the future of 'everyday Australians'. How wrong can they get?


As the party of smug government-employed Canberra bureaucrats and middle-class elites, the Greens would have no idea—nor would they care for the future—of everyday Australians. In fact, all this Greens MPI really reflects is the Greens' neurotic and irrational hostility to coalmining and coal based power generation, regardless of the impact of this on the standard of living of everyday Australians, as often their screechings contradict the evidence and the facts. 


The real truth is that the last 170 years has seen billions of people lifted out of poverty and removed from the vagaries of nature's weather, extremes of drought, flood and famine. We have enjoyed vastly lengthened life spans, greatly increased comfort, safety, ease and security. And this has occurred hand in hand with a miracle of hydrocarbon fuels, coal, gas and oil that, until recent Greens-led government interventions, saw ever-falling real prices. 


Unlike the Greens, informed senators would be aware that the Carmichael coalmine, to be built by the Adani group in the north of the Galilee Basin in Central Queensland, represents a $16.5 billion investment in our state. Expected to produce 2.3 billion tonnes of coal over a projected 60-year lifespan, this wonderful project will generate thousands of jobs and many hundreds of millions of dollars of export earnings for our nation—jobs needed because Queensland's Labor government has killed our state through excessive energy prices, needless tax and over-regulation and the theft of property rights that are decimating regions.


As the first of a number of mines expected to be built in the Galilee Basin, the infrastructure to be built for the Carmichael mine will greatly facilitate the development of subsequent mines, which, in turn, will generate yet more jobs and yet more earnings for Australia. This is the reason that the northern Australia infrastructure fund plans to lend the $1 billion to which this MPI refers. This will not only facilitate the development of the Carmichael mine but also assist the development of numerous other subsequent mines by other companies and open up regional Queensland.


For the Greens to claim that a NAIF loan to build vital infrastructure somehow means that the government is 'working for billionaires' is simply logically incoherent. It is the Greens who feathered the nests of billionaires—American billionaires like George Soros—who drove down the share price of coal companies by calling for action on climate, contradicting the empirical evidence. Those billionaires drove down the share price of coal companies and then swooped to buy those same companies, expecting massive profits as coal in future fulfils huge forecast increases in usage in China, Japan, Germany, Italy, Russia, India and on and on. Also note that I said 'lend', because, contrary to the Greens' claim in their MPI, no-one is giving Adani anything. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility was set up precisely to lend money to assist in the development of railways, port and airport facilities, roads, water and communications facilities and on and on—specifically to assist the development of northern Australia.


The NAIF loan and the Carmichael mine will open up the Galilee Basin to the world, creating untold thousands of jobs and a treasure trove of government revenue and export earnings. Much of the coal mined in this region will go to India to power Prime Minister Modi's amazing industrial revolution. In addition to fuelling power generation that will help to transform much of India and provide the lighting, heating and cooling that we take for granted, this coal will also directly provide many with fuel for domestic cooking. Instead of facing the severe adverse health effects of burning animal dung or scarce wood, millions will benefit from being able to burn clean coal. Of course, as this ridiculous Greens MPI demonstrates, the Greens could not care less about creating jobs or generating export earnings here in Australia, much less about lifting much of India out of the Third World. Oh, no, the Greens could not give a damn about any of that; they are anti-human. Subject to our scheduled discussions on underground water, we support the Adani project and the opening up of our state of Queensland.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-05-09,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (16:36):  It is always a pleasure, might I say, to speak on an MPI on a subject put up by the Greens. It makes it very simple. Very little research is required, because the response you can give to their contribution is the same very time. This anti-development party, anti-employment party, is a party will go to extreme lengths to prevent the development of economies in regional and rural Australia in particular, where resources and, in this case, the Adani mine will be developed. Of course, the Greens were supported by the metro-based Labor senators from the state of Queensland. Every one of the colleagues on the other side have an office in Queen Street—nobody has an office in regional Queensland—and they want to do things that will impact on the economies of communities that are thousands of kilometres away from where they are, places they rarely visit.


Let us have a look at the impacts of the policies of the Labor Party and the Greens in their efforts to date. They have been particularly successful. We have lost 14,000 jobs in Central Queensland in the coal industry, not directly from coal employees but from businesses and others who are there whose whole welfare in life exists around the development of the coal industry. I look to places like Emerald. If only my Labor colleagues were present, though I have one of our Queensland Greens senators here. Emerald is a small community that is west of Rockhampton. If you are ever inclined, you should go up the Cap Highway until you get to Rockhampton and then turn left—there are no other deviations—and you will find yourself in the centre of the township of Emerald. It is a fine place. I used to own a property not far from there—a farm that we had.


I bet you London to a brick that you will never go to Emerald. But, if you do, I bet that you wear a false moustache, because you will not want the good people of Emerald to recognise you—with 600 vacant houses in the community and unemployment rates nearly double that which you enjoy out the window of your office and where you live. Communities like Emerald have gone into depression because of the efforts of the Greens and the Australian Labor Party to prevent the development of industries in regional Queensland.


It is a remarkable thing for a party like the Labor Party, who live on the back of union support, to be anti-union with respect to the development of these 14,000 jobs that are on the table in Central Queensland. It defies logic. Slowly but surely, and sadly for them, the coalition are becoming the party of the workers, particularly as you get into the resource industry. They are looking to us now. They are looking to us to nourish their lives. They still put money into your coffers and the coffers of the Australian Labor Party, but that is slowly changing. In my home state a couple of private unions have performed. People are voting with their feet; they are moving across. I think the nurses union is getting 80 or 90 new memberships a day in my home state.


I invite you—and I am happy to put it onto my tab; our offices can liaise—and I invite all the senators from the Labor Party and any senators from the Greens, particularly the Queensland senator, to join me. We will have a good couple of days. We will kick back and we will have the odd stubbie in Blackwater, Emerald and Alpha, and places. These economies are depressed and they will remain depressed until we stimulate them with the proper development of this Adani mine resource. 


We have 400 kilometres of rail line to be built that they are suggesting that somehow the government is doing for this company without any form of return. The cost-benefit analysis has been done. The stimulus that it will give to Central Queensland and all the way through to the port at Bowen will be enormous. It will have a flow-on effect that will last for decades. Generations of people will have job opportunities up there as a result of this investment. For Senator Chisholm to cast aspersions on the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia, Senator Canavan, and somehow suggest that his support and the processes involved in trying to get this project up have happened in the shadows and that no-one is following the script is complete and absolute nonsense. 


We know that units of the Greens party in Australia have taken these people to court. These Newcastle based environmental activist groups funded by corporate money from the United States have been taken to court. Every single facet of this project has been thoroughly and transparently examined not only in the court system but in the public. I can tell you the jury has come in—the jury of Mackay and the jury of Townsville, where unemployment is almost at 10 per cent when the national figure is 5.9 per cent. These are depressed economies that want this project to happen.


If you think about it, there is not a business or a service in Central Queensland, all the way from Townsville down to Gladstone, that does not have a real interest in this. This is a massive part of our home state. I remind you that no senators other than our party, the coalition government, have senators in these areas. We have Senator Macdonald in Townsville. We have Senator Canavan in Rockhampton. That was done deliberately so that we could spread our representatives across the state so that we could get on top of what our communities want in terms of development and progress for their economies. 


It really is insulting to hear Senator Chisholm and our friends in the Greens come into this place and endeavour to influence decisions that will impact on the hundreds of thousands of people and families in this massive area of my home state without one thought for their welfare. Senator Roberts raised a good point. There are those in this place who are absolute bleeding hearts. They would like to see us develop tofu farms and injured animal hospitals all the way through Central Queensland rather than invest in something that will provide a job. They put a lot of time and effort into saving the blue-winged parrot and a possum that I cannot pronounce, yet there is not one regard for the hundreds of millions of people in India who are endeavouring to pull themselves out of poverty.




Senator Waters:
  So why did you cut the foreign aid budget?




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I know it does not affect you. You can look out of your office and look out of your house down on your mown lawn, but you do not have any regard for these people because you do not understand these economies. Our government tried to give some tax relief. Mind you, those opposite lost sight of the fact that this is the money and the business. They own it and all we wanted to do was to take a bit less. They think it is some sort of tax break that we are gifting them out of the Australian purse. That is not what is happening. We just wanted to take a bit less. We know what they do with it. 


I say to those opposite—and I have said this in here before and no-one has ever protested or corrected me—none of you have ever employed anybody. You have never put your hand in your own pocket and pulled out your own money to pay wages or to promote the development of any industry or any business anywhere in my home state—not one of you. When you put your hand in your pocket you have got someone else's money. I tell you now that you are ignorant to what it takes to drive regional economies.


We have had a lot of depression in my home state. We have had a battle because the mob over here decided to knock out the live cattle trade. That absolutely devastated thousands of business enterprises in the middle of a drought, which no-one wants to support. No-one wants to support us to support those people in drought conditions. Here is a serious opportunity for us to develop an area where the impacts on our national interests will be very positive. It will put much into the purse of the nation, so that we can continue to invest in supporting business and regional and provincial communities so that they can employ people.


When they all get a job they can spend their spare time going out to find your wounded possums, strap their legs up, take them home, put them on the teat and try to save them, but until then you have to start to consider supporting this government as we support these industries and as we promote the development of this wonderful state of ours—in my case, the state of Queensland. The invitation stands for all of my Senate colleagues on the other side, including those in the Greens, who I doubt have ever been outside the CBD of Brisbane. Give my office a bell. I will make myself available to take you for a run and to introduce you to some of these people. I cannot guarantee your safety and I cannot guarantee that I will get you home, but the offer stands.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-05-09,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:46):  That is quite the offer. I am disappointed that we are debating this MPI framed in this way. These are very worrying times for me and for all of us who believe that combating climate change is important. Climate science is under attack here and overseas. Every day seems to bring some fresh story of a conservative attack on the scientific consensus that we need to take climate action. This is a time for progressives to work together to achieve real change, but instead what we have from the Greens is, frankly, pretty petty politics in the form of a divisive MPI.


The simple fact is that we are not going to get meaningful climate action from this government. That much is very clear. The only hope for addressing climate change is to change this government and to point out the folly of their position. Instead of deciding to work with us to make that happen, Greens politicians seem much more interested in spending their time attacking the Labor Party, and in doing so they are betraying millions of Australians who want to see meaningful action on climate change.


Labor's position on the Adani mine is consistent. We do not have a special position on this project. Our position is consistent whether we are talking about projects in the Illawarra, the Pilbara, the Galilee Basin or anywhere else. Every project needs to meet the environmental tests. It needs to comply with relevant environmental protections and have the relevant approvals.


We are not interested in propping up mining projects that are not viable. Projects need to make business sense. There are some indications that this project may not. There is a reason that Westpac are not interested in funding these types of projects, and it is not because there was a single protest at one of their events. They stated that it is a commercial decision based on their assessment of the commercial realities, and that is how it ought to be because it is not a great system to have senators making assessments about the commercial viability of individual projects. That is not a pathway for meaningful climate action, and every single one of the Greens political party people sitting up there on the crossbench know that to be true. The market is far better at doing that. 


What we are seeking to do now, and have sought to do for more than a decade, is make sure that the policy settings are right so that the market delivers the kinds of answers we want, by putting a price on carbon. The point that Greens senators from the Greens political party need to understand is that this should not be about a single mine in Queensland. What is needed is a proper policy on climate. What is clear is that that is on offer. It is on offer from this side of the chamber and it is not on offer in any meaningful way from the other side of the chamber, and yet we see all of the focus of the Greens political party directed in this direction.


The government's climate policy does not provide meaningful signals to the market, and we are paying a great price for that. This is largely because—to state the obvious—the government actually do not have a climate policy. The situation is not just embarrassing; it is very dangerous. Last night, we had the Minister for the Environment and Energy admitting that his government is essentially giving up on meeting our commitments under the Paris Agreement to ensure that Australia achieves net zero emissions by 2050. We need action. We need to fulfil our obligations to the international community, and the simple fact is that only a Labor government can deliver this. Whatever hopes Australia may have had for climate action under Prime Minister Turnbull have been well and truly extinguished. There can be little doubt that we will not see meaningful climate action from the coalition.


If we want to change the policy, we need to change government and we need a Labor government. Labor has had a consistent approach to climate for more than a decade. We believe that climate change is a systemic problem and it needs a systemic policy response. We believe that there should be a price on carbon, and it is one of our key policy priorities. If the Greens were serious about delivering climate action, they would work with Labor to bring down this government. Instead, the Greens, under the leadership of Senator Di Natale, seem more interested in attacking Labor. I am growing very tired of the continued cynicism from the Greens political party on climate change. When you watch the position that Greens politicians have taken over the last decade, it is hard sometimes not to suspect that they care more about climate change as a campaign issue than they do about obtaining meaningful action from government on climate policy.


Labor in government will take action on climate. That is what we did last time we were in power, with absolutely no thanks to the Australian Greens. When Labor got elected in 2007, we had an opportunity. There was widespread community support for climate action. The business community had swung behind it, and we sought to make the most of that opportunity. We had Treasury develop policies. We tried to build a wide base of support, support that could endure for meaningful climate action. And that opportunity—let us be very, very clear—was scuttled by the Greens. They voted, in this chamber, against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Let us be clear about the history. If the Greens had voted for the CPRS, Australia would have had a price on carbon for almost a decade. The Greens political party, through their cynicism, ruined our chance to be first movers on climate, and we will never let them forget it, and the environment certainly will not.


My great worry is that the Greens' political leadership are gearing up to do it again—to play a spoiling role. We are actually having another moment for action on climate in this country because, despite all of the best efforts by the climate deniers, there is a convergence of business, scientific and public opinion in support of an emissions intensity scheme. 



Senator Waters interjecting—




Senator McALLISTER:
  'Where are you?' asks Senator Waters. We could ask exactly the same thing about the Greens on this very question. Experts agree that an EIS is as effective as an ETS in curbing carbon emissions—even Professor Garnaut, who was so instrumental in the design of the CPRS. It has widespread community support from businesses all across different industries and sectors. We have seen BHP, AGL and EnergyAustralia come out in support. The Chief Scientist has come out in support. CSIRO has come out in support. The CEFC supports it. The Climate Change Authority supports it. It even has the support of the National Farmers' Federation and the NSW Young Nationals.


The Greens have had countless opportunities to lend their support to an emissions intensity scheme in public statements, in committee reports and in this chamber, and they have been conspicuously silent. Let us be clear. We want practical action that can gain the support of the widest possible base in the Australian community, and the emissions intensity scheme is the best chance we have to bring that into action, to take meaningful action against climate change in this country. My worry is that, when the time comes, Greens politicians are going to refuse to back an EIS for political reasons, just like they did back in 2009. I am worried that Senator Di Natale and the others in the Greens' leadership group are going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good once again and scuttle growing consensus on climate action. I am worried that the campaign team—because it is all about the campaign—may think that their chances at the next election are better if they can show policy difference with Labor, even if it comes at the cost of meaningful and effective climate policy, even if it means standing alongside Labor against a government that is plainly unwilling to take any action. I am worried that the Greens care more about attacking Labor than they do about critiquing a government that is populated by people who, on a daily basis, deny the science of climate change, a government so desperate to divert attention from their own failures in energy policy that they are willing to take lumps of coal into the chamber in the other place. The problem is we need an effective climate policy to drive long-term change, and that can only come from a Labor government.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-05-09,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:56):  Australia is at a crossroads. We have an opportunity to be smart, to be making wise choices, to be heading for a clean, green, prosperous future, but this government is leading us down the wrong path. Instead of saying 'yes' to clean, renewable energy, the Turnbull government is sticking with dirty, polluting coal. Instead of planning for a transition to long-term jobs that assure regional communities a future—the regional communities across the country, including in Queensland—this government is sticking with a dying business model that is leaving people high and dry. Instead of protecting our precious Great Barrier Reef, the Turnbull government is choosing to destroy this precious natural wonder. And, instead of taking note of the structural decline of coal worldwide, this government is backing a losing industry.


Coal is in decline. It is an industry from last century and the century before. We need to usher it out gracefully, plan the transition and look after the workers that are currently working in the coal industry, instead of propping it up. Instead of doing this, instead of listening to local groups across Australia, who are hitting the streets and who are talking to their MPs, this government is only bending to the vested interests. What a diabolical path to lead us all down. What is more, this government's support for the Adani coalmine is being backed by Labor. For all of the talk of Senator McAllister about being concerned about climate, we know the Adani mine is the biggest issue on the Australian agenda, in terms of tackling climate change, that we face. This mega coalmine, which is being pushed by Labor and defended by Labor, as it was just then—a Queensland Labor plan, backed by the Turnbull government—is a certain road to disaster. It is going to spew out 4.6 billion tonnes of carbon and absolutely wipe out any carbon reductions that Australia would otherwise make. As Senator Roberts told us, it is the key to unlocking global climate catastrophe because of the number of other mines that opening this mine would then make possible.


I really want to pay tribute to the many hardworking campaigners who are rallying huge support behind the Stop Adani campaign, and, in particular, I pay tribute to the young people who are taking action and are standing up for a safe, clean future when the government is so badly steering us on a dangerous path. People are coming together and are saying no to a dirty, coal fired future. Australians want a future society and economy that is based on renewable energy. I hear from people across Victoria and across the country that they understand that their kids' and grandkids' future is severely compromised if we leave them a damaged and desperate world that is destroyed by a legacy of polluting, climate-wrecking coal, not to mention the financial legacy of handing over $1 billion to prop up the mine. What a travesty. This is our money. We need to spend it on infrastructure that is going to take us towards a zero-carbon future, not take us in the completely opposite direction.


I spend a lot of time in my place arguing for people to be put back into the infrastructure planning processes. This whole debacle exemplifies the problem where big private companies' interests are put before people. The government has absolutely no time for anyone or anything but its billionaire coal mates. There is the proposed funding for a rail line for Adani while the government is simultaneously ignoring the neglected and failing public transport networks in our cities and towns.


Labor needs to take a stand on this. Labor needs to rule out supporting this mine. We are you, Bill Shorten? Who do you stand with? Senator Chisholm and Senator McAllister, does Labor stand for jobs that do not kill workers via black lung and industries that do not kill the reef? Does Labor stand for clean groundwater for Queensland? Labor needs to rule out supporting this mine. There is so much at stake—too much at stake—for the old parties to be blindly stumbling ahead, backing the vested interests.

That the Senate take note of the document.


I reiterate to the Senate that we still have a very long way to go, in terms of raising the life expectancy for the first nation people of this country. It is about more than life expectancy; it is also about the quality of life for First Australians. I had the opportunity to travel across many parts of the Northern Territory and around Australia on different occasions: in my role as a parliamentarian for the Senate, previously as a minister in the Northern Territory parliament, and also as a journalist. Journalists are always covering and looking at the issues facing first nation people. We are such an incredibly wealthy country, but three per cent of the population still struggles. They have a quality of life that is, by far, a long way from the quality of life of ordinary Australians.


One of the achievements in Closing the Gap this year—and I can only speak about one of the seven targets—is based around education. We in this place, the Senate, know for a fact that education is the key to any child rising above their circumstances. But it is not just education; it is access to good quality education, it is teachers who will be there day in, day out, and it is schools that function and have the resources to cope with the many issues facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.


In the Northern Territory alone we have over 100 Aboriginal languages. We have an Aboriginal Interpreter Service. That reflects the importance of valuing language. But in our schools we still need to look at our teachers having adequate access to the languages spoken by the very students that they teach. What sort of opportunity is there for first-time teachers who are coming through universities to learn a first nations language? Is this something that we should also be considering? Yes, it is. If you talk to educators across the board who work in Indigenous education, they recognise that there must be scope for that. It may not be the priority that it should be for the broader commitment of education to Indigenous students, because, firstly, you have to look at the resourcing and access to schools—and I speak specifically, across our Northern Territory and in our remote regions, about having good schools built and access for housing for not only teachers who come from interstate or other parts of the Northern Territory but the very teachers and the assistant teachers from those communities. They should have access to that. Of course, better housing leads to better life and better living circumstances for those children, many of whom get up hungry each day. When we look at closing the gap and we see that this is one area out of seven targets, we have to say, 'Okay, we're moving somewhere in that direction.'


I go back to the issue of first nations languages. It is something that Australia needs to have a good look at in terms of reaching out to our first nations students. In Arnhem Land, with the Yolngu language, we know that the ability to stay strong in speaking in language, in listening in language and in singing in language, as well as in understanding English, has been a huge success. We only have to look at the late Dr Mandawuy Yunupingu, who used to speak very strongly about the importance of two-way education.


But we have to have the housing to back up the quality of life and we have to have the access to health—and let us have a look at the health statistics. Consider that there are 400 people on renal dialysis just in Central Australia. If you go up the track to Royal Darwin Hospital, you will see another couple of hundred Aboriginal people on dialysis. But the big kicker here is not that you see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people lying on these machines day in, day out—some three times a week, some two times a week—but that that is their routine.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:28):  by leave—Each year the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is required by legislation to consider the draft budget estimates of the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Australian National Audit Office and make recommendations to both houses of parliament. I rise today to fulfil this requirement and to make a statement on whether the committee considers that the proposed funding for these offices is sufficient to carry out their respective mandates.


With regard to the Parliamentary Budget Office, the committee has been informed that the PBO is not seeking supplementation in the 2017-18 budget. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has advised the committee that the PBO's estimated expenses for 2017-18 can be met from within the PBO's existing resources. The committee endorses the proposed 2017-18 budget for the Parliamentary Budget Office and commends the PBO for its high-quality work in support of parliamentarians and the broader community.


With regard to the Australian National Audit Office, the committee has been informed that the Australian National Audit Office is not seeking supplementation in the 2017-18 budget. The Auditor-General has advised the committee that the Australian National Audit Office's resources are adequate for 2017-18 and that he anticipates completing approximately 48 performance audits over this period. Enhanced performance information is a key focus of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. The Australian National Audit Office is continuing to develop its audit methodology in this area so it is to be in a position to audit the annual performance statements of all Commonwealth entities. The committee endorses the proposed budget for the Australian National Audit Office in 2017-18 and commends the Australian National Audit Office for its continuing high-quality work and focus on the Commonwealth performance framework.


In conclusion, the committee will continue to closely monitor the work, programs and draft budget estimates of both the PBO and the Australian National Audit Office. As independent authorities, the PBO and the Australian National Audit Office need to be sufficiently funded to fulfil their legislative requirements and adequately support the parliament. The committee appreciates the efforts of both the Parliamentary Budget Officer and the Auditor-General in maintaining strong working relationships with the parliament and particularly with this committee. They have made themselves available for regular briefings and provided invaluable advice to the committee on a variety of matters. The committee looks forward to continuing these productive relationships.


Finally, the committee draws the parliament's attention to the fact that Mr Phil Bowen has announced his retirement in July. The committee extends its appreciation for Mr Bowen's proficient and meticulous stewardship of the Parliamentary Budget Office in its first five years of operations and notes that the most recent independent review of the PBO, undertaken by Dr Ian Watt, stated that in a short period of time the PBO has developed into a well-regarded, credible, independent, non-partisan source of expertise on the budget cycle, fiscal policy and policy costings. I also table the statement.

The committee looks forward to continuing these productive relationships.


Finally, the committee draws the parliament's attention to the fact that Mr Phil Bowen has announced his retirement in July. The committee extends its appreciation for Mr Bowen's proficient and meticulous stewardship of the Parliamentary Budget Office in its first five years of operations and notes that the most recent independent review of the PBO, undertaken by Dr Ian Watt, stated that in a short period of time the PBO has developed into a well-regarded, credible, independent, non-partisan source of expertise on the budget cycle, fiscal policy and policy costings. I also table the statement.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (20:31):  In March this year I was delighted to attend an ecumenical service at St Paul's Anglican Church in Manuka in celebration of the sapphire jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and to recognise Her Majesty turning 90 last year. The service was attended by more than a couple of hundred people and included many of my parliamentary colleagues, members of the diplomatic corps, representatives of the Australian Defence Force, many community groups and members of the public committed to demonstrating their support for our constitutional arrangements.


It was particularly pleasing to have clergy from various denominations participating in the service and was a powerful demonstration of the unifying influence the Crown and more particularly Her Majesty, our queen, continues to have over the Australian community. A special highlight was the sermon delivered by Archbishop Christopher Prowse from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn. In the archbishop's sermon he spoke of Her Majesty's inspired leadership as being a symbol of unity in a polarised world and the qualities she has demonstrated in service to her people.


I would like to share with the Senate the archbishop's contribution, which was called 'A symbol of unity in a polarised world'. I would like to read two parts of his sermon. In the first part the archbishop said:


In the First Collect for today there is a prayer that seems particularly apt when applied to the qualities of Her Majesty.


The Collect gives thanks to God “to our sovereign Queen Elizabeth”, because God has given her “gifts of faith in your promises, and hope for the future and love of her people”. This I think is the first quality of extraordinary leadership that Her Majesty has given us—living out faith, hope and love. In doing this she is living out the Baptism she has been given in service to her people.


Faith, hope and love are described as the three theological virtues. They are given as gifts from God. They dispose us to do the good. For those who live out these theological virtues of faith, hope and charity, God gives them knowledge of their origins, their motives and their objectives.


For such a long period of time, we can see that Her Majesty has used these Baptismal gifts of faith, hope and love in great service. For the virtuous way that she has lived out her Baptismal calling, we thank God. It is expressed in her tremendous continuous service over so many years.


Importantly for me, the archbishop went on to describe another important quality. He went on to talk about one of the other qualities and said:


A third quality that comes to my mind on this important anniversary today of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, is that she is a symbol of unity in a very polarised world.


   …   …   …


To a certain degree, I find Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II for so many has symbolically held the Commonwealth together. With her many gifts she has been able to embrace so many disparate cultures and societies and to assure them that, ultimately, we must remain united as a global village in a very polarised world. Whether this has happened, in reality, others may comment. However, I am referring to her symbolic presence which is so unifying.


I would just like to reflect briefly on, and to extend my very warm thanks and gratitude to, the Venerable Dr Brian Douglas, Rector of St Paul's, for his assistance, guidance and counsel in organising the service, which was a tremendously gracious way to acknowledge Her Majesty's devotion to public service above self.


In closing, though, may I make one final remark: in recent days, we have learnt that His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh has decided that he will no longer carry out his public engagements, from the autumn of this year. In taking this decision, he has reflected clearly, and he can be comforted by his tremendous service. I am sure I speak on behalf of all Australians when I extend our very best wishes and our sincerest acknowledgement and recognition of his tremendous service in his various roles but, most importantly, his lifelong service and public and private commitment to Her Majesty the Queen.
