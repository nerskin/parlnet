Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (09:31):  by leave—I thank the Senate for the opportunity to speak today. I apologise to the Senate that my personal family circumstances have prevented me from dealing with this earlier.


On 4 September this year, I provided a detailed statement to the Senate addressing concerns that had been raised about my citizenship status. In my statement to the Senate, I informed the chamber that I had completed an RN—renunciation of citizenship—form on 20 April 2016. I did this based on advice from the ALP legal team and out of an abundance of caution. As I have previously informed the Senate, the UK High Commission had previously advised me that I would need to make an application to obtain British citizenship by descent. The renunciation declaration, supporting information and the prescribed fee were sent to the UK Home Office by registered mail on 20 April 2016. On any measure, I took all reasonable steps to renounce any entitlement I might have had to British citizenship by descent. At the time, I received advice that the action I took was sufficient to make me an eligible candidate for election.


On 16 August 2016, some 118 days after I renounced any right to British citizenship, I received confirmation from the UK authorities. It was also at that time, in August 2016, that the previous advice I had received from the UK authorities and had acted on in respect to the ACT Legislative Assembly and the Senate was clearly wrong—I had indeed received British citizenship from my father. Whilst I wish the matter of my renunciation had been dealt with more expeditiously in the UK, the delay had no bearing on the declaration of renunciation I made in April last year. I renounced prior to nomination and was eligible to stand at the 2016 election.


Those opposite know that processing time varies. It took 118 days from the date of my signing and lodging the RN form to the date my renunciation was registered by the British Home Office. I note that this is far longer than the more recent cases for senators and MPs, where renunciation has taken two, three or four days because a special process has been put in place for them to renounce quickly. This special process was not available to me. Those opposite also know that I'm not the only member of this place to have submitted renunciation documents before nomination and to have received confirmation post election. Indeed, there are current senators sitting in this parliament who were in exactly the same position to me in previous parliaments.


It is a matter of enormous regret to me that I was not correctly advised by UK authorities of my citizenship status ahead of my nomination to fill the casual vacancy in the last parliament. However, in relation to this parliament, my eligibility is clear. I have acted at all times on the legal advice available to me. More recently, I have taken further legal advice following the renewed questioning of my eligibility by the government after the High Court's decisions in Re Roberts and Re Canavan. The legal advice that I received from Dr Collins QC also draws on the expert opinion of Mr Berry from the London Bar. Dr Collins's opinion is that: 


… Senator Gallagher had, prior to the date for nominations for the 2016 election, taken all of the steps that were required to be taken by her (not just the reasonable steps required) under British law in order to renounce her British citizenship.


I can assure the Senate that at no time have I received any advice to say that I am ineligible to sit as a senator in the 45th Parliament. I have acted at all times on information from the British High Commission, the British Home Office and the legal advice given to me. I can confirm again that I have no evidence or advice before me that would indicate a problem with my eligibility.


Over the past few days, there have been reports that I, or Labor, were refusing to refer my case to the High Court. I have previously stated that I do not think there is a basis to refer my eligibility to the High Court for determination. I stand by that position. I have also said the referral would ultimately be a matter for the Senate. I stand by that position, too. This is as it should be. It is, however, clear to me that the government has decided I should be referred, despite having full access to all of my legal advice and expert reports for the past two days—a standard, I note, the government doesn't meet with their members of parliament on the matter of the disclosure register.


I have not been provided with any information or copies of any legal advice from the government that justify the position they are taking towards me and on which they justify their hostile referral threats. It may be because such advice does not exist. In light of this, and conscious that the attacks on my legitimacy to sit as a senator will continue to be used by my political opponents, I have formed the view that my situation should be considered by the High Court, despite the lack of any legal advice indicating I have a problem that warrants referral. This is a decision I have taken individually and is based on my own individual circumstances.


This statement today, the statement of 4 September, along with all the documents I have released as part of my disclosure, and the legal advice, indicates just how seriously I take my responsibilities to the Australian Senate and to the people of the ACT. I have provided more information than anyone on my citizenship status, and anyone who reads the full disclosures can see for themselves the difference in standard and content that exists across this side of the chamber.


In conclusion, while I do not agree with the need for this referral, I do not resent it. The success and standing of the Australian Senate is bigger than all of us and should be focused solely on what we are able to deliver together for the Australian people. It is bigger and much more important than the circumstances of individual senators, and acting in a way that protects the reputation and legitimacy of and the confidence in our parliamentary institutions should always, in my humble opinion, be paramount. It is for this reason that I have asked for this referral motion to be moved today.


Finally, I have advised the Leader of the Opposition that I am standing aside from my portfolio responsibilities within the shadow cabinet, as well as from the role of Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, until my case is resolved by the High Court. I will not be making any further comment about this until my case is finalised. I thank the Senate.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2017-12-06,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:38):  by leave—I move:


That, pursuant to section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the Senate refers to the Court of Disputed Returns the following questions—


(a) whether, by reason of s 44(i) of the Constitution, there is a vacancy in the representation of the Australian Capital Territory in the Senate for the place for which Katy Gallagher was returned;


(b) if the answer to Question (a) is ""yes"", by what means and in what manner that vacancy should be filled;


(c) what directions and other orders, if any, should the Court make in order to hear and finally dispose of this reference; and


(d) what, if any, orders should be made as to the costs of these proceedings.


I understand a copy of the motion is now being circulated in the chamber.


In relation to the motion, I have some brief remarks. Senator Gallagher has today requested that her citizenship status be referred to the High Court to bring an end to the attacks on her that are undermining the legitimacy and dignity of this chamber. In taking this step, she and the Labor Party do not in any way resile from the position we have taken since day one: that Senator Gallagher has taken all the steps required under the Australian Constitution to qualify to stand for election as a member of this parliament. But it is now clear the attacks on her will not stop, that these attacks are undermining the dignity and standing of this parliament, and the only way to bring an end to the attacks and restore the standing and dignity of this Senate is to have the High Court settle this once and for all.


The Labor Party takes this step notwithstanding the fact that we have compelling legal advice that Senator Gallagher is entirely qualified to be a member of this parliament. That is because, unlike some in the coalition, she took all necessary steps required to renounce any claim she may have held to dual citizenship. This is in stark contrast to Mr Joyce, Mr Alexander and former Senators Nash and Parry, who never took any steps to check if they were eligible. Like others, and unlike those members and senators, Senator Gallagher met the express test set out by the High Court in Re Canavan at paragraph 72, which states:


Where it can be demonstrated that the person has taken all steps that are reasonably required by the foreign law to renounce his or her citizenship and within his or her power, the constitutional imperative—


that an Australian citizen not be irremediably prevented by foreign law from participation in representative government—


is engaged.


There is absolutely no doubt Senator Gallagher applied to renounce any entitlement to British citizenship she may have had well before nominations closed for the 2016 election.


In fact, Senator Gallagher has provided the Senate with advice from Adrian Berry of the London bar, a leading expert on British citizenship law, that not only did she take all reasonable steps but she went further: she took all necessary steps to renounce British citizenship according to British law. In other words, Senator Gallagher could not have done any more to renounce her British citizenship in good time before that election was even called. The British Home Office took 118 days to process her renunciation, and I note in passing that Mr Alexander was recently able to have his renunciation processed within one week. It is not within Senator Gallagher's power to determine the time it takes a foreign government to process her renunciation. Labor is therefore confident that Senator Gallagher is constitutionally entitled. As Professor George Williams has stated this morning in The Sydney Morning Herald:


… it is difficult to see the court disqualifying a person because the bureaucracy of another country has taken months to process an application form. There is a low risk of these members offending section 44.


It is not just the case that Senator Gallagher's eligibility is beyond question; so too is her integrity. Those opposite, and everyone in this place, know it. It is now incumbent on the government to follow Labor's lead and ensure that, after it has lost two senators, there are no further doubts over the standing of its senators. Labor does not believe in using this chamber for partisan referrals. For this reason, and in light of Senator Sinodinos's medical circumstances, Labor will not be seeking to refer Senator Sinodinos at this point. However, we note there is significant legal contention about his citizenship status that the government and the chamber may need to consider in due course. For now, we leave that for the government to reflect upon.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-12-06,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:42):  The government will be supporting this motion. The government does not reflect upon the integrity of Senator Gallagher. I want to make that very clear. We do not. We do, of course, reflect upon the integrity of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten. There is one reason, and one reason alone, for the Senate—



Senator Cameron interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron!




Senator BRANDIS:
  Mr President, given the gravity of this matter, I would ask that you be quite firm in ensuring that I am allowed to be heard in silence without interjection from Senator Cameron.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  I call all senators to order. Senator Brandis will be heard.



Senator Cameron interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron! Senator Brandis will be heard in the same silence that Senator Wong was heard in.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  I didn't hear any other noise around the chamber, Senator Collins. Senator Brandis will be heard in the same silence I heard Senator Wong in.




Senator BRANDIS:
  There is one reason, and only one reason, why a motion under section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act should be passed by this Senate, and that is that the Senate is of the view that, on the facts disclosed to it, it is appropriate to refer a senator to the Court of Disputed Returns. Section 376 gives statutory effect to section 47 of the Constitution, which provides:


Until the Parliament otherwise provides—


which it has done by section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act—


any question respecting the qualification of a senator or of a member of the House of Representatives, or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed election to either House, shall be determined by the House in which the question arises.


So, let us be very clear: this motion is being considered by the Senate and, given that it is being moved by the Leader of the Opposition and supported by the government, will be passed, because a question respecting the qualification of a senator, Senator Gallagher, has arisen. The reason it's necessary to make that point is that this procedure should not be used and cannot properly be used to provide political cover. I do not reflect at all on the integrity of Senator Gallagher. I don't doubt for a moment the accuracy and truthfulness of the statements she has made to the Senate. But the assertion that has come from Senator Gallagher and Senator Wong that Senator Gallagher plainly is not disqualified prejudges the very issue which the Senate, by this motion, has asked the High Court to determine. It cannot be right that the Senate is being asked to support a motion to refer a question relating to the qualification of a senator on the basis that there is no question. By passing this motion, as we will, the Senate is plainly determining, under section 47 of the Constitution and section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, that there is a question. It's not a question that reflects upon Senator Gallagher or her integrity or her circumstances, but I just make the point, because it's important to stress it: this motion places the issues that Senator Gallagher and Senator Wong have asserted before the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. It is for that court, not the opinion of the Labor Party's legal advisers, to dispose of the matter now. 


The law as set down in the case of Re Canavan and Re Joyce and others has been settled by the court. The court's reading of section 44(i) of the Constitution is as clear as it is unforgiving. Those from the government and the crossbench who fell foul of section 44(i) didn't do anything wrong, and Senator Gallagher has not done anything wrong, but it is necessary that reasonable steps be taken. One of the issues that goes to the question of reasonableness is the question of timeliness. Even if it be accepted that Senator Gallagher took every necessary step, that does not dispose of the legal question, because the next question that arises is whether every necessary step was taken in a sufficiently timely way. And on that question will the issue of reasonable steps depend, on which I make no further comment in this speech, because it is not a matter for me or this chamber but for the court. 


Finally, let us see now whether, in the other place, those Labor members of parliament—the member for Braddon, the member for Longman, the member for Fremantle and the member for Batman—take the same course. Because as is clear, manifest, on the face of the declarations that they have lodged with the Clerk of the House of Representatives, they had not renounced their dual British citizenship at the time of the 2016 election. In the case of at least two of them, we know that they did not initiate that process until after the writs for the election had been issued, notwithstanding that they had been endorsed more than a year earlier. The question that arises is when Mr Shorten knew about their circumstances that have now been disclosed. I'll say nothing more about it for the moment, but the government does expect that Mr Shorten will take the step in the House of Representatives that has been taken by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and refer those four members to the Court of Disputed Returns because, if he fails to do so, that raises very serious questions about Mr Shorten's own integrity.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2017-12-06,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:50):  I wasn't planning on addressing this issue, but the speech just then from Senator Brandis has compelled me to make a contribution to this debate. Firstly, we will be supporting this referral. I want to acknowledge the steps taken by Senator Gallagher to come forward and the Labor Party for referring Senator Gallagher. We think that's appropriate. But let's just name what's going on here. We've got two classes of politicians. We've got some members of the Labor Party who took steps, took legal advice, and at the time were satisfied that that was enough to disqualify themselves as dual citizens and to mean that they were eligible to stand. Then we've got members of the government who took no steps—who sat in this chamber, knowing they were dual citizens, and took no steps. In fact, they were forced, after the High Court decision, to come clean, like the former President of the Senate and like Minister Nash. She came here at a minute to midnight, as we were about to go home, to put her version of history on the table. It is now clear that she was sitting here, knowing she was ineligible, and did nothing about it. The rank hypocrisy from the Attorney-General is remarkable here. We have members of the government who took no steps, and they've now given the middle finger to the parliament by not disclosing the relevant information in the disclosure form. 


I accept that the High Court needs to make a determination about those Labor members who sought advice and were told that initiating the renunciation process was enough to make sure that they weren't dual citizens. That was based on precedent. I understand that we do need to get some clarity on that. It's important not just for this parliament but for future parliaments to know at what point the test for reasonable steps applies. And that's why we're going to support this referral. That's why we would support referrals in the lower house. 


But don't come in here, Senator Brandis, and lecture this Senate about your role in this, as though somehow the Labor Party have put themselves in the same category as your ministers. They haven't, because what we've seen in this Senate is one party where members have been dual citizens, have taken no steps, have been ineligible and have continued to sit in this chamber and in cabinet. When this first occurred, we had Minister Canavan standing up and saying, 'Given the circumstances, I can no longer sit as a minister.' When it occurred to Minister Nash and, indeed, Minister Joyce, a completely different test was applied. For some reason, they were able to continue in their roles as ministers. We had the President of the Senate issuing orders to the High Court, knowing that he himself was ineligible. The reality is that this government has shown itself to be without integrity and decency and to be hypocritical. To be standing up there and lecturing the opposition as somehow having behaved in a way that is comparable with this government is appalling. 


I make the exception, of course, for former Senator Feeney. Former Senator Feeney is in a category of his own and is now a member of the lower house. The questions about Mr Feeney are: when did he know about what had occurred and when did he know that he didn't have documentation to certify that he was not a dual citizen? Clearly, if it's taken him five months to arrive at this position—and he has been dragged kicking and screaming—I think Mr Feeney is a special case. I think most people would recognise he's a very, very special case, and I think the people of Batman will make it very, very clear that they think he's a very special case.


Mr Feeney has shown himself to be completely lacking in integrity by sitting on information for five months, but members of the government have applied a completely different standard to members of their own team, to ministers, who have been dual citizens, who have taken no steps and have now, through this disclosure process, effectively said, 'We're not going to provide you with the information that you need to have some certainty that we're not dual citizens.' I wasn't planning on making a contribution. I do acknowledge it's been a difficult time for Senator Gallagher. Again, I want to congratulate her on coming forward and the referral, but, please, Attorney-General, next time spare us the sanctimonious hypocrisy that you've just provided the Senate with.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (09:55):  Like Senator Di Natale, I wasn't intending on making a contribution, but I've got to call out that last contribution for the poppycock that it was—absolute hypocrisy itself from the Leader of the Greens. We've got a situation where Senator Di Natale is saying everybody is acting with integrity except for members of the government that he opposes—oh, and except for this other bloke called Mr Feeney, who the Greens almost certainly will be running a candidate against in any subsequent by-election. It is all for political purposes. To everybody up there listening, to everybody watching, it's all theatre for Senator Di Natale. It's got nothing to do with integrity, nothing to do with what should happen and what is the right thing to do—it's all a political opportunity that the Greens now see in the seat of Batman. 


All power to you, Senator Di Natale, and good luck down there in Melbourne if it comes off. But, I must say, your two classes, or your two buckets, don't make any sense either. Here in the Nationals party, when we found out we referred ourselves. Senator Gallagher will go to the High Court now, and that is the right and proper course of action, but let's be very clear that Senator Gallagher apparently became aware that she had issues with her citizenship in April last year, while she sat as a senator, and did absolutely nothing about it. She complains about the time taken by the British bureaucracy to get back to her. If she had done what we did in the Nationals party and had a press conference and told the world about it, I bet you the British bureaucracy would have come back a bit quicker than 118 days. They would have, because she was a sitting senator and they would have acted. But she did not do that. The facts will be established by the High Court—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Canavan, please resume your seat. Order on my left.



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Carr. I am having trouble hearing the minister.



Senator Wong interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  There will opportunities for others to participate in this debate. Until there is silence I am not going to let this debate continue. This is a matter of some importance to the Senate. Could that be kept in mind as we conduct the debate? Senator Wong, there are matters subject to debate and people have an opportunity to participate in those on all sides of the chamber. Senator Canavan.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Thank you, Mr President. The record shows that, when any of the Nationals members or senators have been caught up in these issues, as soon as that information has come to light—




Senator Wong:
  That's a lie. That's a lie.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, on a point of order. Senator Wong should withdraw that interjection that Senator Canavan has told a lie. I was hoping that this debate, given the seriousness of it, would be conducted with decorum and courtesy. All of the interjections have come from the other side.




Senator Wong:
  Mr President, on the point of order: the assertion that Nationals senators immediately disclosed is a lie. It is a lie. And Senator Nash's evidence and the evidence before the High Court demonstrates that.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, that is a debating point. I didn't hear the interjection Senator Brandis referred to.




Senator Wong:
  I said it was a lie when he asserted that all Nationals disclosed as soon as they knew. That has been demonstrated in the evidence before the High Court, including the evidence in relation to his case.



Government senators interjecting—




Senator Wong:
  And I too wish for some decorum—you should control your senators, Senator Brandis. I will take your ruling, Mr President.



The PRESIDENT:  I didn't hear the exact words that were used. What were the exact words used?




Senator Wong:
  If you wish me to withdraw the word 'lie', if it assists the chamber I will do so.



The PRESIDENT:  Yes, that would assist the chamber greatly. Thank you, Senator Wong. And I will ask senators, if they wish to say something in this debate, to cease interjecting and to take the opportunity to participate. This is a matter of some gravity and standing of the Senate, and if we could conduct ourselves accordingly, that would be helpful.




Senator CANAVAN:
  It is a matter of record that as soon as the Nationals senators and member became aware of the legal advice on their situations, they did come clean. We all in this place have decisions to make, and it's easy to make the right decision when the consequences are good for you. It is much more difficult to make the right decision when the consequences could be bad. What we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party is that they have run a protection racket for their members and senators, because to do otherwise would potentially have bad consequences for their political circumstances. Now, tough decisions have been made by the government—to go to a by-election in a place like Bennelong, where we could lose our majority. But it was the right decision. And it is now incumbent on everybody, now that the High Court has clarified this situation—the law is clear—to do the right thing. It may mean that people lose jobs. It may mean that governments or oppositions see changes in the power balance in this place. But the right thing is to refer any matters to the High Court and to clear it up.


We in this place have tried to do that. There have been difficult circumstances for the government. But instead of trying to clarify the situation for the Australian people, instead of providing certainty for this parliament as soon as possible, the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party have played political games, not delivered what is in the national interest, which is to clear up this area of law. Now that this referral has taken place, it will be an opportunity to get to the bottom of it. And perhaps the legal advice the Labor Party has received will prevail. But that is a matter for the High Court now. That is a matter for the appropriate body to determine, and the sooner that can happen the better, so we can get back onto the job we are here to do for the Australian people.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (10:02):  Like Senator Di Natale, I had told Senator Wong that I did not intend to take part in this discussion today. But if we're talking about hypocrisy, while Bill Shorten sure gets some of it, Senator Canavan, you cop the golden medal, for God's sake! I mean, you did the right thing—stood there alongside the Attorney-General, and the Attorney-General stood and said, 'Yes, Senator Canavan will stand down from his ministerial responsibilities,' and that was the fair thing to do. But then, when Barnaby Joyce gets ups, oh no, he can stay. And Senator Nash: you were right, Senator Di Natale; at five minutes to midnight, Senator Nash snuck in here, when we were all going home, and dropped her bucket. The Nationals did not come clean earlier, did not come clean when they should have, and neither did other members of the government. We had Senator Fifield—and Senator Cameron has asked questions about this, and so have I—knowing for weeks that the President of the Senate, Senator Parry, had doubts about his own citizenship. Senator Fifield kept his mouth shut for weeks. Also, according to the reports, other senators in the government knew. Senator Fifield, who is the boss of government business, didn't say to Prime Minister Turnbull, 'Houston, we've got a problem.' For weeks he didn't say a word.


Then there was the Attorney-General, who for 24 hours didn't say a word to the PM, because he was in transit. Haven't you heard of Skype, Senator Brandis? And I mentioned Senator Nash. I say this with a bit of passion, because I was the original target, before the dominoes started to fall. Mr John Cameron, I think his name is—a constitutional nerd in Perth—decided, on a whim, 'I think I'll do something about section 44'—because it was a mess, and it is a mess. And dual citizens should be allowed to be here in some capacity. But he went after it. He thought, 'Hinch runs a small party; he won't have cleaned his act up, so we'll get him,' and he got Scott Ludlam on the way through. The Greens behaved with dignity—while we're talking about hypocrisy. The Greens got up—Ludlam got up, and then Senator Waters got up—and said, 'We resign.' They did it with class, they did it with dignity, and nobody's done much of it since.


Senator Gallagher is offering herself up to the High Court, which is the way it should be. The High Court must make these rulings. But, in the case of Senator Canavan—hypocrisy. Whatever happened to, 'My mother ate my homework?' What happened to that defence?


High Court lawyer David Bennett, former Solicitor-General—he was my lawyer in the High Court, so I know him very well—dumped the mother-ate-my-homework defence because he knew it wouldn't fly. I think there's a case here for Senator Canavan to be referred to the High Court again. They went for another defence. Anyway, I'll leave it to the High Court. I won't do what Prime Minister Turnbull did and say, 'And so the High Court shall rule.' I'll leave it to the High Court. That's where it should be and that's where it should stay. The sooner we get this over and done with and come back clean next year the better.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-12-06,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:05):  I want to briefly contrast the honesty and dignity that Senator Gallagher brought to this debate this morning with the very quick situation that developed under the Attorney-General to try to make this a political issue. For Senator Canavan to get up and say what he did was absolutely outrageous. I agree with you, Senator Hinch. The first defence from Senator Canavan was to blame his mother—'My mum did it, not me'—and that disappeared. And we had the lecture from the Attorney-General about the right thing to do. I'm not sure if the Attorney-General ever gave the Prime Minister the same lecture. Maybe he should walk across to the Prime Minister now and give him the same lecture. The Prime Minister would then have no option but to refer Jason Falinski, Josh Frydenberg, Nola Marino, Julia Banks, Alex Hawke and Michael McCormack from the lower house and Senator Arthur Sinodinos. None of these members have complied with the agreement that was reached, whereas everyone else in the parliament has complied and provided details of their ancestry and their renunciation of any foreign citizenship. None of these MPs have done that. In fact, Jason Falinski argued that he had advice, but he wouldn't provide that advice. Josh Frydenberg says he has received advice from Hungarian, Polish and Australian legal people, but he hasn't provided that advice. Nola Marino says that she has got legal advice. Have we seen that? No, we have not. Julia Banks, Alex Hawke, Michael McCormack and Arthur Sinodinos have all provided an unconvincing letter from the Greek embassy but refused to provide any advice.


I think the hypocrisy that we've seen here demonstrates that the government sees this as an opportunity to kick a political opponent. We know how they have dealt with other matters in this place when it comes to Senator Cash. I contrast the position that Senator Gallagher has taken with the position Senator Cash took in this place to mislead the parliament on at least five occasions and to provide no reasons for her unacceptable conduct as a minister. The Prime Minister should move immediately and refer to the High Court these MPs who have not complied with the agreement between the political parties in this place. It is unacceptable for any of them not to take the same position that Senator Gallagher has. For Senator Canavan to come in here and descend to the level that he did is in complete contrast to the integrity that he did show when he stood aside from the cabinet. But it again demonstrates that Mr Joyce showed no integrity by sitting in cabinet as the Deputy Prime Minister and acting leader of this country when he was not eligible to sit in the House of Representatives.


So I take view that there is a challenge here for the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has to accept this challenge and refer all those members and Senator Sinodinos to the High Court. It is absolutely unacceptable that it is now being left to individuals to put up, because the agreement was that there would be documents provided, that there would be forms filled in and that there would be legal positions put forward. That has not been done. But it has been done by Senator Gallagher, who, again, came in here dignified, honest and was then subjected to a fake argument that people were not going to put her under any pressure. Then a political argument to try and smear other politicians was presented in this place, when the biggest hypocrisy comes from the government, when the biggest hypocrisy comes from the Prime Minister. Maybe this Prime Minister will grow a bit of a backbone and stop being such a jellyback, stop being manipulated by every right-wing idiot in this place, and stand up, do the right thing, refer these members and bring this terrible time for the parliament to an end. 


This is a government in crisis. This is a government in chaos. This is a rabble of a government that cannot lead effectively. All these coalition members are under a cloud. Either they should fess up, do the right thing and refer themselves or the Prime Minister should take some leadership, refer them and make sure that we as a parliament can move on. This parliament is in absolute chaos under this government. This parliament is, I think, more and more being marked down by the Australian public because of the lack of leadership from the Prime Minister and the lack of integrity from some of those on the other side. Every one that I've mentioned—Jason Falinski, Josh Frydenberg, Nola Merino, Julia Banks, Alex Hawke, Michael McCormack and Arthur Sinodinos—should be joining Senator Gallagher in the High Court. At least Senator Gallagher showed the courage, commitment and integrity to refer herself.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:38):  by leave—I move:


That, pursuant to section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the Senate refers to the Court of Disputed Returns the following questions—


(a) whether, by reason of s 44(i) of the Constitution, there is a vacancy in the representation of the Australian Capital Territory in the Senate for the place for which Katy Gallagher was returned;


(b) if the answer to Question (a) is ""yes"", by what means and in what manner that vacancy should be filled;


(c) what directions and other orders, if any, should the Court make in order to hear and finally dispose of this reference; and


(d) what, if any, orders should be made as to the costs of these proceedings.


I understand a copy of the motion is now being circulated in the chamber.


In relation to the motion, I have some brief remarks. Senator Gallagher has today requested that her citizenship status be referred to the High Court to bring an end to the attacks on her that are undermining the legitimacy and dignity of this chamber. In taking this step, she and the Labor Party do not in any way resile from the position we have taken since day one: that Senator Gallagher has taken all the steps required under the Australian Constitution to qualify to stand for election as a member of this parliament. But it is now clear the attacks on her will not stop, that these attacks are undermining the dignity and standing of this parliament, and the only way to bring an end to the attacks and restore the standing and dignity of this Senate is to have the High Court settle this once and for all.


The Labor Party takes this step notwithstanding the fact that we have compelling legal advice that Senator Gallagher is entirely qualified to be a member of this parliament. That is because, unlike some in the coalition, she took all necessary steps required to renounce any claim she may have held to dual citizenship. This is in stark contrast to Mr Joyce, Mr Alexander and former Senators Nash and Parry, who never took any steps to check if they were eligible. Like others, and unlike those members and senators, Senator Gallagher met the express test set out by the High Court in Re Canavan at paragraph 72, which states:


Where it can be demonstrated that the person has taken all steps that are reasonably required by the foreign law to renounce his or her citizenship and within his or her power, the constitutional imperative—


that an Australian citizen not be irremediably prevented by foreign law from participation in representative government—


is engaged.


There is absolutely no doubt Senator Gallagher applied to renounce any entitlement to British citizenship she may have had well before nominations closed for the 2016 election.


In fact, Senator Gallagher has provided the Senate with advice from Adrian Berry of the London bar, a leading expert on British citizenship law, that not only did she take all reasonable steps but she went further: she took all necessary steps to renounce British citizenship according to British law. In other words, Senator Gallagher could not have done any more to renounce her British citizenship in good time before that election was even called. The British Home Office took 118 days to process her renunciation, and I note in passing that Mr Alexander was recently able to have his renunciation processed within one week. It is not within Senator Gallagher's power to determine the time it takes a foreign government to process her renunciation. Labor is therefore confident that Senator Gallagher is constitutionally entitled. As Professor George Williams has stated this morning in The Sydney Morning Herald:


… it is difficult to see the court disqualifying a person because the bureaucracy of another country has taken months to process an application form. There is a low risk of these members offending section 44.


It is not just the case that Senator Gallagher's eligibility is beyond question; so too is her integrity. Those opposite, and everyone in this place, know it. It is now incumbent on the government to follow Labor's lead and ensure that, after it has lost two senators, there are no further doubts over the standing of its senators. Labor does not believe in using this chamber for partisan referrals. For this reason, and in light of Senator Sinodinos's medical circumstances, Labor will not be seeking to refer Senator Sinodinos at this point. However, we note there is significant legal contention about his citizenship status that the government and the chamber may need to consider in due course. For now, we leave that for the government to reflect upon.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:42):  The government will be supporting this motion. The government does not reflect upon the integrity of Senator Gallagher. I want to make that very clear. We do not. We do, of course, reflect upon the integrity of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten. There is one reason, and one reason alone, for the Senate—



Senator Cameron interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron!




Senator BRANDIS:
  Mr President, given the gravity of this matter, I would ask that you be quite firm in ensuring that I am allowed to be heard in silence without interjection from Senator Cameron.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  I call all senators to order. Senator Brandis will be heard.



Senator Cameron interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron! Senator Brandis will be heard in the same silence that Senator Wong was heard in.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  I didn't hear any other noise around the chamber, Senator Collins. Senator Brandis will be heard in the same silence I heard Senator Wong in.




Senator BRANDIS:
  There is one reason, and only one reason, why a motion under section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act should be passed by this Senate, and that is that the Senate is of the view that, on the facts disclosed to it, it is appropriate to refer a senator to the Court of Disputed Returns. Section 376 gives statutory effect to section 47 of the Constitution, which provides:


Until the Parliament otherwise provides—


which it has done by section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act—


any question respecting the qualification of a senator or of a member of the House of Representatives, or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed election to either House, shall be determined by the House in which the question arises.


So, let us be very clear: this motion is being considered by the Senate and, given that it is being moved by the Leader of the Opposition and supported by the government, will be passed, because a question respecting the qualification of a senator, Senator Gallagher, has arisen. The reason it's necessary to make that point is that this procedure should not be used and cannot properly be used to provide political cover. I do not reflect at all on the integrity of Senator Gallagher. I don't doubt for a moment the accuracy and truthfulness of the statements she has made to the Senate. But the assertion that has come from Senator Gallagher and Senator Wong that Senator Gallagher plainly is not disqualified prejudges the very issue which the Senate, by this motion, has asked the High Court to determine. It cannot be right that the Senate is being asked to support a motion to refer a question relating to the qualification of a senator on the basis that there is no question. By passing this motion, as we will, the Senate is plainly determining, under section 47 of the Constitution and section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, that there is a question. It's not a question that reflects upon Senator Gallagher or her integrity or her circumstances, but I just make the point, because it's important to stress it: this motion places the issues that Senator Gallagher and Senator Wong have asserted before the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. It is for that court, not the opinion of the Labor Party's legal advisers, to dispose of the matter now. 


The law as set down in the case of Re Canavan and Re Joyce and others has been settled by the court. The court's reading of section 44(i) of the Constitution is as clear as it is unforgiving. Those from the government and the crossbench who fell foul of section 44(i) didn't do anything wrong, and Senator Gallagher has not done anything wrong, but it is necessary that reasonable steps be taken. One of the issues that goes to the question of reasonableness is the question of timeliness. Even if it be accepted that Senator Gallagher took every necessary step, that does not dispose of the legal question, because the next question that arises is whether every necessary step was taken in a sufficiently timely way. And on that question will the issue of reasonable steps depend, on which I make no further comment in this speech, because it is not a matter for me or this chamber but for the court. 


Finally, let us see now whether, in the other place, those Labor members of parliament—the member for Braddon, the member for Longman, the member for Fremantle and the member for Batman—take the same course. Because as is clear, manifest, on the face of the declarations that they have lodged with the Clerk of the House of Representatives, they had not renounced their dual British citizenship at the time of the 2016 election. In the case of at least two of them, we know that they did not initiate that process until after the writs for the election had been issued, notwithstanding that they had been endorsed more than a year earlier. The question that arises is when Mr Shorten knew about their circumstances that have now been disclosed. I'll say nothing more about it for the moment, but the government does expect that Mr Shorten will take the step in the House of Representatives that has been taken by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and refer those four members to the Court of Disputed Returns because, if he fails to do so, that raises very serious questions about Mr Shorten's own integrity.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2017-12-06,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:50):  I wasn't planning on addressing this issue, but the speech just then from Senator Brandis has compelled me to make a contribution to this debate. Firstly, we will be supporting this referral. I want to acknowledge the steps taken by Senator Gallagher to come forward and the Labor Party for referring Senator Gallagher. We think that's appropriate. But let's just name what's going on here. We've got two classes of politicians. We've got some members of the Labor Party who took steps, took legal advice, and at the time were satisfied that that was enough to disqualify themselves as dual citizens and to mean that they were eligible to stand. Then we've got members of the government who took no steps—who sat in this chamber, knowing they were dual citizens, and took no steps. In fact, they were forced, after the High Court decision, to come clean, like the former President of the Senate and like Minister Nash. She came here at a minute to midnight, as we were about to go home, to put her version of history on the table. It is now clear that she was sitting here, knowing she was ineligible, and did nothing about it. The rank hypocrisy from the Attorney-General is remarkable here. We have members of the government who took no steps, and they've now given the middle finger to the parliament by not disclosing the relevant information in the disclosure form. 


I accept that the High Court needs to make a determination about those Labor members who sought advice and were told that initiating the renunciation process was enough to make sure that they weren't dual citizens. That was based on precedent. I understand that we do need to get some clarity on that. It's important not just for this parliament but for future parliaments to know at what point the test for reasonable steps applies. And that's why we're going to support this referral. That's why we would support referrals in the lower house. 


But don't come in here, Senator Brandis, and lecture this Senate about your role in this, as though somehow the Labor Party have put themselves in the same category as your ministers. They haven't, because what we've seen in this Senate is one party where members have been dual citizens, have taken no steps, have been ineligible and have continued to sit in this chamber and in cabinet. When this first occurred, we had Minister Canavan standing up and saying, 'Given the circumstances, I can no longer sit as a minister.' When it occurred to Minister Nash and, indeed, Minister Joyce, a completely different test was applied. For some reason, they were able to continue in their roles as ministers. We had the President of the Senate issuing orders to the High Court, knowing that he himself was ineligible. The reality is that this government has shown itself to be without integrity and decency and to be hypocritical. To be standing up there and lecturing the opposition as somehow having behaved in a way that is comparable with this government is appalling. 


I make the exception, of course, for former Senator Feeney. Former Senator Feeney is in a category of his own and is now a member of the lower house. The questions about Mr Feeney are: when did he know about what had occurred and when did he know that he didn't have documentation to certify that he was not a dual citizen? Clearly, if it's taken him five months to arrive at this position—and he has been dragged kicking and screaming—I think Mr Feeney is a special case. I think most people would recognise he's a very, very special case, and I think the people of Batman will make it very, very clear that they think he's a very special case.


Mr Feeney has shown himself to be completely lacking in integrity by sitting on information for five months, but members of the government have applied a completely different standard to members of their own team, to ministers, who have been dual citizens, who have taken no steps and have now, through this disclosure process, effectively said, 'We're not going to provide you with the information that you need to have some certainty that we're not dual citizens.' I wasn't planning on making a contribution. I do acknowledge it's been a difficult time for Senator Gallagher. Again, I want to congratulate her on coming forward and the referral, but, please, Attorney-General, next time spare us the sanctimonious hypocrisy that you've just provided the Senate with.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (09:55):  Like Senator Di Natale, I wasn't intending on making a contribution, but I've got to call out that last contribution for the poppycock that it was—absolute hypocrisy itself from the Leader of the Greens. We've got a situation where Senator Di Natale is saying everybody is acting with integrity except for members of the government that he opposes—oh, and except for this other bloke called Mr Feeney, who the Greens almost certainly will be running a candidate against in any subsequent by-election. It is all for political purposes. To everybody up there listening, to everybody watching, it's all theatre for Senator Di Natale. It's got nothing to do with integrity, nothing to do with what should happen and what is the right thing to do—it's all a political opportunity that the Greens now see in the seat of Batman. 


All power to you, Senator Di Natale, and good luck down there in Melbourne if it comes off. But, I must say, your two classes, or your two buckets, don't make any sense either. Here in the Nationals party, when we found out we referred ourselves. Senator Gallagher will go to the High Court now, and that is the right and proper course of action, but let's be very clear that Senator Gallagher apparently became aware that she had issues with her citizenship in April last year, while she sat as a senator, and did absolutely nothing about it. She complains about the time taken by the British bureaucracy to get back to her. If she had done what we did in the Nationals party and had a press conference and told the world about it, I bet you the British bureaucracy would have come back a bit quicker than 118 days. They would have, because she was a sitting senator and they would have acted. But she did not do that. The facts will be established by the High Court—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Canavan, please resume your seat. Order on my left.



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Carr. I am having trouble hearing the minister.



Senator Wong interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  There will opportunities for others to participate in this debate. Until there is silence I am not going to let this debate continue. This is a matter of some importance to the Senate. Could that be kept in mind as we conduct the debate? Senator Wong, there are matters subject to debate and people have an opportunity to participate in those on all sides of the chamber. Senator Canavan.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Thank you, Mr President. The record shows that, when any of the Nationals members or senators have been caught up in these issues, as soon as that information has come to light—




Senator Wong:
  That's a lie. That's a lie.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, on a point of order. Senator Wong should withdraw that interjection that Senator Canavan has told a lie. I was hoping that this debate, given the seriousness of it, would be conducted with decorum and courtesy. All of the interjections have come from the other side.




Senator Wong:
  Mr President, on the point of order: the assertion that Nationals senators immediately disclosed is a lie. It is a lie. And Senator Nash's evidence and the evidence before the High Court demonstrates that.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, that is a debating point. I didn't hear the interjection Senator Brandis referred to.




Senator Wong:
  I said it was a lie when he asserted that all Nationals disclosed as soon as they knew. That has been demonstrated in the evidence before the High Court, including the evidence in relation to his case.



Government senators interjecting—




Senator Wong:
  And I too wish for some decorum—you should control your senators, Senator Brandis. I will take your ruling, Mr President.



The PRESIDENT:  I didn't hear the exact words that were used. What were the exact words used?




Senator Wong:
  If you wish me to withdraw the word 'lie', if it assists the chamber I will do so.



The PRESIDENT:  Yes, that would assist the chamber greatly. Thank you, Senator Wong. And I will ask senators, if they wish to say something in this debate, to cease interjecting and to take the opportunity to participate. This is a matter of some gravity and standing of the Senate, and if we could conduct ourselves accordingly, that would be helpful.




Senator CANAVAN:
  It is a matter of record that as soon as the Nationals senators and member became aware of the legal advice on their situations, they did come clean. We all in this place have decisions to make, and it's easy to make the right decision when the consequences are good for you. It is much more difficult to make the right decision when the consequences could be bad. What we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party is that they have run a protection racket for their members and senators, because to do otherwise would potentially have bad consequences for their political circumstances. Now, tough decisions have been made by the government—to go to a by-election in a place like Bennelong, where we could lose our majority. But it was the right decision. And it is now incumbent on everybody, now that the High Court has clarified this situation—the law is clear—to do the right thing. It may mean that people lose jobs. It may mean that governments or oppositions see changes in the power balance in this place. But the right thing is to refer any matters to the High Court and to clear it up.


We in this place have tried to do that. There have been difficult circumstances for the government. But instead of trying to clarify the situation for the Australian people, instead of providing certainty for this parliament as soon as possible, the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party have played political games, not delivered what is in the national interest, which is to clear up this area of law. Now that this referral has taken place, it will be an opportunity to get to the bottom of it. And perhaps the legal advice the Labor Party has received will prevail. But that is a matter for the High Court now. That is a matter for the appropriate body to determine, and the sooner that can happen the better, so we can get back onto the job we are here to do for the Australian people.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (10:02):  Like Senator Di Natale, I had told Senator Wong that I did not intend to take part in this discussion today. But if we're talking about hypocrisy, while Bill Shorten sure gets some of it, Senator Canavan, you cop the golden medal, for God's sake! I mean, you did the right thing—stood there alongside the Attorney-General, and the Attorney-General stood and said, 'Yes, Senator Canavan will stand down from his ministerial responsibilities,' and that was the fair thing to do. But then, when Barnaby Joyce gets ups, oh no, he can stay. And Senator Nash: you were right, Senator Di Natale; at five minutes to midnight, Senator Nash snuck in here, when we were all going home, and dropped her bucket. The Nationals did not come clean earlier, did not come clean when they should have, and neither did other members of the government. We had Senator Fifield—and Senator Cameron has asked questions about this, and so have I—knowing for weeks that the President of the Senate, Senator Parry, had doubts about his own citizenship. Senator Fifield kept his mouth shut for weeks. Also, according to the reports, other senators in the government knew. Senator Fifield, who is the boss of government business, didn't say to Prime Minister Turnbull, 'Houston, we've got a problem.' For weeks he didn't say a word.


Then there was the Attorney-General, who for 24 hours didn't say a word to the PM, because he was in transit. Haven't you heard of Skype, Senator Brandis? And I mentioned Senator Nash. I say this with a bit of passion, because I was the original target, before the dominoes started to fall. Mr John Cameron, I think his name is—a constitutional nerd in Perth—decided, on a whim, 'I think I'll do something about section 44'—because it was a mess, and it is a mess. And dual citizens should be allowed to be here in some capacity. But he went after it. He thought, 'Hinch runs a small party; he won't have cleaned his act up, so we'll get him,' and he got Scott Ludlam on the way through. The Greens behaved with dignity—while we're talking about hypocrisy. The Greens got up—Ludlam got up, and then Senator Waters got up—and said, 'We resign.' They did it with class, they did it with dignity, and nobody's done much of it since.


Senator Gallagher is offering herself up to the High Court, which is the way it should be. The High Court must make these rulings. But, in the case of Senator Canavan—hypocrisy. Whatever happened to, 'My mother ate my homework?' What happened to that defence?


High Court lawyer David Bennett, former Solicitor-General—he was my lawyer in the High Court, so I know him very well—dumped the mother-ate-my-homework defence because he knew it wouldn't fly. I think there's a case here for Senator Canavan to be referred to the High Court again. They went for another defence. Anyway, I'll leave it to the High Court. I won't do what Prime Minister Turnbull did and say, 'And so the High Court shall rule.' I'll leave it to the High Court. That's where it should be and that's where it should stay. The sooner we get this over and done with and come back clean next year the better.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-12-06,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:05):  I want to briefly contrast the honesty and dignity that Senator Gallagher brought to this debate this morning with the very quick situation that developed under the Attorney-General to try to make this a political issue. For Senator Canavan to get up and say what he did was absolutely outrageous. I agree with you, Senator Hinch. The first defence from Senator Canavan was to blame his mother—'My mum did it, not me'—and that disappeared. And we had the lecture from the Attorney-General about the right thing to do. I'm not sure if the Attorney-General ever gave the Prime Minister the same lecture. Maybe he should walk across to the Prime Minister now and give him the same lecture. The Prime Minister would then have no option but to refer Jason Falinski, Josh Frydenberg, Nola Marino, Julia Banks, Alex Hawke and Michael McCormack from the lower house and Senator Arthur Sinodinos. None of these members have complied with the agreement that was reached, whereas everyone else in the parliament has complied and provided details of their ancestry and their renunciation of any foreign citizenship. None of these MPs have done that. In fact, Jason Falinski argued that he had advice, but he wouldn't provide that advice. Josh Frydenberg says he has received advice from Hungarian, Polish and Australian legal people, but he hasn't provided that advice. Nola Marino says that she has got legal advice. Have we seen that? No, we have not. Julia Banks, Alex Hawke, Michael McCormack and Arthur Sinodinos have all provided an unconvincing letter from the Greek embassy but refused to provide any advice.


I think the hypocrisy that we've seen here demonstrates that the government sees this as an opportunity to kick a political opponent. We know how they have dealt with other matters in this place when it comes to Senator Cash. I contrast the position that Senator Gallagher has taken with the position Senator Cash took in this place to mislead the parliament on at least five occasions and to provide no reasons for her unacceptable conduct as a minister. The Prime Minister should move immediately and refer to the High Court these MPs who have not complied with the agreement between the political parties in this place. It is unacceptable for any of them not to take the same position that Senator Gallagher has. For Senator Canavan to come in here and descend to the level that he did is in complete contrast to the integrity that he did show when he stood aside from the cabinet. But it again demonstrates that Mr Joyce showed no integrity by sitting in cabinet as the Deputy Prime Minister and acting leader of this country when he was not eligible to sit in the House of Representatives.


So I take view that there is a challenge here for the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has to accept this challenge and refer all those members and Senator Sinodinos to the High Court. It is absolutely unacceptable that it is now being left to individuals to put up, because the agreement was that there would be documents provided, that there would be forms filled in and that there would be legal positions put forward. That has not been done. But it has been done by Senator Gallagher, who, again, came in here dignified, honest and was then subjected to a fake argument that people were not going to put her under any pressure. Then a political argument to try and smear other politicians was presented in this place, when the biggest hypocrisy comes from the government, when the biggest hypocrisy comes from the Prime Minister. Maybe this Prime Minister will grow a bit of a backbone and stop being such a jellyback, stop being manipulated by every right-wing idiot in this place, and stand up, do the right thing, refer these members and bring this terrible time for the parliament to an end. 


This is a government in crisis. This is a government in chaos. This is a rabble of a government that cannot lead effectively. All these coalition members are under a cloud. Either they should fess up, do the right thing and refer themselves or the Prime Minister should take some leadership, refer them and make sure that we as a parliament can move on. This parliament is in absolute chaos under this government. This parliament is, I think, more and more being marked down by the Australian public because of the lack of leadership from the Prime Minister and the lack of integrity from some of those on the other side. Every one that I've mentioned—Jason Falinski, Josh Frydenberg, Nola Merino, Julia Banks, Alex Hawke, Michael McCormack and Arthur Sinodinos—should be joining Senator Gallagher in the High Court. At least Senator Gallagher showed the courage, commitment and integrity to refer herself. 


Question agreed to.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (10:13):  My contribution in relation to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017 revolves very much around the fact that the proposition is to abolish the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and absorb it into this new Australian Financial Complaints Authority. Whilst the opposition doesn't have concerns about the ombudsman services being combined, as I have previously indicated, we do have major concerns about the changes to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. 


Some of these concerns were raised by Helen Davis, the chair of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, during the committee's inquiry, and I thank her for her contribution. I would like to also say that this lends support to the Labor view that the tribunal should continue to stand alone. The CPSU's submission to the committee's inquiry is also very informative. They pointed to the fact that the proposed scheme will reduce consumer protections and rights in relation to superannuation matters. They also indicated that the focus of the SCT does not address the widespread community concerns about the operations of the financial services sector. They make the very cogent point that radical changes are being proposed for the superannuation industry, which has not seen anything close to the litany of scandals that have beset the finance sector. In other submissions to the committee's inquiry, I note a number of other reservations to the changes being made.


In closing, I would like to thank Senator Gallagher for her work in this area. Obviously, her highly principled actions this morning speak volumes for her integrity. I also know that Senator Gallagher is passionate about the need for the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to continue with its functions, as am I. I also thank Senator McAllister, who acted as deputy chair of the committee for a time. We believe that the integrity of our super system is too valuable to risk and we do not support the weakening of this body.

"Anning, Sen Fraser",IND,2017-12-06,"



Senator ANNING
 (Queensland) (10:16):  This is not my first speech. I rise to speak to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017. The bill amends the Corporations Act to establish a new dispute resolution body, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, to ensure that consumers and small businesses have access to free, fast and binding dispute resolution. The bill comes on the back of the Ramsay review of 2016, which recommends that significant reform is needed in the disputes resolution process. It also implements the recommendation of the Carnell report to establish a small business disputes resolution one-stop-shop to hear credit disputes for amounts up to $5 million. The AFCA will replace the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Credit and Investments Ombudsman and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, but it will have additional statutory powers.


The Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, will be responsible for ensuring that AFCA meets the standards set out in the legislation. The bill will provide ASIC with the ability to set regulatory requirements that AFCA must meet, and the power to compel AFCA to comply with the standards set out in the legislation. Under the AFCA, consumers and small businesses will be able to have their disputes with financial firms heard and determined by AFCA, at no cost. Under the current system, it is difficult to achieve comparable outcomes for customers with similar complaints, because different bodies handle the complaints.


In his second reading speech, the minister stated that the bill forms part of the government's broader commitment to ensuring that banks and other financial institutions are held to account when they fail to meet community expectations. Insofar as this bill does this, I applaud the government's efforts and support this legislation. My only concern is that the role of AFCA may be too limited, particularly in the size of debts that may be considered. Many farmers with debts exceeding $5 million find themselves in trouble with ruthless banks, and I am concerned that they will not be able to access the benefits of this new complaints authority, or that its rulings may be not be sufficiently strong to overcome the vested power of usury. I, and many colleagues from the bush, have heard hundreds of heart-rending stories of how family farms have been stolen by deceptive and amoral lenders. Rural borrowers have faced unconscionable treatment by banks, which have tricked them into overdrafts, based on phoney, inflated valuations, only to have those same farms seized when lenders subsequently revalued the property in order to create an unsustainable debt-to-equity ratio. We have heard of numerous cases where banks sought to foreclose on properties on which repayments were fully paid up to date, claiming so-called 'anticipatory breaches', using fictitious future projections of reduced income.


If these same lending practices were extended to big-city home borrowers, hundreds of thousands of families who are fully up to date on mortgages would lose their homes and there would be rioting in the streets. It is only the fact that the farmers who are victims of usury are in remote locations and small in number that their hardship and misery are hidden from the wider population. This is along with the waves of suicides that follow the loss of properties that have been in families for generations. 


Because of my concern to ensure that this bill does, effectively, help rural borrowers in these dire straits, I will be supporting the government's amendment that calls for a review of AFCA 18 months after it's established. This amendment will require the minister to commission an independent review of the effectiveness of the AFCA scheme regarding rural debts. The aim of this review will be to consider the limit on the value of claims established by the bill and to consider the effectiveness and fairness of remedies provided by the authority once it commences operation, particularly considering feedback from complainants. Since a proposal for an 18-month review of the effectiveness of this authority is entirely consistent with the stated intent of this bill, I strongly encourage all senators to support the government's amendment.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2017-12-06,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (10:21):  The bill we're debating today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017, arises from the Turnbull government's policy to set up a one-stop shop for consumers' complaints about financial services. In doing so, the bill combines three existing external dispute resolution schemes, the Financial Ombudsman Service, FOS; the Credit and Investments Ombudsman, CIO; and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, SCT. The new body will be known as the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, AFCA. For the FOS and CIO, this is simply a merging and rebranding of the two existing services. 


We, of course, welcome higher monetary thresholds for disputes that can be heard. But the government is not proposing any new or additional powers that the existing dispute resolution bodies don't already have. The bill also purports to copy the powers of the SCT into the AFCA. However, as the AFCA will be a private company limited by guarantee, this bill will result in reduced consumer protections for superannuation disputes. The chair of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, Helen Davis, said:


I don't think it would be true to say, in relation to super, that it's a rebranding exercise. Arguably, it's quite a significant change for superannuation, specifically in terms of the external dispute resolution. It goes from a statutory body to a non-statutory body. It moved from a specialist body to a one-stop-shop body.


There are many important differences between the SCT and the proposed AFCA that stakeholders say will result in reduced protections. Their bill does not retain appeal rights that are currently available for the administrative decisions of the SCT. The SCT has the power to require information shared at the initial review stage to be kept confidential, which can include highly sensitive personal information. The SCT has an explicit statutory power to cancel the membership of a life policy fund if it finds the conduct relating to the selling of that fund was unfair or unreasonable. There is no limit on the value of the claim that the SCT is allowed to hear and, as a private body, the AFCA is not subject to freedom-of-information claims. 


The government claims its reason for shutting down the SCT is due to delays in its resolution of complaints, but this is somewhat hypocritical when the delays have clearly been caused by the funding and staff cuts, at the SCT, inflicted by this government. Another good argument to retain the SCT is that it is a specialist body with skilled and professional staff. Superannuation can be a very complex area, requiring specialists and technical skills. While there is a significant overlap in the types of complaints received by the FOS and the CIO, this is not true of the complaints dealt with by these bodies and the SCT. 


To back up my comments about the retention of the SCT as a separate body, I refer to the additional comments of Labor senators submitted to the Senate inquiry into this bill. As well as outlining the arguments I just mentioned, Labor senators said:


No persuasive evidence was received during this inquiry that demonstrated that the SCT's arrangement was unsuitable, apart from its funding level.


So, I've yet to hear a persuasive argument from those opposite about why the SCT should not be retained in its present form, albeit with the funding cuts reversed, so it can deal with the current backlog of complaints.


Labor does not support the abolition of the SCT, and we will be moving an amendment to this bill to retain the SCT as a separate statutory body. Should Labor's amendments to retain the SCT be supported, we are left with a bill that, as I said, will essentially be a rebranding exercise. It is certainly no substitute for re-election on addressing the poor conduct of the banks. It is no substitute for the royal commission, for which Labor has been calling for 18 months and which this government has now belatedly announced. And, while the government claimed to be taking action to address the numerous examples of inappropriate financial advice, insurance claims that are unfairly declined, loan fraud, irresponsible lending and cover-ups, more stories continue to emerge from victims and whistleblowers even now. I'm sure every member and senator in this place would have at least one story, if not several, of a constituent who has fallen victim to misconduct by banks or financial institutions.


Let me tell you just one of my stories. This is a story about a Tasmanian couple who approached my office for help. Rather than use their real names, I'll call them John and Mary. John and Mary applied for a loan through a mortgage lender. When the lender met with them at their home, he appeared to be in a hurry and did not ask for any financial details. He just sought personal details such as names, dates of birth and driver's licence numbers. When John and Mary asked the lender about including their financial details on the form they were told that they would fill in the rest later. A few years after being granted the loan, they obtained copies of their application forms, only to find their financial information had been completely manufactured. The application stated that the couple owned a small business and also showed that they were both drawing an income from the business. John and Mary had actually stopped working in the business four years prior, when the business they leased was sold. Even when the business had been performing well, they had only ever drawn half the salary that was reported on their form. The application form also significantly overinflated the equity in their business. In total, John and Mary counted 78 fabricated facts that were added to the forms without their consent or knowledge after their signatures were obtained.


This is a clear breach of the Code of Banking Practice, which provides that:


Before we offer or give you a credit facility (or increase an existing credit facility), we will exercise the care and skill of a diligent and prudent banker in selecting and applying our credit assessment methods and in forming our opinion about your ability to repay it.


John and Mary lodged a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service, but their complaint was dismissed. Without the protection of the FOS their only option was to seek legal redress. But as low-income earners—one doing casual work and another one on a pension—they could not afford a lawyer. As for legal aid, John recently told my office, 'No legal aid lawyer in their right mind would take on the banks.'


The mortgage lending industry may claim that the issues faced by victims like John and Mary have been addressed by the industry, and this is something we're continually told by the financial services industry. But time and time again, new claims arise. The Australian reported just last week that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, or ASIC, is investigating several large and small lenders for fabrication of documents. The week before that, National Australia Bank sacked 20 bankers and disciplined a further 32 after it was discovered that false information had been used in around 2,300 loan applications.


Loan fraud is just one of many examples of misconduct in the industry. As Labor has said time and time again—for month after month, in fact—we need a royal commission to get to the bottom of the rorts and rip-offs and to restore confidence in Australia's financial services industry. I find it incredible that Mr Turnbull and his government would spend 18 months fighting a royal commission only to do one of the biggest backflips we have ever seen and capitulate now. They rejected Labor's call for a royal commission and they rejected the call of families and small businesses who had been hurt by the bank's bad behaviour. They even refused to call a royal commission despite the numerous reports of whistleblowers. But when the banks themselves wrote to Mr Turnbull and accepted the need for a royal commission, it took him one day to finally fold. Mr Turnbull waiting on permission from the banks to call a royal commission is like saying he needs a note from his mum—and I don't mean in the Senator Canavan way.


The banks' letter to the government make for interesting reading. Here are a few extracts from that letter. In three instances, the banks refer to the need to act: 


… it is now imperative for the Australian Government to act decisively to deliver certainty to Australia’s financial services sector.


…   …   …


… it is now in the national interest for the political uncertainty to end …


…   …   …


We now ask you and your government to act to ensure a properly constituted inquiry into the financial services sector is established to put an end to the uncertainty …


I think all of those comments can be read as, 'We know an inquiry is inevitable, so we give you permission to get on with it, get it over with and get it done with.' In their letter, the banks' CEOs also said:


In our view, a properly constituted inquiry must have several significant characteristics.


In other words, 'Let us explain to you how we want this thing to be run.'


The letter said:


Its terms of reference should be thoughtfully drafted and free of political influence.


In other words, 'Give us a call. We'll tell you what we want the terms of reference to be and then you can draft it.'


Another quote is:


It is also important that any inquiry reports back in a timely manner so that we can have certainty about the findings and move forward to implement any recommendations.


Once again they're saying, 'Let's get this over and done with ASAP.'


Was the banks' call for a royal commission, and this government's acceptance of that call, done in the spirit of public interest? I think not. It's as clear as day to every Australian that the banks and the government saw the writing on the wall. They knew the pressure was on, they knew the pressure was growing and they knew that an inquiry was inevitable. Rather than accepting the need for a royal commission, after months of holding out against public pressure and pressure from the Labor Party, this government has been dragged kicking and screaming to this new position. It was a backflip of epic proportions, one that would impress an Olympic gymnast. Only on Tuesday of last week, Mr Turnbull was still insisting that his government would not call a royal commission. Two days later, he was announcing one. I think Senator O'Sullivan's comment that the Prime Minister had been dragged to the table is quite apt. In fact, my earlier description of him being dragged kicking and screaming is not that original; it's the same description used by Mr Christensen, a member of the coalition's own backbench, to describe what has recently transpired. And just to show what an extraordinary backflip this was, let's examine what the government had to say about a royal commission previously. Mr Turnbull said:


The only beneficiaries from a royal commission would be, frankly, the legal profession.


He also described a royal commission as something that would go on for years, cost hundreds of millions of dollars and not tell us anything new. Mr Turnbull's Treasurer, Mr Morrison, described Labor's calls for a royal commission as 'a cynical political exercise' which sought to cynically exploit people's genuine concerns and politicise their pain. Mr Morrison also described it as a 'crass populist approach' to the issue.


After such a humiliating backflip, this government will no doubt be choking on their words. This is clearly another desperate tactic by this Prime Minister to hold on to his leadership. It's an attempt to hold off a backbench revolt, just like Mr Turnbull's decision to cancel a week of sitting of the House of Representatives was. Whichever way this government tries to spin it, these decisions are about Mr Turnbull's political interests, not Australia's national interest.


If Mr Turnbull were a decisive leader, a leader who was governing in the national interest, he would not be lurching from crisis to crisis. He would not be belatedly bowing to public pressure. Instead, he would have called a royal commission months or even years ago, and the commission could have handed down its report by now. We could be debating and implementing the recommendations right now if he'd called it even 18 months ago. A royal commission into the banks is in the national interest, but the national interest is not what Mr Turnbull and his government are motivated by. While we welcome this announcement, we would prefer it be done for the right reasons. Let's hope it's not a token exercise, which is what it appears to be, given the rushed manner in which it has been announced. 


We know from evidence recently given by ASIC's deputy president, Peter Kell, that the government did not consult ASIC on their decision to launch a royal commission or on the terms of reference. We also know, from groups representing the victims of banking scandals, that the victims weren't consulted either. The government certainly didn't consult with the opposition. We'll just have to wait and see how effective this inquiry is, because we know the terms of reference could be much stronger. 


It's cold comfort to the victims of many banking scandals over the years that the government have finally called a royal commission not because they thought it was actually necessary but because their mates in the banks told them to do it. One of the clauses in the terms of reference provides that the royal commission is not required to inquire into 'macro-prudential policy, regulation or oversight'. This basically means it will not be looking at whether the regulatory framework for our financial system is effective and up to date. It also appears that the government, in a partisan fashion, is using this royal commission as a cynical opportunity to attack industry superannuation funds. 


The lack of consultation over the terms of reference is disappointing. We on this side will be doing our best to improve them. Labor is working with the government to ensure we have a royal commission that has real teeth, one that can provide some comfort and confidence for the millions of Australians who rely on banks to take care of their borrowings and savings. We certainly want a stronger response to misconduct in the financial services industry, something stronger than just the rebranding exercise in this bill. 


There are a few positives in this bill, such as the lifting of the threshold for disputes that can be heard, removing the competition between the FOS and the CIO for the membership of financial services firms, and additional oversight powers for ASIC. However, I refer to my earlier arguments and I once again emphasise that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal should be retained in its present form. As such, I urge all senators to support Labor's amendments when they come to the Senate.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-12-06,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:37):  From the outset, may I express my reservations about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017. This is another attempt by the government—like governments of all persuasions—to appear to be doing something meaningful to address a substantive problem that they've tried to avoid addressing for a very long time. In this case, it dates back to Mr Hockey. When he was Treasurer in 2013, he had the Financial System Inquiry. It reported in 2014. Then we had the Ramsay review, commissioned in 2016, into the complaints framework in financial services. That report was released on 9 May of this year. Both of those inquiries were designed to avoid a royal commission into the banking and financial sector, and they've gestated and given birth to the bill that we see before us now. 


I've never been a supporter of a royal commission into banks. I believe—and I said this to some senior banking executives—there was a degree of inevitability about it because of what the National Party was doing, with the support of the Greens, the Labor Party and others. That doesn't mean that I fully support it, but it will be coming into being now, with the government having initiated it. The terms of reference may not satisfy some in the building, but at least the royal commission will provide a complete ventilation of many of the issues that people have been talking about, including the Financial Complaints Authority. That's why my advice to the government, for what it is worth, is that they shouldn't be proceeding with this bill. This is front running that was designed to avoid a royal commission and an inquiry into the financial services sector, but principally the banks. They now have that and, yet, they're still proceeding with this bill. It's not saving a substantial amount of money, it's not reducing bureaucracy. In actual fact, I think what it's going to do is create an environment where people will be treated differently according to how their advice was received.


Currently, within the financial services framework, there is a huge difference between a bank wealth management arm, for example, with all the billions of dollars' worth of resources available to it—and the inherent conflicts of interest that also go with that, I must say—to an independently owned financial planning arm, a licensee of a broader financial services licence holder, a truly independent fee-only adviser versus your suburban accountant who might be providing some advice on self-managed superannuation funds, or they might have a specialist financial planner in there. They're different entities. The people accessing them have different expectations. As a result, I believe that those individual entities should have the right to choose a complaints mechanism that will work for them, that is going to be responsive and understanding of the different applications that go right through the financial services sector, rather than merging entities into one that is essentially going to be operating for the big corporates. That's the conclusion that I've drawn—it will be operating for the big banks, it will be mired in bureaucracy, it will force a compliance regime almost that will make the independently owned financial planner or the smaller shop almost unviable.


Choice in complaints resolution is critical, in my view. Not only does it foster competition and more responsiveness but it will, I think, keep costs down. And let's make no mistake about this. The cost of compliance when you're providing advice to clients or providing any services associated with money means it's becoming almost prohibitive to provide specialised or personalised financial advice to the smaller mum-and-dad investor, if I can put it like that. For the person that is starting out and accumulating a nest egg, saying, 'Well, I'd like some financial planning advice,' it's not viable. It's not viable for them to access personalised financial planning advice, because the compliance is enormous.


I understand that this compliance has grown over the course of time because of rogue advisers, dishonest acts and the fact that, wherever there is a pool of money, you will find rogues and sharks attracted to it. That is simply the way. But legislating for the aberrations is wrong. I think what is much more important is: where something has been done incorrectly, where criminal activity has taken place, that that be pursued to the full extent of the law, not that you should have to cause people to fill in 150 pages of documents before they can access it. Where rogues exist, kick them out of the industry. Ensure that clients are compensated. But the best way you can do it is to make it crystal clear what people are signing up to—and say, 'This is what we're putting you into. This is the fee that's going to be attached to it. This is the service you can expect'—and not hide it at the back of the fat bit of puffery in the client forms. Put it front and centre, explain it to them, get them to initial every particular point and get them to understand the risks attached to it.


It highlights, I must say, the lack of financial education that is taking place in this country. It is another area where governments of successive persuasions have been abject failures, quite frankly. They say they've got the ASIC MoneySmart website to warn of scams and all of that. That's great; it's fantastic. But when our children come out of the school system and don't understand the difference between compound and simple interest, or even the most basic fundamentals of investing, you think it is a scandal. Education shouldn't just be about history or the application of literature; it should be about equipping them with very sound and sensible life skills.


There are two areas in this where I think you can radically change individuals' lives, and particularly children's. If you equip them with good money habits and an understanding of investment, you will offer them choices and freedom that is otherwise unavailable to them. Similarly, I would say that, if you can teach people to maintain good health habits, you will equip them with a lifetime of, all things being equal, mobility that is going to serve them in good stead as well. I put my money where my mouth is and I wrote a couple of little books for children in this regard on both of those topics because I think they are absolutely critical to the success and the well-rounding of an individual.


They are two abject failures of our education system, and no amount of tinkering around the edges will protect individuals where their own knowledge is deficient. I don't say that to malign the individuals, but, if you do not understand even the most basics of what is being put in front of you, whether it comes to investment, finance, interest rates or fees, then how can you possibly make an informed judgement? It is little wonder, then, that those people, when it doesn't work for them, start to complain about how they've been mistreated and wrongly sold a product or an environment.


That is why the relationship between the adviser and the client is critical—so that they get to know each other, so that they get to know the goals and so that the client can trust them. If we deny individuals that by removing the choice of a complaints mechanism and driving up the cost of financial advice and planning, we limit the ability for individuals to access financial advice. Then, of course, they're driven into the one-size-fits-all fund, which often is the most expensive. These massive retail funds, run by banks or anyone else in their wealth management arms, often have onerous fees and duplicate multiple levels of fees. I'm inherently not attracted to the consolidation of these complaints mechanisms and review mechanisms. I think that it is critical that we provide choice.


I understand that the Labor Party have some amendments to excise the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal from this bill. I also understand that the motives may be less than pure, if I can put it like that.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  I'm sorry to make those suggestions to you, Senator Collins, through you, Acting Deputy Chair, but the fact that the ACTU and the CPSU are opposed to the incorporation of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal suggests that it's more about the unionised workforce than almost anything else. However, notwithstanding my misgivings regarding your motivations, I'm inclined to support the amendments because I do think that even having two choices in the superannuation space, for example, is much better than having only one.


My preference would be to shelve this bill, quite frankly—and, if the government were smart, they would shelve it and wait for the outcome of the royal commission that they've initiated. I say that because, by their own amendment—I was looking at the running sheet—there is a review of operational amendments still to come. So they're acknowledging that they're going to have a look at this in 18 months time to see if it works and they're doing that in light of the results of the royal commission, which is expected to report in 12 months.


Why are we passing legislation that is going to require a massive amount of change and is going to disrupt an industry? There are many in the financial planning area who have expressed concerns to me with this consolidation and amalgamation and how it's going to affect them and their clients. So why would we be making a change that is going to require a cost—which is, I guess, deleterious to many in the industry—and is going to act in favour of the big banks, whilst at the same time we are having a royal commission, ostensibly into the financial services industry, that is going to examine the conduct of the big banks, amongst many others, and then come back after that and review this legislation? It would be much better, much simpler and much more efficient, given that there is actually a cost to implementing this, to wait until after the royal commission and then say, 'Let's have another look at this.' I'd be happy to go along with that. That would actually be the preferred option.


Whilst I will support the second reading of this bill, I do not commit to its passage or supporting its passage in the third reading. I note there are many concerns in the industry. I note there are many concerns amongst the players involved in it, including the credit industry ombudsman, who said that a banking royal commission should come first before the impact of this and that it impacts upon them. I'm concerned about access to independent financial services, in particular, for the smaller consumers. I'm concerned about the professional indemnity requirements that are going to arise from this, and there are many in that industry as well. This is literally a can of worms that I think is unnecessary, particularly given it was designed to stave off a royal commission. The royal commission has now been enacted, and this bill should be put on the too-hard shelf until the outcome of the royal commission is known.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:50):  I thank all senators who contributed to this debate. And I would like to thank those crossbenchers who have indicated to the government their support for this Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017. This bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 and other related legislation to overhaul the financial system dispute resolution framework by establishing a new one-stop-shop dispute resolution body, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, to ensure that consumers and small businesses have access to a free, fast and binding dispute resolution process.


This bill forms part of the government's broader commitment to ensure that where consumers or small business, in particular, have legitimate grievances about the way they were treated by banks or other financial services providers, there is an avenue for efficient but also binding dispute resolution without having to go through the court system. 


I would like to just pick up on Senator Bernardi contribution's, where he indicated that we should do nothing in relation to this, in relation to improving the dispute resolution processes for consumers and small business until such time as the royal commission has reported. That goes to the heart of one of our core reservations about a royal commission into the banks and the financial system more generally. We were concerned that this is precisely what would happen, that people would use it as an excuse to do nothing, until such time as the report has been received. The government's view is that we need to continue to act, we need to continue to address issues, we need to continue to take real action. This piece of legislation is a core part of our package of taking action to ensure that consumers and small business, in particular, can have the most appropriate access possible to efficient and binding dispute resolution processes. 


Let me make a few other remarks. In addition to the requirements that will be placed on the Australian Financial Complaints Authority via this legislation, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services will have regard to the AFCA's proposed terms of reference in making an authorisation decision, as stated in the government's commitment to One Nation. The Minister for Revenue and Financial Services will require that AFCA's terms of reference will provide that an adverse inference should generally be drawn from a financial services provider's failure to provide information that is material to the resolution of a dispute, except in exceptional and unusual circumstances. In addition to this, it is her intention that for disputes relating to loans, to primary production businesses, including agriculture, forestry and fishery businesses, she will require the compensation cap of up to $2 million for all disputes about a small-business credit facility of up to $5 million. 


I also note the support of both One Nation and Senator Anning for the government's amendments to require a review of AFCA after 18 months. And, again, just responding to some of the issues raised by Senator Bernardi in his contribution, that is just good practice, after a new initiative has been in place for a period, to conduct a review to assess whether it has delivered based on what was intended and, if not, what additional evolutionary improvements can be made to the arrangements that are in place. With those few words, I commend this bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

I advise the chamber that this set of amendments makes a series of non-controversial technical amendments to the bill. It also addresses concerns raised by key stakeholders about the bill's initial draft. The government is proposing these amendments particularly in response to the inquiry into the bill by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. They will provide additional certainty and clarity around aspects of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority's operations to ensure that it operates as effectively as possible. As I have indicated, the amendments are of a technical nature and respond to key concerns raised by superannuation and consumer stakeholders.

 (New South Wales) (10:56):  I indicate that we are not inclined to support these amendments. We believe that the amendments that we have put forward on sheet 8284 would be the appropriate way to deal with this. The amendments on sheet 8284 would maintain the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal in its current form, separate from the proposed AFCA ombudsman body. In October last year, under pressure to call a banking royal commission, the Prime Minister promised to establish a new tribunal to deal with financial service complaints and disputes, but this bill does not create a tribunal. We know that the AFCA is not a tribunal like the Prime Minister promised. It's not even a government authority at all. The word 'authority' in AFCA's name is a misnomer. AFCA is just another ombudsman scheme, in the form of a private company, limited by guarantee. It's another FOS and another CIO. Instead of creating a tribunal, this legislation actually abolishes a tribunal already in place.


Our amendments would protect the tribunal—that is, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal—that has been there for decades. It's a tribunal that operates effectively when it's properly funded. The government, in our view, hasn't made a case to replace a specialist statutory body with the new AFCA. There are three existing financial sector external dispute resolution bodies. The government is replacing the first two bodies—the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman—with another private company, a limited-by-guarantee ombudsman service. AFCA is a merger and a rebranding. ASIC has confirmed that, aside from potential increases in the value of disputes that can be heard, the new AFCA will not have any new powers to resolve consumer disputes that the first two bodies do not already have. In abolishing the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, the bill is much more than a rebranding exercise. Labor believes this will weaken protections and outcomes for consumers.


The design of the SCT recognises that superannuation is not just a regular financial service based on a contractual relationship. The design of the SCT recognises that superannuation trustees are custodians of the retirement savings of millions of Australians. They have obligations to all members, unlike the other two bodies. This bill seeks to replace AFCA. The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal was established as a government statutory tribunal with special powers and expertise to deal with superannuation disputes. The reasons that we seek our amendments are as follows—and I know that's not what's before the chair at the moment, but I just want to explain where we are.


Firstly, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal should remain an independent statutory body. It was established in 1993 and has been effective in resolving disputes within super. Super is not just about another financial product and should not be seen as such. The only real criticism that has been made of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is its delays in resolving some disputes. But it is clear that this is the result of a lack of funding and staff cuts, including a 30 per cent reduction in staff under this government. There is nothing significantly wrong with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal that a suitable funding model wouldn't fix. The SCT has the technical expertise needed for complicated super disputes, as do the adjudicators. This is at risk of being diminished over time with a broad complaints body. The SCT has just under 2,500 complaints in 2016, compared to FOS which has 34,095 complaints. There is a real risk of the superannuation industry cross-subsidising dispute resolution for other parts of the financial services sector, which will affect the hard-earned savings of Australians. The need for a special, standalone superannuation complaints tribunal will become even more important as funds within the superannuation sector continue to grow over time. Submissions to the Senate inquiry and hearings made clear that, despite government's attempts to copy and paste Superannuation Complaints Tribunal powers into the new AFCA body, there are a number of important protections and powers that are missing. Despite potential last-minute government amendments, some of these issues remain outstanding—and we've just received further amendments this morning.


A number of groups, including the Law Council of Australia's Superannuation Committee, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, Industry Super Australia, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand either oppose the abolition of the SCT or have raised concerns about protections that are not included in the new bill or process. Even the SCT chairperson, Helen Davis, told the committee:


I don't think it would be true to say, in relation to super, that it's a rebranding exercise. Arguably, it's quite a significant change for superannuation, specifically in terms of the external dispute resolution. It goes from a statutory body to a non-statutory body. It moved from a specialist body to a one-stop-shop body.


I ask the minister: does the minister agree that this is not a statutory authority?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2017-12-06,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:04):  The government has actually made that point very clear throughout the debate. The government is acting on the independent advice of the expert Ramsay review panel. The Ramsay review recommended an industry dispute resolution scheme as a more flexible and effective model than a tribunal. The overwhelming majority of submissions to the Ramsay review expressed concerns that a statutory tribunal would be legalistic, inflexible and costly, delivering worse outcomes for consumers. Key consumer groups, including the Consumer Action Law Centre, the Financial Rights Legal Centre and Financial Counselling Australia, have indicated that their primary position remains that the best framework for dispute resolution in the financial system is a single industry ombudsman scheme for all disputes, including superannuation disputes. The government's approach will establish a one-stop shop that meets all of the criteria that proponents of a banking tribunal are calling for. AFCA will result in disputes being resolved fairly and efficiently in a less legalistic forum than a court, with access to compensation where consumers have wrongfully suffered a loss and decisions that are binding on financial firms.


All financial firms will be required to be members of AFCA by law, and decisions made by AFCA will be binding on them. If a financial firm fails to comply with an AFCA determination, AFCA can expel the firm, which would mean the firm would be in breach of its licence conditions. AFCA will be more flexible. Its terms of reference, rather than legislation, will set out, for example, the kinds of disputes it can hear, the remedies it can provide and the techniques it can use to resolve disputes. The flexibility will allow it to address new emerging issues—for example, cases involving the use of non-monetary covenants have been prominent in the debate over industry conduct. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman's report on small business loans recommended that banks be restricted from defaulting a loan under $5 million for any reason where a small business has complied with the loan payment requirement and acted lawfully.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:07):  As I indicated when I moved the amendments, the amendments are essentially of a technical nature and respond to key concerns raised by superannuation consumer stakeholders. Given the question asked, let me go through the amendments in detail. Three amendments change or add wording to the AFCA bill to make it consistent with the language from the existing Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993. One amendment provides AFCA with the power to issues directions aimed at protecting the confidentiality of information in certain circumstances. The amendment also allows AFCA to give directions as to the persons who may be present at certain meetings. This power is supported by a penalty provision. A similar provision is currently in the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993. One amendment to the AFCA bill includes an ongoing requirement that the AFCA board have an independent chair. Another amendment corrects a typographical error in the bill. In direct answer to the question: these amendments do not go to the funding of the new body; they go directly to the technical issues that I've outlined.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:08):  Thanks for that answer, Minister. The amendments on sheet HU180 would reinforce the proposition in terms of some of the technical issues: the power to give directions, the directions relating to meetings, the cancelling of membership of the life policy fund and the interest in a death benefit. In the context of the overall bill, you indicate that these are simply technical issues. On that basis, we certainly would prefer our amendments. We will be pursuing our amendments on sheet 8284. These are technical issues. They may have to be superseded if we get the numbers on the other side, but, on that basis, we would probably be happy to let this go to a vote.

Obviously, the opposition would prefer an alternative approach, which is reflected in your amendments. What I would say, very respectfully, is that, if the bill stands as it was put forward, I believe that the opposition would actually prefer these amendments to pass in case the Labor amendment is unsuccessful. That would be my instinctive view, without wanting to put words into the opposition's mind.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (11:10):  The Greens made it clear in our speech in the second reading debate last night that we're not at the point where we can support the SCT going into this new structure, so I need to be very clear that we'll be supporting Labor's amendments to keep the SCT out of a new AFCA. Our view is that AFCA should proceed as the FOS and CIO at this stage. As I made clear last night, I believe that negotiations, consultations and discussions should be occurring between stakeholders in the superannuation industry, the government and the new AFCA board. I just want to make that very clear. The issue to me is a simple one. It's an issue of trust and a lack of confidence in this government and, of course, a question of the government's motivation for bringing superannuation into this new body. I don't find it surprising that superannuation stakeholders, including the employees at the SCT, their union and others, are highly suspicious of this government's intentions.


This issue around superannuation has been a political battleground. I don't necessarily blame the minister so much for some of the rhetoric that has been out there in the public sphere, but all of us have heard in recent weeks how this government is deadset bent on changing the model of not-for-profit super through industry super funds in this country. To me, this is a matter of getting this organisation set up, getting this architecture in place today and then having discussions. We're in this impasse where SCT have admitted that the union who wrote to me, the CPSU, have admitted their performance hasn't been good enough, but they're hampered by funding and a business model, which looks at the volume of complaints, that needs to change. They're not happy with the upper oversight and the way that works at the moment with super contributions, so that needs to change. At the same time, we've got a government that wants to push ahead with bringing the SCT under this AFCA architecture, and the SCT and other industry stakeholders in superannuation, including ASFA—that's the retail and for-profit funds side of superannuation and the not-for-profit side—don't agree. They believe this has been rushed and needs more work.


Keeping that in mind and then coming to this amendment, the Greens will be supporting Labor's amendment to keep the SCT out of this new structure. But what we essentially have before us in this amendment on sheet HU180 are the amendments that SCT wanted put into this bill if they were to lose this fight. Let's be clear about this: the SCT have recommended these amendments to the bill if superannuation were to be included in AFCA and if we were to lose this fight on the Senate floor here today. So we will be supporting these amendments because, if we lose this fight, at least this tries to improve the situation for the SCT if they're going to be incorporated under this umbrella.


Item (2) on sheet HU180 says:


Schedule 1, item 2, page 8 (after line 18), after paragraph 1051(3)(d), insert:


(da) the operator’s constitution provides that the Chair of the board of the operator must be an independent person; and


As I also said in my speech last night, we've had some constructive discussions with the minister's office over weeks about this legislation. Ultimately, we couldn't land on supporting the inclusion of the SCT, but we did urge the minister to consider an independent chair of this organisation. This was a recommendation of the Ramsay review, but we took on board the concerns that Senator Bernardi and One Nation and others have outlined here today.


The CIO has been out there writing us letters saying they're very worried that the big banks and big financial services companies are going to have the run of the new one-stop shop. They're going to be calling the shots, so to speak. So putting an independent chair in place is a really important point. It will mean the chair of this body won't be associated with the big end of town, with the big financial services companies—and I hope that's the case that there will be no conflicts of interest—and they'll be able to stand up for some of the smaller businesses and financial services companies that are currently covered by the CIO. 


This is actually an important amendment. Should this bill get up, the Greens would rather see an independent chair in place than have one that was perhaps appointed by the minister or someone who may have conflicts of interest in relation to the existing financial services industry. I just want to get that on record. We don't support the inclusion of the SCT, but, if it is going to be included—and the government has the numbers—at least this improves their lot. The Greens will be supporting this amendment.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:15):  I understand the Greens' position, but we are still of the view that the preferred position is Labor's. It would have been good if we could have tested the Labor amendments prior to the minister moving these amendments. That's normally how this process eventuates, but the minister got the jump—the minister was up on his feet the whole time—so that's just something we have to deal with. We will oppose these amendments. We do recognise, if our amendments don't get up, that these amendments are appropriate; I won't put it any higher than 'appropriate'. But our position is we will oppose them because we prefer our position, and we will be moving our amendments at the appropriate time.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:17):  I move government amendment (1) on sheet HU185:


(1) Page 3 (after line 5), after clause 3, insert:




4 Review of operation of amendments



   (1) The Minister must cause an independent review of the operation of the amendments made by this Act to be undertaken as soon as practicable after 18 months after the day on and after which, under item 58 of Schedule 1 to this Act, the amendments made by Part 4 of Schedule 1 to this Act apply.


   (2) The review must take into account feedback, provided by complainants under the AFCA scheme (within the meaning of Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act 2001 as amended by this Act), relating to whether their complaints were resolved in a way that was fair, efficient, timely and independent.


Note: Paragraph 1051(4) (b) of the Corporations Act 2001 as amended by this Act provides that one of the operational requirements for the AFCA scheme is that complaints against members of the scheme are resolved in a way that is fair, efficient, timely and independent.


   (3) The review must also specifically examine the appropriateness of limits on:


(a) the value of claims that may be made under the AFCA scheme (within the meaning of Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act 2001 as amended by this Act); and


(b) the value of remedies that may be determined under that scheme;


in relation to disputes about credit facilities provided to primary production businesses, including agriculture, fisheries and forestry businesses.


   (4) The Minister must cause a written report about the review to be prepared.


   (5) The Minister must cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the day on which the report is given to the Minister.


   (6) The report is not a legislative instrument.


This amendment will require the government to commission an independent review of the new external dispute resolution framework as soon as practicable 18 months after AFCA commences operations. The review will take into account feedback provided by complainants to AFCA in relation to whether their complaint was resolved in way that was fair, efficient, timely and independent. In particular, it will examine the appropriateness of the monetary limits applying to complaints relating to credit facilities provided to primary production businesses, including agriculture, fisheries and forestry businesses. A report will be provided to the responsible minister and, within 15 days, will be tabled in parliament.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (11:18):  I think Senator Cameron's point that we would have rather tested their amendment first was a very valid one, because I think that's the game changer for us—taking the SCT out of this architecture and this legislation. But can I say that the review was, once again, something the Greens had constructive discussions with the government about in recent weeks and months. We heard stakeholders, including in the superannuation industry, say that, if this were to get up, there should at least be a review of the new AFCA body. We wanted more than just a review. We wanted it to be tabled in parliament. We wanted it to be an instrument that we can debate and scrutinise closely. It is a big move to bring the ombudsman schemes together in a statutory body.


As I mentioned in my speech last night, we accept that there are different cultures and different aspects to superannuation and to financial services, especially the evolution of those organisations. One tends to have a judicial process; they're government employees; they're under a totally different, shall we say, ownership structure to FOS. As I mentioned earlier, these cultural issues haven't been sorted out yet. The super industry, including ASFA, still aren't convinced that there has been enough consultation on this, that it has been rushed and that these issues haven't been properly dealt with.


I reiterate to the government that they should have a process in place where they sit down with the SCT and other industry stakeholders and work to bring them on board to a new AFCA structure, which hopefully will pass today, for FOS and the CIO. The SCT themselves have admitted that their business model needs to change. They need to change their business model. They need more funding. They need more support. Surely there can be some common ground between a government that's been hell-bent on attacking the industry super industry and the stakeholders. The reason we're here today and are having this debate is that the government haven't been able to bring the super industry on board with this. I think it was the Greens who first put up our amendment and said to the government that we wouldn't support anything unless it had a review. Here we have in front of us a government review. I know One Nation have put up an amendment for a review as well, with some specific aspects that we would support. I understand the Nick Xenophon Team have put up a review. A review makes sense and, on that basis, the Greens will support this amendment.

The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Leyonhjelm
):  Do you wish to speak to the amendment before the chamber?




Senator ANNING:
  Yes. As previously indicated, the purpose of this amendment is to require an assessment of the effectiveness of the AFCA scheme for rural debtors to be provided to both houses of the parliament two years after commencement. The amendment will require the minister to conduct an independent review after 18 months of operation, including whether the limit on the value of claims that may be made under the scheme is appropriate, whether the remedies available to be provided by the AFCA are sufficient and whether complainants indicated that the outcomes are fair and timely. The report of this review is required to be tabled, in both houses, six months after its commencement. While the intentions behind this bill are good, if this measure is to be effective we obviously need some kind of measure of success. This modest amendment seeks to do just that. I strongly urge other senators to support this important and very necessary amendment and help all struggling borrowers, from both the country and the big smoke, to get a fair go.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  The question is that amendment (1) on sheet HU185 be agreed to.

Our position is clear: we think that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal should be maintained in its current position. The complaints tribunal, as I've indicated, has operated for some time. The very fact that the government has tried to replicate the powers of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal in the AFCA bill demonstrates that the current powers, protections and structures for the SCT are appropriate. In May this year, the draft legislation tried to copy and paste a few of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal's statutory provisions into the new AFCA. In September this year, the final legislation introduced, copied and pasted, more of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal's statutory provisions in the new AFCA. Now, after the Senate inquiry and after Labor senators exposed serious flaws, the government has circulated amendments to copy even more of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal provisions into the new AFCA. The ad hoc process of grafting features of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal onto the AFCA has been a tacit admission by the government that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is a far superior model for resolving superannuation disputes than the private AFCA body.


The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is designed as a statutory body, a statutory tribunal, imbued with statutory powers to resolve disputes. The significant public role that the SCT has in upholding the integrity of Australia's superannuation system is reflected in its structure—with a chairperson appointed by a government for a fixed term and part-time tribunal members with expertise in superannuation, insurance, government, legal and medical fields—in recognition of the complexity of the superannuation disputes that come before it. It also includes superannuation life insurance disputes. Submissions to the Senate inquiry also made clear that issues that arise with the other two existing bodies, the FOS and the CIO, do not arise with respect to the SCT. Unlike the other two existing bodies, there is far less overlap between the jurisdiction of the SCT and the other two schemes than there is between the other two existing bodies, the FOS and the CIO.


In relation to the prospects of increasing on the monetary limits to the disputes that can be heard, it should be noted that any changes would only benefit complainants with disputes currently heard before the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman. In relation to superannuation disputes, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal already has an unlimited and uncapped jurisdiction to hear disputes relating to superannuation. 


There have also been serious concerns raised about the transition arrangements to the AFCA as currently outlined in the bill. Mike Taylor, in Super Review, summarises these nicely:


… there is much to suggest that the creation of AFCA represents a bureaucratic slow-motion train crash with the Treasury officials confirming that the financial services industry will have to deal with four different external dispute resolution schemes for at least a year after the necessary legislation is passed and that the SCT will still be clearing its workload as late as 2022.


He goes on to say:


The transitionary arrangements as outlined by the Treasury officials involve more loose ends than a beggar’s blanket with no definitive numbers being available for how the SCT will be funded to complete its work, how a statutory Government authority will be appropriately transitioned into a not for profit company arrangement or precisely how much superannuation funds or other stakeholders will have to pay.


The Turnbull government has no plans to ensure that AFCA will have the professional expertise to resolve superannuation disputes. The expertise currently resides in the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and it will have to stay there, because, under the government's plan, the SCT will stay in operation for a number of years to work through existing superannuation disputes.


The Turnbull government has announced no plans to adequately fund the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to deal with those existing disputes. The government's plan is to keep the SCT in place to resolve disputes received before the commencement of AFCA on 1 July 2018. The government has said it wants the SCT to resolve all existing complaints by 30 June 2020; yet it cut the SCT's funding by $7.2 million in this year's budget. The SCT told the Senate inquiry that, on current funding, it won't be able to finalise old disputes until 2022. When asked by the Senate committee, Treasury could not provide any guarantee that the funding issues would be resolved. All it could offer on behalf of this government were weak assurances that discussions between Treasury and the SCT were ongoing. So, Minister, can you give us an update on those discussions and whether the funding issues have been resolved?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2017-12-06,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:30):  Firstly, let me say, as the government has previously indicated, that we believe funding arrangements are appropriate but, of course, always under review. Let me also indicate that the government will not be supporting these amendments. These amendments seek to retain the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal so that AFCA will not be able to hear and determine superannuation complaints. Instead of a one-stop shop, we would be left with a two-stop shop. Under a one-stop shop, consumers will be able to approach one body to resolve all financial disputes, eliminating uncertainty, confusion, inconsistency of outcomes and the cross-referral of disputes between bodies. Where a complaint covers multiple providers within the financial system, managing these complaints will be smoother. The one-stop shop will remove the current duplication associated with multiple external dispute resolution bodies, such as duplicated governance arrangements, systems, overheads and costs associated with regulatory oversight. A one-stop shop will also be better able to respond to unanticipated changes in dispute volumes and to reallocate resources from those areas experiencing a reduction in dispute volumes to those areas experiencing higher dispute volumes. For example, in the event of a natural disaster like a flood or a cyclone, AFCA will be able to increase resources in areas where disputes may increase, such as in the area of general insurance claims. A one-stop shop will have much more flexibility and direct control over its funding and dispute resolution processes. This will allow a more timely resolution of superannuation complaints.


Again, the Ramsay review found that maintaining a tribunal structure to resolve superannuation complaints would not provide the flexibility needed to adapt to changes in the superannuation sector and that existing pressures would only increase in the absence of significant reform. This is why I indicated before that the government is acting on the independent advice of the expert Ramsay review panel, which recommended an industry dispute resolution scheme as a more flexible and effective model than a tribunal. I would also like to remind the chamber again that the overwhelming majority of submissions to the Ramsay review expressed concerns that a statutory tribunal would be legalistic, inflexible and costly, delivering worse outcomes for consumers, and that key consumer groups, including the Consumer Action Law Centre, the Financial Rights Legal Centre and Financial Counselling Australia, have indicated their primary position remains that the best framework for dispute resolution in the financial system is a single industry ombudsman scheme for all disputes, including superannuation disputes.


I would also take this opportunity to comment on a related matter that was mentioned by Senator Whish-Wilson, referencing the view of CPSU members at the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. I would note that only 12 employees of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal are members of the CPSU. The CPSU does not speak for or represent all employees of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, or rather ASIC, as they are actually ASIC employees. So, with those few comments, I indicate the government's opposition to these amendments.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:33):  Minister, I'm still not clear as to what the funding arrangements will be. You took us through some of the political reasoning for the position that you've adopted, but there's another issue that has also come up. If the bill is passed this year, the four years will expire in late 2021. That's what the bill says, and yet it's clear, taking into account the cuts to the SCT in the 2017 budget, that it won't be able to resolve all disputes until December 2022, a whole year after it's had the statutory rug pulled out from under it and from under Australians whose disputes are yet to be resolved at that date.


We think it's contemptuous of the government to ask this chamber to authorise the abolition of the tribunal by a certain date when the government can't even guarantee the funding to ensure that all residual disputes of the tribunal are resolved by that date. What guarantees can you give us that that funding will be there between late 2021 and December 2022?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:35):  Firstly, I reject the proposition that the government cannot guarantee adequate funding. The government is guaranteeing adequate funding for the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. Furthermore, the government will ensure that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal has adequate funding while it operates and to wind down in an appropriate manner, and so it is able to clear the backlog of complaints. So I reject the premise of the question that was originally asked. I thought that I had already answered it. The government is satisfied that adequate funding has been provided. We'll continue to monitor, of course, the situation. And, of course, the government will at all times ensure that adequate funding is available.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-12-06,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:36):  I must say that I'm not convinced by the answer. I just want to move to another issue—the death benefit disputes. It's worth looking at an example of the achievements of the SCT. One of the most difficult aspects of superannuation disputes are superannuation death benefit disputes. These kinds of disputes are just one example of the value of a specialised, professional and statutory body for resolving superannuation disputes. It's important to note that there are significant differences between retail life insurance disputes and superannuation death benefit disputes. Under superannuation law, it's often up to the superannuation trustee to determine how payments of the death benefit are divided between the deceased person's family members in accordance with the rules of the superannuation fund. This can be a very difficult process, and the trustee may have to consider the rights of a number of family members of the deceased person and the level of reliance the family members had on them. The superannuation trustee often has to look into the dependence of family members on the person who has died and whether they had a reasonable expectation of continuing financial support, such as the surviving partner and financially dependent children.


One of the strengths of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal has been its ability to resolve these disputes through what is known as its conciliation process. Through this conciliation process, the SCT allows all those with a claim to the death benefit to be heard, but the information is kept confidential and the SCT has the power to do this. As the SCT reported to the Senate committee, this information:


…can be highly personal, sensitive, inflammatory and identifiable (for example, the assertions that are made in the context of family members disagreeing about who is entitled to a death benefit under a superannuation life insurance policy).


It's encouraging that the SCT is able to resolve the vast majority of these very difficult disputes between family members by conciliation. Only a small proportion have to go on for final determination by the SCT. This reflects the value of a specialised, professional tribunal with expertise in superannuation law, and strong and established processes for resolving these claims.


Just as important with disputes like these is certainty. The dispute resolution process needs to give an opportunity to all those who feel that they may have an entitlement to part of the death benefit to be heard. But once everyone is heard, there needs to be a final resolution so that there can be certainty and families can move on. This means that anybody or institution tasked with resolving these disputes must have the power to join additional parties. It must also have the power to make a decision that is binding on all those parties.


One of the criticisms of the way non-superannuation disputes are handled under AFCA is that for non-super disputes, such as banking disputes, there is no power to join parties. Any dispute scheme that is involved in resolving superannuation death benefit disputes needs power to join a number of parties and the power to deliver a resolution that is binding on these multiple parties. These are necessary powers but they are also significant powers, and it is appropriate that such significant powers lie with a statutory tribunal body like the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. 


Labor is concerned that the loss of the expertise and statutory powers that currently exist would be detrimental and result in Australians, who have worked hard for their retirement savings, being denied access to a specialist tribunal which deals solely with superannuation matters. The Prime Minister promised a new tribunal in October 2016. This bill has no new tribunal; instead, it abolishes an existing tribunal. This amendment will protect that tribunal. What we get in AFCA is no significant change from the existing arrangements for disputes from banks. But for superannuation disputes, we get the abolition of a tribunal—a strong statutory tribunal that, resource constraints aside, has served Australians well in handling complicated and heated superannuation disputes, and it does that in an accessible, fair and conclusive manner. 


Labor will not accept this government abolishing a crucial piece of the architecture of Australia's superannuation system. We urge this parliament to stand up and prevent a reduction in consumer protections and outcomes that will come from the abolition of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and its replacement with a private body, a generic, one-stop ombudsman scheme. There is very little change in this bill for customers who have a dispute with the banks. They can go to an ombudsman scheme now. AFCA will be an ombudsman scheme as well, and AFCA has no new powers for these disputes. The Prime Minister promised a tribunal. The bill fails to deliver one. Instead, what this bill presents is a rebadging of the existing Financial Ombudsman Service and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman and the abolition of a tribunal, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. 


In relation to superannuation disputes, this bill represents a substantial reduction in the quality of dispute resolution in its attempt to replace a statutory Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, with specialist expertise for complex super disputes, with a generic private body one-stop shop ombudsman whose powers are based on contract law. As such, we commend this amendment, as it protects the quality and integrity of superannuation dispute resolution by retaining the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. I would urge all of the crossbench to support what has been a very effective, efficient and longstanding tribunal with runs on the board in dealing with the specialist issues that arise from superannuation. 


The problem that we have is that this government does everything in its power to resist superannuation being delivered to working-class people in this country. It resisted superannuation being introduced in the first place. It continues to resist increases to superannuation for workers who need superannuation so that they can retire with dignity. This is part of its attack on superannuation. It removes a tribunal that has worked effectively and efficiently over many years. It takes it away from a statutory organisation to a privately run organisation.


We don't believe it's the appropriate way to go. We would hope that the crossbench supports our position. The crossbench should not be aligning itself with the government to further attack the efficacy of the superannuation system in this country. I would ask One Nation to give serious consideration to supporting this body, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, that has been effective, that has been efficient and that looks after families—it's not just workers; it's families—who end up in disputes or disagreements over superannuation payments. I ask that One Nation continues to support the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal as the most effective and longstanding proposition to deal with these superannuation disputes.


I take the view that these are important issues that we should deal with. Just before we go on, I'd like the minister to answer these questions: can the minister confirm that the SCT will be wound up four years after the bill receives royal assent; can the minister confirm that the SCT has provided advice to the government that, on current funding levels, the SCT will not be able to finalise all disputes until December 2022, over five years away; and can the minister guarantee that the SCT will receive additional funding from the government to resolve the disputes?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2017-12-06,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:46):  In relation to the last question, I've already indicated that the government will ensure that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, as it's wound up, has the appropriate resources to clear the backlog of complaints. I can also confirm that the legislation provides that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal would be wound up by 2022.


I will also just address some of the other issues that Senator Cameron has raised. Again, pointing to the Ramsay review, the Ramsay review found that a statutory tribunal to resolve superannuation complaints does not provide flexibility to adapt to changes in the superannuation sector. It also found that the longstanding issues with superannuation dispute resolution arrangements could not be fully resolved in a statutory tribunal structure, even with reforms to funding and governance, as the tribunal structure would not provide flexibility. AFCA will have maximum flexibility to deal with complaints in a timelier manner by having direct control over its funding and its processes. It will have increased transparency and flexibility over funding arrangements.


AFCA will also retain key statutory powers to ensure that superannuation dispute resolution is aligned with trustee duties and, most importantly, consumers can approach one body to resolve all financial disputes, eliminating uncertainty and confusion. Specifically in relation to the issue of death benefit complaints—which is where Senator Cameron started in his most recent contribution—the current processes for determining death benefits, including identifying who has an interest in a death benefit within appropriate time limits to bring forward a complaint about the distribution of a death benefit, have been replicated in this new legislation.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:48):  I can indicate that the Nick Xenophon Team will not be supporting these amendments. While we acknowledge some of the concerns that have been raised about the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal being incorporated into AFCA, we believe that the proposed model will deliver faster, more effective dispute resolution for all consumers than a model that preserves the SCT as a standalone tribunal. There are inherent limitations with the tribunal model, where processes are determined by legislation, the appointment of the tribunal members can be delayed and any changes to funding is dependent on the government budget cycle. It is also inflexible and not able to respond to changes in demand in the way the ombudsman scheme can. These limitations do not contribute to positive consumer outcomes.


I would like to take the opportunity to ask the minister a couple of questions in relation to the AFCA terms of reference, specifically in relation to principles of fairness in the external dispute resolution framework. I refer to a case in the Victorian Supreme Court, Cromwell Property Securities Limited v Financial Ombudsman Services and Radford (2013), where the court found that a party to a contract, and that contract is the terms of reference, must establish Wednesbury unreasonableness—namely, that the decision was one that no reasonable decision-maker could properly arrive at at the evidence. Basically, it is saying that you can't appeal a tribunal decision unless the decision is so unreasonable that no-one could reasonably make it.


I'm strongly of the view that fairness principles used by a multiple of statutory tribunals need to be adopted such that fairness is not left to the opinion of AFCA. Some of these fairness principles might include the fact that there is mandatory discovery for parties, open exchange of information between the parties, the prohibition of private advocacy to the ombudsman, the prohibition of apprehended or actual bias, the right to be heard, that irrelevant material must not be considered, that relevant considerations must be considered, and that the tribunal cannot act in the manner that constitutes Wednesbury unreasonableness. 


Can the minister please advise what steps the government has taken to ensure the terms of reference contain these principles of fairness so the decisions made by AFCA will not simply be based on a process that is fair in the opinion of AFCA alone?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2017-12-06,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:51):  I thank Senator Patrick for his contribution. AFCA will be required by law to be appropriately accessible to persons that have complaints against financial firms that are members of AFCA. All Australian financial services licensees will be required by condition of their licence to be a member of AFCA. AFCA will also be required under the legislation to resolve complaints in a way that is fair, efficient, timely and independent. ASIC will be given a broad new directions power to compel AFCA to comply with the mandatory requirements under this legislation. ASIC will also have a new legislative instrument-making power to ensure AFCA satisfies its legislative requirements, including the requirement to resolve complaints in a way that is fair, efficient, timely and independent. 


AFCA's discretion to decline to hear a particular complaint will be appropriately limited by tightening the parameters for exercise of its discretion—that is, by requiring AFCA to set out the factors it will have regard to before exercising the discretion, including a requirement to provide written reasons where AFCA exercises the discretion, and including an internal review mechanism for those circumstances where AFCA exercises its discretion. In addition, the responsible minister, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister O'Dwyer, will have regard to AFCA's proposed terms of reference when making the authorisation decision, and will be able to impose conditions on authorisation. The responsible minister, Minister O'Dwyer, will require AFCA's terms of reference to include a commitment to procedural fairness before she will authorise the scheme. Following authorisation, any material change to AFCA's terms of reference will require ASIC approval. These measures strike the right balance, we believe, between providing AFCA with the flexibility to refuse to hear a complaint when this is appropriate and ensuring that AFCA is accountable for the exercise of this discretion. 


AFCA's decision-making approach in relation to non-superannuation complaints and as affirmed by the Ramsay review will adopt the approach currently taken by the Financial Ombudsman Service and the CIO. AFCA will make decisions based on what is fair in all circumstances. As a non-legal body, it is reasonable that AFCA should make decisions that are fair in all circumstances as opposed to decisions that, while adhering to the law, nonetheless result in unfair or very unreasonable outcomes for consumers. 


There is also a legislative obligation on AFCA to ensure that it has the appropriate expertise to deal with complaints within its jurisdiction, and AFCA will be required to have an independent assessor and to have regard to the use of panels for complex complaints, and will also be subject to more frequent independent reviews, which can look at different aspects of AFCA's operations, including its decision-making processes. The government has also established a transition team led by Dr Malcolm Edey, former assistant governor with the RBA, for the establishment of AFCA. The consultation paper on AFCA's governance and funding arrangements has been released for stakeholder feedback.

There needs to be considerable discussion between stakeholders and the government, and with AFCA, before that occurs.


In relation to the SCT being merged into this organisation, I have some questions that I don't believe have been addressed—if it is going to go ahead; hopefully it won't, but if it is. Minister, you mentioned terms of reference in your response to the Nick Xenophon Team. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia have given us the key reforms and their positions on these reforms. One of the points they make that they're disappointed by is that, while time limits for complaints will be addressed by the terms of reference, they actually haven't seen the detail of those terms of reference because they're yet to be finalised—I'm not even sure that they are majorly completed yet. I will put on record that it's been a topic of conversation between the Greens and the minister: we've requested to see those terms of reference and the detail around those terms of reference, but they haven't been done yet. Minister, do you have the terms of reference and that kind of detail with you now? And, if you do, will you be able to table them for the Senate?

It obviously wouldn't be appropriate for the government to finalise terms of reference in relation to a body that hasn't yet been set up by legislation. We're not presuming the outcome for the parliament; the first step is to get the approval of the parliament for the establishment of this one-stop-shop complaints mechanism, which we are strongly recommending to the parliament. We have set out the process that we would follow from here to finalise the terms of reference and we've indicated some of the guiding principles that the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services will work from in order to finalise those terms of reference.

 (Tasmania) (12:00):  I will point out that the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia is both the for-profit and the not-for-profit part of the super industry. Your government has been very critical and has brought considerable legislation before this place to try and break apart the business model of the not-for-profit industry super sector, but this organisation covers the banks and financial services as well as the not-for-profit sector. I would have thought, with a key body like ASFA, you would have at least noted and discussed with them a change to the implementation date and made sure this process wasn't rushed. 


ASFA also note that they remain concerned with the indication that, where the SCT has not made a final determination on a complaint, the complainant will be able to withdraw their complaint and instead progress it via a complaint to AFCA. This raises the prospect of what they call forum shopping. It will be difficult to manage the complaints involving things such as death benefits.

They expressed the concern that this is in conflict with trustees' obligations, including their obligation to act in the interest of all members. They have also highlighted that they believe this issue may be challenged in the Federal Court. Does the minister accept this criticism? How has the minister consulted with ISA on this issue?

Where a complaint covers multiple providers within the financial system, managing these complaints will be smoother. This provides efficient and binding outcomes.

 (New South Wales) (12:06):  So, basically, we'll move from a tribunal with an administrative review process to a private body that can make a decision, and the only redress someone has if that decision is, in their view, not appropriate is to go to the Federal Court. I would state that the bulk of Australian families in the superannuation system have very modest superannuation accounts and modest means. For them to have the Federal Court as the only avenue of redress—which means expensive lawyers, litigation and thousands of dollars a day—is clearly a step backwards in the context of the existing tribunal.


This is one of the key issues for us in the context of ensuring that we have dispute resolution appeal processes that are not only efficient but also cost-effective. For this government to simply push an individual to the Federal Court, with the associated costs relating to a Federal Court hearing, is, I think, an absolute disgrace. For all the rhetoric that we had from the minister about efficiency and getting consistency, I think this is a backwards step. So, Minister, can you just outline what the process of appeal to the Federal Court includes?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:09):  I think we're going round and round in circles now. The government has been very up-front, right from the word go. In fact, in our second reading speech and again in the summing up speech today, I made the point that the whole purpose of this one-stop shop proposal through the Australian Financial Complaints Authority is to ensure that consumers and small businesses have access to free, fast and binding dispute resolution, and it's of course part of the government's broader commitment to ensure that consumers and small business can have any legitimate grievances against banks or financial institutions more generally resolved in a timely, efficient and conclusive manner. The purpose is not to replicate a parallel judicial structure. So the intention is for this to offer an avenue for consumers and small business to get access to a free and very efficient dispute resolution process. Obviously, the aspiration is that this dispute resolution process will be effective in resolving all legitimate disputes.


I would, again, say that the overwhelming majority of submissions to the Ramsay review supported this approach and expressed concern about the proposal to persist with a statutory tribunal because it would be too legalistic, inflexible and costly, delivering worse outcomes for consumers. That includes key consumer groups, including the Consumer Action Law Centre, the Financial Rights Legal Centre and Financial Counselling Australia. They have all indicated that their primary position remains that the best framework for dispute resolution in the financial system is a single industry ombudsman scheme for all disputes, including superannuation disputes. As far as access to the Federal Court is concerned, that is a matter of the usual processes applying.

We've had two sets of legislation before this place in recent weeks. We've had them over a year ago. There has been all sorts of rhetoric around the announcement of a royal commission and inclusion in the terms of reference that a commission can go after the not-for-profit industry super sector, and here you're saying the minister is going to consult and then appoint experts to the board however she chooses—presumably, if she's still minister when this organisation gets set up. Will you include not-for-profit representation, because it is the not-for-profit part of the super sector that your government has done everything it can to try to dismantle?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:15):  Firstly, I need to correct Senator Whish-Wilson's perception. It does come under the purview of ministers in the elected government to make these sorts of judgements on behalf of the Australian people. The minister will make a one-off appointment of the independent chair and a minority of the board, and the ongoing composition of the board is going to be a matter for the board itself.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-12-06,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:15):  Minister, I think this is a key question. I just want to continue on from where Senator Whish-Wilson finished. You're aware of the history of the establishment of the superannuation industry in this country. It came about in the early 1980s, when the ACTU and the trade union movement became absolutely sick and tired of a proposition where only, or predominantly, white-collar workers had access to superannuation and blue-collar workers had limited or no access to superannuation.


I indicated earlier—not in this debate but in previous debates—that I was employed by the Electricity Commission of New South Wales as a maintenance fitter at Liddell power station, and my superannuation was the first superannuation I ever earned or achieved as a blue-collar worker in Australia. For about 10 years prior, I think, I worked in various industries and in various companies with no access to superannuation whatsoever. When I left the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, I was denied the Electricity Commission's contribution to my superannuation because I left that company. At that stage, I think the Electricity Commission's contribution to my superannuation was about $17,000, and that $17,000 from about 1981 would have been a significant amount in my and my family's superannuation now.


That was a regular situation that blue-collar workers found themselves in. It was called vesting. There was no vesting of the company's contribution to the worker if they left their existing employment, so they just lost their superannuation, other than the contribution that they themselves had made. So all I received when I left was the contribution I had made in addition to the Electricity Commission's contribution, which significantly disadvantaged me and disadvantaged my family. That was typical of how blue-collar workers were treated in relation to superannuation.


One of my first jobs as a union official for the then metal workers union was to go out and fight for superannuation entitlements and the vesting of superannuation for workers across the country. The coalition at that time opposed superannuation applying generally to workers. Their position has been ongoing as one of opposition to industry superannuation funds and opposition to increases for workers to make sure that they could retire with dignity.


My view is that this is another aspect of this government's ideological opposition to superannuation. This is an ideological opposition to industry superannuation funds that have, in most places, 50 per cent of representation from workers and 50 per cent of representation from employers. It's an industry that has delivered on average, over many, many years, about a 2½ per cent yield to workers through the superannuation on a regular basis. This is an industry—that is, the industry super funds—that regularly and consistently outperforms the private sector superannuation funds run predominantly by the banking industry.


As a result of the history of superannuation and the involvement of the trade union movement in providing that benefit to workers across the country, they had a say and a contribution to make to the superannuation industry. The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal was one of those contributions where the ACTU, the trade union movement and the employers were engaged in its establishment. Now, we see this being moved out from a tribunal—a government oversight body—to the private sector, which again is part of the ideological position that this government adopts consistently and unfailingly. We've seen the results of this transfer of public oversight and public bodies through the competition policy and privatisation taking place regularly under this government.


One of the areas that I think should be maintained, and the Labor Party believes should be maintained, given the history of superannuation, is the continuation of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. NXT came in here earlier and made some assertions how this would be more efficient and more effective. The minister has made similar assertions. But when you look around at the tragic contribution that company policy and privatisation has made in other industries and in other areas, then you see that it is not as ideologically pure and effective as some of the acolytes of privatisation and competition policy would have us believe. You've only got to look at the disastrous position in the VET training sector and at VET FEE-HELP to understand that the theory of academics and ideologues is not always represented in the practical outcomes of these changes.


Again, I take the view, and Labor takes the view, that it is the ideologues in the government and the ideologues in the private sector who want this tribunal to be put into a private-sector body that will not deliver. I just don't see the rhetoric that the minister has outlined being deliverable in that there is not going to be any consultation, by the looks of it, with the industry in terms of people who go onto this board. There will be no consultation with the ACTU, who were fundamentally responsible for creating the superannuation system, along with the Labor government at the time. These are some of the underpinning issues that we want to deal with. I want to ask the minister a couple of general questions on this. Can the minister confirm that the new dispute resolution caps—the limits on the value of disputes that can be heard by AFCA—are not specified in the legislation for non-superannuation disputes?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:26):  They have been publicly announced. They were in the minister's press release announcing the relevant changes some time ago. AFCA will commence with significantly higher monetary limits than the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman. AFCA will have a claim limit of $1 million and a compensation cap of $500,000 for non-superannuation disputes. That is almost double what is currently in place for small business credit facility disputes. AFCA will be able to consider complaints related to a credit facility of up to $5 million and award compensation of up to $1 million. This is triple what is currently in place. There will also be no monetary limits for disputes about whether a guarantee should be set aside—whether it has been supported by a mortgage or other security of the guarantor's primary place of residence. There will continue to be no monetary limits or compensation caps for superannuation disputes. The government does not support extending the compensation limit for non-superannuation disputes to $3 million at this point, but, because in the future these matters will be governed by the terms of reference, there will be flexibility to make adjustments as appropriate in the future.

  The amendment is an amendment as a whole; it was just taken in two parts: one was that the bill stand as printed, to which we voted yes, and the other, which is consequential and related, was the one on which the government voted no. But, even though we had an indication that the Nick Xenophon Team would be supporting the government's position against the amendments, on the basis that for a period it looked as though the Nick Xenophon Team was seated on the other side—eventually they moved over—in informal communications that happened across the chamber, I am advised by our duty whip that somebody was sent out from our side who should not have been sent out, and he wasn't able to get back into the chamber on time.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (10:13):  My contribution in relation to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017 revolves very much around the fact that the proposition is to abolish the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and absorb it into this new Australian Financial Complaints Authority. Whilst the opposition doesn't have concerns about the ombudsman services being combined, as I have previously indicated, we do have major concerns about the changes to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. 


Some of these concerns were raised by Helen Davis, the chair of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, during the committee's inquiry, and I thank her for her contribution. I would like to also say that this lends support to the Labor view that the tribunal should continue to stand alone. The CPSU's submission to the committee's inquiry is also very informative. They pointed to the fact that the proposed scheme will reduce consumer protections and rights in relation to superannuation matters. They also indicated that the focus of the SCT does not address the widespread community concerns about the operations of the financial services sector. They make the very cogent point that radical changes are being proposed for the superannuation industry, which has not seen anything close to the litany of scandals that have beset the finance sector. In other submissions to the committee's inquiry, I note a number of other reservations to the changes being made.


In closing, I would like to thank Senator Gallagher for her work in this area. Obviously, her highly principled actions this morning speak volumes for her integrity. I also know that Senator Gallagher is passionate about the need for the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to continue with its functions, as am I. I also thank Senator McAllister, who acted as deputy chair of the committee for a time. We believe that the integrity of our super system is too valuable to risk and we do not support the weakening of this body.

"Anning, Sen Fraser",IND,2017-12-06,"



Senator ANNING
 (Queensland) (10:16):  This is not my first speech. I rise to speak to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017. The bill amends the Corporations Act to establish a new dispute resolution body, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, to ensure that consumers and small businesses have access to free, fast and binding dispute resolution. The bill comes on the back of the Ramsay review of 2016, which recommends that significant reform is needed in the disputes resolution process. It also implements the recommendation of the Carnell report to establish a small business disputes resolution one-stop-shop to hear credit disputes for amounts up to $5 million. The AFCA will replace the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Credit and Investments Ombudsman and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, but it will have additional statutory powers.


The Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, will be responsible for ensuring that AFCA meets the standards set out in the legislation. The bill will provide ASIC with the ability to set regulatory requirements that AFCA must meet, and the power to compel AFCA to comply with the standards set out in the legislation. Under the AFCA, consumers and small businesses will be able to have their disputes with financial firms heard and determined by AFCA, at no cost. Under the current system, it is difficult to achieve comparable outcomes for customers with similar complaints, because different bodies handle the complaints.


In his second reading speech, the minister stated that the bill forms part of the government's broader commitment to ensuring that banks and other financial institutions are held to account when they fail to meet community expectations. Insofar as this bill does this, I applaud the government's efforts and support this legislation. My only concern is that the role of AFCA may be too limited, particularly in the size of debts that may be considered. Many farmers with debts exceeding $5 million find themselves in trouble with ruthless banks, and I am concerned that they will not be able to access the benefits of this new complaints authority, or that its rulings may be not be sufficiently strong to overcome the vested power of usury. I, and many colleagues from the bush, have heard hundreds of heart-rending stories of how family farms have been stolen by deceptive and amoral lenders. Rural borrowers have faced unconscionable treatment by banks, which have tricked them into overdrafts, based on phoney, inflated valuations, only to have those same farms seized when lenders subsequently revalued the property in order to create an unsustainable debt-to-equity ratio. We have heard of numerous cases where banks sought to foreclose on properties on which repayments were fully paid up to date, claiming so-called 'anticipatory breaches', using fictitious future projections of reduced income.


If these same lending practices were extended to big-city home borrowers, hundreds of thousands of families who are fully up to date on mortgages would lose their homes and there would be rioting in the streets. It is only the fact that the farmers who are victims of usury are in remote locations and small in number that their hardship and misery are hidden from the wider population. This is along with the waves of suicides that follow the loss of properties that have been in families for generations. 


Because of my concern to ensure that this bill does, effectively, help rural borrowers in these dire straits, I will be supporting the government's amendment that calls for a review of AFCA 18 months after it's established. This amendment will require the minister to commission an independent review of the effectiveness of the AFCA scheme regarding rural debts. The aim of this review will be to consider the limit on the value of claims established by the bill and to consider the effectiveness and fairness of remedies provided by the authority once it commences operation, particularly considering feedback from complainants. Since a proposal for an 18-month review of the effectiveness of this authority is entirely consistent with the stated intent of this bill, I strongly encourage all senators to support the government's amendment.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2017-12-06,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (10:21):  The bill we're debating today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017, arises from the Turnbull government's policy to set up a one-stop shop for consumers' complaints about financial services. In doing so, the bill combines three existing external dispute resolution schemes, the Financial Ombudsman Service, FOS; the Credit and Investments Ombudsman, CIO; and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, SCT. The new body will be known as the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, AFCA. For the FOS and CIO, this is simply a merging and rebranding of the two existing services. 


We, of course, welcome higher monetary thresholds for disputes that can be heard. But the government is not proposing any new or additional powers that the existing dispute resolution bodies don't already have. The bill also purports to copy the powers of the SCT into the AFCA. However, as the AFCA will be a private company limited by guarantee, this bill will result in reduced consumer protections for superannuation disputes. The chair of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, Helen Davis, said:


I don't think it would be true to say, in relation to super, that it's a rebranding exercise. Arguably, it's quite a significant change for superannuation, specifically in terms of the external dispute resolution. It goes from a statutory body to a non-statutory body. It moved from a specialist body to a one-stop-shop body.


There are many important differences between the SCT and the proposed AFCA that stakeholders say will result in reduced protections. Their bill does not retain appeal rights that are currently available for the administrative decisions of the SCT. The SCT has the power to require information shared at the initial review stage to be kept confidential, which can include highly sensitive personal information. The SCT has an explicit statutory power to cancel the membership of a life policy fund if it finds the conduct relating to the selling of that fund was unfair or unreasonable. There is no limit on the value of the claim that the SCT is allowed to hear and, as a private body, the AFCA is not subject to freedom-of-information claims. 


The government claims its reason for shutting down the SCT is due to delays in its resolution of complaints, but this is somewhat hypocritical when the delays have clearly been caused by the funding and staff cuts, at the SCT, inflicted by this government. Another good argument to retain the SCT is that it is a specialist body with skilled and professional staff. Superannuation can be a very complex area, requiring specialists and technical skills. While there is a significant overlap in the types of complaints received by the FOS and the CIO, this is not true of the complaints dealt with by these bodies and the SCT. 


To back up my comments about the retention of the SCT as a separate body, I refer to the additional comments of Labor senators submitted to the Senate inquiry into this bill. As well as outlining the arguments I just mentioned, Labor senators said:


No persuasive evidence was received during this inquiry that demonstrated that the SCT's arrangement was unsuitable, apart from its funding level.


So, I've yet to hear a persuasive argument from those opposite about why the SCT should not be retained in its present form, albeit with the funding cuts reversed, so it can deal with the current backlog of complaints.


Labor does not support the abolition of the SCT, and we will be moving an amendment to this bill to retain the SCT as a separate statutory body. Should Labor's amendments to retain the SCT be supported, we are left with a bill that, as I said, will essentially be a rebranding exercise. It is certainly no substitute for re-election on addressing the poor conduct of the banks. It is no substitute for the royal commission, for which Labor has been calling for 18 months and which this government has now belatedly announced. And, while the government claimed to be taking action to address the numerous examples of inappropriate financial advice, insurance claims that are unfairly declined, loan fraud, irresponsible lending and cover-ups, more stories continue to emerge from victims and whistleblowers even now. I'm sure every member and senator in this place would have at least one story, if not several, of a constituent who has fallen victim to misconduct by banks or financial institutions.


Let me tell you just one of my stories. This is a story about a Tasmanian couple who approached my office for help. Rather than use their real names, I'll call them John and Mary. John and Mary applied for a loan through a mortgage lender. When the lender met with them at their home, he appeared to be in a hurry and did not ask for any financial details. He just sought personal details such as names, dates of birth and driver's licence numbers. When John and Mary asked the lender about including their financial details on the form they were told that they would fill in the rest later. A few years after being granted the loan, they obtained copies of their application forms, only to find their financial information had been completely manufactured. The application stated that the couple owned a small business and also showed that they were both drawing an income from the business. John and Mary had actually stopped working in the business four years prior, when the business they leased was sold. Even when the business had been performing well, they had only ever drawn half the salary that was reported on their form. The application form also significantly overinflated the equity in their business. In total, John and Mary counted 78 fabricated facts that were added to the forms without their consent or knowledge after their signatures were obtained.


This is a clear breach of the Code of Banking Practice, which provides that:


Before we offer or give you a credit facility (or increase an existing credit facility), we will exercise the care and skill of a diligent and prudent banker in selecting and applying our credit assessment methods and in forming our opinion about your ability to repay it.


John and Mary lodged a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service, but their complaint was dismissed. Without the protection of the FOS their only option was to seek legal redress. But as low-income earners—one doing casual work and another one on a pension—they could not afford a lawyer. As for legal aid, John recently told my office, 'No legal aid lawyer in their right mind would take on the banks.'


The mortgage lending industry may claim that the issues faced by victims like John and Mary have been addressed by the industry, and this is something we're continually told by the financial services industry. But time and time again, new claims arise. The Australian reported just last week that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, or ASIC, is investigating several large and small lenders for fabrication of documents. The week before that, National Australia Bank sacked 20 bankers and disciplined a further 32 after it was discovered that false information had been used in around 2,300 loan applications.


Loan fraud is just one of many examples of misconduct in the industry. As Labor has said time and time again—for month after month, in fact—we need a royal commission to get to the bottom of the rorts and rip-offs and to restore confidence in Australia's financial services industry. I find it incredible that Mr Turnbull and his government would spend 18 months fighting a royal commission only to do one of the biggest backflips we have ever seen and capitulate now. They rejected Labor's call for a royal commission and they rejected the call of families and small businesses who had been hurt by the bank's bad behaviour. They even refused to call a royal commission despite the numerous reports of whistleblowers. But when the banks themselves wrote to Mr Turnbull and accepted the need for a royal commission, it took him one day to finally fold. Mr Turnbull waiting on permission from the banks to call a royal commission is like saying he needs a note from his mum—and I don't mean in the Senator Canavan way.


The banks' letter to the government make for interesting reading. Here are a few extracts from that letter. In three instances, the banks refer to the need to act: 


… it is now imperative for the Australian Government to act decisively to deliver certainty to Australia’s financial services sector.


…   …   …


… it is now in the national interest for the political uncertainty to end …


…   …   …


We now ask you and your government to act to ensure a properly constituted inquiry into the financial services sector is established to put an end to the uncertainty …


I think all of those comments can be read as, 'We know an inquiry is inevitable, so we give you permission to get on with it, get it over with and get it done with.' In their letter, the banks' CEOs also said:


In our view, a properly constituted inquiry must have several significant characteristics.


In other words, 'Let us explain to you how we want this thing to be run.'


The letter said:


Its terms of reference should be thoughtfully drafted and free of political influence.


In other words, 'Give us a call. We'll tell you what we want the terms of reference to be and then you can draft it.'


Another quote is:


It is also important that any inquiry reports back in a timely manner so that we can have certainty about the findings and move forward to implement any recommendations.


Once again they're saying, 'Let's get this over and done with ASAP.'


Was the banks' call for a royal commission, and this government's acceptance of that call, done in the spirit of public interest? I think not. It's as clear as day to every Australian that the banks and the government saw the writing on the wall. They knew the pressure was on, they knew the pressure was growing and they knew that an inquiry was inevitable. Rather than accepting the need for a royal commission, after months of holding out against public pressure and pressure from the Labor Party, this government has been dragged kicking and screaming to this new position. It was a backflip of epic proportions, one that would impress an Olympic gymnast. Only on Tuesday of last week, Mr Turnbull was still insisting that his government would not call a royal commission. Two days later, he was announcing one. I think Senator O'Sullivan's comment that the Prime Minister had been dragged to the table is quite apt. In fact, my earlier description of him being dragged kicking and screaming is not that original; it's the same description used by Mr Christensen, a member of the coalition's own backbench, to describe what has recently transpired. And just to show what an extraordinary backflip this was, let's examine what the government had to say about a royal commission previously. Mr Turnbull said:


The only beneficiaries from a royal commission would be, frankly, the legal profession.


He also described a royal commission as something that would go on for years, cost hundreds of millions of dollars and not tell us anything new. Mr Turnbull's Treasurer, Mr Morrison, described Labor's calls for a royal commission as 'a cynical political exercise' which sought to cynically exploit people's genuine concerns and politicise their pain. Mr Morrison also described it as a 'crass populist approach' to the issue.


After such a humiliating backflip, this government will no doubt be choking on their words. This is clearly another desperate tactic by this Prime Minister to hold on to his leadership. It's an attempt to hold off a backbench revolt, just like Mr Turnbull's decision to cancel a week of sitting of the House of Representatives was. Whichever way this government tries to spin it, these decisions are about Mr Turnbull's political interests, not Australia's national interest.


If Mr Turnbull were a decisive leader, a leader who was governing in the national interest, he would not be lurching from crisis to crisis. He would not be belatedly bowing to public pressure. Instead, he would have called a royal commission months or even years ago, and the commission could have handed down its report by now. We could be debating and implementing the recommendations right now if he'd called it even 18 months ago. A royal commission into the banks is in the national interest, but the national interest is not what Mr Turnbull and his government are motivated by. While we welcome this announcement, we would prefer it be done for the right reasons. Let's hope it's not a token exercise, which is what it appears to be, given the rushed manner in which it has been announced. 


We know from evidence recently given by ASIC's deputy president, Peter Kell, that the government did not consult ASIC on their decision to launch a royal commission or on the terms of reference. We also know, from groups representing the victims of banking scandals, that the victims weren't consulted either. The government certainly didn't consult with the opposition. We'll just have to wait and see how effective this inquiry is, because we know the terms of reference could be much stronger. 


It's cold comfort to the victims of many banking scandals over the years that the government have finally called a royal commission not because they thought it was actually necessary but because their mates in the banks told them to do it. One of the clauses in the terms of reference provides that the royal commission is not required to inquire into 'macro-prudential policy, regulation or oversight'. This basically means it will not be looking at whether the regulatory framework for our financial system is effective and up to date. It also appears that the government, in a partisan fashion, is using this royal commission as a cynical opportunity to attack industry superannuation funds. 


The lack of consultation over the terms of reference is disappointing. We on this side will be doing our best to improve them. Labor is working with the government to ensure we have a royal commission that has real teeth, one that can provide some comfort and confidence for the millions of Australians who rely on banks to take care of their borrowings and savings. We certainly want a stronger response to misconduct in the financial services industry, something stronger than just the rebranding exercise in this bill. 


There are a few positives in this bill, such as the lifting of the threshold for disputes that can be heard, removing the competition between the FOS and the CIO for the membership of financial services firms, and additional oversight powers for ASIC. However, I refer to my earlier arguments and I once again emphasise that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal should be retained in its present form. As such, I urge all senators to support Labor's amendments when they come to the Senate.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-12-06,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:37):  From the outset, may I express my reservations about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017. This is another attempt by the government—like governments of all persuasions—to appear to be doing something meaningful to address a substantive problem that they've tried to avoid addressing for a very long time. In this case, it dates back to Mr Hockey. When he was Treasurer in 2013, he had the Financial System Inquiry. It reported in 2014. Then we had the Ramsay review, commissioned in 2016, into the complaints framework in financial services. That report was released on 9 May of this year. Both of those inquiries were designed to avoid a royal commission into the banking and financial sector, and they've gestated and given birth to the bill that we see before us now. 


I've never been a supporter of a royal commission into banks. I believe—and I said this to some senior banking executives—there was a degree of inevitability about it because of what the National Party was doing, with the support of the Greens, the Labor Party and others. That doesn't mean that I fully support it, but it will be coming into being now, with the government having initiated it. The terms of reference may not satisfy some in the building, but at least the royal commission will provide a complete ventilation of many of the issues that people have been talking about, including the Financial Complaints Authority. That's why my advice to the government, for what it is worth, is that they shouldn't be proceeding with this bill. This is front running that was designed to avoid a royal commission and an inquiry into the financial services sector, but principally the banks. They now have that and, yet, they're still proceeding with this bill. It's not saving a substantial amount of money, it's not reducing bureaucracy. In actual fact, I think what it's going to do is create an environment where people will be treated differently according to how their advice was received.


Currently, within the financial services framework, there is a huge difference between a bank wealth management arm, for example, with all the billions of dollars' worth of resources available to it—and the inherent conflicts of interest that also go with that, I must say—to an independently owned financial planning arm, a licensee of a broader financial services licence holder, a truly independent fee-only adviser versus your suburban accountant who might be providing some advice on self-managed superannuation funds, or they might have a specialist financial planner in there. They're different entities. The people accessing them have different expectations. As a result, I believe that those individual entities should have the right to choose a complaints mechanism that will work for them, that is going to be responsive and understanding of the different applications that go right through the financial services sector, rather than merging entities into one that is essentially going to be operating for the big corporates. That's the conclusion that I've drawn—it will be operating for the big banks, it will be mired in bureaucracy, it will force a compliance regime almost that will make the independently owned financial planner or the smaller shop almost unviable.


Choice in complaints resolution is critical, in my view. Not only does it foster competition and more responsiveness but it will, I think, keep costs down. And let's make no mistake about this. The cost of compliance when you're providing advice to clients or providing any services associated with money means it's becoming almost prohibitive to provide specialised or personalised financial advice to the smaller mum-and-dad investor, if I can put it like that. For the person that is starting out and accumulating a nest egg, saying, 'Well, I'd like some financial planning advice,' it's not viable. It's not viable for them to access personalised financial planning advice, because the compliance is enormous.


I understand that this compliance has grown over the course of time because of rogue advisers, dishonest acts and the fact that, wherever there is a pool of money, you will find rogues and sharks attracted to it. That is simply the way. But legislating for the aberrations is wrong. I think what is much more important is: where something has been done incorrectly, where criminal activity has taken place, that that be pursued to the full extent of the law, not that you should have to cause people to fill in 150 pages of documents before they can access it. Where rogues exist, kick them out of the industry. Ensure that clients are compensated. But the best way you can do it is to make it crystal clear what people are signing up to—and say, 'This is what we're putting you into. This is the fee that's going to be attached to it. This is the service you can expect'—and not hide it at the back of the fat bit of puffery in the client forms. Put it front and centre, explain it to them, get them to initial every particular point and get them to understand the risks attached to it.


It highlights, I must say, the lack of financial education that is taking place in this country. It is another area where governments of successive persuasions have been abject failures, quite frankly. They say they've got the ASIC MoneySmart website to warn of scams and all of that. That's great; it's fantastic. But when our children come out of the school system and don't understand the difference between compound and simple interest, or even the most basic fundamentals of investing, you think it is a scandal. Education shouldn't just be about history or the application of literature; it should be about equipping them with very sound and sensible life skills.


There are two areas in this where I think you can radically change individuals' lives, and particularly children's. If you equip them with good money habits and an understanding of investment, you will offer them choices and freedom that is otherwise unavailable to them. Similarly, I would say that, if you can teach people to maintain good health habits, you will equip them with a lifetime of, all things being equal, mobility that is going to serve them in good stead as well. I put my money where my mouth is and I wrote a couple of little books for children in this regard on both of those topics because I think they are absolutely critical to the success and the well-rounding of an individual.


They are two abject failures of our education system, and no amount of tinkering around the edges will protect individuals where their own knowledge is deficient. I don't say that to malign the individuals, but, if you do not understand even the most basics of what is being put in front of you, whether it comes to investment, finance, interest rates or fees, then how can you possibly make an informed judgement? It is little wonder, then, that those people, when it doesn't work for them, start to complain about how they've been mistreated and wrongly sold a product or an environment.


That is why the relationship between the adviser and the client is critical—so that they get to know each other, so that they get to know the goals and so that the client can trust them. If we deny individuals that by removing the choice of a complaints mechanism and driving up the cost of financial advice and planning, we limit the ability for individuals to access financial advice. Then, of course, they're driven into the one-size-fits-all fund, which often is the most expensive. These massive retail funds, run by banks or anyone else in their wealth management arms, often have onerous fees and duplicate multiple levels of fees. I'm inherently not attracted to the consolidation of these complaints mechanisms and review mechanisms. I think that it is critical that we provide choice.


I understand that the Labor Party have some amendments to excise the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal from this bill. I also understand that the motives may be less than pure, if I can put it like that.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  I'm sorry to make those suggestions to you, Senator Collins, through you, Acting Deputy Chair, but the fact that the ACTU and the CPSU are opposed to the incorporation of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal suggests that it's more about the unionised workforce than almost anything else. However, notwithstanding my misgivings regarding your motivations, I'm inclined to support the amendments because I do think that even having two choices in the superannuation space, for example, is much better than having only one.


My preference would be to shelve this bill, quite frankly—and, if the government were smart, they would shelve it and wait for the outcome of the royal commission that they've initiated. I say that because, by their own amendment—I was looking at the running sheet—there is a review of operational amendments still to come. So they're acknowledging that they're going to have a look at this in 18 months time to see if it works and they're doing that in light of the results of the royal commission, which is expected to report in 12 months.


Why are we passing legislation that is going to require a massive amount of change and is going to disrupt an industry? There are many in the financial planning area who have expressed concerns to me with this consolidation and amalgamation and how it's going to affect them and their clients. So why would we be making a change that is going to require a cost—which is, I guess, deleterious to many in the industry—and is going to act in favour of the big banks, whilst at the same time we are having a royal commission, ostensibly into the financial services industry, that is going to examine the conduct of the big banks, amongst many others, and then come back after that and review this legislation? It would be much better, much simpler and much more efficient, given that there is actually a cost to implementing this, to wait until after the royal commission and then say, 'Let's have another look at this.' I'd be happy to go along with that. That would actually be the preferred option.


Whilst I will support the second reading of this bill, I do not commit to its passage or supporting its passage in the third reading. I note there are many concerns in the industry. I note there are many concerns amongst the players involved in it, including the credit industry ombudsman, who said that a banking royal commission should come first before the impact of this and that it impacts upon them. I'm concerned about access to independent financial services, in particular, for the smaller consumers. I'm concerned about the professional indemnity requirements that are going to arise from this, and there are many in that industry as well. This is literally a can of worms that I think is unnecessary, particularly given it was designed to stave off a royal commission. The royal commission has now been enacted, and this bill should be put on the too-hard shelf until the outcome of the royal commission is known.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2017-12-06,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:50):  I thank all senators who contributed to this debate. And I would like to thank those crossbenchers who have indicated to the government their support for this Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017. This bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 and other related legislation to overhaul the financial system dispute resolution framework by establishing a new one-stop-shop dispute resolution body, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, to ensure that consumers and small businesses have access to a free, fast and binding dispute resolution process.


This bill forms part of the government's broader commitment to ensure that where consumers or small business, in particular, have legitimate grievances about the way they were treated by banks or other financial services providers, there is an avenue for efficient but also binding dispute resolution without having to go through the court system. 


I would like to just pick up on Senator Bernardi contribution's, where he indicated that we should do nothing in relation to this, in relation to improving the dispute resolution processes for consumers and small business until such time as the royal commission has reported. That goes to the heart of one of our core reservations about a royal commission into the banks and the financial system more generally. We were concerned that this is precisely what would happen, that people would use it as an excuse to do nothing, until such time as the report has been received. The government's view is that we need to continue to act, we need to continue to address issues, we need to continue to take real action. This piece of legislation is a core part of our package of taking action to ensure that consumers and small business, in particular, can have the most appropriate access possible to efficient and binding dispute resolution processes. 


Let me make a few other remarks. In addition to the requirements that will be placed on the Australian Financial Complaints Authority via this legislation, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services will have regard to the AFCA's proposed terms of reference in making an authorisation decision, as stated in the government's commitment to One Nation. The Minister for Revenue and Financial Services will require that AFCA's terms of reference will provide that an adverse inference should generally be drawn from a financial services provider's failure to provide information that is material to the resolution of a dispute, except in exceptional and unusual circumstances. In addition to this, it is her intention that for disputes relating to loans, to primary production businesses, including agriculture, forestry and fishery businesses, she will require the compensation cap of up to $2 million for all disputes about a small-business credit facility of up to $5 million. 


I also note the support of both One Nation and Senator Anning for the government's amendments to require a review of AFCA after 18 months. And, again, just responding to some of the issues raised by Senator Bernardi in his contribution, that is just good practice, after a new initiative has been in place for a period, to conduct a review to assess whether it has delivered based on what was intended and, if not, what additional evolutionary improvements can be made to the arrangements that are in place. With those few words, I commend this bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-12-06,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (12:48):  I rise today to speak briefly about the life of Robert Malcolm Harper, who recently passed away in my home state of Queensland. Bob Harper was a giant in our political movement and previously in what was the predecessor Liberal Party in Queensland. Whilst we lose many colleagues and members over our time in parliament, I think there are very few who whose lives were so exceptional that they attract a speech onto the Hansard. But in the case of Bob Harper, that is particularly warranted.


It could be said that Bob was born with Liberal blood in his veins. His parents bestowed upon him the names of two of their personal friends—one being Sir Robert Menzies, and the other Bob's godfather, Sir Malcolm Ritchie, who was the founding president of the Australian Liberal Party. Bob was the youngest of four children, with brother and sisters Neville, Dot and Jan, and he was born to Neville and Hazel Harper at Nundah Private Hospital in Brisbane. And, with the exception of his experiences in the bush—where he worked for a long period of time at Wandoan on a cattle property; his brother, Neville, was a respected minister in the Queensland parliament at that stage in Bob's life—most of his life has been concentrated in and about metropolitan Brisbane. In 1972 Bob married his darling wife, Rhonda. I attended his funeral, and there was evidence that Rhonda was not an easy catch for Bob: he had to spend some serious time in pursuit of the woman who went on to be his darling wife for so many decades.


As I deliver this speech, I will add that many of my colleagues from the Liberal-National Party in Queensland have contacted me this week to ensure that it is on the record that they support my speech. In particular, Senator McGrath wanted me to note that he attaches himself to my remarks, and will be delivering a tribute of his own to Bob in the fullness of time.


Bob's love of family and of his wife were matched only by his love of politics. It's fair to say that Bob devoted his life to politics, both as an active member of a political movement and by going on to represent his local area in the state parliament. Of course, this is after Bob had run for the state seat of Nudgee in Queensland. During the course of that campaign he was chased down the road by a man with an axe. Despite this, Bob persisted in his pursuit of politics not only as a member of the state legislature but also—in my time knowing Bob, and for so many of his friends and colleagues—as a very serious and influential honorary member of our political movement, to which he devoted so much of his time over such a long period of time. Bob was the second-ever nominated life member of the Liberal-National Party on amalgamation, behind the father of the party, the honourable Lawrence Springborg. With an inaugural party membership that touched on some 14,000 people, to be granted the second-ever life membership—second only to the father of the party—I think in and of itself speaks massive volumes about Bob's contribution.


As a state member, he made terrific inroads for his electorate: he got the Mount Ommaney Police Station—this is now a thriving, quite dense suburb in Brisbane in my home state—the Centenary State High School and the war memorial for his constituents. He served as the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, and then as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Premier and the Treasurer. Bob lost his seat in 1998; however, that wasn't the end of his political career. He went on to administer the office of our current Attorney-General. Bob's devotion over a long period of time and over many thousands of hours needs to be properly noted.


Bob was, I think, almost without peer as a campaigner in my home state, particularly in state politics; although he was responsible for supporting many of our federal members, and I think can be credited with maintaining two of our federal seats and at least one of our state seats. That was as a direct result of his stewardship.


I think what most of us will recall about Bob Harper is the intense honesty of the man. Bob always believed that politics played a significantly important role in the stability of our communities and he believed that the people ought to know what was on the minds of candidates who were seeking their endorsement in this framework of representative democracy as we know it. Bob believed that the calibre of the candidates came first. He often successfully supported candidates. 


Bob was a man of great influence. You hear about people having the numbers around political parties. Bob had his share and someone else's at most times. Particularly in metropolitan seats, he had great influence around the success or otherwise of candidates. I know from conversations that I had with him over a long period of time about the value that Bob put on the family circumstances of candidates, people who were experienced in business and in life. He would always come back to where he started and say that they had to reflect the standards and values of honesty and integrity that people expected of themselves and therefore expected in their members of parliament.


He was a strong man, although he presented himself in a gentle form. Bob wasn't prone to raising his voice or inflicted by one of the conditions that I suffer from, from time to time: using shearers' language. He put his cases very simply and plainly, and as a result he was much respected and had great influence. When I started, I said Bob was a true warrior. There are so many things that attract people into political life and political influence; but it's the true warriors and the true believers, who believe in the ideology and the value that they believe that their political franchise or political movement brings to life, who are the most dangerous. They don't bend, they don't sway and they don't come in the dead of night. They are out there and rely upon their intellect and their ability to communicate their position and their own great personal values. This fellow was front and centre, and head and shoulders, above his peers in relation to his approach to this. He believed in his state and he believed in his nation, and it reflected the way that he operated. He wasn't just a true warrior; he was an inspiration to multiple generations of political activists and practitioners on the conservative side of politics. He was a campaigner extraordinaire. There was no question about that. I think many who didn't know him personally but remember him professionally will remember that first and foremost.


More importantly, he was a devoted husband, father, grandfather and uncle to so many. His three daughters paid him the most enormous tribute at his funeral. I leaned over to my wife and said, 'If there's a possibility, I want to hire those three girls to deliver the eulogy at my funeral.' It was a wonderful, moving presentation by those girls. Bob will be fondly remembered and respected, notwithstanding that he's no longer with us. He made a substantial contribution to state and national affairs. I say: Bob, you'll be well remembered respectfully by so many of us.

 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:04):  I seek leave to make a brief statement in relation to Senator Sinodinos.


Leave granted.




Senator BRANDIS:
  This morning, during the debate on the reference of Senator Gallagher to the High Court, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate made a number of remarks about our colleague Senator Arthur Sinodinos. I should say, particularly in view of Senator Sinodinos's health and the fact that he is on leave from the Senate to deal with the health issue that has afflicted him, that I appreciate the fact that those comments were made by the Leader of the Opposition in a very temperate manner. Nevertheless, they were made. In view of those comments, I wish to advise the Senate that Senator Sinodinos has received advice from the relevant minister in the Greek government, the Minister of Interior, that he is not and has never been a citizen of Greece. I table that letter, which is written in the Greek language, along with a translation of that letter provided by the Greek embassy. These documents confirm that Senator Sinodinos is not and has never been a citizen of Greece.

Senator WONG:
  Given Senator Sinodinos's personal circumstances, I regret that I feel that it is incumbent upon us to respond. But, given that the document has been tabled and some assertions made, I do want to place upon the record the view of the Labor Party, which, as I again say, both in light of our view about partisan referrals and in light of his medical circumstances, we leave for the government to reflect upon.


The documents tabled by the Attorney deal with whether or not Senator Sinodinos has registered his Greek citizenship. The allegation is not that he registered his citizenship but that he acquired it. The consistent advice that the opposition has had and has given its persons nominating for parliament is that Greek citizenship by descent is automatic at birth, as is made clear in article 1 of the Greek Nationality Code. Under article 18 of that code, a written declaration must be submitted to the nearest Greek consulate. Those are the relevant documents. We don't believe the documents that have been tabled reflect that. Certainly, the advice to Labor candidates in a similar position over the years has consistently been that such a written declaration must be provided.

 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (15:07):  I refer to questions asked by Senator McAllister yesterday in question time in my capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. I have sought advice from the minister and I can advise as follows: for the purposes of administrative simplicity, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection assesses people from comparable English-speaking nations as meeting the English requirement.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:10):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) and the Minister for Employment (Senator Cash) to questions without notice asked by Senators Carr, Farrell and Sterle today relating to proposed laws concerning foreign donations and influence and to a 7.30 report concerning drivers for Tip Top.


The politics of this government is no longer about the battle of ideas or adherence to principle. We have heard very pejorative words used today—and we've heard all week—about the attacks on individuals. This is a government that has descended to assaults upon the character of individuals.


It was Malcolm Turnbull who came into office purporting to be a man of integrity. He was a man who said he would treat the public with intelligence. He said they would not be treated as idiots. What we have seen is that this government is now conducting itself on the basis of personal smears. We know that they've cast aside all assertions to be acting on terms of principle. We no longer have a conversation in this country about the values that should shape this country. We no longer have a conversation about the sort of country we want Australia to be. It is a conversation now that the Prime Minister—in fact, he discourages his front bench—is not interested in engaging in.


We see a proposition advanced with real venom on a premise that simply is this: that Bill Shorten and leading members of the Labor caucus are this government's and this Prime Minister's social and intellectual inferiors. This is what you get when you are falling behind in 24 news polls. It's a desperate measure seized upon by desperate men and women in desperate times. This is a government that is even willing to suggest that Labor MPs and Labor senators are traitors. No evidence is ever suggested to ascertain the truth of that matter, other than to imply that the security agents of this country support such a contention. What a preposterous idea: that the Attorney-General will engage the security agencies of this country in the domestic politics of the Commonwealth.




Senator Brandis:
  I've never done so.




Senator KIM CARR:
  Yes, you have. You've done it repeatedly in this chamber and in the press on a regular basis, for which you should be condemned. The hypocrisy on this question is absolutely breathtaking. You don't care who you throw under the bus—even your former trade minister. No wonder he comes out and makes his contempt perfectly clear for the politics that you're now engaging in. Why is it that he says it's quite clear that you're engaging in a shameless and unethical political stunt?


Huang Xiangmo of the Yuhu Group has been a very generous donor to the Liberal Party—over $1 million. Of course, that's on the public record. When they accepted that money it wasn't an act of treason. However, when the Labor Party is engaged with this man, there is a completely different and double standard. When the leader of this government appears in public with these individuals, it's regarded as perfectly legitimate, because it's the Labor Party that's unworthy and Labor politicians that are somehow illegitimate.


This government, because of its desperation, has now in a shocking attempt been reduced to smearing the reputation of Bill Shorten, because he has been so successful. They have so completely underestimated the willingness of the Australian people to engage in a proper conversation about the future direction of this country. You don't care about the consequence: the consequence to our democratic policies; the consequence to our institutions, our universities; and the consequence to our relationship with our No. 1 trading partner. You don't care about the consequence of the misuse of intelligence or the partisan use of the police forces of this country. You'll do anything you can to trash the reputations of individuals and this country's democratic processes. It's a process for which you should hang your head in shame, because it will not work. When Andrew Robb calls you out, you know just how desperate you've become and how shockingly puerile this government is— (Time expired)

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2017-12-06,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:15):  I thought the questions were about foreign donations and counterespionage but the outrage, or the feigned outrage, we have just seen from Senator Carr points to the fact that in actual fact their leader is the person who is under significant pressure at the moment for the simple reason that the contention put forward by Senator Carr fails the pub test. For the average person in the street who looks at the conduct of people in this house—whether they be crossbench, government or indeed opposition members who have been held to account by the Labor Party over section 44, where there has been no ill will and no suggestion of conduct that is not loyal to Australia—there has been all kinds of outrage from those opposite. Yet, if we go to the wording of section 44 of the Constitution, it says that disqualification applies to any person who: 


… is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power. 


We have seen Mr Shorten protect and not admonish or hold to account, in a similar standard, somebody who has clearly conducted himself in a manner that members here—even members opposite—have recognised is not appropriate. But the outrage that is thrown at people who failed section 44 under citizenship is not thrown at those who the pub test would say have actually breached that in terms of 'obedience' or 'allegiance' to a foreign power. Because it's not about donations to a political party; the issue here was personal donations and conduct directly related to things that breached the Labor Party's own policy. That is the issue at hand here. The policy area that Senator Carr referred to and the questions that were asked went to the proposed legislation around political donations, tackling foreign interference and espionage. They are the serious issues of government that the Turnbull government is getting on with in the national interest. 


The government has put forward legislation to address the issue of foreign donations that will actually ban foreign donations, unlike the proposal that was introduced by Mr Shorten in February of this year which purports to ban foreign donations but actually has significant loopholes. The definitions of foreign property don't take into account the actual owner of the asset, just where the asset is held. So the effect of that is that there are many ways that legislation, or that ban, could be circumvented by using money that is already in an Australian bank account. So it goes to the heart of the fact that this is a government that actually sees a problem and provides a considered solution that will have not just the headline of a fix but also a policy that will have the effect of banning foreign donations and that influence. 


More broadly, the government is concerned, as are the Australian people, about foreign interference and espionage. It's not just occurring here in Australia. On a recent delegation to the European Union, I heard firsthand evidence from countries who are concerned about a range of foreign interference in their news cycles and their political systems right through to what we hear in America about the use of Facebook ads to push false news and create dissent and division in communities. In Australia we have concerns about pressure on people, who are of a different ethnic origin living in Australia, to support the views of a foreign government. We see universities under pressure about what they will or won't teach. We see actions taken at conferences and symposiums in Australia where, essentially, speakers are shut down by the actions of foreign delegates.


There are a range of ways that we see foreign interference. These reforms will mean that we are going to address the threat of political interference by foreign intelligence services or, indeed, by other governments and their representatives, whether they be formal or through business or expatriate links. It is in the national interest that the government is doing this, and it is a shame that, on such an important topic, those taking note from the other side should resort to attacking the person and the character, in this case, of the Attorney-General and of the Prime Minister, as opposed to dealing with the substantive issue, which is an issue that goes directly to our national interest.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2017-12-06,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:20):  I rise to take note of the answers to questions that I put to Minister Cash today. I cannot believe what I heard today. What a disgraceful episode that was. I asked the minister and the government when they became aware of some shocking employment conditions at Tip Top, where one driver died in the car park from a heart attack. His family were interviewed last night on 7.30 and they said that they believed their husband and father had been driven to an early grave. He had worked six months without a day off—working seven days a week and sometimes 17 hours a day. The lack of empathy I got from the minister could not have been more embarrassing or less caring. All she wanted to waffle on about was some funding for some roads—and, if someone has a problem with a truck, get on the internet or something.


Tip Top is a name that has been around forever, but I for one will never purchase another Tip Top product—and I reckon Australia should get in behind me. Tip Top are a subsidiary of Associated British Foods, which just weeks ago reported a profit of over A$27 billion. These so-and-sos at Tip Top are squeezing the supply chain down to the point where people are dying. One poor man who had lung cancer was so ill that he couldn't go to work. When he rang up, do you know what the response was from Tip Top—that brand on the shelves at Woolworths, Coles, Aldi and the like? Their answer was: 'We don't care how crook you are. You have a contract; get in here.' He couldn't afford to put a driver on. That is the way that he was treated by this multibillion-dollar raider from Britain. What a disgraceful company!


The minister, in her response to my question, accused me—it's on the record—of trying to spin a political point when I spoke about the 301 deaths on our roads involving articulated vehicles. I get really, really wild about this as an ex-long distance truck driver. I carved my living on the roads, the highways and byways from Perth to Darwin, starting off as a 15-year-old in the removal industry and then running my own trains up there on a fortnightly basis. I know the pain that truckies go through. I know the lack of quality lifestyle that they have. I worked for a company which wasn't all that fantastic in paying, sometimes—but, fortunately, we were a collective. When we weren't paid right, we had the ability—in those good old days—to withdraw our labour. We could park our $200,000 rigs out the front of the yard and say, 'We're not moving, because we aren't being paid a rate that can pay off our fuel bills, fix our trucks, pay off our trucks, feed our families and pay off our house payments.' These poor devils working for Tip Top have had rate reductions.


I want to mention the two drivers from Tip Top who came here from Sydney, because they are brave men. Mark Goldfinch and Paul Clapson came here yesterday to tell their story to Australian legislators. Not one coalition government member—Liberal, National, LNP—would meet with them. Why not? Then the minister gets up in question time—like some complete; I won't say that word because I will have to withdraw it, and I can't put my tongue around a nice enough word—and tries to push away these deaths that have been experienced at one bread company, because the poor devils have had $1,000 a week taken off their remuneration, and treats my question and my concern about deaths on our roads as a political stunt. I am absolutely concerned about the deaths happening on our roads.


I'm the son of a long-distance truck driver. I'm the father of a long-distance truck driver. I absolutely have fears every night: are my mates and my son safe out there on the highway and are other road users safe out on the highway? Every truck in this country should have a driver that is rested safely. He or she should be paid a rate that will cover their fixed costs and their variable costs, and give them a working wage—not wage theft from so-and-sos, like these mongrels here from Britain Tip Top. And I'm not making this up. So I challenge anyone from Tip Top, if you're listening, to write me a letter and tell me I'm wrong; tell me that Mark Goldfinch, Paul Clapson and all their mates—about eight of them—haven't had wage theft. What a disgusting company!

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2017-12-06,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (15:25):  The emotional plea from Senator Sterle was, indeed, stirring. I don't doubt for a moment his sincerity. I do doubt, however, his accuracy. It was, indeed, those opposite that tried to destroy the trucking industry. The government, in fact, with the support of the crossbench, were the ones that took action to urgently abolish the RSRT and to put an end to its payments order, which directly threatened the livelihoods of tens of thousands of owner truck drivers and their family operators. That payments order caused crippling financial hardship and emotional distress to thousands of owner-drivers. It was very bad for small business; it was very bad for owner truck drivers; it was bad for families; and it was bad for the economy.


The RSRT was implemented in 2012 by none other than Bill Shorten. It was done to appease the Transport Workers Union in order to silence their public opposition to the Julia Gillard carbon tax. The payments order was designed purely to push owner-drivers out of business and into the employ of the large transport companies, making them a workforce that, of course, would be much easier to unionise. This government was not going to stand by and watch the livelihoods of those tens of thousands of people be destroyed. So, in 2016, with the support of the majority of the crossbench of the Senate, this government abolished the RSRT and saved the livelihoods of those thousands of small businesses—those thousands of owner-operator truck drivers. Mr Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, has made it clear that Labor supports the re-establishment of the RSRT and of the pay order. Labor continues to support the destruction of the tens of thousands of small businesses throughout Australia. It is entirely impossible not to feel enormous empathy for the men and women whose lives have been turned upside down by the unnecessary ordeal caused by the tribunal's unfair payments order.


Owner-drivers, as we all know, are the lifeblood of the economy. We simply couldn't survive without them. This government will never do anything which threatens their viability with significant implications across the country. By abolishing that tribunal, the government has been able to provide $4 million per year to vital road projects, including contributions to the Heavy Vehicle Safety Initiative package that delivers chain-of-responsibility education and improves heavy vehicle monitoring. It has funded research into heavy vehicle driver fatigue to inform the development of future fatigue arrangements. It has also provided safer freight networks in areas identified as higher risk. It has contributed to the Black Spots Program and to the national Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program and the Bridges Renewal Program to deliver the key infrastructure to improve heavy vehicle safety outcomes. It has also gone to developing a master industry code of practice. It has gone to developing safety, education and awareness campaigns. It has also provided pilots for the new livestock transfer infrastructure.


While I feel for Senator Sterle and I can hear the emotion in his voice, I suggest to you, Madam Deputy President, that they are, in fact, crocodile tears—that there is an extent of theatre and of performance art to Senator Sterle's allegations today.


I've surprised myself today because I do tend to agree, to some extent, with Senator Carr. He was right when he said that this is a government that was elected because of its principles. Indeed, the announcements made yesterday by the Attorney-General, by the Prime Minister and also by the Minister for Finance, Mathias Cormann, suggest that we are acting on those principles.


It's not just rhetoric. It's not just empty words. We are acting on those principles. The behaviour of those opposite, while not the cause of it, certainly demands it; it certainly inspires it. This is a government of principle. This is a government that's acting in the national interest. It's a government that's doing what Australians expect of it. It's a government that is getting on with the job of looking after the interests of not just some, not just a select few, but all Australians.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2017-12-06,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:30):  I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Brandis and Senator Cash and, in doing so, acknowledge what a lacklustre and insincere response we heard from Senator Brandis to questions regarding the introduction of foreign donations legislation. We know how insincere and lacklustre it was because Senator Brandis has been silent on the matter of foreign donations legislation for months now, if not years.


I think it was back in June when, on Sky News, Senator Brandis talked about how the government would introduce in the spring sittings legislation to ban foreign donations. Yet here we are, the day before parliament rises for the year, and Senator Brandis is flagging that, finally, the government wants to introduce foreign donations legislation. We know why this is. It is a political stunt by this government to show that it is finally doing something about foreign donations to political parties, unlike the Labor Party, which has for years been trying to legislate in this manner, both in government and in opposition.


There is a bill on the table right now that Mr Shorten tabled to ban foreign donations to political parties. It's been on the table for over a year, and yet the coalition has deliberately ignored this bill and tried to obfuscate and prevent any kind of debate being brought on simply because it is not interested in banning foreign donations. It is continuing to take foreign donations into its political coffers for the various elections that it has to fight. I have a very good question for Senator Brandis: is the Liberal Party taking foreign donations for the current Bennelong by-election?


What is really clear here is the government's insincerity in dealing with this issue. As Senator Farrell asked Senator Brandis, why did the coalition in 2010 vote against laws to ban foreign donations? Why has the coalition, time and time again, voted against laws—laws that are in place in the United States, in the UK and in Canada, and that Labor has been trying to legislate for in this place for years—to ban foreign donations? This government is not interested in doing that because it is quite comfortable continuing to take such donations.


If Senator Brandis were serious about this legislation, then the parliament would have sat last week so that the debate could have continued and so that we could have passed this legislation this year. But he is not serious about it at all. He has been dragged kicking and screaming to deal with it because of the politics that has come to light surrounding the issues at play—issues that, of course, the Liberal Party know very well they are tainted with themselves.


If we look back through the history of donations legislation in this parliament, it was under the Hawke government all those years ago that we set a disclosure threshold for political donations of $1,500. What did Prime Minister John Howard do the moment he came in? He lifted that threshold to $10,000—a $10,000 threshold for disclosure of donations. Not only did Labor's legislation that Mr Shorten introduced a year ago look at the issue of banning foreign donations; it also looked at the issue of thresholds. It also looked at the issue of banning anonymous donations to political parties. It also looked at the issue of donation splitting. It looked at a range of disclosure issues to ensure that we build in an automatic, instinctive process to ensure we are accountable, including donation disclosure in as close to real time as possible. All of that has been on the table in this parliament for over a year. The Labor Party have wanted to ban foreign donations for over a year. This government has not. 




Senator Williams:
  You kept taking them!




Senator SINGH:
  No. The Labor Party has not taken foreign donations since July this year. Despite the government not wanting to debate it, we banned them anyway. (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-12-06,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:35):  The motion to take note of answers moved by Senator Carr made reference to Senator Sterle's question. I take a point of difference with Senator Hume when she suggests that Senator Sterle was less than serious or was putting a bit of theatre into it. I have no doubt that Senator Sterle feels very passionately and strongly on behalf of truck drivers. I have no doubt that his concern for their welfare is very genuine. I do not agree that increased rates of pay or somehow resurrecting the RSRT will make the circumstance which he described today any better, notwithstanding the fact that I understand how difficult it is that a man who was suffering from cancer had to fulfil his contractual obligations. 


I would like to make this point, and it is a serious one for this chamber: the minister may have been giving an answer that Senator Sterle didn't appreciate, but, during her answer, multiple points of order were taken, although there were some directly relevant responses. Senator Sterle took one himself, and I think that was reasonably genuine. Senator Cameron took a point of order as well. I think Senator Sterle took another one, and there could have been Senator Wong also. I'm not sure whether she took one. But there were three, four or maybe even five points of order, which meant the minister wasn't even able to get out a response that might have illuminated the matter. I think those were spurious points of order. They didn't assist in our ability to get the answers that Senator Sterle was, I think, quite genuinely seeking. 


There was a repeal of the RSRT last year by the government. That was due to a change of mind by the Nick Xenophon Team. I recall that Senator Xenophon, when it was introduced, invoked that same sort of emotive response, about someone who was tragically killed by an out-of-control truck whilst they were changing a tyre on the side of the road. Anyway, after examining the merits of it and recognising that there really is no correlation between road safety and rates of pay when it comes to truck drivers, the Senate, in its wisdom, changed the legislation. I supported that, because, notwithstanding the emotions and the personal commitment that Senator Sterle and others have in this space, I don't think it's entirely relevant to the Tip Top contractual obligations that were raised today. 


I guess the point is that, if we want to get answers to questions, and there is a requirement for direct relevance in this space, then it is incumbent upon all of us to not raise multiple points of order seeking to score political points, because then the person answering the questions might not be tempted to score political points themselves and might actually come within cooee of responding to the question. 


I also make the point that yesterday, in taking note of answers, there was some discussion about national security issues, and this was something that Senator Carr also moved a motion about, in response to Senator Brandis's concerns. The concerns about national security are not confected. They're absolutely serious. There is a quite genuine need for reform in this place. It's on both major parties, who have taken donations from individuals whom ASIO have warned them about. We have the circumstance with Senator Dastyari, who has warned an individual that they may be under surveillance and they should go outside to discuss it, free of the authorities' listening devices. I find that extraordinary, and I find it extraordinary that it's defended on that side of the chamber, because I know that even Senator Dastyari's close friends can't defend it. They were giving him counsel and advice, which is completely contrary to what Mr Shorten, Senator Carr and others are saying in this place.


If we're serious about trying to restore some faith and confidence in the body politic, if you're serious about wanting to ensure that people have at least an understanding that we're trying to act in the national interest here, you cannot defend the indefensible. You've got to put aside the tribal message and you've got to call it out when it's wrong. Senator Dastyari is completely wrong in this space, and I think anyone that defends him here is completely wrong. The Australian public know it. As Graham Richardson, a former Senator, says, 'The mob will work you out,' and the mob have worked this out pretty quick. (Time expired)

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for three minutes.




Senator SIEWERT:
  Senator Bernardi took the crossbench spot—



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator SIEWERT:
  It's normally the crossbench spot—when he didn't have a question today. I asked a question about a very important matter, which was the royal commission inquiry into the child protection and youth detention systems of the Northern Territory, known as the Don Dale inquiry, which the government unfortunately didn't answer. While Senator Brandis repeated some of the comments that the Prime Minister had made in the other place on Monday, which I had actually read, it did not help inform the chamber as to what I asked, which was: is the government going to implement all of the recommendations from the royal commission? There are at least 17 that are specifically targeted at the Commonwealth, and there are others that we expect the Commonwealth to work on with the Northern Territory. I would have thought that the Commonwealth could have got a fairly good idea about those by now, given that it's been a number of weeks since the royal commission recommendations were handed down. The government also squibbed on telling us a time line for when we can expect their response and what it's going to look like. There are a number of really important issues here.


The second question I asked was specifically about recommendation 7.3, which was about immediate engagement with Aboriginal community representatives to negotiate the broad terms of a partnership between the communities and the government to boost better outcomes for children and young people. The reason I asked about this is that it's absolutely critical. It's at the foundation of most of the recommendations—certainly the recommendations from the Family Matters report, which I talked about in this place just last night, and also the Change the Record report, which is: anything to do with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples has to be done in partnership and where the community is taking the lead on these important issues. That's why I asked about that. And, again, the government did not answer that question. They squibbed it again when it came to their answer to my final supplementary, which was: what's happening in the rest of Australia? We went to the same old 'states and territories' and that old backwards and forwards between states and territories and the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth clearly has a role of leadership here and, as articulated in these recommendations, a lot of responsibility. There are a number of recommendations particularly for the Commonwealth to take up, and that needs to happen around Australia, not just in the Northern Territory.




Senator Bernardi:
  Mr President, for the sake of accuracy: I didn't take a crossbench spot. As a crossbencher, I sought to contribute to a debate that was in order.

It delivers on the Government's election commitment to resolve outstanding Aboriginal land claims in the Northern Territory and to work with Indigenous land owners to ensure their land rights deliver the economic opportunities that should come from owning your own land. 


This Bill also gives practical effect to our commitment to working in partnership with Indigenous Australians.


The Government is committed to the recognition of Indigenous land through statutory land rights and native title and we are working with traditional owners and land councils to make sure these are resolved as soon as possible. 


The Bill adds areas subject to four traditional land claims in the Kakadu region of the Northern Territory to Schedule 1 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (Land Rights Act) so that the land can be granted as Aboriginal land. It also provides for the leaseback of that land to the Director of National Parks (Director).


The Bill also adds land that was subject to a successful native title application in the Roper River region of the Northern Territory to Schedule 1 of the Land Rights Act so that the land can be granted as Aboriginal land. Scheduling of the land is consistent with the terms of the Township of Urapunga Indigenous Land Use Agreement executed by the native title parties and the Northern Territory Government.


The four land claim areas in the Kakadu region comprise approximately 50 per cent of Kakadu National Park (Park). 


Title to the majority of that land is held by the Director, a Commonwealth statutory office holder. Smaller land parcels subject to the land claims are Crown land held by the Northern Territory and Commonwealth. 


The balance of the land in the Park is already Aboriginal land and leased to the Director by the Aboriginal Land Trusts which hold title.


The land claims were lodged between 1984 and 1997. While they remain unresolved there are statutory limitations on dealing with the land. This has constrained potential developments in one of Australia's iconic tourism destinations and added a layer of complexity to the joint management arrangements in place between traditional Aboriginal owners and the Director. 


The parties to the land claims have agreed to settle on the basis of the land being scheduled for grant as Aboriginal land, subject to immediate leaseback to the Director of as much of that land as is required to continue to form part of the Park.


The Director is not the Crown for the purposes of the Land Rights Act in its current form and that would prevent the land from being granted after it is scheduled. 


The Bill amends the Land Rights Act to allow deeds of grant for the land to be delivered to Aboriginal Land Trusts and to take effect despite the interests of the Director.


The Bill also repeals certain existing provisions of the Land Rights Act relating to land descriptions in the Kakadu region that will be made redundant by adding the relevant land to Schedule 1.


The grants of these areas of land is supported by stakeholders including the Northern Territory Government, Northern Land Council and other local stakeholders. 


I commend the Bill to the chamber. 


AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (PLANNING AND LAND MANAGEMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 2017


Today I introduce into Parliament a Bill to improve the ability of the National Capital Authority—the NCA—to look after the Commonwealth interest in Canberra as our capital city. 


This Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 2017 will strengthen governance arrangements for the NCA. 


The NCA is a statutory authority that manages the Commonwealth's interests in the capital, especially through planning and the management of major Commonwealth assets in nationally important areas. 


The purpose of this Bill is to improve the governance, transparency and oversight of NCA activities by enhancing the role of its Authority—in effect, the NCA Board. Currently, the Accountable Authority for the NCA under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the PGPA Act) is its Chief Executive alone. 


Currently, the Authority lacks any prescribed corporate management responsibilities, including oversight of the NCA's finances. With the exception of planning decisions, members of the Authority have a role that is principally advisory. 


There is a need for a reformed corporate structure that provides greater transparency and accountability. This would also provide the Chief Executive and the Minister with the level of support they require. 


The Bill therefore amends the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 to establish the Authority as the accountable authority under the PGPA Act. It also empowers the Authority to provide the Chief Executive with specific directions in relation to the operation of the NCA. 


The Chief Executive will remain the head of the agency under the Public Service Act 1999. While the Authority would take on a greater role in oversighting corporate management, most day-to-day operations would still be handled by the Chief Executive. The Chief Executive will continue to have a close working relationship with the Authority by remaining an Authority member. 


The Bill also clarifies some provisions of the legislation, such as by confirming that Ministerial directions to the Authority are legislative instruments. It includes minor updates to ensure that the PALM Act is consistent with current practice on public sector governance. It makes all Authority members officials of the NCA so as to engage PGPA Act provisions on the duties of officials, notably care and diligence. 


There will be no changes to the NCA's basic functions, including concerning the planning of Canberra.


Conclusion


The Bill will ensure that the NCA continues to operate efficiently and effectively in planning and managing the national capital. It will do so by enabling the NCA to operate in way more consistent with the Government's expectations of a modern agency. 


I call on both Houses to show bipartisan support for the Bill and its non-controversial measures.


With this, I commend the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 2017. 


BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL RADIO) BILL 2017


The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2017 continues the Government's commitment to a more streamlined regulatory framework for digital radio. These amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 (Radcomms Act) further simplify digital radio processes. This includes efficiencies across the planning, licensing and allocation processes making for a more efficient rollout of digital radio services in regional Australia.


This government remains committed to removing unnecessary and outdated regulations that hamper the industry from delivering what audiences want. The reform agenda requires continuous effort. Small improvements such as these, over time, will provide a cumulative benefit to industry and consumers. The Bill makes a modest but welcome contribution in this regard.


Digital radio is now recognised as an important component of Australia's broadcasting landscape. In the decade since it was legislated, digital radio is now available in all Australian mainland state capital cities—Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney—and planning is being undertaken for permanent digital radio services in Canberra, Darwin and Hobart. 


Digital radio is being introduced to Australia in a staged way. Commercial radio broadcasters are the key driver in providing digital radio services in new areas, by targeting those areas where they are most likely to be commercially viable. Digital radio remains a supplementary part of the many broadcasting services available to Australians and the Government does not consider a switchover program to be appropriate. The Government also considers it important that the radio broadcasting industry remain the key driver in the rollout of digital radio into regional Australia. Nonetheless, the Government recognises that it still has a role to play in ensuring that any legislative or regulatory impediments to introduction of digital radio into regional Australia are removed and that the digital radio regulatory regime is working efficiently.


The Government acknowledges the ongoing work of industry members of the Digital Radio Planning Committee for Regional Australia. This Committee, which is chaired by the ACMA, was established following a recommendation of the Digital Radio Report tabled by this Government in July 2015. Committee members include the Department of Communications and the Arts, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Special Broadcasting Service, Commercial Radio Australia, the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The Committee has become a critical forum for industry, the regulator and Government to plan the future rollout of digital radio in regional Australia. Some of the digital radio issues being addressed in this Bill are a direct result of discussions at the Planning Committee. All the measures in the Bill are supported by Committee members.


The Bill intends to assist industry to expedite the rollout of digital radio to regional Australia. The Bill shortens several legislatively prescribed timeframes and removes unnecessary or redundant steps in the digital radio planning and licensing processes. Doing this reduces the overall time and cost for commercial broadcasters who want to rollout digital radio to viable regional markets. These benefits also extend to the community and national broadcasters.


Furthermore, it is important to recognise that radio broadcasters, whether they are located in metropolitan or regional markets, need to be more innovative and responsive to changes in audience demand and listening patterns. While this is a matter for the broadcasters themselves, the Government does have a role to play in ensuring the regulatory arrangements reflect the realities of the 21st century broadcasting market.


As part of this role, the Government is also introducing a measure in the Bill that will implement measures to clarify the calculation of digital radio excess capacity entitlements in the Radcomms Act. At present, there is the potential for existing excess capacity entitlements to be extinguished by later excess capacity allocations on foundation multiplexes. The Government considers this is not fair to the digital radio broadcasters who acquired excess capacity by allocation or competitive auction. The proposed measures aim to clarify that existing excess capacity entitlements allocated to content providers are considered when determining new excess capacity allocations. This will provide certainty to content providers on their existing excess capacity entitlements on foundation digital radio multiplexes, as well as other parties seeking access to excess capacity entitlements.


The Bill represents a necessary step in facilitating the rollout of digital radio to regional Australia.


BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FOREIGN MEDIA OWNERSHIP AND COMMUNITY RADIO) BILL 2017


Australia's media industry is under sustained and significant pressure, as digital technologies upend established business models and intensify competition for audiences and revenue. 


In October 2017, the Government secured passage of legislation that will enable Australia's media companies to deal with these challengers and better compete in what is now a global media environment. 


The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Act 2017 and the Commercial Broadcasting (Tax) Act 2017 implemented a number of the key measures of the Government's Broadcasting and Content Reform Package: the abolition of broadcasting licence fees; the introduction of a charge on spectrum more reflective of its value; and changes to the anti-siphoning scheme and list.


These are important initiatives that modernise broadcasting and content regulation and will improve the sustainability of Australia's media industry. But they don't mark the end of the reform program, and there is more work to be done. 


The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Foreign Media Ownership and Community Radio) Bill 2017 implements two measures developed as part of the passage of the media reform bills. 


The first is the establishment of a Register of Foreign Ownership of Media Assets (Register), to be overseen and administered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). The Register will enhance the transparency of foreign investment in Australian media companies and the levels and sources of such investment.


The second measure relates to applications for community radio broadcasting licences. The Bill will introduce a new 'local content' criterion that the ACMA can consider in assessing such applications, giving applicants the opportunity and incentive to deliver more localised content. 


I now turn to each of these measures. 


Foreign investment plays an important role in the Australian economy and is a key source of funding for Australian media companies. Despite this, there are few sources of information on this type of investment. Existing regulatory frameworks, including the disclosure obligations applicable for entities listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, don't identify foreign investors, and there is no information about investment in privately held media companies. 


From a public policy perspective this represents a significant information gap. The media has the unique ability to set news agendas and the context in which important issues are analysed and discussed. In turn, this allows the media to inform and shape community views on social, economic, and political issues. 


There is a strong case to ensure foreign investment in the Australian media is better understood, and the Register proposed in this Bill will achieve this outcome. It will ensure that the Australian public is not left in the dark about the levels and sources of foreign investment in Australian media companies. 


Under the Register, foreign persons will be required to notify the ACMA of any interests in regulated Australian media companies—commercial television, commercial radio and associated newspapers—where those interests exceed two and a half per cent. 


The main reporting obligations will be annual, at the end of each relevant financial year, along with any circumstance where a person becomes, or ceases to be, a foreign stakeholder for the purposes of the Register. A foreign person must report their interests within 30 days of the end of the financial year, or the change in their status as a foreign person, as applicable.


The details to be published on the Register will be limited to the foreign stakeholder's name and country of residence (for individuals), or the place of incorporation or formation for companies and trusts. Published information will also include the relevant interests in the media company, and the reason that the investor is a foreign person. 


Importantly, there will be protections in place to prevent the disclosure of commercially sensitive information. Foreign stakeholders will not be required to disclose sensitive information as part of the Register. However, if they do, the ACMA will be prohibited from publishing such information where it would materially impact the interests of the person. 


Although foreign stakeholders that are individuals will be required to disclose some personal information, for administrative and identification purposes, only their name and ordinary country of residence will be published on the Register. 


The reporting provisions established through the Register will be civil penalty provisions, and also designated infringement notice provisions. If a foreign person fails to comply with these reporting requirements, then the person may be liable for an administrative penalty. 


At the end of each financial year, the ACMA will present a report to the Minister, setting out the interests held by foreign stakeholders in Australian media companies. The ACMA will also have the opportunity to identify and comment on foreign investment trends, which will assist future Government decision making in the media industry.


The Register will complement existing regulatory frameworks governing foreign investment in Australia. It draws on key terms from the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, such as 'foreign government', 'foreign government investor', 'foreign person', and 'ordinarily resident'. It is also modelled, to an extent, on the National Register of Foreign Ownership of Water Entitlements, particularly in terms of the timing for disclosure and the type of information that foreign persons would need to supply. 


As a whole, the Register will provide greater transparency regarding foreign investment in the Australian media, while minimising the impost of a disclosure obligation on industry. 


I now turn to the second measure in the Bill, which amends the criteria for allocating and renewing community radio licences. 


When assessing an application for a community radio broadcasting licence, the ACMA will now be required to specifically consider the extent to which the applicant will provide material of local significance. Material of local significance is defined as material that is produced or hosted in the relevant licence area, or relates to the licence area. 


This measure builds on the natural strengths of community radio and will encourage 


broadcasters to consider how they can boost local participation in creating programs, or how they can provide more coverage of topics and issues that are relevant to their local communities.


Material of local significance would be given the same priority as the existing criteria for licence allocation decisions under the Broadcasting Services Act1992. This will provide the ACMA with appropriate discretion to weigh up the relative strengths and weaknesses of different applicants. 


This is important, as community radio services are highly varied and represent a diverse range of community interests. This measure will encourage localism in a way that takes these differences into account, and does not disadvantage services that meet particular community needs.


The measures contained in this Bill represent the next steps in the Government's commitment to implementing holistic reform to the Australian media industry. 


I commend the Bill to the Chamber.


COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ONLINE CONTENT SERVICES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2017



The Communications Legislation Amendment (Online Content Services and Other Measures) Bill 2017 amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and other legislation to introduce a new regulatory framework to regulate gambling promotions on online content services. The Bill will also establish a regulatory mechanism that can be used to apply the new gambling promotions restrictions to broadcasting services if necessary.


The Government has listened to community concern about the scheduling and quantity of gambling promotions shown during live sporting events, particularly in the context of its impact on child audiences.


In response to this, the Government's Broadcast and Content Reform Package included new community safeguards in the form of additional restrictions on gambling promotions shown or broadcast during live sporting events in children's viewing hours. Importantly, the Government determined that these new restrictions should apply across commercial free to air television, the Special Broadcasting Service, subscription television, commercial radio and online content services.


The additional restrictions will prohibit all gambling commercials and promotions during live coverage of sporting events, from five minutes before the scheduled start of play to five minutes after the conclusion of play. It is intended that under rules made by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), the restrictions will apply between the hours of 5:00am and 8:30pm.


The restrictions will apply to all audio and audio-visual live coverage of sports. The types of gambling promotions covered will include advertising, sponsorship announcements and promotional content. The Government intends that the new restrictions will be in effect across all platforms by 30 March 2018.


The restrictions will be applied to broadcast services via changes to their industry codes of practice. As no equivalent industry arrangements exist for online content services, this Bill will amend the Broadcasting Services Act to establish a flexible, fit for purpose regulatory framework that can be used to apply the gambling promotions restrictions to online content services. 


The gambling promotions reform will mean that, for the first time, broadcast-like program standards will be applied to online content services. 


This Bill, once enacted, will add Schedule 8 to the Broadcasting Services Act. Schedule 8 is an enabling framework that will allow the ACMA to make service provider rules which regulate gambling promotional content shown on online content services in conjunction with live coverage of a sporting event.


The online content service provider rules will be a legislative instrument for the purposes of the Legislation Act2003, and subject to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance.


A key objective of the policy reform is for, to the extent possible, the same restrictions to apply to broadcast, subscription and online providers. It is intended that the online content service provider rules will be similar to existing code-based gambling promotions restrictions that apply to broadcast services. 


Schedule 8 provides that the ACMA may make rules regulating or prohibiting gambling promotional content provided on online content services in conjunction with live coverage of a sporting event.


Under Schedule 8 an 'online content service' is one that delivers, or allows the public to access, content using the internet, where the service has a geographical link to Australia. 


A service will have a geographical link to Australia if an ordinary reasonable person would conclude that the service is targeted at individuals who are physically present in Australia or, any of the content provided on the service is likely to appeal to the public, or a section of the public, in Australia. In addition, for the service to be subject to online content service provider rules, the end user must be physically present in Australia.


Consistent with Government policy, under Schedule 8, gambling promotional content will be taken to be 'provided in conjunction with live coverage of a sporting event' where it is provided in the period beginning five minutes before the start of play and concluding five minutes after the conclusion of play. 


Where the content consists of promotions of betting odds by match commentators, or the appearance of representatives of gambling firms at or around sporting venues, these time thresholds are extended to 30 minutes before and after play. This reflects the existing rules in broadcast codes of practice. It will also allow the online content service provider rules to better protect the community from the potential adverse effects of gambling promotions which link sports personalities and gambling products.


Consistent with broadcast codes of practice, 'live', in relation to coverage of a sporting event, would include both real time and delayed coverage where the delayed coverage is provided as if it were live and begins no later than the conclusion of the sporting event. However the Bill also provides that a program can no longer be considered live, for the purposes of the rules, once the sporting event has concluded. 


The term 'sporting event' is defined to include the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, and other similar games. Given that new kinds of sporting events are constantly emerging, the online content service provider rules may also, for certainty, provide that particular events are, or are not, 'sporting events' for the purposes of Schedule 8. The term 'sporting event' otherwise has its ordinary meaning.


The Government recognises that there are a range of online content services, with different business models and technical characteristics, and that the online content service provider rules will not need to regulate all online content services. 


Accordingly, rules made under Schedule 8 will not apply to simulcast services—that is, services that do no more than simultaneously stream a broadcast service that is already subject to code based gambling promotions restrictions. This prevents such content from being subject to two separate regulatory regimes.


Schedule 8 will also empower the ACMA to determine that a specific online content service or online content service provider is exempt from the rules. A refusal to make, as well as a decision to vary or revoke, an individual exemption determination, will be subject to merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.


In addition, Schedule 8 will empower the ACMA to, by legislative instrument, determine that online content services or online content service providers included in a specified class are exempt from the online content service provider rules.


In terms of compliance and enforcement, it is anticipated that investigations of potential breaches of the online content service provider rules will, as is the case with broadcasting codes of practice, be largely complaints driven. The online content service provider rules may also require relevant online content service providers to keep records that will allow the ACMA to ascertain whether they have been complying with the rules. 


Schedule 8, in conjunction with existing provisions in the Broadcasting Services Act, sets out the mechanisms that may be used to enforce compliance with the online content service provider rules, including infringement notices, civil penalties and remedial directions. The Government does not consider that criminal penalties are appropriate sanctions for breaches of online content service provider rules, and I note that breaches of broadcast industry codes of practice do not, of themselves, result in potential criminal penalties.


As noted earlier the Bill also includes a regulatory mechanism that can be used to apply the new gambling promotions restrictions to broadcasting services should industry codes of practice not be amended in time. I can report that broadcast sectors are working closely with the Government and the ACMA to ensure that their codes are appropriately amended and I anticipate that the Government will have no need to mandate these important restrictions. I am grateful for the constructive engagement of broadcast sectors to date.




Conclusion



In conclusion, this enabling legislation, which provides increased powers to the regulator and helps ensure a more consistent approach to regulating gambling promotional content across platforms, will send a clear message to the public that the Government is committed to implementation of its policy to enact additional restrictions on gambling promotions. 


The announced gambling promotions restrictions will establish a clear safe zone during which parents and caregivers may have confidence that children will not be exposed to gambling promotions by viewing live sports events. 


I commend the Bill to the Chamber. 


COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REGIONAL AND SMALL PUBLISHERS INNOVATION FUND) BILL 2017


In October this year, the Parliament passed a landmark package of reforms that will modernise broadcasting and content regulation and improve the sustainability of Australia's media industry. A number of additional measures were developed as part of that process and this Bill, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017, establishes the legislative framework for one of those measures. 


The Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund will assist regional and small publishers to transition, compete and innovate more successfully in a changing media environment. These news providers are operating under acute and sustained pressure. The business models that have traditionally supported journalism, particularly those funded by advertising revenue, are being challenged, and the need to adapt successful subscriber and other revenue models is proving especially demanding for smaller publications. 


The Bill will amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (BSA) to establish the legislative framework for the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund. The Fund will provide $16.7 million in grants each year from 2018-19 to 2020-21, via a competitive application process, to assist small and regional publishers adapt to the challenges of providing quality news content in a digital media environment. 


The Bill establishes the legislative authority for the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to administer the Fund. It will require the ACMA to enter into an agreement with each funding recipient, specifying the terms and conditions of the grant, before making any payments, and will require the recipient to spend the funding on activities that relate to the newspaper, magazine or periodical or online content service. 


The Bill will also allow the Minister for Communications to establish a Committee to provide advice to the ACMA in its administration of the Fund, including its assessment of applications for grants. It is expected that the Committee will comprise members who have significant experience with news, journalism, and other media-related content and will include, as a minimum, a representative from each of the Australian Press Council, the Walkley Foundation and Country Press Australia. The ACMA will be required to have regard to any advice provided by the Committee in exercising its powers under the Fund, although this won't limit the matters to which the ACMA may have regard. 


The Bill will require the ACMA to include in its annual report the details of the name of each recipient of one or more grants of financial assistance, the total amount of those grants, and any advice given during the financial year to the ACMA by the Committee. This will ensure full transparency in relation to the oversight of the Fund and the decisions made by the ACMA to provide grants to publishers. 


The Fund complements the core components of the Government's Broadcasting and Content Reform Package by fostering an adaptable and sustainable Australian media industry. Journalism that investigates and explains public policy and issues of public significance is critical for our democracy. But its provision is under challenge by a changing media environment. The Fund will assist Australian publishers, particularly smaller publishers and those operating in regional areas, to transition their businesses to the new operating environment, and continue to provide news content that informs and engages Australians across the country. 


I commend the Bill to the Chamber.


COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (SERVICE PROVIDERS) BILL 2017


There are significant opportunities in the digital environment for improving the way we provide educational services, provide services to people with a disability, and promote cultural and historical experiences in Australia. Many of these opportunities, however, may put Australia's educational and cultural institutions and organisations assisting people with a disability at a high risk of copyright infringement. There is a balance to be struck between encouraging the development of new and innovative services for the benefit of all Australians, and ensuring that Australian creators can retain control and derive value from their copyright protected material. Ensuring respect for the creative efforts and economic rights of creators is an ongoing challenge for all participants in the digital environment. Extension of the safe harbour scheme to service providers in these sectors will provide greater certainty to educational and cultural institutions and to those organisations assisting people with a disability about their responsibilities in engaging in the online space.


The current safe harbour scheme in the Copyright Act 1968 was introduced following the commencement of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement in 2005. The scheme in the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement was intended to provide an alternative to court proceedings for copyright owners where their infringing material is hosted, cached or linked to by a service provider or where a provider's network services are used to infringe copyright. It sets out conditions that a service provider must comply with, including in some situations, taking down infringing material or removing links to infringing material when they have been notified of a suspected infringement by a copyright owner. When the scheme was originally implemented in Australia, it was restricted only to carriage service providers—or providers of telecommunications services (such as Internet Service Providers) as they are more commonly known. This cautious approach was taken because the Internet was still in its infancy.


This Bill, through the extension of the existing safe harbour scheme, will ensure that a greater range of service providers can work with copyright owners to effectively protect copyright material, without recourse to litigation. The extended scheme enabled by this Bill will apply the safe harbour provisions to educational institutions such as universities and schools as well as libraries, archives, museums and organisations assisting people with a disability. Where these additional service providers comply with the requirements of the safe harbour scheme, including the operation of a 'notice and take down system', their liability for monetary remedies will be limited.


The education, cultural and disability sector generally take a very risk averse approach to protecting and managing the copyright of others. Many of the institutions and organisations who, under this Bill, will be covered by the safe harbour scheme already comply with the requirements of the scheme, and actively work with copyright owners to remove or disable access to infringing material residing on their systems or networks or to take action against repeat infringers. In doing so they dedicate a significant amount of resources on their processes. Yet they still remain potentially liable for the infringement of their users which is beyond their active control. 


The Bill will reduce the potential exposure of these sectors to legal liability for authorising copyright infringement when third parties use their networks or services in a way that breaches copyright. This amendment will provide certainty to a group of institutions and organisations which provide services that are in the public interest and will support them in being more innovative in the online environment. This will therefore encourage these institutions and organisations to create and deliver enhanced online services for all Australians.


Copyright owners will benefit from the extended scheme as it will provide them with a consistent mechanism for working with those organisations covered by the Bill to address copyright infringement on a broader scale, rather than having to pursue each and every individual who infringes copyright online. 


Earlier this year the Government introduced and passed the Copyright Amendment (Disability Access and Other Measures) Act 2017 which was the result of a collaborative effort between rights holders, the education and cultural sector and the disability sector. The passage of the Disability Access Act was an important step in simplifying and modernising the Copyright Act 1968 in response to specific challenges and concerns identified by rights holders and those sectors of the community. This Bill now builds upon the effective working relationship that already exists between these sectors and copyright owners as a result of the Disability Access Act. 


Users of these institutions and organisations' services will also have additional protection under the safe harbour scheme. The changes will give users a clear process for ensuring that where their material is removed from the institutions or organisations' systems or networks, in line with a notice under the safe harbour scheme, it can be reinstated when the user can demonstrate the material is not infringing. This will ensure, for example, that students and researchers can protect their legitimate use of copyright material in online forums.


The Government has made the decision to make this incremental expansion of the safe harbour scheme, so that it can continue to consult on how best to reform the scheme to apply to other online service providers in the future. In Australia, the expansion of the safe harbour provisions has been reviewed in six separate government reviews over a period of more than ten years. Each of these reviews called for submissions from the public. The Productivity Commission's 2016 review of Australia's Intellectual Property Arrangements was the most recent of these reviews and it recommended that the scheme be extended to all online service providers.


The Government is, however, aware that a blanket extension of safe harbour remains a highly contested reform. This is why we chose to undertake further consultation this year. The consultation demonstrated the full spectrum of views from complete support to strident opposition. Both sides are worthy of a full examination. The Government has appreciated the open and frank dialogue that we have had with representatives from both sides. 


On the one hand we have heard that extending safe harbour would encourage piracy, contribute to the gap in revenue between subscription and ad based content services, and remove the ability for rights holders to seek licence revenue from online services. Of particular concern have been scenarios in which service providers derive profit from the infringing activities of their users. There are also strong concerns that the current conditions in the safe harbour scheme are no longer effective in addressing infringement and that they need to be reconsidered to ensure they promote a collaborative and supportive online environment. 


On the other hand we hear that Australia has legal uncertainty about the extent to which service providers can be liable for the actions of their users, which has a chilling effect on innovation. Service providers, who in many cases perform the same role as a carriage service provider, have pointed out that they are the ones that have no protection and that this makes Australia uncompetitive compared with other countries who have a safe harbour scheme. Internet users and service providers alike have argued that safe harbour provides a simple non-court based option to address infringement on the internet which should be a good thing for the creative sector. 


The worst outcome would be for the Government to inadvertently impact on rights holders' ability to realise returns on their creative and financial investments. Australia has thriving creative industries whose work contributes enormously to our economy and our cultural life. The Government is trying to achieve an environment that encourages innovation, but does not want to do that at the expense of a vibrant cultural and arts sector and the thousands of Australians it employs. At the same time the Government recognises that there are many institutions and organisations that operate in the public interest of all Australians and there are actors on the internet who are trying to build a robust and innovative Australian digital economy. 


So far, opposing parties have been unable to meet in the middle of this protracted debate. So this Bill starts the process of safe harbour reform by responding to where there is broad consensus and extending the scheme to a group of institutions and organisations that all agree are responsible players in the copyright space. 


The current Australian safe harbour scheme, which this Bill will extend, is governed by procedural provisions in the Copyright Regulations 1969. These Regulations provide the additional details about exactly how the safe harbour scheme works including: how industry codes must be developed, how notifications and notices should be issued and received, and the procedures for notice and takedown of infringing material. As part of the Department of Communications and the Arts review of the sunsetting Copyright Regulations 1969, over the past six months stakeholders have had an opportunity to indicate how these provisions might be updated. Shortly, the Government expects to remake these Regulations in largely the same form as their sunsetting version, save for some further enhancements to give effect to provisions contained in the Copyright Amendment (Disability Access and Other Measures) Act 2017. However, the passage of this Bill will require some further updates to the Regulations.


Therefore, in early 2018 the Government will release an Exposure Draft of amending Regulations to facilitate the extension of the safe harbour scheme for consultation prior to passage of this Bill. The Government will focus on ensuring that the mechanics of Australia's safe harbour scheme, contained within the Regulations, operate effectively in Australia's digital environment for copyright owners and the broader range of service providers defined in this Bill.


The Government will continue to work with stakeholders to find a way to further extend the safe harbour scheme in a way that allows Australian businesses to harness the significant opportunities of the growing digital economy while ensuring respect for the creative efforts and economic rights of creators. The Government is confident that through this staged approach it can find a way to provide a practical and responsive safe harbour framework that operates effectively in the Australian environment.


CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMBATTING CORPORATE CRIME) BILL 2017


The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Combatting Corporate Crime) Bill 2017 will amend the Criminal Code and the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 to enhance the tools available to law enforcement to tackle corporate crime.


Corporate crime is estimated to cost Australia $8.5 billion every year. It hurts business, it hurts Australia's international reputation and it hurts our economic wellbeing.


The opaque and sophisticated nature of corporate crime can make it difficult to identify and easy to conceal. Investigations into corporate misconduct can be hampered by the need to process large amounts of complex data, and evidence may be held overseas. Court proceedings can be long and expensive, particularly against well-resourced corporate defendants. 


The measures in the Bill seek to address these challenges. 


The Bill will remove undue impediments to the successful investigation and prosecution of foreign bribery. Foreign bribery is an inherently challenging crime to investigate. The OECD has reported that, across all parties to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, it takes an average of 7.3 years to conclude foreign bribery cases.


The offence in its current form poses challenges for typical foreign bribery cases. Prosecutions can also be hampered where evidence is held offshore and where bribes are disguised as legitimate payments. 


The Bill will address these issues by expanding and clarifying the scope of the foreign bribery offence. 


Under the foreign bribery offence as currently drafted, the prosecution needs to show that both the bribe and the business advantage sought were 'not legitimately due'. 


This presents challenges where bribes are concealed as legitimate payments (for instance, agent fees). 


The Bill replaces the requirement that the bribe and the advantage sought be 'not legitimately due' with the concept of 'improperly influencing' a foreign public official. This better reflects the conduct of foreign bribery. The Bill also amends the definition of 'foreign public official' to include candidates for public office.


The Bill also broadens the scope of the foreign bribery offence to encapsulate bribery conducted to obtain any advantage, such as a personal advantage, rather than requiring that the bribery be perpetrated to achieve a business advantage. This reflects law enforcement experience that bribes can include the bestowal of personal honours or the processing of visa requests. 


The Bill further removes the existing requirement that, for the offence to be established, the foreign public official be influenced in the exercise of their official duties. The Bill also clarifies that the offence does not require the accused to have had a specific business or advantage in mind, and that the business or advantage can be obtained for someone else. 


The Bill also introduces a new corporate offence of failure to prevent foreign bribery. This new offence will apply where an associate of a body corporate has committed bribery for the profit or gain of the body corporate. However, the offence will not apply if the body corporate can demonstrate that it has 'adequate procedures' in place to prevent the commission of foreign bribery by its associate. 


The United Kingdom has successfully used a similar offence to prosecute companies in several foreign bribery cases. 


The Bill will also implement a Commonwealth Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) scheme. 


The DPA scheme will bolster cooperation between law enforcement agencies and the business community to uncover and deal with corporate crime, and provide a new tool for holding offending corporations to account. 


DPAs have been used to tackle corporate crime with significant success in both the United Kingdom and the United States. 


Under the DPA scheme, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions will be able to invite corporations suspected of certain serious corporate criminal offences to negotiate an agreement to comply with a range of specified conditions. If the corporation fulfils its obligations under the DPA, it will not be prosecuted for the offences specified in the DPA. 


Because the purpose of the DPA scheme is to tackle corporatecrime, a DPA will only be available with respect to one or more of the serious corporate offences specified in the Bill. These offences are often difficult to detect, investigate and prosecute, and include offences relating to foreign bribery, false accounting, dealing with proceeds of crime, money laundering and dishonest conduct, as well as sanctions offences. Under the scheme, the Director of Public Prosecutions will have the discretion to extend a DPA to also apply to additional less serious offences where it is appropriate to do so. 


A DPA will not be appropriate in all cases. The scheme will provide prosecutors with an additional option in cases where a company is actively cooperating with authorities. 


The DPA scheme strikes a balance between encouraging corporations to self-report misconduct, and ensuring that a DPA does not represent a 'free pass' to corporations that have engaged in serious corporate crime. 


The scheme offers corporations an opportunity to avoid some of the reputational and financial costs associated with lengthy investigation and trial processes, but will typically require a party to a DPA to admit to agreed facts, cooperate with any related investigation, pay a financial penalty and implement a compliance program. 


Each DPA will be assessed and approved by a former judicial officer to ensure that the DPA is in the interests of justice and that its terms are fair, reasonable and proportionate.


The DPA scheme is a new and innovative approach to combatting corporate crime, and it is important to ensure that stakeholders understand the benefits of the scheme and can inform how it works in practice. As such, the Government will consult publicly on proposed guidance material detailing how the scheme operates in early 2018. 


The amendments in the Bill will strengthen Australia's implementation and enforcement of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and the United Nations Convention against Corruption. 


The Bill will enhance Australia's criminalisation of foreign bribery and assist in meeting our international obligations to combat corruption and related corporate criminal conduct. Through the establishment of a DPA scheme, the Bill also will provide a new tool to law enforcement to help tackle the challenges of investigating and prosecuting serious corporate offences. 


This Bill demonstrates that the Government is committed to tackling corporate offending, and to protecting Australia from the corrosive effects of corporate crime. 


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.


Ordered that the bills be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day.


ENHANCING ONLINE SAFETY (NON-CONSENSUAL SHARING OF INTIMATE IMAGES) BILL 2017


The Enhancing Online Safety (Non-Consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill2017 implements the Government's commitment to take strong action to combat the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.


The term 'non-consensual sharing of intimate images' refers to the sharing or distribution by a relevant electronic service, a designated internet service, or social media service, of an image or video of a person or persons portrayed in sexual or otherwise intimate manner, which has been shared without consent. This behaviour is colloquially referred to as 'revenge porn' or 'image-based abuse'. 


Intimate images might be obtained with or without consent of the subject and can come from a variety of different sources including recordings from hidden devices, hacking into personal electronic storage such as computers, hard drives, cloud-storage or email accounts, images shared with an individual with consent, and subsequently distributed without consent, or images doctored to falsely portray an individual.


The sharing of images can occur over various electronic services, including email, text or multimedia messaging, social media services, websites including mainstream pornography sites, message boards and forum websites, or websites specifically designed to host images shared without consent.


The reasons for non-consensual sharing of intimate images are varied. For example, it can often occur as a result of the ex‑partner of a victim seeking revenge, or it can also involve acquaintances or complete strangers distributing the images either maliciously or simply because they think it might be a fun thing to do. However, in the most part, the practice is generally intended to cause harm, distress, humiliation and embarrassment, whether through the actual sharing of intimate images, or through the threat to share. Often such threats are made in an attempt to control, blackmail, coerce, bully or punish a victim. Other motives might include sexual gratification, entertainment, social notoriety and financial gain.


During the Government's consultation about this Bill we have heard that the psychological impact on victims can be significant, and can have negative implications which affect their reputation, family, employment, social relationships and even personal safety.




The need for 
government
 action



This issue is a global concern with many countries taking targeted action against this unacceptable practice. The Government recognises that the sharing of intimate images without consent is also an emerging issue of great concern here in Australia. 


According to a report published in May 2017 by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University, one in five Australians, one in two Australians with a disability and one in two Indigenous Australians have experienced the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. 


Previously, the impacts of intimate image distribution were limited by the restrictions of the physical world. However, as noted by academics from Bond University, 'as a result of movement to the digital world, globalisation and society's reliance on technology, many more of our lifestyle activities are conducted in the digital world'. The ubiquity of internet connected mobile devices has changed the way we socialise and increased the speed and reach of information shared online. 




Existing laws



There are existing criminal offence provisions available in relation to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images at both the Commonwealth and state level.


Under Commonwealth law, it is an offence to use a carriage service in a menacing, harassing, or offensive way (section 474 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (Criminal Code)). The maximum penalty for this offence is three years imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $37,800. Since 2004 there have been 927 charges proven against 458 defendants under this offence, including a number of cases in relation to image-based abuse conduct. 


Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Western Australia have criminalised this behaviour and there have already been a number of prosecutions under existing state laws including broad laws covering stalking, identity theft and domestic violence. The Northern Territory and Queensland have indicated their intentions to introduce specific criminal offences for this behaviour.


These laws do differ slightly across jurisdictions which is why the Commonwealth worked with states and territories through COAG to support a nationally-consistent approach to criminal offences relating to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. 


On 20 May 2017, the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council published the National Statement of Principles on the criminalisation of the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Alignment on key principles is an important initiative as most offences are likely to be prosecuted at the state level. 


The Commonwealth continues to work with states and territories on this issue.




Consultation on a proposed civil penalty regime



On 23 November 2016, the Government committed to consult on a proposed civil penalty regime targeted at perpetrators who share intimate images without consent and the website and content hosts that are involved. 


The Government heard from a range of stakeholders including women's safety organisations, mental health experts, schools and education departments, victims and members of the Government's Online Safety Consultative Working Group. 


The majority of stakeholders were broadly supportive of a civil penalty regime as it would provide victims a timely, accessible and effective means of redress not available to them through the criminal justice system. The ability to take down intimate images quickly is a primary concern of victims and support services. 


Feedback from police indicates that victims are often reluctant to pursue criminal charges against perpetrators which could result in lengthy and expensive court processes, which in turn has the effect of amplifying the harm inflicted on the victim. 




Enhancing Online Safety (Non-Consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) 
Bill
 2017



The Enhancing Online Safety (Non-Consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2017 implements a civil penalty regime for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.


The Bill introduces a new prohibition for the non-consensual posting, or threat to post, of an intimate image on a social media service, relevant electronic service which includes images shared by email, text or multimedia messages, or a designated internet service. A designated internet service could include websites and peer to peer file services.


During the consultation process stakeholders reached consensus that the eSafety Commissioner was best positioned to administer the civil penalty regime. This would utilise existing expertise within the Office of the eSafety Commissioner and build on the eSafety Commissioner's ability to take fast, effective action to have images removed and limit further distribution with minimal additional stress to victims.


Under the civil penalty regime, a victim or someone authorised to act on behalf of the victim, can make a complaint to the eSafety Commissioner by phone, in writing or through the Commissioner's online complaints portal.


The eSafety Commissioner will have the discretion to action various enforcement mechanisms such as investigating complaints, issuing infringement notices, accepting enforceable undertakings or seeking injunctions. 


The Commissioner will also be able to issue formal warnings for breaching the prohibitions and will have the power to issue removal and objection notices to both perpetrators, social media services and content hosts. The Bill will introduce a penalty of up to 500 penalty units (up to $105,000 for individuals and up to $525,000 for corporations) for a breach of the prohibition, or failure to comply with a removal notice. 




National online reporting portal



On 16 October 2017, the Government welcomed the pilot launch of a new national portal for reporting instances of non-consensual sharing of intimate images. The portal is a world first government-led initiative developed by the Office of the eSafety Commissioner and provides immediate and tangible support to victims of image‑based abuse.


The portal gives victims a place to seek assistance and report instances of image-based abuse. It provides clear and concise information about the practical steps victims can take to reduce the impact of the abuse.


The pilot is designed as a test platform to evaluate the volume and complexity of reports about image-based abuse. The Office of the eSafety Commissioner expects to formally launch the portal in early 2018. This civil penalty regime will complement the portal.




Industry efforts in addressing the non-consensual sharing of intimate images



I would also like to commend those social media providers and content hosts that have taken steps to address this issue through the development of acceptable use guidelines, the adoption of complaints processes and the investment in technology which removes or prevents further posting of images. Victims have benefited from industry investment and responsiveness.


The Government expects that these social media providers and content hosts will build on this good work. It is noteworthy that the Bill will not prevent victims from approaching these services in the first instance to quickly remove images, rather than the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, if they wish to do so.


The Government also recognises the strong partnerships that many social media services, content hosts, and technology companies have established with the Office of the eSafety Commissioner and envisages that these relationships will continue to be pivotal in protecting Australians against the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. 




Conclusion



The Bill reflects the Government's ongoing commitment to keep Australians safe online. 


The non-consensual sharing of intimate images is a significant issue that can have an adverse impact on victims, their families and the Australian community. 


The Bill will prohibit the non-consensual posting of intimate images and the threat to post intimate images. It will empower the eSafety Commissioner with enforcement capabilities including the ability to take fast and effective action to have images removed and limit further sharing of images.


The civil penalty regime will complement existing criminal laws and provide another avenue for victims to seek assistance and redress. It will also send a clear message that in Australia, the non-consensual sharing of intimate images is unacceptable in our society. 


I thank stakeholders who provided input, either through submissions or attendance at the public workshops, during the consultation process. I make special mention of those victims who opened up about their own experiences. Their stories and views were essential in the development of this Bill. 


I commend this Bill. 


FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (FAMILY VIOLENCE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2017


Family violence and child abuse are unacceptable and require a strong legislative response. The Family Law Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2017 will enhance the capacity of the justice system to provide effective outcomes for vulnerable Australians who are experiencing family violence. In particular, the Bill will strengthen the powers of courts to protect victims of family violence, and facilitate the resolution of family law matters by state and territory courts in appropriate cases. 


The Commonwealth, states and territories have made shared commitments under the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022, which sets an ambitious agenda for addressing the scourge of family violence affecting many Australians. Under Action 5.1 of the Third Action Plan of the National Plan, governments have agreed to implement supported recommendations of the Family Law Council's 2015 and 2016 reports on Families with Complex Needs and the Intersection of the Family Law and Child Protection Systems. This Bill implements four of those recommendations. 


The Bill also responds directly to calls for reform from Victoria's 2016 Royal Commission into Family Violence, the Australian and New South Wales Law Reform Commissions' 2010 report: Family Violence—A National Legal Response, and the Victorian State Coroner's 2015 findings of the inquest into the death of Luke Geoffrey Batty. This Bill demonstrates the seriousness with which the Government has taken the findings of these enquiries, and its commitment to improving how the federal, state and territory justice systems help vulnerable families. 




Increasing family law jurisdiction of state and territory courts



The Bill will reduce the need for families to interact with multiple courts across these systems to address their legal needs. 


Currently, families are often required to navigate state or territory magistrates' courts and children's courts, and the federal family law courts. This can cause confusion, delay and prolonged exposure to risks of violence, particularly for families with complex needs such as family violence, mental health and substance abuse issues. 


State and territory magistrates' courts already have a range of powers to make, vary and suspend family law orders under the Family Law Act. However, they don't always do this, and when they do, it can result in inconsistent state and federal orders. This can create uncertainty, but also increase risk, for families. 


The Bill will also provide for an increased total property value, under which state magistrates' courts can hear contested family law property matters without both parties' consent. The current property value of $20 000 has not been updated since 1988. The Bill will allow a higher value to be prescribed in regulations, with the flexibility of prescribing different values for different states and territories. 


Increasing this value will reduce the cost, pressure and risk for vulnerable families who are dealing with legal matters across multiple courts. State and territory magistrates' courts exercising limited property and parenting jurisdiction will enable vulnerable victims of family violence to achieve some measure of economic independence, without having to initiate separate proceedings in a family law court. This can accelerate their recovery process by facilitating earlier financial stability. 


The Bill will allow relevant state and territory courts, such as children's courts, to be prescribed so that they can exercise family law parenting jurisdiction. This will provide children's court judicial officers with additional tools to make orders that support the best interests of children. 


Family law orders will be a useful tool for the children's court where they can provide greater certainty to children and their carers. For example, where a matter is already before the children's court, a family law parenting order may give a protective carer, such as a grandparent, greater certainty about ongoing care arrangements for a child. It will also negate the need to institute future proceedings in a family law court.


The Government does not intend that state and territory courts become the primary fora for resolving family law disputes. The amendments in this Bill are designed to give state and territory courts greater flexibility to hear family law matters where parties are already appearing for a related state or territory proceeding. State and territory courts will retain their existing powers to transfer proceedings to the federal family law courts in the circumstances provided for in the Act.


To support this Bill, the Australian Government has funded the National Judicial College of Australia to deliver training to state and territory judicial officers about family law parenting and property matters. 




Criminalisation of breaches for personal protection injunctions



Family violence is not a private matter, but a criminal offence of public concern. The Bill will reinforce this critical message by criminalising breaches of family law injunctions made for personal protection. Currently these injunctions are enforceable only by civil action brought in the family law courts. These consequences do not reflect the seriousness of family violence. The new offences will relieve the burden on family violence victims of bringing a private application for contravention of the injunction. Instead, breaches of an injunction will be enforceable by the police through criminal action, which will improve the safety of protected people under the order, including children.


The Government recognises the ongoing power and control dynamics of family violence and is committed to ensuring that the law prioritises the safety of victims. Accordingly, the Bill will prevent a perpetrator from relying on self-induced intoxication as a defence to a breach offence, and will ensure that victims cannot be charged with aiding and abetting the offence if their actions invite a breach. 




Additional measures to improve the operation of the Family Law Act



The Bill will further improve the efficacy and protective function of the Family Law Act by ensuring that judges exercising family law jurisdiction do so expeditiously, and that the information children receive from a court is appropriate and would not expose them to further details of family violence. The Bill includes measures to avoid inconsistencies between family violence orders and family law orders, which can lead to confusion and increased risk for victims. It will also strengthen and codify the power of the family law courts to dismiss unmeritorious cases and proceedings that are frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process, which will enable courts to better protect victims of family violence from perpetrators who attempt to use the family law system as a tool of continued victimisation. Lastly, the Bill will remove an outdated provision in the Family Law Act which deals with conjugal rights and marital services—concepts which are repugnant to our modern values of equality and respect within relationships.




Conclusion



This Bill will improve the justice system's capacity to produce timely and effective resolutions to matters involving family violence. It will respond directly to expert recommendations to address the needs of vulnerable families and support more effective interaction between the family law, and state and territory family violence and child protection systems. The measures in this Bill exemplify the Government's commitment to ensuring that the family law system will protect victims of family violence and hold perpetrators accountable. 


FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (PARENTING MANAGEMENT HEARINGS) BILL 2017


When Mum and Dad fight, children hurt. The longer the conflict, the more intense the conflict—the greater the pain suffered by the children. Research shows that it is protracted conflict that harms children, rather than family separation itself. There is also longstanding recognition of the limitations of the adversarial method for resolving family disputes; in particular, the costs, delays and inherently oppositional structure of that system, which prolongs and exacerbates conflict. 


It is critical that the family law system evolve to ensure that families can access the most effective mechanism to resolve their parenting disputes. We need a framework that reduces, not exacerbates, parental conflict. Our arrangements must support families to achieve safe, fair and timely outcomes and lay the foundations for healthy co-parenting.


For this reason, in May this year, the Turnbull Government announced that it would commit $12.7 million to pilot a new forum for resolving family law disputes. 


The Family Law (Parenting Management Hearings) Bill 2017 provides for the establishment of this forum—the Parenting Management Hearings Panel—a new statutory authority designed to offer self-represented litigants a more flexible and inquisitorial alternative to the court process. During the pilot phase, there will be no costs charged to families who choose to participate.


Self-represented parents represent a significant proportion of litigants who come before the family law courts, and they often face considerable challenges due to the complexity of the rules that apply, and the adversarial nature of the system. Many self-represented litigants are struggling not only with the loss and pain of family separation, but with coexisting challenges, including housing and financial stress and mental health issues.


A key objective of the Panel is to give to parents who would otherwise be in a court without legal representation the option to obtain a binding decision about parenting arrangements in a quick, fair, just, informal and economical way, all the time ensuring that decisions are made in the best interests of children and that safety is prioritised. 




Multi
disciplinary



A key feature of the Parenting Management Hearings model is its multidisciplinary approach. The Panel will be constituted by members with specialist skills and expertise in family law, family dispute resolution, family violence, psychology, mental health and child development. 


It is critical that families' situations are considered holistically and not seen predominantly through a technical legal lens. After all, family breakdown is not, fundamentally, about a legal dispute. It is about the deterioration of a relationship. The easy access to professionals who can offer a sophisticated understanding of the psychosocial dimensions of a family breakdown, and identify tools to address these, will support delivery of more nuanced and tailored services. 




Inquisitorial



Many reviews and reports into the family law system have identified the need for a less adversarial approach to resolving parenting disputes. From the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs 2003 report, Every Picture Tells a Story, to the more recent report of the Family Law Council, in 2016, on Families with Complex Needs and the Intersection of the Family Law and Child Protection Systems.


Unlike the traditional adversarial system, where opposing sides assemble and present their evidence to advocate for a particular outcome, those managing the hearings will undertake inquiries and gather information to promote informed and safe outcomes for families. The rules of evidence will not apply, allowing parties to speak freely to the Panel members.


This approach will allow Panel members to investigate and focus on the information and issues most pertinent to the dispute, whilst ensuring that the process is procedurally fair, and vulnerable family members get the support they need.




Role of family dispute resolution



It is not intended that the Parenting Management Hearings Panel will replace the important role of family dispute resolution, a major innovation introduced by the Howard Government in 2006. 


Families will still be required to try to resolve their disputes themselves where possible and appropriate, through family dispute resolution services, before making an application to the Panel. 




Legal representation



As the forum is designed with self-represented litigants in mind, the Bill provides that legal representation during the hearings would be allowed only with the leave of the Panel, and be subject to any directions of the Panel. 


In considering whether to grant leave to allow legal representation, the Panel must have regard to any instances of family violence between the parties, and the capacity of each party to effectively participate in the hearing. It is envisaged that legal representatives could support vulnerable parties in the hearings, including victims of family violence or parties with a disability. The intention is to ensure that these parties are assisted to present their case effectively, for the purpose of ensuring a fair hearing. 


The general position that legal representation during the hearings is not allowed, does not, of course, preclude parties seeking legal advice in relation to their family law matter, and about the suitability of the Parenting Management Hearings Panel in their individual circumstances. Using legal services in this limited way may present a more cost-effective option for families than having to pay for legal services from initiation of legal action to its finalisation some years later.




Family violence and child abuse



Family violence is distressingly common among separated parents. A high proportion of matters in the family law system, and before the family law courts, involve family violence. 


For this reason, it is critical that any forum established to resolve parenting disputes is equipped to identify and respond effectively to family violence. 


The Bill requires that the Principal Member appointed to lead the Panel must be an experienced legal practitioner with extensive specialist knowledge and skills in family law, and in dealing with matters relating to family violence. 


The Bill ensures that, in each case that comes before it, the Panel will give careful consideration to the family's individual circumstances, and will make an assessment about the capacity of the Panel to manage any safety risks for the family through the forum. The Panel will not be empowered to deal with applications involving allegations of child sexual abuse. Any application made to the Panel raising such allegations will continue be dealt with by the family law courts. The Family Court of Australia's Magellan Program provides for specific case management for matters involving serious allegations of child abuse, and ensures such cases are prioritised.


Importantly, if the Panel becomes aware of an allegation of child sexual abuse at any stage of proceedings, it will also be required to notify the relevant State and Territory child welfare agency. 


The Panel will operate under an inquisitorial model, allowing Panel members to have more control over hearings, directing lines of enquiry and the focus of the hearing; and questions will be asked by Panel members, avoiding the potential for cross-examination of a victim by a perpetrator of family violence.


As part of the Parenting Management Hearings model, families will be referred to other support services, such as counselling and family violence services, to ensure that families and children are better supported at an earlier point than currently is the case, with a view to minimise the intensity and duration of conflict. This capacity is funded from the Budget commitment.




Best interests paramount



While the Bill offers a new forum for the resolution of parenting disputes, the Panel will use the legislative framework which is currently applied by the family law courts. In particular, the best interests of the child will remain the paramount consideration.




Enforcement



Parenting determinations made by the Panel will be enforceable by a court exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act, in the same way as a parenting order made by a court. 


A party will also be able to appeal a decision of the Panel, on a question of law, to the Federal Circuit Court.




Pilot



Subject to the passage of the Bill, it is intended that the first location of the Parenting Management Hearings Panel will commence operations in the Family Law Court Registry in Parramatta from mid-2018, and commence in a second location by the end of 2018. 


Parenting Management Hearings will be a consent-based forum, and parties will be not be compelled to participate in the process. 


Families in the two early pilot locations will have the option of making an application directly to the Panel as an alternative to making an application to a family law court. Parties may also be referred by a court, with their consent. In all cases, it will be a choice made by the parties themselves.




Evaluation



Given that the Bill provides for an innovative forum for the resolution of parenting disputes, it is critical that its operation be carefully and comprehensively evaluated, to provide a rigorous and robust evidence basis for ongoing policy and program development.


For this reason, the Bill requires that an independent review of the operation of new part IIIAAA of the Family Law Act be undertaken and finalised within three years after commencement. 




Other measures



The establishment of the pilot program of the Parenting Management Hearings Panel represents one of several important commitments taken by the Turnbull Government to help improve access to family law services. 


It complements a range of other Turnbull Government initiatives. These include:


the recently announced funding of $468 million for family law services, which will continue to deliver critical support to separating and separated families


the allocation of $10.7 million for the family law courts in the 2017-18 Budget to engage additional family consultants to assist with complex parenting matters; and


the significant additional funds the Government has committed to family violence services and the legal assistance sector. 


The Australian Law Reform Commission will be able to consider the early observations about the operations of the Panel in the context of its broad and far-reaching review of the family law system, due to report by 31 March 2019. 




Conclusion



This Bill provides the basis for an important development in the family law system. It establishes, for the first time, a forum specifically designed for self-represented litigants, and one that draws together multidisciplinary expertise in child development, psychology, family dispute resolution, social work and family violence, as well as legal expertise. It provides an important opportunity to offer to families a holistic approach which is less prone to exacerbate conflict and which provides early access to support services. 


The Bill recognises that ongoing parental conflict leads to poorer outcomes for children, washing right through their futures, impairing their educational and employment outcomes, and hampering their future ability to nurture healthy, respectful relationships as adults, including with their children. The Bill exemplifies the Government's commitment to ensuring that families are able to resolve disputes about parenting arrangements as quickly, economically and safely as possible, and in the best interests of children.


GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AMENDMENT (AUTHORITY GOVERNANCE AND OTHER MATTERS) BILL 2017


The Bill amends the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 to implement a new governance model for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The amendments will strengthen the strategic capability and capacity of the Authority to respond to challenges facing the Marine Park. 


The Authority plays a crucial role in protecting the iconic Great Barrier Reef, a World Heritage site, now and for future generations. It was established through the Actto set up and manage the Marine Park, provide advice to the Government, conduct research and provide educational, advisory and information services. 


The rapidly changing ecology of the Reef drives the need to transition the focus of Marine Park management from conservation and sustainable use, to actively fostering resilience and assisting the Reef to adapt and recover. Leading and implementing this transition in Marine Park management will challenge the Authority's capacity to adapt, facilitate community debates and understanding, and coordinate management actions with other Reef related organisations.


The Australian Government remains firmly committed to protecting the Reef. Effective operation of the Authority is central to this commitment. The Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan was established in 2015 as the centrepiece of Australia's efforts to build the resilience of the Reef. The Authority delivers key programs under the Reef 2050 plan such as the joint field management program and actions to control crown of thorns starfish.


In March 2017 the Government commissioned an independent review to determine whether the current governance arrangements continue to be the best fit to support the Authority's important and challenging work over the coming decades. The independent reviewer, Dr Wendy Craik AM, considered numerous public submissions and held more than 50 consultation meetings with individuals from relevant government, industry, community and conservation organisations.


The 2017 Review found these arrangements do not allow for sufficient strategic leadership or management commensurate with the requirements of the Authority's functions and responsibilities. 


The Bill amends the Act to implement the governance arrangements recommended by the Review and accepted by the Government. 


The Bill replaces the existing full-time Chairperson position with a part-time Chairperson and a full-time Chief Executive Officer, and establishes one additional part-time member position. It also strengthens requirements for the appointment and termination of members. 


The Authority will continue to have responsibility for implementation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, and will be supported by the Chief Executive Officer and staff of the agency.


In addition to implementing the new governance arrangements, the Bill also makes a minor technical amendment to clarify the relationship between the suite of legislation underpinning the functions of the Authority. 


The Government recognises every effort needs to be made to mitigate threats to the Great Barrier Reef and is committed to its long-term protection and best-practice management. 


The Bill will ensure the Authority is best placed to meet the significant challenges facing the Reef and continue its important work with Reef users, business, research and government and non-government partners.


NATIONAL BROADCASTERS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ENHANCED TRANSPARENCY) BILL 2017


The National Broadcasters Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Transparency) Bill 2017, amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 (ABC Act) and the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 (SBS Act) to require the annual reporting of employees, including on-air talent, whose combined salary and allowances are in excess of $200,000 annually. 


I gave the national broadcasters an opportunity to implement this reporting measure and advised that if they did not agree I would bring forward legislation to amend the ABC Act and the SBS Act to force the obligation. The national broadcasters have advised that they will not undertake the voluntary reporting, therefore I am following through on my commitment.


This measure seeks to provide more transparency in how the broadcasters allocate Government funding in relation to remuneration for staff and on-air talent. This measure not only provides transparency in the allocation of funding but will also provide for the comparison of remuneration between male and female employees and on air-talent. 




Reporting of salaries over $200,000



The national broadcasters each are required under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 to prepare annual financial statements which comply with accounting standards and any other requirements prescribed by rules, as well as fairly presenting the financial position, performance and cash flow. There is however, no requirement for the national broadcasters to report on how it allocates its Government funding in the employment of high paid staff and on-air talent. 


The payment of salaries and allowances in excess of $200,000 per annum is a major allocation of Government funding which should be visible to the taxpayer. The national broadcasters have an obligation to be transparent in their operations and how Government funding is allocated. 


The ABC and SBS will be required to line-by-line, list the names, position, salary and allowances for employees, including on-air talent, whose combined salary and allowances brings them to over $200,000 annually. 


The concept of reporting on employee salaries is not a new one. The salaries of members of parliament, ministers, judges, senior public servants and military officers all have their salaries publicly released. In addition, private companies, including commercial broadcasters are required to include similar information in annual reports, provided for under the Corporations Act 2001.




Gender pay issues



Enhanced transparency will also enable scrutiny of the extent to which the national broadcasters are meeting public expectations in relation to gender pay parity. The national broadcasters assert that no pay gap unfavourable to women exists within their organisations. That is to be commended. The additional transparency measures proposed by this Bill will ensure ongoing scrutiny and visibility to the Australian public of the performance of the national broadcasters in this regard.




Privacy issues



The Privacy Act 1988 provides for instances where disclosure is required under an Australian law. Where the enhanced transparency measure is legislated in the ABC Act and the SBS Act, it will enable the ABC and SBS to lawfully publish personal information (such as names) of the relevant employees and on-air talent individuals.


Privacy issues are of course a concern to those who will be affected by this amendment. I appreciate that. However, taxpayers have a right to know how their money is being spent for high profile employees and on air talent. These individuals occupy significant positions of public trust and so it is reasonable to expect greater transparency of the remuneration arrangements that apply to high-earning individuals at taxpayer-funded broadcasters. I expect the national broadcasters to manage these issues appropriately.




British Broadcasting Corporation



Similarly, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) publishes information in its annual report on the names of all senior executives of the BBC paid more than 150,000 pounds from licence fee revenue in that financial year. In addition, the names of all other staff of the BBC paid more than 150,000 pounds from licence fee revenue in that financial year is set out in pay bands. 




Conclusion



Transparency in how Government funding is allocated and spent is of interest to the public. This obligation provides a more open and transparent view of our national broadcasters.


In addition, enhanced transparency will provide the public with visibility over how the national broadcasters are ensuring gender pay parity amongst their highest-earning employees.


The Bill is a responsible way to improve public visibility over how the national broadcasters allocate and spend the significant taxpayer funding which they receive each year.

Senator McGRATH:
  The government is implementing measures both on and off site at RAAF Williamtown which address the primary exposure pathways, mitigate against further migration of PFAS from the base and reduce PFAS in the environment. Defence has installed three water treatment plants at the base, treating over 820 million litres of ground and surface water. Defence is excavating sediment from open drains to reduce migration of PFAS in surface water. The government has extended blood testing participation in the epidemiological study and access to dedicated mental health services for those who live or work, or have lived or worked, in the management area, including those affected by its recent expansion. The PFAS task force coordinated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is leading the whole-of-government response and is considering potential options to assist affected communities, including at Williamtown.

 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (15:58):  At the request of Senators Fierravanti-Wells, Pratt and Moore, I move:


That the Senate—


(a) notes that:


   (i) on 5 December 2017, the world will observe International Volunteer Day, an opportunity for Australia to thank all our volunteers—past and present, both in Australia and overseas—for their selfless contributions to worthy causes, including Australia's aid program,


   (ii) the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (the global plan to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change) explicitly recognises volunteer groups as stakeholders to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),


   (iii) this year's theme for International Volunteer Day, 'Volunteers Act First. Here. Everywhere', is a reflection of how volunteers around the world are responding in times of crisis and supporting longer-term social and economic development, at home and abroad,


   (iv) Australia has a long and proud history of volunteering, with the 2016 Census revealing that around 3.6 million Australian volunteers give their time to support local and regional communities and those in need overseas—since 1951, when our first international volunteers went to Indonesia, successive Australian Governments have supported more than 14 000 Australians to volunteer through Australia's aid program,


   (v) the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper recognises the importance of Australian volunteers creating links between communities and people in our region—advancing Australia's reputation overseas,


   (vi) each year, through the Government's flagship Australian Volunteers Program, over 1,000 Australians offer their time and skills to volunteer in developing countries—through this program, skilled Australian volunteers share their knowledge with people and organisations in about 25 developing countries by contributing to global economic growth and poverty reduction, and Australian volunteers are helping make our region more stable, secure and prosperous,


   (vii) by helping our neighbours to be healthier, well-educated and able to make a meaningful contribution to the economy, support for Australian volunteers across successive governments ensures less reliance on aid in the future, and


   (viii) Australian volunteers give a lot to their host communities but they also receive a lot in return—Australian volunteers increase their understanding of our region and bring new knowledge, skills and relationships back to Australia—these life-long personal and professional relationships are building strength and diversity in Australia's connections to the world; and


(b) recognises:


   (i) United Nations (UN) resolution, Integrating volunteering into peace and development: the plan of action for the next decade and beyond, adopted in November 2015 by consensus by the UN General Assembly, which recognises that volunteering can be a powerful means of implementation for the SDGs,


   (ii) that, through Australia's aid program, Australian volunteers play a valuable part in contributing to regional development and stability, and


   (iii) the strong commitment from Australian volunteers, business, government and non-government organisations to support volunteers to share our culture, our values and our multicultural way of life with the world.

(d) on 22 March 2017, the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia, responding to a question from then Senator Xenophon on the meaning of 'broad community support', advised the Senate that the Government had taken a proposal forward in the Hawker region in South Australia where support was at 65%;


(e) the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia further advised that, while the Government has not put a definitive figure on what constitutes 'broad community support', the Government would need a figure in the range of the support received in Hawker;

The need for regulation of mobility scooters, also known as motorised wheelchairs, including:


(a) the number of deaths and injuries attributed to accidents involving mobility scooters in Australia since their introduction;

  From 2000 to 2010, Monash University has kept statistics on the number of accidents involving mobility scooters, commonly known as gophers. In Australia, 62 people were killed and 442 people were hospitalised in those 10 years. Of course, it was very public when my wife got hit by one. She is very good, and I'm pleased about that. Mrs Nicholson from Ballina contacted us. She was walking down the street in Ballina and got hit from behind by a mobility scooter. She had multiple fractures to both legs, spent four months in hospital and has never recovered properly. That is only one incident; there have been many more. They're an essential item for the elderly and frail. I have no desire to ban them, but I think we need to have a good look at this and see what we can do to make it safer for all Australians in the future.

That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by 20 September 2018: 


The need for regulation of mobility scooters, also known as motorised wheelchairs, including:


(a) the number of deaths and injuries attributed to accidents involving mobility scooters in Australia since their introduction;


(b) the causes of these accidents;


(c) any current regulations governing the use of mobility scooters throughout Australia;


(d) comparison of Australian regulations with international standards;


(e) what support structures are in place to ensure the safe operation of mobility scooters;


(f) the regulatory role of government and non-government bodies; and


(g) any related matter.


I seek leave to make a brief statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  From 2000 to 2010, Monash University has kept statistics on the number of accidents involving mobility scooters, commonly known as gophers. In Australia, 62 people were killed and 442 people were hospitalised in those 10 years. Of course, it was very public when my wife got hit by one. She is very good, and I'm pleased about that. Mrs Nicholson from Ballina contacted us. She was walking down the street in Ballina and got hit from behind by a mobility scooter. She had multiple fractures to both legs, spent four months in hospital and has never recovered properly. That is only one incident; there have been many more. They're an essential item for the elderly and frail. I have no desire to ban them, but I think we need to have a good look at this and see what we can do to make it safer for all Australians in the future.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (16:23):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator HINCH:
  On the ABC this afternoon I was asked about this. I was asked, 'Are you here to vilify old people?' I said, 'Not at all. I wear a knee brace and may need one of these things at some stage.' The reason that I am co-sponsoring this motion is that the mother of one of my staff ended up in hospital with bad hip injuries because her partner—inadvertently, I hasten to add—ran her over in one of these motorised scooters. He was in his 80s, legally blind and still driving it. The weight and speed of these things should be checked out. They need to be made safer not only for partners but also for the people riding them.


Question agreed to.

(b) the Senate further notes that:

   (ii) the decision of any Government minister to associate with media identities facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment and abuse would call into question their capacity to responsibly execute their ministerial responsibilities,


   (iii) scrubbing one's social media of references to figures facing allegations of sexual harassment and abuse would represent an acknowledgement that the association was inappropriate in the first place, and


   (iv) any member of the Government who chooses to associate with a figure whose alleged behaviour was, to quote one report, 'an open secret for years', cannot, for their own benefit, pick and choose when to withdraw that association; and


(c) there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, by no later than 6.30 pm on 8 December 2017:


   (i) any documents produced by, with, or featuring celebrity gardener Mr Burke from 1 November 2016,

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:39):  by leave—I table and present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 137th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held at St Petersburg in the Russian Federation on 14 October to 18 October. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.


Leave granted.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


In speaking to this report, I thank the secretariat, who accompanied the delegation to St Petersburg in October. I also should acknowledge my co-delegates, Senator Ketter and Mr Josh Wilson, both of whom made significant contributions to the assembly in St Petersburg. The assembly comprised some 829 parliamentarians from all over the world from some 155 member countries, including 146 presiding or deputy presiding officers. Unfortunately, our presiding officers could not be there because parliament was sitting in Australia, so I had the honour of leading the delegation.


It's a real privilege and an honour for Australian parliamentarians to be at these conferences. You do come away realising just how very lucky we are to live in a country like Australia which has rule of law. Some of the delegates who spoke at the conference gave the impression that they didn't know whether, when they got off the plane when they got home, they would be thrown in jail. Some of the challenges under which parliamentarians around the world work is a real eye opener to those of us in Australia who understand a civilised country that follows the rule of law.


There were a number of general debates. The topic of the general debate was promoting cultural pluralism and peace through interfaith and interethnic dialogue, which both Senator Ketter and I spoke to. I might say that Senator Ketter, in his typical approach to these sorts of things, was forthright and honest. He gave a very clear exposition of his view on that—and, I might say, it was Australia's view as well. It wasn't a view that might have been universally accepted.


There was a motion on the problems in Myanmar, particularly as they relate to the Rohingya people. This was the urgency motion selected by the assembly to deal with. A number of urgency motions were put forward, all of which were quite important, but it was the one on Myanmar that achieved the support needed to make it the urgency debate. I was nominated to the drafting committee of that motion. It was a motion promoted by a number of countries, including Morocco, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh, Kuwait, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Sudan and Turkey. They all had individual motions but agreed to join them. The drafting committee then had to try and bring the motion to something that might achieve support across the assembly, which it did.


The Australian delegation took the opportunity while we were in St Petersburg to have bilateral meetings with the Republic of Belarus and with Singapore. The latter was particularly related to the strategic partnership between Australia and Singapore and, as far as I was concerned, particularly the expansion of the training of Singapore troops in Australia at Rockhampton and Townsville. We also had a meeting with the delegation from Israel. Interestingly, the young lady from the Knesset who spoke to us and who was part of the Israeli delegation was until a couple of years previously an Australian citizen and had spent most of her life in Australia. She'd returned to Israel and got herself elected—

1052BA


Directions to ensure sufficient financing



(1) ASIC may give AFCA a written direction under this section if ASIC considers that AFCA has not done all things reasonably practicable to ensure that the operations of the AFCA scheme are sufficiently financed.


(2) The direction must set out the specific measures that AFCA must take to ensure that the operations of the AFCA scheme are sufficiently financed.


(3) ASIC must not give a direction under this section unless ASIC has given AFCA written notice of at least 1 month of ASIC's intention to issue the direction.


(4) AFCA must comply with a direction made under this section.


Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1).


(5) If AFCA fails to comply with the direction, ASIC may apply to the Court for, and the Court may make, an order that AFCA comply with the direction.


(6) A direction made under this section is not a legislative instrument.


(4) Schedule 1, item 3, page 29 (after table item 311), insert:


311A Subsection 1052BA(4) 100 penalty units for each day, or part of a day, in respect of which the offence is committed.


We won't be moving amendment (1) as there's duplication. I will briefly speak to amendments (2) to (4). Quickly, on amendment (1), review of the operation of amendments: we asked for a clause to be put in for an independent review that was comprehensive. That was tabled in parliament; that wasn't an legislative instrument. I think that has been dealt with now through the government's own amendments, and it's been recommended by other senators.


In relation to schedules 2, 3 and 4, the amendments are really important. I would really urge the Senate to support these amendments. Essentially, these give the Australian Securities and Investments Commission special powers and consideration to make sure that this new entity, AFCA, is properly financed—that it actually has the funding in place to deal with complaints. I've had experience of this with FOS, one of the entities that's being merged into AFCA. I think I've spoken on 7.30 on this issue, and I know that Senator Xenophon has also made public comments. If not the perception there's the reality that, under the current system, with a huge backlog, it's not necessarily in the banks' or the big financial service companies' interests to get through a big backlog of financial complaints, because they often have to pay them out, and that funding was a real problem. We had accusations that the senators looked at directly where complainants were told that their complaints couldn't be heard, because FOS didn't have the resources at that point in time. We have to make sure that the whole spirit of setting up AFCA—and the Greens support, in this debate, merging FOS and CIO—is that we have a better funding model in place so that there's no hanky-panky or monkey business with providing the funding that's needed to get through backlogs of these complaints.


As a backup—and this is specifically in relation to concerns raised by the CIO and stakeholders around them—we would give ASIC the oversight, which is outlined in some detail on schedule 1, item 2, page 11, where we insert:




   
1052BA


Directions to ensure sufficient financing



(1) ASIC may give AFCA a written direction under this section if ASIC considers that AFCA has not done all things reasonably practicable to ensure that the operations of the AFCA scheme are sufficiently financed.


(2) The direction must set out the specific measures that AFCA must take to ensure that the operations of the AFCA scheme are sufficiently financed.


(3) ASIC must not give a direction under this section unless ASIC has given AFCA written notice of at least 1 month of ASIC's intention to issue the direction.


(4) AFCA must comply with a direction made under this section.


Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1).


(5) If AFCA fails to comply with the direction, ASIC may apply to the Court for, and the Court may make, an order that AFCA comply with the direction.


Schedule 1, item 3, page 29, under (4), has the penalties for not doing so. This gives ASIC not only administrative oversight et cetera but also the ability to actually look at the financing of this body. Hopefully that won't be a problem; hopefully this will work. If not, ASIC has the ability to fund those.


I do have some specific questions that I want to ask in relation to the new body, Minister, so I might get through those quickly, if that's okay. I will come back to the amendments in a second. This is in relation to the power to obtain documents under the new AFCA architecture. Will AFCA be given the power to obtain documents for non-superannuation related matters? Very quickly, under FOS's current terms of reference, where a party to a dispute without reasonable excuse fails to provide or procure information or to take any other step requested, FOS may make an adverse inference and rule against the party on that basis. Will AFCA have that power?

It's important that the new AFCA has adequate resources to properly consider disputes, and we note that ASIC has a directions power under the bill with respect to AFCA. We will support this amendment, to put beyond doubt that this includes making sure that the AFCA scheme is sufficiently financed.

However, in that context, we will not be opposing the Greens amendments.

(2) Schedule 1, item 2, page 9 (line 26), after ""1052B"", insert "", 1052BA"".


(3) Schedule 1, item 2, page 11 (after line 7), after section 1052B, insert:




   
1052BA


Directions to ensure sufficient financing



(1) ASIC may give AFCA a written direction under this section if ASIC considers that AFCA has not done all things reasonably practicable to ensure that the operations of the AFCA scheme are sufficiently financed.


(2) The direction must set out the specific measures that AFCA must take to ensure that the operations of the AFCA scheme are sufficiently financed.


(3) ASIC must not give a direction under this section unless ASIC has given AFCA written notice of at least 1 month of ASIC's intention to issue the direction.


(4) AFCA must comply with a direction made under this section.


Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1).


(5) If AFCA fails to comply with the direction, ASIC may apply to the Court for, and the Court may make, an order that AFCA comply with the direction.


(6) A direction made under this section is not a legislative instrument.


(4) Schedule 1, item 3, page 29 (after table item 311), insert:


311A Subsection 1052BA(4) 100 penalty units for each day, or part of a day, in respect of which the offence is committed.


We won't be moving amendment (1) as there's duplication. I will briefly speak to amendments (2) to (4). Quickly, on amendment (1), review of the operation of amendments: we asked for a clause to be put in for an independent review that was comprehensive. That was tabled in parliament; that wasn't an legislative instrument. I think that has been dealt with now through the government's own amendments, and it's been recommended by other senators.


In relation to schedules 2, 3 and 4, the amendments are really important. I would really urge the Senate to support these amendments. Essentially, these give the Australian Securities and Investments Commission special powers and consideration to make sure that this new entity, AFCA, is properly financed—that it actually has the funding in place to deal with complaints. I've had experience of this with FOS, one of the entities that's being merged into AFCA. I think I've spoken on 7.30 on this issue, and I know that Senator Xenophon has also made public comments. If not the perception there's the reality that, under the current system, with a huge backlog, it's not necessarily in the banks' or the big financial service companies' interests to get through a big backlog of financial complaints, because they often have to pay them out, and that funding was a real problem. We had accusations that the senators looked at directly where complainants were told that their complaints couldn't be heard, because FOS didn't have the resources at that point in time. We have to make sure that the whole spirit of setting up AFCA—and the Greens support, in this debate, merging FOS and CIO—is that we have a better funding model in place so that there's no hanky-panky or monkey business with providing the funding that's needed to get through backlogs of these complaints.


As a backup—and this is specifically in relation to concerns raised by the CIO and stakeholders around them—we would give ASIC the oversight, which is outlined in some detail on schedule 1, item 2, page 11, where we insert:




   
1052BA


Directions to ensure sufficient financing



(1) ASIC may give AFCA a written direction under this section if ASIC considers that AFCA has not done all things reasonably practicable to ensure that the operations of the AFCA scheme are sufficiently financed.


(2) The direction must set out the specific measures that AFCA must take to ensure that the operations of the AFCA scheme are sufficiently financed.


(3) ASIC must not give a direction under this section unless ASIC has given AFCA written notice of at least 1 month of ASIC's intention to issue the direction.


(4) AFCA must comply with a direction made under this section.


Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1).


(5) If AFCA fails to comply with the direction, ASIC may apply to the Court for, and the Court may make, an order that AFCA comply with the direction.


Schedule 1, item 3, page 29, under (4), has the penalties for not doing so. This gives ASIC not only administrative oversight et cetera but also the ability to actually look at the financing of this body. Hopefully that won't be a problem; hopefully this will work. If not, ASIC has the ability to fund those.


I do have some specific questions that I want to ask in relation to the new body, Minister, so I might get through those quickly, if that's okay. I will come back to the amendments in a second. This is in relation to the power to obtain documents under the new AFCA architecture. Will AFCA be given the power to obtain documents for non-superannuation related matters? Very quickly, under FOS's current terms of reference, where a party to a dispute without reasonable excuse fails to provide or procure information or to take any other step requested, FOS may make an adverse inference and rule against the party on that basis. Will AFCA have that power?

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:02):  I have another question in relation to this. I understand that Pam McAlister from Mercer is developing the rules and operational arrangements for AFCA with Treasury. Have some financial institutions already been consulted on the governance and funding issues? Could you tell us who they are? Have any not-for-profit representatives been consulted?

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:02):  I've been advised that it's a public consultation process, which means that anybody is able to take part in the consultation.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:03):  So not-for-profit representatives within the superannuation industry will be able to participate or you will be consulting with them directly on the many fine details that we're yet to see about how this is going to work?

Senator RUSTON

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-12-06,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:03):  Just to clarify—the process has come to the point where we have the legislation. My question was specifically into all the details around the terms of reference and the operational rules and arrangements, which we're yet to see. I don't think anyone has seen them. Will you be going through extensive consultation processes with those stakeholders?

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-12-06,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:04):  There is already a consultation paper that's out in the public domain. The terms of reference of the consultation are outlined in that, and it is quite clear that that is what they are consulting about.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:04):  Labor would like to indicate that we will be supporting the Greens amendments on sheet 8314. These amendments give ASIC explicit power to direct AFCA to take steps to ensure that it is sufficiently financed—fundamental for any organisation. It's important that the new AFCA has adequate resources to properly consider disputes, and we note that ASIC has a directions power under the bill with respect to AFCA. We will support this amendment, to put beyond doubt that this includes making sure that the AFCA scheme is sufficiently financed.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Kitching
):  Senator Whish-Wilson, could I confirm that you do not wish to move amendment (1) on sheet 8314?




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  That's correct; just amendments (2), (3) and (4).

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,32,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-12-06,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:05):  Before you put the question, Madam Temporary Chair, I would like to say that the government will not be opposing these amendments, although we would like to put on the record that we believe that providing these additional powers to ASIC is unnecessary, because we believe that the legislation already currently provides the general direction powers to ASIC that it can to ensure that AFCA is adequately funded. However, in that context, we will not be opposing the Greens amendments.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  The question is that amendments (2) to (4) on sheet 8134 be agreed to.


Question agreed to.




(Quorum formed)



Bill, as amended, agreed to.


Bill reported with amendments; report adopted.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (19:20):  After that long—




Senator Payne:
  Tirade?




Senator RUSTON:
  tirade—thank you, Senator Payne—from Senator Collins, it gives me great pleasure to stand up and talk about something that I think is extraordinarily important—that is, meeting the commitments that we make to the Australian people. Given that we live in an extraordinary world of alternative facts—which is probably the politest way of putting it—where public opinion trumps facts and science, it is really important that we continue to keep our promises, and deliver accountability, transparency, honesty and integrity. The only way that we're going to deal with the deficit of trust out there, that's being created by those who were quite happy to peddle in alternative facts, is by returning the trust of the Australian people through keeping our promises.


One of the great promises that have been kept in very recent times was in relation to the same-sex marriage debate. We held a survey, we asked the Australian people what they wanted, 79.5 per cent of them turned up to have their say, and we had an overwhelming response where they voted 'yes'. Last week we passed the legislation through this place, and it is downstairs at the moment. I think it is really important that we recognise the fact that it is irresponsible to ignore the mandates that are given to those in this place by the public—mandates that have often been ignored; particularly, for instance, by those opposite, who ignored the mandate that I believe that the Abbott government got when it was elected in 2013, and that was to abolish the carbon tax. The level of frustration that occurred in the period following the election in 2013—to the extent that we were not able to act on the mandate that was delivered by the people—was reprehensible. I believe that goodwill, cooperation and collaboration with the private sector are absolutely essential, as is making sure that we speak to the public, we talk to the public and we listen to the public.


What I'd like to highlight in the few minutes that I have now are some of the things that might not have been able to happen if we hadn't taken the approach, which I think is appropriate—you know the old saying, Mr Acting Deputy President: you catch more flies with honey than vinegar! A constant adversarial approach—'we've just got to oppose things for opposition's sake'—doesn't actually serve any purpose in terms of delivering good governance and outcomes for the people of Australia. In my portfolio, I take great pride in refusing to play politics. I also refuse to play politics in my role as a senator, because I believe that actually delivering the outcomes for people is far more important—for the people that I represent: as a senator, they are the people of South Australia; and in my Agriculture and Water Resources portfolio, they are, most particularly, those people in the fisheries, forestry, wine and horticulture industries, and those people who live in the Murray-Darling Basin. I believe it is much more important to listen to what they have to say and to work really hard to deliver the outcomes that they need, to benefit those people. I'm not after a headline by just saying 'no', and I'm not after a headline by playing politics; I am after delivering outcomes for the people that I represent.


It is with great pleasure that tonight I'd like to outline a few of the things that have happened in my portfolio area that have delivered positive outcomes. In the wine industry we have been delighted to be able to deliver a suite of reforms in relation to taxation and the marketing of the wine industry that have been wholeheartedly embraced by the wine industry. We listened to the industry. There were some issues on the table when I came in as the minister, but we've listened to the wine industry and we've delivered a suite of reforms which the industry has embraced. For instance, we have reformed the wine equalisation tax so that it better reflects the original intent of the policy.


In doing so, the federal government has also made available to the wine industry a $50 million package that will enable the industry to take advantage of the massive international export marketing opportunity that is on our doorstep in Asia. Included in this is an additional $10 million wine tourism cellar door package, which gives us the opportunity to say to the wine industry that we recognise the huge contribution it makes to regional Australia by its investment in its cellar doors, restaurants and cafes. Most particularly, we recognise the employment that is delivered to rural and regional Australia by the Australian wine industry. 


In relation to the forestry sector, it was an absolute pleasure to have worked with a group of people who delivered the Forest Industry Advisory Council's report Transforming Australia's forest products industry: recommendations from the Forest Industry Advisory Council. Now, only a matter of 12 months after the release of that report, you can go through the 19 recommendations and see that many of them have already been ticked off and that we are well underway towards delivering the outcomes that the Australian forestry industry has asked the government to deliver. We believe that the forestry industry is a regional growth engine, so we are investing in its future. It was with great pleasure that I stood with the Prime Minister when he announced that we are going to develop a new plan that reflects the recommendations and the requests of the forestry industry in its plan to transform the sector.


We have also established a National Institute for Forest Products Innovation. Two of these hubs will be set up in Tasmania and South Australia, and we're looking forward to working with the industry to roll out more of these innovation hubs around Australia. We're looking forward to working with the forestry sector to transition their industry from an industry of the past to an industry of the future—one that is technologically advanced, responsible, sustainable, recyclable, renewable. For those who haven't heard me lately, it's also carbon positive. So, we're absolutely delighted that we are moving forward in the forestry sector. 


In terms of the fisheries sector, I can also say it was an absolute delight to stand with my colleagues Veronica Papacosta and Jane Lovell when they announced the launch of Seafood Industry Australia, the new peak industry body for the commercial fishing sector. They've really hit the ground running and are doing amazing things already. This government has met another of its election commitments in recognising recreational and Indigenous fishers, and we've changed legislation to do so. 


We believe that this is a shared resource. There are many stakeholders, and not any one stakeholder should have a greater say. We are working with the recreational and Indigenous fishing sectors to make sure that they too can have their say and make their contributions to the development of fisheries policy in Australia. We were delighted to work with the recreational fishing sector to put on 'gone fishing' days, so that we can let the young people of Australia understand what a fantastic pastime going fishing is and let them know there's something more to life than perhaps playing on their PlayStation or their Xbox. 


We also take our responsibilities in the international fisheries sector very seriously. We work, particularly with Pacific island countries, to make sure that we have sustainable fisheries in the international space. Many of our very important fisheries are international fisheries, so we are catching the same fish that they are catching in Vanuatu, Niue and the Marshall Islands, as well as Indonesia, Japan and many other places. It was with great pleasure that I signed a memorandum of understanding with the Vietnamese government so that we can work with them to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and promote sustainable fisheries, which both our governments are very keen to do. 


From a fisheries perspective we have a very proud record of delivering on the promises we went to the Australian people with. We have also put out the Commonwealth fisheries policy statement, which places a strong emphasis on balance and sustainability. It is a statement of Australia's sovereignty over its fisheries, recognising that these fish, our fisheries and our marine environment are owned by all Australians and that no one sector, whether in Australia or overseas, can claim a greater victory. These are shared resources, and they must be managed accordingly. 


We've also delivered our national agriculture strategy, and early in the new year we will be delivering our Commonwealth Fisheries Harvest Strategy Policy and Fisheries Bycatch Policy, once again delivering on the promises that we took to the Australian people. In the horticulture area we've delivered the new horticultural code of conduct, which sees a much better balance between the responsibilities of the markets and the growers to make sure that we have security for everybody going into the future.


Finally, in the water sector, despite all of the hoo-ha and the carry-on that we've heard in this place, I'd like to advise the chamber that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is on target to deliver its projected targets for 2019. With the approval through this place of the two amendments—one at the moment and one early in the New Year—we will be able to deliver our 2,750 by 2019. It is a great news story. We have delivered.
