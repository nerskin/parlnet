(1)	Schedule 1, page 17 (after line 18), after item 16, insert: 
16A After section 74
Insert:
74A Minister may request referral of a larger action
	(1)	If the Minister receives a referral in relation to a proposal to take an action by a person, and the Minister is satisfied the action that is the subject of the referral is a component of a larger action the person proposes to take, the Minister may decide to not accept the referral.
	(2)	If the Minister decides to not accept a referral under subsection (1), the Minister: 
	(a)	must give written notice of the decision to the person who referred the proposal to the Minister; and
	(b)	must give written notice of the decision to the person who is proposing to take the action that was the subject of the referral; and
	(c)	may, under section 70, request of the person proposing to take the action that was the subject of the referral, that they refer the proposal, to take the larger action, to the Minister.
	(3)	To avoid doubt, sections 73 and 74 do not apply to a referral that has not been accepted in accordance with subsection (1).
	(4)	If the Minister decides to accept a referral under subsection (1), the Minister must, at the time of making a decision under section 75: 
	(a)	give written notice of the decision to the person who referred the proposal to the Minister; and
	(b)	publish in accordance with the regulations (if any), a copy or summary of the decision.
16B After subsection 75(1)
Insert:
	(1AA)	To avoid doubt, the Minister is not permitted to make a decision under subsection (1) in relation to an action that was the subject of a referral that was not accepted under subsection 74A(1).
16C Subsection 77(3) 
Repeal the subsection. 
16D Subsection 77(5) 
Repeal the subsection. 
16E After section 77
Insert:
77A Action to be taken in a particular manner
	(1)	If, in deciding whether the action is a controlled action or not, the Minister has made a decision (the component decision) that a particular provision of Part 3 is not a controlling provision for the action because the Minister believes it will be taken in a particular manner (whether or not in accordance with an accredited management plan for the purposes of a declaration under section 33 or a bilaterally accredited management plan for the purposes of a bilateral agreement), the notice to be provided under section 77 must set out the component decision, identifying the provision and the manner.
Note:	The Minister may decide that a provision of Part 3 is not a controlling provision for an action because he or she believes that the action will be taken in a manner that will ensure the action will not have (and is not likely to have) an adverse impact on the matter protected by the provision.
	(2)	A person must not take an action that is the subject of a notice that includes a particular manner under subsection (1), in a way that is inconsistent with the manner specified in the notice.
Civil penalty:
	(a)	for an individual—1,000 penalty units, or such lower amount as is prescribed by the regulations;
	(b)	for a body corporate—10,000 penalty units, or such lower amount as is prescribed by the regulations.
This amendment is about split referrals and it gives the minister the power to require that whole projects be referred to the minister and not just smaller components of those projects. In doing so the amendment gives effect to the government's express desire that proponents would not be able to thwart or circumvent the referral, assessment and approvals provisions of the EPBC Act by splitting projects into smaller components. In this regard the explanatory memorandum for the EPBC Bill says:
An action may be a series of activities carried out over a particular time period (for example, under a licence or permit). This is intended to ensure a person cannot avoid the provisions of the Act by breaking one action into many small actions.
Controlled action decisions have been made on split projects over the past two years but there is still some ambiguity about whether the minister has the ability to enforce the government's stated commitment that I have just quoted. Our amendment will simply provide that certainty. 
When a proposal is referred to the minister, he or she must decide whether the action requires approval under part 9—in other words, whether it is a controlled action. Under part 7 the minister can decide that an action will not require approval under part 9 if it is taken in a specified manner. The problem with this process at the moment is that the manner specified is not enforceable. A person who takes an action in contravention of the manner specified will be guilty of breaching the act only if it can be established that the action had a significant impact or is likely to have a significant impact on a matter protected under the relevant provisions of part 3. The amendment rectifies this problem by inserting a statutory obligation to comply with the manner specified outlined in the notice of decision. It also imposes penalties for noncompliance.
In addition, the amendment repeals section 77(5). That section provides that reasons for controlled action decisions do not need to be given in relation to referrals where the person proposing to take the action stated in the referral that they thought it was a controlled action. In the interests of improved accountability and transparency it is appropriate for reasons to be provided in all circumstances. I point out that this is almost identical to Senator Lees's amendment (109) but in Senator Lees's amendment a minor error has been picked up.

(12)	Schedule 1, item 31, page 27 (lines 1 and 2), omit “However, the Minister may extend the period in paragraph (a) or (b).
(13)	Schedule 1, item 31, page 27 (after line 2), after subsection 324G(2), insert:
	(2A)	If the Australian Heritage Council does not complete the assessment of a place against the National Heritage criteria within the period specified in paragraph (2)(a) or (b), the Minister may, by notice in writing, extend the period by up to 24 months if all reasonable efforts were made to complete the assessment within the relevant period. 
	(2B)	If the Australian Heritage Council does not complete the assessment of a place against the National Heritage criteria by the time specified in the notice provided under subsection (2A), the Minister may, by notice in writing, provide an extension of up to 24 months if all reasonable efforts were made to complete the assessment within the period specified in the notice. 
	(2C)	If the Minister extends the period for the completion of an assessment of a place against the National Heritage criteria under subsection (2A) or (2B), the Minister must within 10 business days:
	(a)	publish a notice including the reasons for the extension on the Internet; and
	(b)	if the place was nominated by a person, or a person notified the Minister under subsection 324F(1A)—provide copies of the notice and the reasons for the decision to the person. 
These amendments are to do with the time frame for assessments by the Heritage Council. These amendments impose time limits on the production of assessments of places of national heritage value by the Australian Heritage Council. It is important to ensure that assessments are done in a timely manner, in particular to ensure that there are not go-slows on politically contentious assessments.
The bill currently gives the AHC 12 months to complete an assessment, but the minister can grant an extension of time for an indefinite period. Our amendment gives the minister the capacity to grant a maximum of two extensions of time to the AHC for the production of assessments if all reasonable efforts were made to complete the assessment within the relevant period. Each extension is for up to 12 months, meaning that all assessments must be completed within five years, which should be enough time for the AHC to complete an assessment and consider new studies et cetera, even for very large areas. The amendment also provides that if the minister grants an extension of time then he or she must publish on the Internet a copy of the notice and the reasons for the decisions. If a person nominated the place then that person must be provided with the reasons for that decision.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-14,"—I would like to take this opportunity to revisit an issue that was discussed at some length yesterday, regarding the Commonwealth assets listed on the heritage register. Whilst that amendment of the Labor opposition was defeated, there is a follow-up question that goes specifically to what I described as the minister's dodgy maths for the number of sites that would be transferred across. It relates specifically to nine sites on Norfolk Island. I know Senator Allison did ask some questions about the Norfolk Island sites as well. Specifically, the question is: will the nine sites, which I understand either have listing or are waiting to be listed, be listed prior to that crown land being sold off on Norfolk Island?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-14,"—I have to take that on notice because I do not know of any plan to sell off land on Norfolk Island. I would have to find out exactly what the detail of that is and, if it is proposed to sell Commonwealth land on Norfolk Island, what the timetable of that is. I would need to check the state of consideration of the heritage assessment. There is obviously a range of quite complex issues within it.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-14,"—I ask the minister to do that as soon as possible, because what I am interested in is an undertaking from the government that the nine areas, which apparently are on the indicative list of the register, will not be sold until they are listed on the new register.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-14,"—It is an appropriate time for me to ask the minister about the critically endangered swamp eyebright plant in the Southport Lagoon conservation area in southern Tasmania. This plant is found in only one place, and the population is down to some 250 mature individuals. The plant is listed as critically endangered because it is confined to that area. It actually occupies a space of less than 10 hectares. There is only one population, and it is declining. There are extreme fluctuations in the numbers of plants and, clearly, it is faced with extinction. The access road through the Southport Lagoon conservation area to the Recherche Bay logging area goes right through this area of habitat of this critically endangered plant. Could the minister give me the status of the study of the impact of that access road, which was begun in May 12 months ago but is now on hold and is slated for renewed roadworks if the logging proceeds at the end of the year? In the assessment of the status of the plant, it names that road as a specific danger, not just directly but through the introduction of rootrot fungus, for example, which could endanger this plant, which is making its last stand on the planet. I ask the minister: is the swamp eyebright on the critically endangered list under the current legislation? If so, what will be the impact of the road on that eyebright? To be blunt, isn't it a matter of that road not being allowed to proceed without danger to this plant, which as I said is making its last stand? What other action would be appropriate to protect the plant other than ensuring that that road does not proceed?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-14,"—I do not know off-hand the status of the swamp eyebright, and I have to confess that I do not know of this particular access road. I will seek advice and hopefully will be able to provide further information to Senator Brown. In relation to the matter he raised yesterday about the listing of Recherche Bay, it now seems, from what I am told today, that the nomination has not been made but the council has changed its approach to this particular issue. The nomination, I am told, is being prepared by a group comprising the parliamentary Greens—I am surprised Senator Brown does not know these things—the National Trust, the Recherche Bay Protection Group, the Australian Gardens Historical Society and the Tasmanian Conservation Trust. I am told the formal nomination is being prepared for consideration by the Tasmanian Heritage Council on 24 September.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-14,"—The actual question I asked the minister yesterday was related to a letter to me from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, saying that the Tasmanian Heritage Council was to have expert individuals look at the status with a view to a nomination and to do research, which was obviously to look at the natural and cultural values of the area. I am asking the minister whether that process is proceeding and how it is going as far as process is concerned.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-14,—My officials believe that the Tasmanian Heritage Council changed its approach subsequent to the letter of Dr Kemp to Senator Brown. The process being adopted now is the one that I have just outlined.,SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-14,"—If that is the case, can the minister tell me why Dr Kemp did not contact me to inform me that that process had been changed? Otherwise, clearly I am in a position of being misled that there is a process of assessment taking place, when it is not taking place. The minister informed me that the Tasmanian Heritage Council was having an independent expert assessment of the north-east peninsula of Recherche Bay. If that process has changed, it was incumbent upon the minister to let me know that that process had changed and to let anybody else he had so informed know. I now ask the minister why Dr Kemp did not inform me and indeed why that change has been made. What are the factors involved? I can tell him that the groups he named—and he did name the Tasmanian Greens amongst them—did not want to be left in the position where they did the assessment. There was a commitment there by the Tasmanian Heritage Council, and I ask why that commitment has been reneged on.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-14,"—The Tasmanian Heritage Council is not a Commonwealth body. As I understand it, a new way of approaching the matter was agreed on by the council and the groups I listed, which include the parliamentary Greens. So it would seem that those on the ground, so to speak, adopted a new process in relation to this matter which they obviously believed was a better process. Why didn't Dr Kemp tell Senator Brown of this? I do not know the answer. It might be that Dr Kemp was not told himself, because this is a Tasmanian process and not a Commonwealth process, or it might have been that he assumed that Senator Brown would be a party to it because the parliamentary Greens are a party to it.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-14,"—We are looking here at national heritage, and if ever there is a place that qualifies as being a prime listing for the National Estate it would be the north-east peninsula of Recherche Bay for the reasons I outlined yesterday. It is to do with its cultural as well as its natural heritage—in particular as a meeting place between the great French scientific expedition of D'Entrecasteaux and the Pallevar people in 1793. It was a very extensive meeting, and it has been very extensively diarised by the French expeditioners of the time. I have just alluded to a further factor that is involved here, which is that one of the most critically endangered species in Australia, the swamp eyebright in Tasmania—which, by the way, is a most beautiful flowering plant—is right in the way of roadworks being proposed for a very limited but destructive logging operation to be undertaken by Gunns Pty Ltd at any time that a voluntary moratorium is listed. 
We have here a critically endangered suite of values. The minister wrote to me saying that there was an independent assessment of these values being done by the Tasmanian Heritage Council and that it was an appropriate way to proceed. But what I want to draw Senator Hill's attention to is a decision—for reasons unknown; I believe it was a political decision involving the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Jim Bacon, intervening in the process— saying that the Tasmanian Heritage Council will not do an independent study. He went on to say that therefore the community groups, without the money, the wherewithal or the expertise—they would have to go and look for those—would have to do the study if they wanted this area protected. 
What I am pointing to here is a totally inadequate process for doing an assessment of a critically endangered area by the system that is in place. Surely the Commonwealth should move in to do this assessment if the state government will not. Why should it be left to community groups to do this work? Is this not prime national heritage that is at stake here? I ask the government: ought it not move in to ensure there is an independent study done? Why put it to a group of communities which, at the end, will no doubt have their expertise questioned by the logging industry which wants to get in and make money out of logging part of that peninsula? It ought to be done at arms length by government and it ought to be independent. I asked the minister what the reasons were for suddenly not having that study done in Tasmania, because I believe they are political and I believe they are the outcome of pressure from Gunns on the Tasmanian government, which has said it will not help by doing the study that is required. 
It is the worst of my fears—and the fears of the Greens—about this legislation that is happening now right in front of this committee. I want the minister to be able to assure us that there is a better process than this— that it will not be at the behest of a pressure group, which has a development afoot, that is simply moving right across a proper process for establishing critically endangered National Estate and putting the kybosh on it as best they can. I ask the minister: will he ensure that he gets a response from the Tasmanian government as to why that funding was not provided, if that is the problem, for the Tasmanian Heritage Council to go ahead with this decision to do an independent study? I am sure Senator Hill will agree with me that, on the face of it, it does not add up.  
It is not a reasonable process to say to community groups, `Yes, this is endangered; within months they are going to be in there logging, you go and do the work that says that they should not do it.' You cannot have prime Australian heritage sites—cultural and natural—and an extraordinarily important historic landscape subject to such imminent damage as this, and you cannot have governments withdrawing and saying to the community, `You sort it out, you prove it to us or the damage is going to occur.' I ask the minister: will he find out why that independent study is not proceeding and is there a Commonwealth facility to do that independent archaeological, historic and natural assessment as to the value of this peninsula? Might I also flag with the minister a real problem arising here. This is going to become a huge dispute in Tasmania in the New Year if it is not properly dealt with now.
The Tasmanian Heritage Council made an interim listing of about a hectare around the French garden site on the peninsula and down south on the point, where the observatory was. But the logging is going to occur. It is just 10 hectares of logging within this 140-hectare peninsula, but to get into the peninsula they have to go through the Southport Lagoon conservation area, which is protected. That requires the permission of the Premier of Tasmania—he has to give his go-ahead—and it will threaten the highly endangered swamp eyebright. The peninsula is a cultural landscape because the French moved across it in a great number of surveys. They met up with the Indigenous people in the second year and there are extraordinarily detailed descriptions of their interrelationship with the Tasmanian Aboriginal people. It is a remarkable record of positive contact between those two totally different cultures. 
This small peninsula, with its intact sites, is extremely important. I would be happy to provide the minister with maps of the French expeditions and an indication of the complexity of the historical values of what we know about this peninsula. Frankly, there is no way. Gunns is logging thousands of hectares a year. To log this 10 hectares on this peninsula is way out of court. The minister and I have different approaches to many things, but I appeal to him to get some information about this issue and the way it is being handled. I think the Tasmanian government is being influenced by Gunns to make a very big mistake that will damage one of the most important small cultural landscapes in the nation. 
I reiterate: the garden was put there by the French. There is a second garden that has not been located yet, possibly in the woods there, that is the site of the first European burial in Tasmania. It is the site of a duel between a woman who secreted herself onto a French expedition dressed as a man, got sick of being slagged off for her effeminate ways, had a duel with one of the crew and was winged on the peninsula—a very famous woman in French history. She later fell in love with one of the crew on board. The two of them, sadly, succumbed to a tropical disease in Indonesia on the way home and died within a day of each other. So did D'Entrecasteaux himself. They were caught up with the revolution occurring in France. 
The historical collection relating to this peninsula, including the first collection of the floral emblems of both Tasmania and Victoria, is still intact in the drawers of conservatoriums in Paris and in Florence. The historical record of this contact is quite extraordinary. For Gunns to be going in to log the centre of this cultural landscape—I understand it will now be after Christmas because they simply do not have enough equipment to get there in the meantime—is just not on. But it is going to happen. We had a process for an independent assessment and suddenly—I think it is due to pressure from the Tasmanian government and/or the logging industry—the independent experts who are going to assess this peninsula for its cultural value are withdrawn.  
One of the most eminent archaeologists in Australia, Professor Mulvaney, and Dr Bickford from Sydney, also an eminent expert in the field, have been to the site and have said this is an extraordinarily important cultural landscape which must be protected. I would appeal to the minister to talk with the Minister for the Environment and Heritage about the tragic situation unfolding in Tasmania around this natural heritage site, and to move to protect the Commonwealth's interest in this site.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-14,"—That was an eloquent and passionate case put by Senator Brown. Obviously, I need better briefing on the matter. I will undertake to get that. The thrust of the advice I have would suggest that the nomination process is being carried out cooperatively between the groups that I mentioned, which include the Greens and the Tasmanian Heritage Council and, furthermore, that Gunns is cooperative with the process being undertaken. So Senator Brown's fears and suspicions may not be well founded. But I will find out the detail of the process that has been adopted, why it changed, and ensure that it will achieve the outcome of a proper assessment. Obviously, as a result of that objective assessment, decisions can be made as to the appropriate level of protection for the site in the future.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-14,"—I thought I would take this opportunity to recap events in this chamber leading up to this morning's debate and highlight Labor's view about this group of bills. Labor's amendments in this place yesterday—all of which were not successful—went to the heart of what we see as the fundamental problem with these bills: that is, the independence of the Heritage Commission and the ability for independent decisions to be made about what items and what places receive heritage protection. Obviously, with those amendments having failed, Labor does not now believe that this bill is supportable in any form, and I should flag that Labor intends to move a couple more amendments in this debate on related matters. I express my disappointment and concern that the government was not able to recognise Labor's view that the independence factor was our fundamental claim—our case for what could make this bill workable.
As I stated yesterday, many of my colleagues have stated that Labor recognise that there did need to be some change to heritage protection and our amendments created the opportunity to maintain that critical independence of the Heritage Commission as well as to make those upgrading and updating changes that we think were also constructive and positive. So it is disappointing that that has occurred. For the record, I would also make it clear that Labor will not be supporting the Democrat amendments, Senator Lees's or anyone else's as we proceed through this bill, but we will be taking the opportunity to comment and reflect on the issues at hand.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-14,"—We think the amendment can be further improved, and we have been party to seeking to further improve it. Later on in the list of amendments to be dealt with by the committee is a clause that is not dissimilar but which is a better clause. For example, one change is that our amendment makes clear that it has to be an adverse impact, which is not the case in Senator Allison's amendment. Whereas we are supportive of the general direction that she is advocating, we are not supportive of her amendment in the explicit terms in which it has been drafted.

I know the ALP had amendments that would have retained the name `commission'. In our view, this is not a substantive issue. We would be quite happy with it being called a commission or a council. At the end of the day we are interested in the protection of heritage, not specific names. I apologise for saying `commission' when I meant `council'.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-14,"—While the minister is collecting his thoughts to respond to that, another opening has been created for Labor to say that the name of the commission or council is actually not a point about semantics, as Senator Allison implied. As I said earlier, the fundamental issue here is: with the commission gone, their independence goes too. That change is far more than just a name. I highlighted that point—as, I think, Senator Allison well knows—because the whole decision making structure has moved from an independent commission to an advisory council, with the decisions about heritage listing residing with the minister's office. That is what has changed. It is far more than just a name change. I pointed out the use of the word `commission' as a symbol of the significance of that change—a change which, I say again, means that Labor is now unable to support what is before us as we proceed through the debate.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech

(2)	Schedule 1, page 17 (after line 20), after item 17, insert: 
17A Section 137 
Repeal the section, substitute:
137 Requirements for decisions about World Heritage
		In deciding whether or not to approve for the purposes of section 12 or 15A the taking of an action, and what conditions to attach to such an approval, the Minister must not act inconsistently with: 
	(a)	Australia's obligations under the World Heritage Convention; or
	(b)	the Australian World Heritage management principles; or
	(c)	a plan that has been prepared for the management of a declared World Heritage property under either section 316 or 321. 
(3)	Schedule 1, item 18, page 17 (lines 23 to 30), omit section 137A, substitute: 
137A Requirements for decisions about National Heritage places
		In deciding whether or not to approve for the purposes of section 15B or 15C the taking of an action, and what conditions to attach to such an approval, the Minister must not act inconsistently with: 
	(a)	the National Heritage management principles; or 
	(b)	an agreement made under Part 5 or Part 14 in relation to the protection and conservation of a National Heritage place; or 
	(c)	a plan that has been prepared for the management of a National Heritage place under either section 324S or 324X.
These amendments will help ensure consistency in the treatment of World Heritage and national heritage places under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Section 137A of this bill currently provides that, in deciding whether to approve an action under part 9 for the purposes of section 15B or 15C:
... the Minister must not act inconsistently with:
(a)	the National Heritage management principles; or
(b)	an agreement to which the Commonwealth is party in relation to a National Heritage place.
Our amendment to section 137A clarifies that the relevant agreements are conservation agreements made under part 14. The amendment also ensures that the minister must act consistently with the management plan made under the act for a national heritage place. Our amendments to section 137 make similar changes in relation to World Heritage properties. At present, section 137 only requires the minister to act consistently with Australia's obligations under the World Heritage convention. Our amendment requires that, in deciding whether to approve an action for the purposes of the World Heritage provisions in part 3—in other words, subsections 12 and 15A—the minister must not act inconsistently with Australia's obligations under the World Heritage convention management plan made under the act in relation to a World Heritage property or the Australian World Heritage management principles.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-14,"—It is probably timely to make a few observations about what seems to be going on here. I note the minister sought leave to cancel that last division, and I note Senator Allison's comments that this amendment was in fact identical to an amendment that we will be required to subsequently address, which has been brought forward under the name of Senator Lees. What we are participating in here is an exercise in potentially having a duplicate series of amendments before the chamber with the government not having quite worked out which ones of which batch they are going to support. This is really a comment in the interests of having the debate proceed in a cohesive way: perhaps the government should work those things out before the division bells are rung.

	(2)	Where a plan has not been made under section 316, the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency must take all reasonable steps to not act inconsistently with the Australian World Heritage management principles. 
This amendment provides that the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency must not contravene a management plan for a World Heritage property or authorise any other person to contravene such a plan. We think this is important since the act does not currently stop the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency authorising another person to contravene a plan. The amendment also inserts a new requirement that, where a plan has not been made for the management of a World Heritage property under the act, the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency must take all reasonable steps to not act inconsistently with the Australian World Heritage management principles.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-14,"—This could be the appropriate time for me to ask the minister about the impact from outside World Heritage areas on World Heritage areas and where it is in this legislation that the government is empowering the minister or the advisory council to ensure the protection of values of World Heritage areas from external threat. A very clear example of this is occurring at the moment with the logging of the Styx Valley, the Huon Valley, the Weld Valley and the Picton Valley in Tasmania, where eminent experts in the field have pointed out that, for example, the wilderness values of the World Heritage area are being infringed. Currently there is a major logging coupe under Snowy North, one of the peaks of the Snowy Range in Tasmania, where, by the way, this morning snow has fallen down to 300 metres right across the Styx Valley. There is no way anybody could say other than that that is damaging the World Heritage values of the Snowy Range itself and its wilderness values. 
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has called on the Australian government to protect the World Heritage area from this impact on the World Heritage values and particularly the degradation of the wilderness values of the World Heritage area by this creeping series of logging coupes, the danger of breakaway fires and feral animals and plants being brought in and, of course, the remoteness and intactness of the wilderness itself being compromised by logging right up to World Heritage boundaries. It is damaging the World Heritage value. It is, after all, one of the listings in Australia that is a wilderness listing as such; it is the Tasmanian World Heritage wilderness by name. 
I ask the minister what value the government puts on this wilderness quality in the Tasmanian World Heritage wilderness and why it has taken no action against this damage to the wilderness value for which the World Heritage area is named by these processes which are working away at the deterioration of the World Heritage values for which the area was nominated.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-14,"—This legislation does not alter Australia's obligations under the World Heritage convention. Under that convention Australia commits to the conservation of World Heritage listed assets, and that might be affected by actions outside the listed boundary. It has always been a contentious area, but in principle what I have said I think is correct. It is contentious in the sense that it would have to be proven that the actions outside are significantly and detrimentally affecting the World Heritage values inside. I think the same principles will apply in relation to an asset that is listed under the new national list, because it is listed for its values and the obligation is to conserve the values. I know that in relation to Tasmania there has been a long and at times contentious debate about the effect of certain logging actions in what I think used to be referred to as the shoulder areas or the margins of the World Heritage list. They are debates that the scientists have and assessments are made. I know it is an area that has been of interest to the World Heritage Commission in the past. The bottom line of what I am saying is that what was the position in the past, as I understand it, continues. Therefore, Senator Brown in his efforts in this area is at least not detrimentally affected by the changes that are proposed in the chamber today.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-14,"—I have been making out—and the minister is echoing that—that in very important aspects the changes being made in the chamber do not help. Why change from a situation which does not have teeth to a situation which does not have teeth? I will approach this more directly with the minister and ask if he can name one authority in the department, in the World Heritage Unit, in academia anywhere in the world and in the IUCN who has said that the encroachment to the borders of the World Heritage area by logging in Tasmania does not damage the wilderness values of World Heritage property.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-14,"—You are testing me now. As I recall it, at the time of the debate on the RFA legislation and the negotiation of the Tasmanian RFA, there were different points of view. I can remember the authorities of some on the other side of the argument, but my recollection is that the effect of the logging on such a huge area of wilderness nevertheless remained an issue in contention.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-14,"—I will give the minister the duration of this debate, which has a long while to go, to ask him, and in fact to challenge him, to come back and name an authority who says that the logging currently in the Styx, Huon and Weld valleys—and I mentioned earlier that there is logging right under Snowy North at the moment; cable logging is occurring in the Valley of the Giants—is not impacting on the wilderness values of the World Heritage area. Underlying this is the reality that commercial interests—in this case Gunns Ltd—override timeless heritage values for the nation as a whole. The whole point and the central thrust of the argument is that this legislation does not give teeth to protecting heritage areas against such prodigious commercial interests. Short-term commercial interests win out over the long-term national interest.
The minister is not going to come back and answer my challenge, because there is no answer to it. The fact is that the World Heritage values in Tasmania are being damaged today by those logging activities. It is not just the wilderness values; there are threats to other values. Indeed, the Styx Valley should be part of the World Heritage area, because it is of World Heritage value and adds to the stature of the World Heritage area. I am not going to get any good answer out of the government—nor would I if the opposition were sitting over there—on this central question of our nationhood, which is: where do we draw the line on the continual attrition of the natural, historic and cultural values of this nation which is occurring at a greater rate now than ever before? This is not some process where we are turning it around. It is occurring at a greater rate than ever before in history and this legislation does not have the teeth to stop it. It does not have the teeth to stop it because we are in a materialist age which says you must not get in the way of companies like Gunns making money at the expense of not just this generation of Australians but all generations to come.
The World Heritage values in Tasmania are being damaged; that is the totality of expert opinion. But this government is not doing anything about it and, under the regional forest agreement, the Prime Minister stamped his approval on the process—wide-eyed and knowingly. This legislation does not countermand that deliberate support for the frittering of extraordinarily important values, which is at the heart of the matter we are debating today. It is something that is going to have to be corrected. We cannot undo the damage being done now, but we have to put an end to this process down the line. This legislation is not going to do that.

	(a)	within 10 business days publish on the Internet the reasons for the decision; and 
	(b)	if the place was nominated by a person, or a person notified the Minister under subsection (1A)— within 10 business days advise the person of the decision and give written reasons for the decision; and
	(c)	give written reasons for the decision to anyone who asks for them.
These amendments all relate to emergency listing. Amendment (7) makes it explicit that any person can ask the minister to consider including a place, and its national heritage values, on the National Heritage List where that person believes any of those heritage values are under threat. Amendment (9) ensures that, if the minister places a site on the National Heritage List through the emergency listing provisions, he or she must within 10 business days publish a copy of the instrument on the Internet and any other place required by the regulations. The current provision does not impose a time limit on when an instrument must be published nor specify that it must be published on the Internet.  
Amendment (10) requires the minister to advise the person who nominated the site for emergency listing within 10 business days that the place has been included on the National Heritage List. Currently there is no time limit. Amendment (11) inserts new requirements that provide that, if the minister decides not to include a place on the National Heritage List under the emergency listing provisions, he or she must publish reasons for the decision on the Internet within 10 business days of the place having been nominated by the person; advise the person of the decision within 10 business days, giving written reasons for the decision; and give written reasons for the decision to anybody at all who asks for them.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-14,"—Again I am provoked to reflect that the series of amendments put forward by the Democrats is about drawing the minister to account for the decision making process and the notification of that process. And all of that is absolutely essential. I think Senator Allison would agree that every non-government party has had serious difficulty with the accountability of the coalition government. It is extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible in some cases, to make the ministers accountable for very much at all. The best way to deal with this issue is to ensure that the decision making process is not left up to the minister and the minister's office but retained with an independent commission—but that, of course, is not the case anymore.

The amendments further amend section 324J(4) by requiring that, in instances where a person nominates a place, the minister must advise that person of the decision and provide written reasons within 10 business days. This time constraint is a new one. The amendments also improve section 324J(7) which deals with the notification of the minister's decision to remove a place or its values from the National Heritage List where that place was included following an emergency listing nomination. Our amendments require that the minister must publish a copy of the instrument in the Gazette and the reasons for the decision on the Internet. He or she must give written reasons for the decisions to each person identified as an owner or an occupier of the place and to anyone who asks for them.

At the present time the Commonwealth and/or Commonwealth agencies are prohibited from contravening a management plan for a national heritage place in a Commonwealth area.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-14,"—Again, it is probably timely for Labor to make the observation that this dynamic we are seeing, with the minister contemplating whether or not the Democrats amendments are the same as Senator Lees's amendments, is really an exercise in the government working out whether they are going to do a deal with the Democrats or do a deal with Senator Lees. Because so many of the amendments not only are, I think, similar but also cover the same territory, the minister is now sitting back and just picking and choosing the ones that will meet the government's objectives as far as the deal that was being negotiated leading up to the debate today goes. So, again, from Labor's point of view, we are not supporting these amendments. What we are dealing with is the nature and extent of that deal between various parties on the crossbench—primarily, in this case, the Democrats and Senator Lees. It just makes for an interesting observation. Senator Bartlett was, obviously, quite right when he said, in his speech in the second reading debate yesterday, that the negotiations did not go too well. What we are observing now is, effectively, a negotiation occurring in the chamber.

	(c)	make recommendations for the improved protection of the National Heritage values of the place. 
	(3)	Before carrying out a review under subsection (1), the Minister must cause a notice to be published on the Internet and in a daily newspaper circulating in each State and self-governing Territory, inviting anyone to give the Minister comments within 20 business days on the effectiveness of the plan in protecting and conserving the National Heritage values of the place and whether the plan is consistent with the National Heritage management principles.  
This amendment relates to the contents of reviews of management plans. The current bill requires the minister to carry out a review of management plans for national heritage places in Commonwealth areas once every five years. This amendment specifies the particular issues that the review must include. These are: an assessment of whether the plan is consistent with the national heritage management principles, an assessment of whether the plan is effective in protecting and conserving the national heritage values of the place, and recommendations for the improved protection of the national heritage values of the relevant place. It also ensures that the minister must seek public comments on the review of the management plan.

This amendment creates an obligation to assist the minister and the Australian Heritage Council in monitoring national heritage values. Proposed section 324Z requires all Commonwealth agencies that own or control a place that may have one or more national heritage values to take all reasonable steps to assist the minister and the Australian Heritage Council in the identification and assessment of the place's national heritage values. This amendment extends the obligation of Commonwealth agencies so as to ensure that they are also required to assist the minister and the Australian Heritage Council to monitor the place's national heritage values.

This amendment is to do with Commonwealth compliance with management plans for Ramsar wetlands and the Australian Ramsar management principles. It is the same as our amendments (5) and (23) in that it only applies to management plans prepared in relation to Ramsar wetlands in Commonwealth areas; that is, it clarifies that the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency cannot authorise another person to contravene a management plan for a Ramsar wetland in a Commonwealth area. It also ensures that where a management plan has not been made in relation to a Ramsar wetland in a Commonwealth area the Commonwealth and Commonwealth agencies must take all reasonable steps to not act inconsistently with the Australian Ramsar management principles.

(37)	Schedule 1, item 32, page 47 (after line 12), at the end of section 341F, add:
	(6)	If the Minister decides not to include a place in the Commonwealth Heritage List under this section, the Minister must:
	(a)	within 10 business days publish on the Internet the reasons for the decision; and 
	(b)	if the place was nominated by a person, or a person notified the Minister under subsection (1A)— within 10 business days advise the person of the decision and give written reasons for the decision; and
	(c)	give written reasons for the decision to anyone who asks for them.
These amendments relate to the emergency listing provisions of the bill. Amendment (33) makes it explicit that any person can ask the minister to consider including a place and its Commonwealth heritage values on the Commonwealth Heritage List where that person believes any of those heritage values are under threat.
Amendments (34) and (35) ensure that, if the minister places a site on the Commonwealth Heritage List through the emergency listing provisions, he or she must within 10 business days publish a copy of the instrument on the Internet and any other place required by the regulations. The current provision does not impose a time limit on when an instrument must be published nor specify that it must be published on the Internet. Amendment (36) requires the minister to advise the person who nominated the site for emergency listing within 10 business days that the place has been included on the Commonwealth Heritage List. There is currently no time limit.
Amendment (37) inserts new requirements that provide that, if the minister decides not to include a place on the Commonwealth Heritage List under the emergency listing provisions, he or she must publish reasons for the decisions on the Internet within 10 business days of making a decision and, if the place was nominated by a person, advise the person of the decision within 10 business days and give them written reasons for that decision, and give written reasons for the decision to anyone who asks for them.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-14,"—I move Democrat amendment (39) on sheet 2990:
(39)	Schedule 1, item 32, page 47 (after line 29), after subsection 341G(2), insert: 
	(2A)	If the Australian Heritage Council does not complete the assessment of a place against the Commonwealth Heritage criteria within the period specified in paragraph (2)(a) or (b), the Minister may, by notice in writing, extend the period by up to 24 months if all reasonable efforts were made to complete the assessment within the relevant period.  
	(2B)	If the Australian Heritage Council does not complete the assessment of a place against the Commonwealth Heritage criteria by the time specified in the notice provided under subsection (2A), the Minister may, by notice in writing, provide an extension of up to 24 months if all reasonable efforts were made to complete the assessment within the period specified in the notice. 
	(2C)	If the Minister extends the period for the completion of an assessment of a place against the Commonwealth Heritage criteria under subsection (2A) or (2B), the Minister must within 10 business days:
	(a)	publish a notice including the reasons for the extension on the Internet; and
	(b)	if the place was nominated by a person or a person notified the Minister under subsection 341F(1A)—provide copies of the notice to the person. 
The bill currently provides that where the minister receives a nomination for inclusion of a place on the Commonwealth Heritage List he or she must pass the nomination on to the AHC and request it to assess whether the place meets any of the Commonwealth heritage criteria. These assessments must be completed within 12 months; however, the minister can extend the time frame for completion of the assessments indefinitely. The power to extend the period for completion of assessments indefinitely enables the minister and the AHC to postpone making decisions in relation to contentious nominations. It also gives the minister and the AHC the power to ignore certain public nominations and concentrate on themes and places of their choosing.
Amendments (38) and (39) limit the ability of the minister and the AHC to abuse the assessment process by imposing strict time limits on the preparation of assessments. Under these amendments, the AHC will have 12 months to complete an assessment. If the assessment is not completed at the end of 12 months, the minister may grant an extension of up to 24 months. However, the extension can only be granted if all reasonable efforts were made to complete the assessment within the initial 12-month period. If the assessment is still not completed at the end of the extended period, the minister may grant a second extension of up to 24 months. However, again, this extension may only be granted if all reasonable efforts have been made to complete the assessment within the specified period. These amendments also provide that, if the minister grants an extension of time, he or she must publish a copy of the notice and the reasons for the decision on the Internet. If a person nominates the place then that person must be provided with reasons for the decision.

	(d)	if the place was included on the List following a nomination made under section 341E, or a person notified the Minister under subsection 341F(1A)—advise the person who made the nomination, or who notified the Minister, within 10 business days, of the decision and give the person written reasons for the decision.
These amendments relate to the listing process and the decision about inclusion of a place on the Commonwealth Heritage List. Section 341 currently requires that, if the minister includes a place on the Commonwealth Heritage List, he or she must notify the owners and occupiers of the place and the person who nominated the place if the place was nominated. Amendment (40) inserts an additional requirement for the minister to publish a copy of a notice of decision and the reasons for the decision on the Internet. This amendment will ensure greater transparency in the listing process.
Other amendments require that, if the minister decides not to include a place on the Commonwealth Heritage List, he or she must publish details of the decision and the reasons for the decision on the Internet and provide a statement of reasons to the person who nominated the place within 10 business days. These are some of our general amendments on transparency in the listing process. Under the emergency listing provisions, the minister can include a place on the Commonwealth Heritage List if he or she believes the place may have one or more Commonwealth heritage values and any of those values are under threat. After including a place and its values on the list, under these provisions the minister must ask the AHC to assess whether the place does in fact have any Commonwealth heritage values. At the completion of the assessment, the minister must decide whether to keep the place and its heritage values on the Commonwealth Heritage List.
Further amendments require the minister to notify the owners and occupiers of the place and the person who nominated the place for inclusion on the list, including the person who notified the minister of the need to include a place on the Commonwealth Heritage List under the emergency listing provisions, and to provide them with reasons for the decision within 10 business days of the decision. As the bill currently stands, there is no requirement to provide this information to a person who notifies the minister of the need to include a place on the Commonwealth Heritage List under emergency listing provisions.

Amendment (52) includes time frames for endorsing management plans for Commonwealth heritage places.

It is an interesting observation for Labor that this whole series of amendments that we are going through is about accountability. The amendments are about the ministerial decision making process under the new regime being more accountable and transparent.

	(1)	The Commonwealth or a Com-monwealth agency must not contravene a plan made under section 341S, or authorise any other person to contravene such a plan.
	(2)	Where there is no plan under section 341S, the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency must take all reasonable steps to not act inconsistently with the Commonwealth Heritage management principles. 
(54)	Schedule 1, item 32, page 60 (lines 25 to 32), omit section 341X(2), substitute:

	(1)	At least once in every 5 year period after a plan for managing a Commonwealth Heritage place is made under section 341S, the Commonwealth agency must cause a review of the plan to be carried out. 
	(2)	The review must: 
	(a)	assess whether the plan is consistent with the Commonwealth Heritage management principles in force at the time; and 
	(b)	assess whether the plan is effective in protecting and conserving the Commonwealth Heritage values of the place. 
	(3)	Before carrying out a review under subsection (1), the Commonwealth agency concerned must cause a notice to be published on the Internet and in a daily newspaper circulating in each State and self-governing Territory inviting anyone to give the Commonwealth agency comments within 20 business days on the effectiveness of the plan in protecting and conserving the Commonwealth Heritage values of the place and whether the plan is consistent with the Commonwealth Heritage management principles. 
Again, these amendments relate to management plans. At present the Commonwealth and all Commonwealth agencies are prohibited from contravening a management plan for a Commonwealth heritage place, but there is uncertainty regarding the issue of whether the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency can authorise another person to contravene a management plan for these areas. Amendment (53) clarifies that the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency cannot authorise another person to contravene a management plan for a Commonwealth heritage place. Furthermore, it ensures that, where a management plan has not been made in relation to a Commonwealth heritage place, the Commonwealth and all Commonwealth agencies must take all reasonable steps to not acting inconsistently with the management principles.
The bill currently requires the minister to carry out a review of management plans every five years. Amendment (54) specifies the particular issues that the review must include. They are: an assessment of whether the plan is consistent with the national heritage management principles, assessment of whether the plan is effective in protecting and conserving national heritage values, and recommendations for the improved protection of national heritage values of the relevant place. It also ensures that the minister seeks public comment on the review of management plans.

	(5)	Where the Minister receives a copy of a report under paragraph (1)(c) that indicates that a place owned or leased by a Commonwealth agency may have one or more Commonwealth Heritage values, the Minister may, in consultation with relevant Commonwealth Ministers, use the report as a basis for nominations to the Commonwealth Heritage List. 
This relates to deemed nominations for inclusion on the Commonwealth Heritage List. Section 341ZB requires Commonwealth agencies to assess the Commonwealth heritage values of the places they own and to produce a register of the Commonwealth heritage values of the places they own. After completing the assessment and establishing the register, each Commonwealth agency must provide a report on the assessment and a copy of the register to the minister. This amendment allows the minister to treat the report as a nomination for the purposes of section 341E, and it merely reduces unnecessary duplication in paperwork.

This amendment relates to management of Commonwealth reserves. Item 33 of the bill amends section 367, which sets out what management plans for Commonwealth reserves must contain. In this regard, item 33 requires that where a Commonwealth reserve includes a national or Commonwealth heritage place, the plan must take account of the national or Commonwealth heritage management principles and address the matters that must be addressed in management plans for national and Commonwealth places. This amendment ensures that these plans must be consistent with the national or Commonwealth heritage management principles and clarifies that the management plan must address the matters prescribed in the regulations for the preparation of management plans.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-14,"—I move Democrat amendment (3) on sheet 3044:
(3)	Schedule 1, item 48, page 69 (lines 8 to 10), omit the definition of indigenous heritage value, substitute:
indigenous heritage valueof the place means the heritage value that is of significance to indigenous persons generally or a particular group of indigenous persons in accordance with their practices (including laws and cultural practices), observances, customs, traditions, beliefs or history.
This amendment amends the definition of `Indigenous heritage values' in the bill. It is required because the bill currently contains provisions that may result, we think, in inadequate statutory protection being provided to places of Indigenous heritage significance. Indigenous heritage values of a place are currently defined as:
... the heritage value of the place that is of particular significance to indigenous persons in accordance with their traditions.
The key problem is the potential for historic heritage values of Indigenous communities to be excluded from this definition. For example, archaeological surveys of an area known to have been occupied by a particular Indigenous community may reveal burial remains or evidence of human settlement— for instance: middens, stone tools et cetera. The Indigenous group or community may have no known tradition that places importance on the objects that are discovered. However, these objects clearly would have special historic significance to the Indigenous group or community over and above their significance to other Australians. 
Similarly, the customs and beliefs of an Indigenous community may have traditionally attributed significance to a place, but these customs and beliefs may no longer be acknowledged and observed by the Indigenous community. In these circumstances it is arguable that the heritage value of a place is not an Indigenous heritage value because the special significance of the place to the Indigenous community is not in accordance with their traditions, rather the place has historical, cultural significance that is unrelated to the customs and beliefs currently held by the community. This issue is also of concern to ATSIC and it is my understanding that a letter was sent to the minister from ATSIC in the last few days regarding this.
The problem with the definition of `Indigenous heritage values' arises in the context of the statutory protection that will be afforded to national heritage values under part 3 of the EPBC Act. Proposed subsections 15B(4), 15C(7) and 15C(8) prohibit a person from taking an action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the national heritage values of a national heritage place, to the extent that those national heritage values are Indigenous heritage values, without the approval of the minister under part 9. By way of example, subsection 15B(4) says:  
A person must not take an action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the National Heritage values, to the extent that they are indigenous heritage values, of a National Heritage place. 
This creates a two-stage process for establishing a breach of those provisions of sections 15B and C that relate to Indigenous heritage values. Firstly, it will be necessary to establish that the relevant action has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on national heritage values of a national heritage place. Secondly, the applicant or prosecutor will have to prove that the value threatened by the action is an Indigenous heritage value. Establishing the second element will require the applicant to prove that the relevant heritage value is of particular significance to Indigenous persons in accordance with their tradition. This ensures that those heritage values that are included in the National Heritage List on the basis of their social, cultural or spiritual importance to a particular cultural group or community will not be protected under subsections 15B(4), 15C(7), 15C(8) unless a link between the value and the traditions of the relevant group or community can be established. 
There is considerable uncertainty associated with what will constitute `traditions' for these purposes. This could result in many heritage values that are of great importance to contemporary Indigenous communities not being able to be protected under these provisions. It is also arguable that places that are only of historic significance to an Indigenous group or community as opposed to being of significance in accordance with their traditions will not be protected under these provisions. 
If it cannot be proven that the national heritage values of a national heritage place are of particular significance to Indigenous persons in accordance with their traditions, these values will only be able to be protected under the other provisions in sections 15B and C that rely on heads of power unrelated to Indigenous issues. In other words, it will be necessary to establish that the defendant's action was taken or will be taken for the purpose of trade or commerce et cetera. To ensure that Indigenous heritage is appropriately protected, the Democrats propose the following definition: 
... indigenous heritage value of the place means the heritage value that is of significance to indigenous persons generally or a particular group of indigenous persons in accordance with their practices (including laws and cultural practices), observances, customs, traditions, beliefs or history. 
It is our view that this is an improvement on the amendment which has been circulated by Senator Lees. Our amendment makes it clear that an Indigenous heritage value can be of significance to Indigenous persons generally and a particular group of Indigenous persons. Senator Lees's amendment only specifies Indigenous persons. It is necessary, we think, to specify that the values can apply to a particular group of Indigenous persons since there is the ambiguity that I mentioned as to what `Indigenous persons' means and whether this implies all Indigenous persons or can include a particular group of Indigenous persons. 
Our amendment also specifically includes reference to laws and cultural practices. If the minister does not intend to support this amendment, I would appreciate some response from him as to why this is the case. I also ask the minister to indicate whether the government intends to bring the ATSIHP bills—which were to some extent dealt with in the Senate some years ago—on for debate. To some extent the Democrats think it is important that that legislation is dealt with and that the EPBC Act is not replied upon for Indigenous cultural heritage. So I ask that some assurances be provided to the chamber that that legislation is forthcoming. If it is not, I would like some dates on which we can expect to see the legislation to be debated. If we cannot, then I urge the chamber to support this legislation because, as we know, many Indigenous sites are at risk or have been lost. If we cannot properly deal with heritage protection through the ATSIHP bills then I commend this amendment to the chamber as a way of making sure that we do it through this legislation. I ask the minister to respond to the matters that I have raised.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-14,"—The issue of Indigenous heritage is obviously very important but also very complex, and it is no secret that there are strongly held and differing views within the Indigenous community on the issue. Some would argue that it is inappropriate for Indigenous heritage to be within legislation of this type at all, but the view of the government is that it is necessary to have contemporary and effective legislation to protect sites of significance. As we have said, the current legislation is inadequate in that regard and the government is still intending to bring to the Senate new site protection legislation. There has been a long consultation on the detail of that legislation. That consultation is still not complete. I thought it was all but complete before the last election, but it did not quite reach finality. I am assured by the current minister that the process has continued and the bill will be brought to the parliament as soon as possible. I cannot give a specific date.
This legislation deals with something different in this area—Indigenous heritage that comes within the definition of `national significance'. When it does, it achieves the protection that is set out within the legislation. On the issue of the definition of Indigenous heritage, again there has been a range of views. I am told that, whilst ATSIC may have preferred an even wider definition, through Commissioner Dillon it is prepared to accept this definition. I gather that there has been a flow of correspondence on that issue. The definition that we will accept does not go as far as that proposed by Senator Allison, but we think in the circumstances, the type and purpose of the legislation we are dealing with today, it is appropriate. I think as time goes by, and as a result of the continuing debate on these complex issues and changes of view within the Indigenous community, there may be argument for further changes in this area, but we think that what we have put before the chamber today and the changes to the definition as foreshadowed in amendments that are to come later in this debate achieve the purpose of being able to protect Indigenous heritage of national significance.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech

Firstly, can the minister tell the committee whether the original intention was to bring forward that bill as part of this package—the minister mentioned that he thought negotiations would have been completed—and at what point were those plans changed, if that were the case? Secondly, can you provide the chamber with an assurance that that bill will be debated in the upcoming sittings of parliament?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-14,"—It was never intended to be part of this legislation. It was always being negotiated as a separate piece of legislation—although, to be fair, there are some within the Indigenous community who believe it should be. In other words, there are some within the Indigenous community who argue that no matter of Indigenous significance should be within this legislation and there are some who argue that every matter of Indigenous significance should, by definition, be a matter of national significance and therefore be included. That is why I say that this is a very complex subject. But the government always intended to treat the two matters separately, and that is still our intention. We think it is a better way to go, at least at this time in history.
As to the timing of the debate, I do not think I can say more than I have said. The government would wish to have the sites legislation debated as soon as possible.

Can the minister also indicate whether it is the government's current thinking that the bill would be re-presented in the Senate largely in the form which was agreed with Indigenous groups at the time, going back now at least three years?

It is in the interests of all parties if the major constituencies are brought on side. Therefore, if a piece of legislation can be produced that the Indigenous community broadly accepts, the mining community broadly accepts and the pastoral community broadly accepts, in wanting to protect Aboriginal sites in good spirit, which is the basis of this proposed legislation, it is a much better outcome. That is why the government has been prepared to undertake such a comprehensive and time-consuming negotiating process. It is still not quite complete, but I am advised that it is getting there.

The provisions within this bill certainly improve the situation for the protection of Indigenous sites. They do not go as far as they should across the board—even if it is not generally agreed—for a range of reasons. There is still deep concern about Indigenous heritage. I asked whether the minister could outline what `continuing' means. Does that mean everyone sitting with the draft bill on their desk or are there meetings taking place? If so, when was the last time the government met with ATSIC on this issue or with other groups who are keen on the bill? It is my understanding that Indigenous groups were happy with the bill as it was last drafted. So before we decide on this amendment it would be useful for us to know where that debate is at and what further consultation the minister expects to take place before we see that legislation back in the Senate.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-14,"—I ask Senator Hill, and through him the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, about the matter of Aboriginal heritage in Tasmania being compromised by the regional forest agreement process. It is my understanding that there are a number of protected Aboriginal heritage sites that are being compromised by clear-fell logging in Tasmania. These are sites that are listed by the relevant state authorities but which are nevertheless expected to be protected under the Forest Practices Code, which is the mechanism for implementing the regional forest agreement and a Commonwealth signed document. I ask the government whether it could furnish me and the chamber with a list of sites known to be in regional forest agreement areas which have been affected by logging since the regional forest agreement was signed. I refer to individual sites from the finding of implements to quarry sites, habitation sites, middens—all listed sites in Tasmania. I ask the government whether it could give the committee a complete list of which sites have been destroyed and what the parameters are for allowing clear-fell logging where such sites are destroyed. I also ask whether the government can furnish the chamber with a list of prospective sites that are now threatened with imminent destruction. Logging is moving into coupes anywhere in the state where there are Aboriginal sites and there has been a request that these Aboriginal sites not get in the way of that clear-fell logging. The logging is either occurring through and between the sites or is, in effect, bulldozing them into obliteration.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-14,"—I am a little puzzled by the question. I would have thought that if the sites were listed under the Tasmanian Aboriginal site protection legislation then they would be protected under that legislation. One of the difficulties in this area is that there is another part of the Indigenous community who either are uncomfortable with or believe it inappropriate to identify the location of sites and therefore, if the state is setting rules for forestry activities and is unaware of the location of Aboriginal heritage sites, it is very difficult for it to take those into account. I cannot see that the Commonwealth would have a list of prospective Indigenous sites as referred to by Senator Brown, but if there is a particular Indigenous site that he believes might be characterised as being of national heritage significance and which is being affected by the regional forest agreement then we would be prepared to have a look at that. There is always the possibility of a renegotiation of aspects of an agreement with the state where, following the agreement, new information comes to light—and new information relating to Indigenous heritage of significance is always treated very seriously.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-14,"—I would be satisfied if the minister could furnish the Senate with a list of sites in Tasmania that were listed but have been given ministerial exemption for their disturbance and/or destruction by the logging processes since the regional forest agreement came into being. There is no sensitivity about that. If there is an Aboriginal site and it has been disturbed or destroyed by logging, there is no longer a secret about it—certainly the people doing the logging know about it. This comes under the Commonwealth arrangement with the state. I am sure the minister knows about it but, if not, I would like the minister to find out about it and to come back to the chamber with that information.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-14,"—Again I am not quite sure what is being sought. If it is a site that is listed under the Tasmanian legislation then I do not see how a Commonwealth ministerial authority would apply. If it has been listed under the Commonwealth legislation—for example, it is on the Register of the National Estate—then those issues were addressed at the time of the signing of the RFA, and advice of the Australian Heritage Commission was taken into account in the signing of that agreement. That was our obligation under section 30 of the existing legislation. 
If Senator Brown is referring to an application to list under the Commonwealth legislation post the Tasmanian RFA, that is something that I could explore to see whether there have been either any new sites listed under the Commonwealth legislation or, alternatively, nominations under the Commonwealth legislation since the Tasmanian RFA. I therefore simply ask for some further clarification as to what is being sought. I am not trying to avoid what has been asked of me; I just do not think I can deliver in the terms that he has given.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-14,"—I can clarify: since the regional forest agreement, there has been quite extensive logging activity in Tasmania. As that occurs, on some occasions, the areas are studied to see if they have sites of significance, and sites of significance are discovered. I would think that it would be imperative that the Commonwealth is notified of those sites. This is a Commonwealth agreement which gives the state the responsibility for protecting not only natural but also cultural sites.
I think the system is not working. What I am asking the minister is whether he will find out from the state if there are sites which had been protected under Tasmanian legislation under the terms of the regional forest agreement which have then been removed from protection so that logging could proceed. I ask the minister to establish whether any of those sites were of national significance. In my view, Indigenous heritage is of national significance wherever it is, but the Commonwealth may have a different view on that. I want the minister to establish whether such a process—where sites are found, listed, notified and then authority is given for their destruction—is occurring and what the Commonwealth's arrangement is for ensuring that national heritage is not being destroyed through this process.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech

I think there needs to be a relationship whereby the Commonwealth is made aware of sites. I am very keen for him to establish whether that process is occurring in Tasmania and, if it needs to be checked, to ensure that sites which do have national significance are not being damaged or disposed of in this way. There is a process in Tasmania where ministerial exemption can be given, but that is not a public process as far as I am aware. Certainly there has not been any publicity about it, but I am very concerned about it.

324RA Transfer of World Heritage properties
	(1)	Upon commencement of this Subdivision, the Minister must: 
	(a)	include all places in Australia that are declared World Heritage properties on the date of commencement in the National Heritage List; and  
	(b)	include the World Heritage values of those places in the National Heritage List as the National Heritage values of those places. 
	(2)	Notwithstanding anything else in this Act, within 24 months of commencement of this Subdivision, the Minister must determine whether Australia's declared World Heritage properties at the time of commencement of this Act have additional National Heritage values to those included in the National Heritage List under subsection (1).
(2)	Schedule 1, item 32, page 58 (after line 14), after section 341R, insert:
341RA Transfer of World Heritage properties
	(1)	Upon commencement of this Subdivision, the Minister must: 
	(a)	include all places in Australia that are declared World Heritage properties on the date of commencement in the Commonwealth Heritage List; and 
	(b)	include the World Heritage values of those places in the Commonwealth Heritage List as the Commonwealth Heritage values of those places. 
	(2)	Notwithstanding anything else in this Act, within 24 months of commencement of this Subdivision, the Minister must determine whether Australia's declared World Heritage properties at the time of commencement of this Act have additional Commonwealth Heritage values to those included in the Commonwealth Heritage List under subsection (1).
These amendments make sure that on commencement of schedule 1 the minister must include all of Australia's World Heritage properties and their World Heritage values on the National Heritage List. It also requires the minister to determine whether the World Heritage properties contain any other national heritage values that should be included on the National Heritage List.
For some time we have been discussing this matter of World Heritage properties, and it seems to us to be very logical that these sites, which are of World Heritage status and value, should be immediately put on our National Heritage List. The government argues that there are some sites which would not be appropriate to put straight onto the list because there would be further consultation required. The most often cited case is the wet tropics in Queensland, where Indigenous groups would like to see that early listing amended in order to pick up some of the Indigenous values that are not currently on it. We would argue that there is still an opportunity to do that, that if these sites—and there are not that many of them—were to be put immediately on the National Heritage List, given the very extensive assessment process that has already taken place for them, this not only would be a good and important gesture but would indicate that the National Heritage List was just that. 
The government also argues that the list already has a very high level of protection, and that is true. But this is about whether or not we have a list which can truly be said to be of national significance and there are no more significant sites than those that are currently on World Heritage. We see no reason why this should not happen. The government argument goes along the lines that there needs to be more work. That is fine: put them on the list, do further work on them, make them a priority and then adjust that assessment as necessary. 
I urge the ALP to think about this one. If they vote against this, it is an indication that they do not see great value in World Heritage, that they do not see World Heritage sites in this country as of national significance. I know they are not supporting any of these amendments because it is not their old regime and it is not what they proposed to do with their amendments. However, it seems to me that this, for a whole range of reasons, is a very important thing to do and I strongly urge senators to think carefully about these amendments and support them.

We do not support the amendments, but it is not because we do not wish the World Heritage assets to be listed on the national list. We do believe that the process of assessment should take place and, further, that that can have incidental beneficial outcomes. I pick up the point that Senator Allison mentioned in relation to the Wet Tropics that is not listed on the World Heritage List for its indigenous values, which would be described as cultural values, yet there may well be a strong argument, and I have certainly heard the argument put, that those values are such that it would deserve listing under that heading on the Australian national list. Therefore, we think that it is better an assessment process take place, and that is why we have drafted the bill in the way we have.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-14,"—It must be extremely humiliating for the Democrats to go through this extended exercise in trying to salvage at least a little of their deal with the government on these bills. I think, on this matter like every other matter, Labor has made it very clear that we do not think these bills are salvageable. I know we are going to be taking an opportunity at some point in hopefully the not-too-distant future to put forward a couple of amendments of our own, but we have made our position clear. We think the crossbenchers had the opportunity to preserve the most important principle and the fundamental issue, and that was the independence. When push comes to shove in all these Democrat amendments that we are now considering—and the amendments that we will consider that have been foreshadowed by Senator Lees—what we are talking about is trying to now make a fundamentally flawed regime a little more accountable by tinkering with it around the edges. Labor is not engaging in the process. We are not supporting the amendments. We do not believe that the accountability regime will be effective once you give the minister the power to make these decisions.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-14,"—The problem there is that Labor has got its amendments coming down the line— the same as the Greens do. We do not know what the outcome is going to be in the vote at the end of today. It is going to be close. Anybody who has looked at some of the earlier amendments and the way the vote went there would know that. I think we are caught in the position where, yes, we do have flawed legislation—it is seriously flawed— but it is heading for potential enactment and, under those circumstances, we certainly have to do what we can to influence the quality of the legislation, to bring it from one out of 10 to two out of 10 if we can.
When it comes to the World Heritage properties, of course they should be listed on a National Heritage List. They are listed, and they should remain so. They should be made as safe as possible. The question is about the ability of this bill to protect anything. Here is a chance for the parliament to establish a baseline list of World Heritage properties to go onto the new National Heritage List, which comes out of the ashes of the burning and destruction of the list that had been drawn up with the nation's best expertise over the last 35 years. The parliament has a right to feed into that list. It has the right to establish it. Senator Allison is right: the World Heritage properties in Australia obviously qualify for the National Heritage List. As has been said so often, they are the cream of the cultural and natural heritage properties of this nation and from around the world. I agree with Senator Allison that Labor should support the amendments. Certainly the Greens will be.

This is perhaps the most important part of this debate. It concerns the way in which sites are listed, the powers of the minister and whether or not sites are listed for their heritage value or for some other purpose. These amendments set out the procedure for the inclusion of places and heritage values on the National and Commonwealth Heritage lists. In short, the standard process for both lists under our amendments is as follows. Anyone can make a nomination. The minister refers the nomination to the AHC for assessment of whether the place has any national or Commonwealth heritage values; in other words, whether it meets any of the listing criteria. The AHC carries out its assessment. In making the assessment the AHC must seek public comments on the nomination. The AHC then provides its assessment to the minister. If the AHC finds that the place has no national or Commonwealth heritage values, and the minister agrees with the assessment, then the minister cannot list the place.
If the AHC finds that the place has one or more national or Commonwealth heritage values, the minister has three options: to include the place and all its national or Commonwealth heritage values, to not include the place on non-heritage grounds, or to include the place and only some of its national or Commonwealth heritage values on non-heritage grounds. If the council finds that a place has one or more national or Commonwealth heritage values, and the minister decides not to include the place or one or more of its relevant heritage values on the National or Commonwealth Heritage List—in other words, makes a decision not to include on non-heritage grounds—the minister is required to undertake additional public consultation to give all stakeholders an opportunity to comment on the non-heritage matters that purport to justify the exclusion of the place or heritage values from the list.
In undertaking this additional consultation, the minister is required to publish a copy of the AHC's assessment and the reasons for his or her proposed decision not to include the place or some of its heritage values on the National or Commonwealth Heritage List. The minister can undertake additional public consultation in any of the other situations and, at the completion of the additional public consultation process, the minister must decide whether or not to include the place and its heritage values on the list. Our amendments include an equivalent process for the emergency listing procedure. I will provide detailed comments on each of our amendments before completing this part of the debate.
The minister has, in the earlier part of this debate, complained about Democrat lack of willingness to negotiate on this legislation, or lack of willingness to make our decision or come to agreement with the government— whichever way you see this. For us this has always been one of the most important issues to get right. From memory, we have put up four different models to the government for how listing might be more accountable— how listing might be truly said to be based more on heritage values and less on political, socioeconomic and other considerations; in other words, to be sure that we have a list that is about heritage values first and foremost. I make no apologies for attempting to do this because, as I said, I regard this as the most important aspect of the bill. 
Our first amendment simply amends the outline of the division to note that the minister may undertake additional consultation. It is straightforward. The second amendment requires public consultation during the AHC assessment process. In the present bill the AHC is not required to carry out public consultation when assessing a place; it is only required to notify stakeholders who have a direct interest in the place—that is, owners, occupiers and Indigenous groups. Public consultation is carried out after the AHC has completed its assessment and is only required where the AHC finds that the place has one or more national or Commonwealth heritage values. This amendment requires the council to undertake public consultation when carrying out an assessment, and it must consider the comments received in making the assessment and give a copy of those comments to the minister with that assessment.
Amendments (3) to (8) are also about public consultation. They insert an additional public consultation process where the AHC finds that a place has one or more national heritage values and the minister proposes not to include the place or not to include all of its national heritage values on the list. The minister must then undertake additional consultation, and we think that that is reasonable. The minister must publish reasons for the proposed decision and copies of the AHC assessment. The intention is to ensure that, if the minister proposes not to include a place on the National Heritage List on non-heritage grounds—in other words, the miners do not like or there are socioeconomic reasons against doing it—the reasons are subject to public scrutiny. We think that this is the very least that ought to happen. In other words, we have an assessment which says `This has national heritage values' and we have a recommendation from the council that this site be listed. We think it is important that, if the minister does not want to do so, he or she is required to explain themselves.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-08-14,"—The Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 before the chamber today amends three separate acts to make various changes to aviation policy. The changes will facilitate the ongoing review of civil aviation regulations and provide for the simplification and the international harmonisation of Australia's civil aviation regulatory regime. Specifically, the changes will modify the act to amend aircraft maintenance related definitions and terminology. The new definitions of state aircraft and Australian aircraft will align with international law and practice. The bill also makes minor corrections to provisions relating to goods seized as part of an investigation.
The bill amends the Airports Act 1996 to repeal section 192. This change will remove the requirement for, and the application of, ministerial determinations under that act. This goes to airport services that would otherwise be subject to declaration provision under part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974. These determinations are by necessity in general terms and subject to ACCC scrutiny. The Productivity Commission found that this section provides no tangible benefit to stakeholders. There was, therefore, no compelling case to keep the process and it declared all airports subject to the generic access provisions of the Trade Practices Act. 
The amendments related to article 83bis agreements are significant. The bill transfers from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the function to enter into article 83bis agreements with the national airworthiness authorities of other countries. Under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago 1944, best known as the Chicago Convention, a party state is generally responsible for the safety regulation of aircraft on that state's register irrespective of where the aircraft is in the world. Some obvious difficulties in administering safety regulations arise when an aircraft registered in one country is operated in another for a substantial period. Article 83bis is a relatively recent addition to the Chicago Convention. It correctly enables the transfer of safety regulatory functions from the state of registration of an aircraft to the state in which the aircraft is to operate. Naturally, this can only occur with the agreement of both states. ICAO considers that such agreements should be made between the relevant national airworthiness authorities as they are administrative instruments of less than treaty status.
Australia ratified article 83bis on 2 December 1994 after amending the Civil Aviation Act by the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 to give effect to the convention. This bill ensures that CASA will have the functions to enter into article 83bis agreements on behalf of Australia. Public scrutiny and transparency of the process are ensured because it is a requirement that CASA publish in the Gazette particulars of an article 83bis agreement or an amendment to such an agreement. There will also be detailed administrative and technical provisions concerning the implementation of article 83bis agreements in the regulations.
I want to pick up on a couple of points made in the other place by my colleague the shadow minister Mr Ferguson. Firstly, and in particular, Mr Anderson continues to show more interest in matters other than his portfolio interests and therefore not particularly in the area of his responsibilities. Obviously, he is shortly to leave this parliament but I encourage him in the short time he has left to focus on his day job. He claims to be an expert on Telstra and on water reform but when it comes to his own portfolio you hardly hear from him. You hardly hear any comments from him on aviation but you never hear from him on the shipping industry. You hardly hear any comments from him on his so-called future land transport plan, which, frankly, everyone knows is a shambles. Finally, there are air services amendments from the government to this legislation. My advice from Mr Ferguson is that we will support those amendments to be moved by the government today and we will support the bill as amended.",SENATE,<title>CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2003-08-14,"—The Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 is an omnibus bill which will make amendments to three different acts. It harmonises definitions, terms and concepts used in the acts, it alters the definition of Australian aircraft, it alters the definition of state aircraft and it delegates various functions to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It makes minor corrections to provisions, it makes consequential amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920, it repeals a redundant provision in the Airports Act 1996 and it amends the Air Services Act 1995. There are government amendments which I will speak to in the committee stage of the bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-08-14,"—The purpose of the Export Control Amendment Bill 2003 is to amend the Export Control Act 1982 to, firstly, redraft part of section 11Q(5) as a consequence of the repeal of section 16 of the act by the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Act 2000 and, secondly, amend section 23 to allow certificates issued in relation to goods for export to describe goods that originate from Christmas Island or Cocos Island as goods from those territories. It is interesting that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry should introduce a bill that effectively deals with truth in labelling. Australia's access to international markets is reliant on our reputation as being free from pests and diseases that exist in the rest of the world. Yet under this minister we have seen that reputation eroded.
During the May estimates hearings this year the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service admitted that drums of Chinese honey have been transiting through Australia for the purpose of relabelling the products as being of Australian origin. They are then reshipped to our markets in the United States. The honey may have been contaminated with chloramphenicol, which AQIS says causes the disease aplastic anaemia in some susceptible individuals. AQIS could not confirm the number of shipments that had transited through Australia. The Senate estimates committee also heard that some international honey has been labelled `product of Australia' and shipped to third countries without even landing on our shores. 
This honey laundering is occurring on an unknown scale. According to an AQIS official, agriculture minister Warren Truss had in May this year known about the problem for up to 12 months—that is, in May he had been in possession of information about it for 12 months. The committee heard that, even so, Australia still has no arrangements in place with customers of genuine Australian honey to identify the real product. According to the minister's department, this is a problem for importing countries. But Labor disagrees. This scam has the potential to do serious damage to the reputation of Australian honey producers.
This honey laundering scam revealed by Labor is not the first such scam. Labor also revealed in July last year that meat from other countries is being sold in the international marketplace under forged Australian health certificates. In response to a question on notice, Mr Truss confirmed that in the 18 months to July 2002 some 233 metric tonnes of meat from unknown sources was sold overseas and passed off as coming from Australia. This illicit trade and the associated risk of disease or chemical contamination to our customers could have cost Australian rural industries billions in lost exports. For example, if a shipment of beef contaminated with mad cow disease were to find its way to the US or Japan under forged documentation, it could cast doubts over the entire system of certifying Australian export meat. That could close those and other markets to Australian products. Thanks to Labor, Mr Truss appears to have addressed the problem of beef export health certificates, but we will of course be keeping an eye on this matter continually. Mr Truss is yet to act on ensuring the integrity of export honey marked `product of Australia', and every day he delays he is damaging the international reputation of not only Australian honey but our entire export certification process for agricultural and food products.
Whilst on the subject of exports and the government's mismanagement in this area, I must point out the plight of the Tasmanian apple industry. I have had a number of representations from Mr Gary Groombridge talking about the difficulties in making a living as an apple producer and the fact that India has real potential as a market for Tasmanian apples. However, the Indian government places heavy import tariffs on our apples. I wrote to Minister Vaile to ask what he had been doing to have these trade restrictive barriers reduced. To his credit, Mr Vaile in his response advised me that he was aware of the problem and had raised the issue with his Indian counterpart during a trip to India in February this year.
I must say that, like the Howard government's lacklustre efforts on the Japanese beef `snapback' tariff, Mr Vaile's efforts have clearly been too little and too late, and India maintains its tariff position on the importation of Tasmanian apples. I think Minister Vaile's efforts in this regard leave a little to be desired, and I will continue on behalf of Tasmanian apple growers to monitor Mr Vaile's performance on this issue. As I said earlier, market access for our agricultural and food produce depends on our relative disease-free status and the fact that, when people overseas buy Australian, they know—or at least they did know—what they are getting. The inability of Mr Truss to manage this key part of his portfolio risks billions in export income—income to farmers and income to workers who work in the sector and also in the processed food sector—and risks the jobs of thousands of Australians. As this amendment seeks to preserve trade benefits that arise from Australia's unique pest and disease status—something that Labor at least takes seriously—we will support this legislation.

Is the minister aware of a report in the Financial Review last week about industry fears that the R&D tax concession would be cut as a result of a survey on its effectiveness, conducted by AusIndustry? Can the minister tell us who initiated this survey? Does the government have any plans to either restrict access to the R&D tax concession scheme or close down the scheme altogether? Given that the latest OECD figures place Australia's business expenditure on R&D 17th out of the 29 nations surveyed, will the minister state categorically that this government will not abolish nor seek to restrict access to the R&D tax concession?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Research and Development: Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,14,1,question

Given that the minister did not address the substance of the question, why is this government giving companies less than two weeks to complete very detailed surveys at the business end of the tax year reporting period?

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2003-08-14,"—I thank Senator George Campbell for his very timely question. I draw to the Senate's attention a survey released last week that showed that R&D expenditure by business in this country is now at a record level. It has gone up 13 per cent, to $5.546 billion. Under this government we are seeing the highest expenditure on R&D in the history of this country. It is now higher than it was when the figures were artificially inflated by the rort of syndication in 1995-96. We have the highest number of companies engaged in the R&D tax concession. We have the highest number of people working in R&D that we have ever had in the history of this country. These tremendous results are a consequence of the focus that this government has put on R&D by virtue of the first ever national innovation summit, which it held in 2001, and the release of the biggest ever support package for innovation in this country, Backing Australia's Ability—a $3 billion commitment to innovation that included not only a reaffirmation of the government's commitment to the 125 per cent tax concession but the introduction for the first time ever of a 175 per cent tax concession for additional R&D and a long-term commitment to the R&D Start program of around $160 million of grants for R&D in this country. 
This government has a very proud record in assisting business to engage in the critical activity of investing in R&D. We have now seen the fruits of that effort from the figures that I just quoted from the ABS survey released last week, which show record expenditure. Indeed, if there were any concern that business might have, it would be on the issue of the ALP ever getting into government. The ALP have made it quite clear that they will adopt a very antibusiness strategy in everything that they do and that they will fleece business to pay for their unaffordable promises in education and health. They announced last week that, to pay for their education package, they will attack the mining industry and foreign workers who want to work in Australia. It is clear from statements made by the now shadow Treasurer, Mr Latham, that the R&D tax concession will also be in the firing line. He said, not that long ago, that the R&D tax concession is not a good outlay, it is not a good policy and it is not an efficient strategy. So business, I think understandably, is now very concerned about any prospect of the ALP getting into government, given that it is clear they will fleece business to pay for their extravagant promises. The shadow Treasurer has made it quite clear that business should have no confidence whatsoever that the R&D tax concession—a critical part of our innovation commitment—would survive the advent of an ALP government.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Research and Development: Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,14,1,answer

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of all the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today.
I would like to turn my attention to the response by the minister for sport in relation to a question I asked about Shane Warne. It took a supplementary question to get the minister to say that he thought that the advice on the Shane Warne circumstance would be that he would not be able to play. But that was not without a major qualification either—that is, taking advice and possibly a review of Cricket Australia's antidoping policy. This is nothing more than a farcical squib on behalf of the minister because we know that Cricket Australia's drugs policy is modelled on the Australian Sports Commission's policy. Given that Cricket Australia thought that their policy covered all matches, by default the minister is saying that the Australian Sports Commission policy somehow needs review. It is quite a debacle when the minister cannot be definitive about his government's own drugs policy. The answer of course was no, but the minister could not quite bring himself to say that in his response to my question.
It is worth going back through these circumstances to understand what the facts are. In February this year, Shane Warne was given a 12-month ban from playing cricket for testing positive to taking a banned substance. Cricket Australia should be commended for having banned Shane Warne from playing in all cricket matches until February 2004. They believed that this action was in accordance with their antidoping policy. However, following a challenge by the Australian Cricketers Association, it was found that Cricket Australia does not have the ability under its current antidoping policy to ban cricketers from playing in charity matches and testimonials.
This ruling was detrimental to Australia's credibility in the fight against drugs in sport. Athletes must know that, if they are found to be in breach of antidoping policies, they will attract a ban that is enforceable. This also serves to vindicate naturally talented athletes who excel in their sports without the aid of drugs. However, it has become very obvious that the Howard government is not serious— or, indeed, consistent—in its application of its own Tough on Drugs in Sport policy. If this government were serious, it would act now to ensure that all national sporting organisations are beginning to implement the world antidoping code, to which this government is a signatory—and I do acknowledge the work that has taken place on that code.
The fact is that this government has proven that it is not willing to enforce even its own policy at this most basic level. This has never been demonstrated more clearly than when it was revealed that the sport of cycling had failed to comply with antidoping requirements within the specified time frame, and the Australian Sports Commission and the minister failed to apply any sanction to the sport of cycling. In fact, despite the government rhetoric, it was only at the recent estimates last May that the government and the Australian Sports Commission required national sporting organisations to conform to an antidoping assessment process at all. Prior to that, it did not happen. Even once they had got around to making sports accountable for fighting drugs in sport, those requirements were not enforced. Instead, in the case of cycling, they effectively fulfilled their requirements at their leisure, and certainly not within the specified time frames. 
I think that this government must better support the independent work of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, who are constantly undermined by Sports Commission board member Alan Jones. Because he is the deputy chair of the Sports Commission, it makes it particularly pertinent that the government allows that to occur without providing the reprimand that is so obviously necessary. I do not think that the Howard government is doing enough to support national sporting organisations who are doing the right thing in their implementation and their working towards the World Anti-Doping Association code. I think that the implementation of the code would ensure that athletes in breach of the antidoping policy receive consistent and equitable treatment and that, when they are appropriately banned from participating in any sporting event, that sticks regardless of its nature. As signatories to the WADA code, the coalition must enforce its adoption by all national sporting organisations, to ensure compliance by Athens 2004. I call on the Howard government once again to abide by its Tough on Drugs in Sport policy. It is a policy that Labor, obviously, began with the establishment of ASDA, and it should support those—(Time expired.)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2003-08-14,"—I rise to respond to some of the points that Senator Lundy made. Senator Lundy has a chronic problem in not listening to answers. I think that that is effectively demonstrated not only by her responses today but also, I must say, by her performance at Senate estimates and elsewhere. Senator Lundy has a peculiar capacity to not actually listen to what people say. In relation to the Shane Warne issue I think that the facts are well known. I am on record—and I continue to go on record—as saying that I believe Australia should maintain the highest standards in antidoping policy. I strongly support the work of ASDA and the ASC to ensure that this occurs.
Australia took a lead role in the negotiation of the WADA code. The expertise of Australians was often called on. Senator Lundy, that code will now be implemented. Work is being done to ensure that. There is no government keener than this government to ensure that there is a level playing field throughout the sporting world in relation to the antidoping code. I can assure Senator Lundy and the Senate that the Australian government is pursuing the implementation of this code with vigour, and I believe that we will again show the rest of the world what can be achieved in this country. But, Senator Lundy, it is not adopted overnight; there is a lot of work to be done. That work is in train and will continue. That is the point that I make.
For you to get up, Senator Lundy, and attempt to grandstand on this is a bit of a pity. We would have wanted you to play a more constructive role in sport. I think that Senator Lundy is famed for her sporting policy over the last 12 months. When we asked what Labor's sporting policy was it seemed that it was, essentially, to drive a four-lane highway through the front yard of the Australian Institute of Sport. Senator Lundy supported that crazy policy of the ACT government, which would have had a very detrimental effect on the Australian Institute of Sport. I criticised her at the time for that. At the end of the day, it was clear that the position that this government adopted was the one that won out, and it protected one of the great jewels in Canberra. One of the things that Senator Lundy must always wear when she is in the sport portfolio is that, when she was needed to support a sensible policy to persuade the ACT government, she was leading the charge supporting a policy which, I believe, would have had a very serious effect on the Australian Institute of Sport. 
Getting back to the case of Shane Warne and the issues in relation to the charity match and the training, as Senator Lundy pointed out, Cricket Australia was very concerned about the charity match and in fact took action. There was a case with an arbitrator and, at that stage of the game, the fact of the matter is that the policy of Cricket Australia was not upheld by the arbitrator. We will see how this develops in the future. But I think it is true that, when you look at what Australians expect, you see that they expect the highest standards in this area. They expect the highest standards, and this government expects the highest standards. That is why, Senator Lundy, a great deal of my work and my time in the portfolio has been to ensure that we work with international organisations to ensure the adoption of a world antidoping code. This government should take great pride in that and, particularly, in the work of the Australians who are involved.
Senator Lundy, the fact is that now we are going to implement the code. That is what the policy is. It is no good for you to stand up and pontificate about this. Your government talked a lot in so many areas but it did not take the required action. This government has taken a real lead, and I pay tribute to Jackie Kelly and Senator Amanda Vanstone for the work that they did before the 2000 Olympic Games and I pay tribute to the people in ASDA and people in the Sports Commission.

"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2003-08-14,"—I wish to take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health and Ageing today relating to mental illness. One in five Australians suffering from a mental illness cannot afford to keep paying rising doctors fees but are excluded from private health insurance. How is a person suffering from mental illness expected to improve their condition when this government, through its changes to Medicare announced in the budget, will make visiting a doctor more expensive? As the number of doctors who are bulk-billing has continued to drop it becomes even more expensive. Doctors have admitted that, as a result of the government's Medicare initiatives, they will need to raise their fees to cover their costs.
People with mental illnesses already face barriers to seeking treatment. They often do not want others to know they are psychologically unwell. Also, they fear that the treatments may be worse than their illness and that Medicare systems may not respond appropriately. We also know that men and older people are particularly unlikely to take themselves to a doctor for psychological help. Now they face another barrier—an unnecessary barrier, a mean barrier—and that is the cost of treatment. If you cannot afford to see your doctor it is simple: you just do not go. You do not have a choice. For people needing to have their medication supervised and their condition monitored this can have disastrous and costly effects both for the person, for our health care system and, I also add, for the people caring for them.
A doctor giving evidence to the Senate poverty inquiry in Brisbane said:
The ability of those with mental illness to access a bulk-billing doctor is critical to their long-term wellbeing. Without such access they miss their treatments and become even more marginalised in society.
This is an illness that can be managed yet if it goes without treatment it is likely the person will end up in the acute care section of our public system or killing themselves—as the statisticians tell us, in 2001, 2,454 people killed themselves and this included 339 young persons between the ages of 15 and 24. The most common mental health problem that leads to suicide is depression. Without access to health care and bulk-billing these numbers will possibly increase. 
Being a member of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiring into poverty, I have heard numerous times of the links between mental illness and poverty. In Western Australia we heard how a lady was forced to live for 2½ years on negative $12 a week before food. This was because she paid for her own private health insurance and had to pay for other counselling services on top of that. She said that her private health insurer fought tooth and nail not to provide many of the services she needed because of her condition. In describing how she felt she said there was nobody there for her. To get by she resorted to shoplifting from the supermarkets and baking cakes to sell door to door.
This government has pushed private health insurance. People with mental illnesses who have taken up private insurance despite their ominous financial situation are finding that the very service they are paying for is failing them. Many of the health services they need, such as counselling, their private health insurer will not cover. As the Senate poverty inquiry heard, a severely disturbed individual is very rarely admitted to a private hospital because of the Mental Health Act and the issues of restraint and control. Therefore, for people with a significant mental illness, private health insurance will not guarantee quicker or more suitable health care. The Mental Health Council of Australia and beyondblue, the national depression initiative, have called for an immediate resolution of the discriminatory insurance practices. They have been informed of insurance companies declining insurance policies to people—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2003-08-14,"—I wish to take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs today relating to conditions of service of ADF and AFP personnel in the Solomon Islands. Our personnel are part of the cooperative intervention in the Solomon Islands, which at this time is going very well—let us hope it continues to do that—along with troops from Fiji, Tonga, New Zealand and the PNG. This operational allowance is based on an assessment of the security environment. That applies whether our troops are involved in East Timor, Afghanistan, the war against terror, the build up to the war in Iraq, the multinational interception force, the Iraq war itself or now, of course, the Solomons. In my experience the allowance ranges from $200 per day to what has been assessed as appropriate in this particular ADF exercise, which is $55 per day. It is based on an assessment of the security environment in the Solomons and the tasks and mission that the ADF personnel deployed in the operation will expect to meet. Despite a level of risk, it is a non-warlike declaration of service and that is appropriate for this operation. As a consequence, the conditions of service provided to ADF members for this operation include: the tax-free deployment allowance of $55.50 per day inside the specified area; comprehensive coverage for injury under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act; and additional recreation leave at a rate of 10 days per annum on a pro rata basis.
I am advised that there is a possibility that their earnings will be tax-free as well, which applies under a general provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act which exempts certain foreign earnings where a member has engaged in foreign employment for a continuous period of not less than 91 days. There is a fair expectation that some of our ADF people will serve for longer than 91 days. I make the point to the Senate that this provision is not an ADF condition of service. It is something that is very appropriate for those who are risking their lives on our behalf, and it is an additional benefit that they have. In addition, members will continue to receive their normal salary and environmental allowances. 
ADF members deployed for six months or more are eligible for the additional following benefits: embarkation and disembarkation leave and travel; removal of dependants to extended family support—and I remember, Mr Deputy President, that when you and I were on the inquiry into conditions of service it came up that it was important for people who are left at home with a young family to have family support, and the ADF extends that to military families and so they should— removal of personal effects to store; and relief for out of country assistance to travel back to Australia.
We take our responsibility to our personnel overseas very seriously. I do not think there is anybody who does not believe that they should be looked after in their absence, that their families should be looked after in their absence and if something untoward might happen to them. The government are going through the review process to improve the range of benefits that might be available to our ADF personnel overseas. We take that very seriously. I think there is bipartisan support for anything that we do for our ADF personnel. It is important because they are on an important mission. All missions are important, but this mission is particularly important.
We have 1,500 ADF personnel in the Solomons. We have a show of force that has been very effective, I think, in bringing the war lords and dissident groups to the table, and certainly in making them cooperative. I am delighted that Harold Keke has seen the light and decided to hand himself in. When I was in the Solomons a short period ago— about six weeks ago—they were very worried about the murderous activities of Harold Keke down on the Weather Coast. It is pleasing to see that he has seen the light and decided to hand himself in. I suspect he would not have done so if it had not been for the show of force of the ADF, along with our allies—Fiji, Tonga, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea have also sent troops to support us.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-08-14,"—I wish to take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs today, relating to trafficking in the sex industry. Trafficking in the sex industry is a growing global trade. There have been significant increases in the trafficking of sexual labour, particularly the use of women for the commercial sex industry. At some stage in this country we will realise that crimes against women need to be taken seriously and treated harshly. There has to come a time in this country when we are as tough on the criminal use of women's sexuality as we are on drugs. If we had a policy that addressed the use of women in the sex industry, particularly in trafficking for the sex industry, which was as tough as our stance on drugs then perhaps some of these women would not find themselves in the situation they are currently in. Until we take it seriously and until we start to deal with these crimes harshly, we still will have a major problem before us.
In my question to Senator Ellison I asked about the trafficking of two Thai women for the sex industry back in November. Apart from him failing to tell us what DIMIA were doing about this or what the Australian Federal Police were doing about this in cooperation with the New South Wales Police, he mentioned that these women had left the country voluntarily. I do not believe for one instant that voluntary departure or willingness to even come to this country in the first place is a reason for not doing something about it. The consent of these women to come to this country—when they do not realise what they are coming to and how their bodies are going to be used—is not a defence of your system or a reason to do nothing about it. The fact that they may well have left their country voluntarily and come here voluntarily does not mean that you simply step back and decide that your current system needs to be defended. It is a system that does very little to catch people involved in trafficking and to protect women who are being used in this way. 
There is a conflict between the way the government has failed to deal with trafficking in the sex industry and its current immigration laws. This government has its priorities in immigration laws. We know it is going through this whole juxtaposition of allowing these women who are here illegally to be detained and retained in this country and afforded the protection they need while they are used to give evidence against any traffickers that may or may not have been caught. In this country there has not been one prosecution for this crime. In this day and age, current laws and policies are completely out of step with the internationally agreed standards; in fact, they are well behind and are seriously inadequate to deal with this growing global industry and crime.
We do not have a comprehensive national approach to this. We do not look at a policy that is designed to punish the traffickers and at the same time protect the victims. We have a government that does very little to look after the physical, psychological or social recovery of these women because, pitted against their current immigration policy— which is to remove illegal people from this country as quickly as possible, deport them as quickly as possible—there is a conflict in sending those people back home as this government has done.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-08-14,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The tabling of this report has occurred quite a long time after the passage of the Timor Sea Treaty legislation. The delay in this response is quite indicative of the way the government has conducted itself throughout the Timor Sea Treaty negotiations. Throughout this process, the Australian Democrats have voiced our concerns regarding the fairness of the treaty and the way in which it was negotiated. It was on the basis of these concerns that we were unable to support the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Our minority report made several recommendations, one of which was that the treaty be renegotiated in order to address the very serious issues raised by a number of people in their submissions to the committee. But the government in its response that has just been tabled has not even bothered to respond to our recommendations which, we would remind the government, are an official part of the committee's report. I hope the government will, if need be, table a supplementary response in order to deal with those recommendations. I acknowledge, though, that it may be far too late.
The Democrats believe that it is in Australia's national interest for East Timor—our newest neighbour—to develop into a strong, prosperous and democratic nation with proper regard for the rule of law. At a time when Australia has just made a very substantial contribution and commitment to assist the Solomon Islands in order to prevent it from becoming a permanently failed state, it is important that we take into account the warnings to the inquiry by the East Timor Institute for Reconstruction Monitoring and Analysis, which said that without economic security and without the ability to rely on the rule of law both within East Timor and internationally, East Timor also faces the serious risk of becoming a `failed state'.
It is neither in the interests of East Timor nor Australia for East Timor to maintain its financial dependence on other countries and regress to a situation similar to what we have seen occur in the Solomon Islands. Members of the government have spoken a lot in recent weeks about the importance of Australia providing leadership in our region, which is something the Australian Democrats agree with. In his ministerial statement to the Senate earlier this week, the Minister for Defence said:
If Australia wants security, we need to do all that we can to ensure that our region, our neighbourhood, is stable—that governance is strong and the rule of law is just.
The Democrats could not agree more with that statement by Minister Hill, but the government's conduct in this instance has not demonstrated leadership and has given us many reasons to doubt the sincerity of its rhetoric. Providing leadership means that Australia must support the structures and principles of the international legal justice and legal systems, which have been established to promote collective security, the just resolution of disputes and international peace. All of these things are important. In practical terms, this means submitting to the rule of law even where this is contrary to our more immediate or financial interests. For this reason, the Democrats strongly oppose the government's decision to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice with respect to the determination of seabed boundaries. This sets a very poor example for East Timor and its people. As one submission put it: 
Australia and others in the international community consistently encourage East Timor's new government to implement democracy, the rule of law, transparency and safeguards against corruption as we develop our governmental structures and practices ... At the same time, Australia is not practising what you are preaching. When your country withdrew from legal processes for resolving maritime boundary disputes, you taught us the opposite message—that when the booty is large enough, the legal principles go out of the window.
Significantly, East Timor was given no prior notification of Australia's decision to withdraw from the jurisdiction of that court. The national interest analysis expressly stated that this was to prevent any action being commenced against Australia that could not be initiated after the declaration had been made.
Another of the Democrats' concerns relating to the Timor Sea Treaty is the ongoing uncertainty as to the exact seabed boundary between Australia and East Timor. People remember this as part of the debate on the legislation. While the Democrats do believe that a 90:10 split in favour of East Timor represents a fair allocation of the resources within the joint petroleum development area, the problem is that the boundaries of that area remain in contention. A series of legal opinions have given rise to conflicting interpretations of international law as it applies to the determination of the boundary between Australia and East Timor. These divergent and often equally persuasive opinions illustrate the complexity of the legal principles that apply to the delimitation of seabed boundaries and the unique factual circumstances of this particular case. For these reasons, it may well be necessary for this dispute to be determined by an independent body.
The Democrats' view is that the seabed boundaries must be determined in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and any applicable customary law. If Australia and East Timor are unable to reach a fair and just agreement, they should submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. By ratifying the treaty and finalising the unitisation agreement before the determination of seabed boundaries, not only is Australia accessing resources that potentially belong to East Timor but also East Timor's ultimate claim to those disputed areas may be prejudiced.
What we are now left with is a situation in which Australia has no incentive or legal obligation to negotiate with East Timor in an attempt to conclusively determine those seabed boundaries. That was one of the reasons why the East Timorese wanted the ratification of the treaty to proceed independently of the unitisation agreement. While the unitisation agreement provides that almost 80 per cent of the Greater Sunrise oil belongs to Australia, the Timorese argue that under the principles of international law most if not all of Greater Sunrise rightfully belongs to East Timor.
By insisting that the unitisation agreement be finalised prior to the ratification of the treaty, the government forced East Timor to compromise its long-term interests in order to meet its short-term needs. No-one denies that there were—and still are—very pressing short-term needs. It is hypocritical for the government to, on the one hand, provide aid to East Timor but, on the other, prevent it from accessing resources which arguably belong to it and which would enable it to progress more rapidly towards a situation of financial independence. 
As Dr Alkatiri indicated earlier this year, the best way to alleviate poverty in East Timor is to give it an equitable share of the revenues from Timor Sea petroleum developments. The government acted like a bully throughout its negotiations with East Timor and I was embarrassed and ashamed of the way in which our country dealt with this issue, as I know many Australians were. And yet it was not that long ago that I felt proud of the leadership Australia showed when it demonstrated its commitment to human rights and its role in preventing human rights abuses against the East Timorese and assisted East Timor during its transition to independence. Unfortunately, we risk undoing or undermining that good work that we have done in the past.
The Democrats once again urge the government to proceed with negotiations with East Timor for the final delimitation of the seabed boundaries. We urge the government to do so in good faith and in accordance with the relevant principles of international law. And we certainly urge the government to resubmit Australia to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and allow it, if required, to determine the disputes regarding maritime boundaries. We must show leadership with this new neighbour and we must act responsibly in our dealings with it. I acknowledge this belated response from the government to the committee's report. I do ask the government to respond to the Democrat recommendations as part of its report, although I do acknowledge that it is too late given that the treaty legislation has passed the parliament. But it is not too late for us to ensure that we submit to the ICJ—something we are a part of—and for us to recommit to acting in good faith and acting responsibly with our newest neighbour.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-08-14,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The tabling of this report has occurred quite a long time after the passage of the Timor Sea Treaty legislation. The delay in this response is quite indicative of the way the government has conducted itself throughout the Timor Sea Treaty negotiations. Throughout this process, the Australian Democrats have voiced our concerns regarding the fairness of the treaty and the way in which it was negotiated. It was on the basis of these concerns that we were unable to support the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Our minority report made several recommendations, one of which was that the treaty be renegotiated in order to address the very serious issues raised by a number of people in their submissions to the committee. But the government in its response that has just been tabled has not even bothered to respond to our recommendations which, we would remind the government, are an official part of the committee's report. I hope the government will, if need be, table a supplementary response in order to deal with those recommendations. I acknowledge, though, that it may be far too late.
The Democrats believe that it is in Australia's national interest for East Timor—our newest neighbour—to develop into a strong, prosperous and democratic nation with proper regard for the rule of law. At a time when Australia has just made a very substantial contribution and commitment to assist the Solomon Islands in order to prevent it from becoming a permanently failed state, it is important that we take into account the warnings to the inquiry by the East Timor Institute for Reconstruction Monitoring and Analysis, which said that without economic security and without the ability to rely on the rule of law both within East Timor and internationally, East Timor also faces the serious risk of becoming a `failed state'.
It is neither in the interests of East Timor nor Australia for East Timor to maintain its financial dependence on other countries and regress to a situation similar to what we have seen occur in the Solomon Islands. Members of the government have spoken a lot in recent weeks about the importance of Australia providing leadership in our region, which is something the Australian Democrats agree with. In his ministerial statement to the Senate earlier this week, the Minister for Defence said:
If Australia wants security, we need to do all that we can to ensure that our region, our neighbourhood, is stable—that governance is strong and the rule of law is just.
The Democrats could not agree more with that statement by Minister Hill, but the government's conduct in this instance has not demonstrated leadership and has given us many reasons to doubt the sincerity of its rhetoric. Providing leadership means that Australia must support the structures and principles of the international legal justice and legal systems, which have been established to promote collective security, the just resolution of disputes and international peace. All of these things are important. In practical terms, this means submitting to the rule of law even where this is contrary to our more immediate or financial interests. For this reason, the Democrats strongly oppose the government's decision to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice with respect to the determination of seabed boundaries. This sets a very poor example for East Timor and its people. As one submission put it: 
Australia and others in the international community consistently encourage East Timor's new government to implement democracy, the rule of law, transparency and safeguards against corruption as we develop our governmental structures and practices ... At the same time, Australia is not practising what you are preaching. When your country withdrew from legal processes for resolving maritime boundary disputes, you taught us the opposite message—that when the booty is large enough, the legal principles go out of the window.
Significantly, East Timor was given no prior notification of Australia's decision to withdraw from the jurisdiction of that court. The national interest analysis expressly stated that this was to prevent any action being commenced against Australia that could not be initiated after the declaration had been made.
Another of the Democrats' concerns relating to the Timor Sea Treaty is the ongoing uncertainty as to the exact seabed boundary between Australia and East Timor. People remember this as part of the debate on the legislation. While the Democrats do believe that a 90:10 split in favour of East Timor represents a fair allocation of the resources within the joint petroleum development area, the problem is that the boundaries of that area remain in contention. A series of legal opinions have given rise to conflicting interpretations of international law as it applies to the determination of the boundary between Australia and East Timor. These divergent and often equally persuasive opinions illustrate the complexity of the legal principles that apply to the delimitation of seabed boundaries and the unique factual circumstances of this particular case. For these reasons, it may well be necessary for this dispute to be determined by an independent body.
The Democrats' view is that the seabed boundaries must be determined in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and any applicable customary law. If Australia and East Timor are unable to reach a fair and just agreement, they should submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. By ratifying the treaty and finalising the unitisation agreement before the determination of seabed boundaries, not only is Australia accessing resources that potentially belong to East Timor but also East Timor's ultimate claim to those disputed areas may be prejudiced.
What we are now left with is a situation in which Australia has no incentive or legal obligation to negotiate with East Timor in an attempt to conclusively determine those seabed boundaries. That was one of the reasons why the East Timorese wanted the ratification of the treaty to proceed independently of the unitisation agreement. While the unitisation agreement provides that almost 80 per cent of the Greater Sunrise oil belongs to Australia, the Timorese argue that under the principles of international law most if not all of Greater Sunrise rightfully belongs to East Timor.
By insisting that the unitisation agreement be finalised prior to the ratification of the treaty, the government forced East Timor to compromise its long-term interests in order to meet its short-term needs. No-one denies that there were—and still are—very pressing short-term needs. It is hypocritical for the government to, on the one hand, provide aid to East Timor but, on the other, prevent it from accessing resources which arguably belong to it and which would enable it to progress more rapidly towards a situation of financial independence. 
As Dr Alkatiri indicated earlier this year, the best way to alleviate poverty in East Timor is to give it an equitable share of the revenues from Timor Sea petroleum developments. The government acted like a bully throughout its negotiations with East Timor and I was embarrassed and ashamed of the way in which our country dealt with this issue, as I know many Australians were. And yet it was not that long ago that I felt proud of the leadership Australia showed when it demonstrated its commitment to human rights and its role in preventing human rights abuses against the East Timorese and assisted East Timor during its transition to independence. Unfortunately, we risk undoing or undermining that good work that we have done in the past.

Question agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,18,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-14,"—I rise to continue speaking on the 1999 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement because the issue of housing has always been a critical one but in recent times it is finally starting to get some of the political, media and public attention that it deserves. That attention is focused of course around the issue of housing affordability—or, slightly more accurately, the lack of housing affordability and the absence of affordable and accessible housing particularly in areas where jobs and services happen to be. 
The McClure report—the report the government commissioned into welfare reform done by Patrick McClure from Mission Australia—highlighted that housing is fundamental to opportunities in all other aspects of life whether employment opportunities, educational opportunities or social opportunities. If people are not able to access appropriate and affordable housing where they need it then even in that first step there is often a fundamental barrier to people's ability to grasp some of the opportunities that we seek to ensure all Australians have access to.
It is particularly critical at the moment as the new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement has just been gazetted and tabled in this place. There are aspects of that that the Democrats are certainly concerned about, not least what we believe to be the inadequate overall funding amount. Public housing is something that has not got a lot of attention in the recent debate about housing affordability, but it really should. The Productivity Commission has been commissioned to do an inquiry into aspects of housing affordability, but only for first home buyers. I think that is far too narrow an aspect. It quite clearly needs to look at affordability for people trying to buy a second home or a third home when moving from one home to another as they get a larger family or change jobs perhaps and move interstate. So it is not just the first home buyers that are having problems with affordability. 
Similarly, the private rental market is a major problem in relation to affordable and accessible private rental. The vacancy rates in some parts of the country, not least in my home town of Brisbane, are very severe, and accessing reasonable rental housing is getting extremely difficult. Even in other parts of the country where the vacancy rate is a bit higher, a lot of that vacancy is in the high end of the rental market, particularly in some of the inner-city units and apartments that have flourished of late. That is where the vacancies are and that is not much use if you are on a small income and simply trying to find a place to live.
The Productivity Commission, or its forerunner, the Industry Commission, did examine public housing in a report some time back, in the early 1990s. It highlighted—and I think it is an important finding, particularly for a body that is often seen as a strong advocate of economic rationalism—the efficiency of money being spent on public housing in terms of dollar-for-dollar value in delivering affordable housing for people that need it. I think the move away from public housing that has occurred throughout the country—and this an issue too for state governments—is a real problem and is a contributing factor to the problem we are facing now. 
There are many contributing factors. A lot of people are trying to suggest that it is only one thing. The government likes to suggest that it is all the stamp duty that the state governments are charging. Others might suggest that it is all due to negative gearing at federal level. Certainly those issues are important; they are all factors, but there is no single solution. Stepping away from public housing is making that problem more difficult. 
This week we have seen the Treasurer a couple of times in question time gloating quite loudly about the immense amount of money that has been provided through the first home buyers scheme. I would have to say that, whilst that is welcome, it is not targeted at all. It is not even properly scrutinised to make sure that it is being applied legitimately. There was more money spent on the first home buyers scheme last year than was provided for public housing throughout Australia and I think that is a misdirected priority. I am not saying the first home owners scheme should be scrapped, but I am saying that we need to look at value for money in getting outcomes for people in terms of affordable housing, and that is not being delivered at the moment. We have to look to some of the drivers at national level that are making the market so full of investors that they are driving up the price. Housing has to be about providing people with a place to live, well before being a chance for people to make money. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-14,"—A Pacific engaged: Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea and the island states of the south-west Pacific was tabled earlier this week by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. It is quite a comprehensive report into Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea and the island states of the South Pacific. There are a lot of aspects to the report and a lot of interesting and important recommendations in there, and I congratulate the committee on its work. I was not a member of that committee, but the relations we have with Pacific island nations is certainly an interest I have.
I noted that Senator Sandy Macdonald in speaking to this report the other day thought he would have a shot at my colleague Senator Ridgeway about his alleged lack of involvement. Without chewing up a lot of time here, I think it was a very cheap shot, given the enormous committee and portfolio responsibilities that all Democrats senators have, not just Senator Ridgeway. I think it was a most unfair and inappropriate reflection on him and the work he puts into many committees, not least of which is the rural affairs committee that he chairs.
I particularly want to draw attention to chapter 6, which talks about Australia's political relations with Papua New Guinea and the Pacific. I have had the good fortune to attend a few forums on Pacific island issues and have met people there from various Pacific island countries, and that has helped me become a little more aware of some of the very significant and varied issues and challenges that those nations in the Pacific region are facing. The only one country that I have actually been to is the island country of Nauru, which I visited for a couple of days a week or two ago.
I note the recommendation in here that the Presiding Officers of the parliament look at developing some modified travel guidelines to facilitate the involvement of Australian parliamentarians in bona fide training and exchange programs with parliaments of Pacific island countries. I would like to strongly support that recommendation. I guess it would be easy for someone to take a cheap shot at that and say that we are just trying to find another way to get ourselves funded overseas travel. But I am sure it could be done in a way that works within existing budgets and guidelines and simply redirects some of that money towards these types of visits. I do believe that nothing really beats being able to directly meet with people to see the situation for yourself. In my visit to Nauru, although it was focused predominantly on the refugee facility on the island and trying to meet with people who were detained there, I did have the opportunity to meet with the acting president of Nauru, who was the finance minister at the time, and some other government officials and NGO people from the Nauruan community. Being able to hear directly from them about the very significant and severe problems that that nation is facing was very valuable and certainly gave me a much better appreciation of the situation they are in. 
Senators may know that—and this was nothing to do with my visit—the government of Nauru changed about a week or so after I was there, and just this week a different president and different government are now in place. I think the minister I met with is now no longer a minister. These things happen from time to time and they seem to have happened quite regularly this year in Nauru, which is probably not helpful in terms of them dealing with all their problems—but that is obviously an issue for them as an independent nation.
Equally significant—in fact, far more so—was the section in this chapter on what is now called the Pacific strategy. At least, that is what the government now calls it; it used to be called the `Pacific solution'. I presume it was changed because the government now acknowledges that it is not a solution to anything very much, unless you count making hundreds of people suffer enormously at great expense to Australia as being a solution. That has now been changed to be called the Pacific strategy. It is nearly two years since that was established. The processing centre in Nauru was established on 10 September 2001, and there have been many people—well over 1,000 asylum seekers— who have gone through those two centres on Nauru. I was able to visit one of those when I was there, the Top Side Camp, and have a look at the facilities. They are certainly not up to the standard of facilities in Australia, which is probably not surprising, given that Nauru itself as a nation is in significant economic difficulty and the facilities for the islanders themselves and the conditions are not ideal, particularly in terms of water shortages, irregular power supply and some fairly dilapidated infrastructure. So in that context the fact that the camp itself is not particularly flash is probably no surprise. That is not a reflection, from my point of view, on the management of the camp, the IOM—International Organisation for Migration. I found them exceedingly helpful when I was there and very much focused on trying to do what they can to ensure the wellbeing of the detainees on Nauru, recognising, of course, that they as an organisation have no power or ability to determine what happens to these people—where they get sent or where they are allowed to go. They are really only able to focus on trying to make people's lives a little less difficult.
Certainly the lives of the people on Nauru are extremely difficult. The staff at the facility, the health workers there, made clear that 80 to 90 per cent of their work is with mental illness issues—with depression, anxiety and despair. It is very difficult for them to deal with that because the situation that the people are in is what is generating that mental illness, and that cannot be changed.
The worst scenario amongst all the people there that I encountered was of nine women, who between them have 14 children, whose husbands are in Australia on refugee visas. Not being permitted to reunite with their husbands in Australia, these women are being pressured to return to the very country and the very location from which their husbands fled, having fled—and been found to have fled—serious persecution. I think that scenario, whatever else people might think about the government's policies in relation to refugees, is simply unacceptable. To have those women and their children, most of whom are very young and who have not seen their father for three or four years—in a few cases ever—knowing where their husbands and fathers are in Australia but not being able to be with them and instead being told they have to go back alone to a country that was found to be persecuting their husbands and fathers I find simply extraordinary. The despair of those people—not just those in the camp but equally the husbands here in Australia, a couple of whom I have met—is simply enormous. The psychological trauma they are suffering just cannot be calculated. I really urge the government, even if they do nothing else, to at least look at the situation of those women and children and reunite them with their husbands and fathers here in Australia. I just cannot see any possible justification for causing such torment to people. 
The committee examines the Pacific solution or the Pacific strategy in a little detail and looks at some of the expenses and costs. It is budgeted to cost another $430 million over the next four years and it has certainly cost well over $100 million already. But I was surprised—and pleasantly surprised—by a recommendation and finding contained in the report. I have double-checked it and it is a unanimous recommendation, which unanimity included the committee's government senators. Senator Sandy Macdonald and Senator Johnston I think were the two government members on that committee and they supported recommendation 29, which reads:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government consider modifying the operation of its Pacific Strategy which would allow for the removal of Nauru and Manus Province in Papua New Guinea as refugee processing destinations.
That is a very significant recommendation and I welcome the fact that it is unanimous. I would prefer it to have just recommended that the government immediately move to close down the facilities on Nauru and bring people to Australia, but to get a unanimous recommendation, including from government senators, that the government consider removing Nauru as a refugee processing destination is a very significant advance, and I would like to congratulate the committee on that. I ask the government again to acknowledge the concerns of the committee and many others in Australia and act upon that recommendation. 
The committee said it was `concerned that not only did the policy accentuate the perception that Australia tends to take advantage of Pacific island countries but that also it fuelled distrust amongst the Pacific island countries over Australia's mixed signals in relation to the duration of the policy in the Pacific'. The committee considers this policy in relation to Nauru to have been `detrimental to Australia's relations in the region in not adequately taking into account the potential for adverse effects in Nauru'. It is a significant finding; it is a significant recommendation as part of what is quite a comprehensive report. I believe there is no excuse any longer for leaving these people suffering in isolation, without any significant contact with friends and families, on the middle of the equator thousands of kilometres from anywhere. They should be removed from there and brought to Australia. Ideally they should be set free, particularly those women and children who have their spouses and fathers here in Australia.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-14,"—Report No. 38 of last financial year is a performance audit on referrals, assessments and approvals under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The objective of the report was to examine and report on the quality and timeliness of the referral, assessment and approval processes under the act as well as on Environment Australia's activities to ensure compliance with the act. I do not say this very often about Audit Office reports, but I have to say with this one that I think it has failed in significant ways to perform this objective. As a report, it really does not identify what I believe are quite clearly inappropriate practices that are happening in relation to the assessment and approvals process under the EPBC Act.
The EPBC Act was passed through this place in 1999 after hundreds of amendments from the Democrats to significantly strengthen it. Whilst the act can still be improved further—there is no doubt about that—it was a major advance in national environmental law and in the ability of the Commonwealth government to ensure environmental protection; hence the title of the act. Unfortunately, despite it being a significantly improved act, the problem lies in the implementation of it and the lack of political will from the government to actually use its powers to ensure environmental protection. There are numerous examples of this, but particularly I would like to focus on the approval process. I really believe that the Auditor-General needs to go and have another look at this, and I am giving consideration to moving a motion next week to recommend that the Auditor-General reconsider the report with a view to correcting some of the errors that I believe it contains and to look at identifying some of the more obvious flaws in Environment Australia's administration of the act.
There are clearly failings in the way the act is being administered and these should be identified. As the National Land and Water Resources Audit and State of the Environment Report have highlighted, there are serious environmental problems in Australia that require urgent attention—including biodiversity loss and the degradation of land and water resources. The EPBC Act's referral, assessment and approvals process is intended to be one of the central pillars of the federal government's response to these challenges. It is intended that the act provide a regulatory safety net for the protection and conservation of matters of national environmental significance. However, this has not been provided by this government. The audit report should have provided this parliament with details of these failings, the great majority of which would be quite obvious to people who work with some of the various proposals that get referred, assessed and approved under the EPBC. 
My concerns include the department's having regard to beneficial impacts in controlled action decisions. This is where the minister or the department makes a decision that an action is a controlled action and has to be examined by the environment department because it relates to matters of national environmental significance. In making an assessment of whether or not the project should be approved it is against the act—that is, it is against the law—to take into account beneficial impacts of the action. The audit report makes reference to the fact that the minister is not permitted to have regard to beneficial impact. The report concludes that there is no evidence to suggest that beneficial impacts were considered at the referral stage, which would have been contrary to the act.
I find that finding truly astounding. There are numerous instances where it is quite clear that the minister has had regard to the beneficial impacts of an action when making controlled action decisions. These include a significant proportion of those instances where the minister has decided that an action does not require approval if it is carried out in particular manner. I could give the Senate a whole range of reference numbers of decisions but in the interests of time I will not do that. The extent of the practice, and the fact that it so obviously involves a contravention of the statutory requirements, makes a mockery of the Auditor-General's conclusion that in the overwhelming majority of the cases examined the reasons for decisions by the minister or delegate were consistent with the Prime Minister's guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility and the principles of administrative law.
A simple example is applications to clear trees and vegetation from endangered ecosystems or habitat of threatened species. For example, the bull oak tree habitat is a key nesting site for the red-tailed black cockatoo. There are frequent applications to clear areas of bull oak. Repeatedly and without exception, as a side effect and part of the approval of this action, the minister requires some new trees to be planted. Presumably the bird just flies around in the air for 30 years until the trees grow big enough and become appropriate for nesting or food. Leaving aside that absurdity, the planting of trees to cover the area that has been cleared is a beneficial impact. To say that the action is approved as long as it is done in the manner specified— the planting of these trees—is clearly to give regard to beneficial impact and is a breach of the law. That is not an isolated example; it happens with infuriating regularity.
Conditions imposed on approvals must possess reasonable certainty of meaning and application. That is a basic principle of administrative law and I believe that the terms of the particular manner decisions are also an area of concern. Although particular manner decisions differ from approvals, the same principles apply. The particular manner specified by the minister must possess reasonable certainty of meaning and application. I believe the Auditor-General neglected to analyse the particular manner decisions to determine the adequacy of the manner specified by the minister. In doing so it overlooked one of the most obvious flaws in the way in which the referral, assessment and approval process is currently being administered. 
Another related issue is that the particular manner decisions often refer to information that is not publicly available. This also occurs in relation to the conditions imposed on approvals. By framing decisions in this manner Environment Australia prevents members of the public from being able to monitor compliance with the act. As the audit report recognised, third parties can and do play an important role in helping to enforce compliance with the provisions of the act. Another reason that the act is a significant improvement on previous environment laws is that it provides a mechanism for third parties to monitor and help enforce compliance. But, again, if you have a government that is not interested in facilitating that, it becomes much more difficult to use effectively. If third parties are expected to perform this role then Environment Australia must ensure that third parties can monitor the terms of its particular manner decisions. 
The fourth issue that the audit report fails to analyse appropriately concerns staged referrals, which involve circumstances where a person divides a single action into a number of stages and then refers each stage to the minister as a separate action. In the act this is an obvious loophole that can be, and has been, exploited by people taking actions to avoid the assessment and approval requirements. The loophole could be easily closed—not simply by amendment but even by a minister refusing to allow people to refer projects in that way. The parliament was certainly aware of this issue when the act was passed and to ensure it did not occur the term `action' was defined very broadly by the Democrats. Again, unfortunately, the minister and the department seem to be happy to interpret this much more narrowly and that should be examined by the Auditor-General as well. There are issues in terms of the provision of false and misleading information in referrals, and in terms of enforcing the act, that have not been properly examined. In conclusion, I have some significant concerns and I think it is appropriate to see if this can be re-examined by the Audit Office. I will pursue that separately but at this stage I simply seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-14,"—Report No. 38 of last financial year is a performance audit on referrals, assessments and approvals under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The objective of the report was to examine and report on the quality and timeliness of the referral, assessment and approval processes under the act as well as on Environment Australia's activities to ensure compliance with the act. I do not say this very often about Audit Office reports, but I have to say with this one that I think it has failed in significant ways to perform this objective. As a report, it really does not identify what I believe are quite clearly inappropriate practices that are happening in relation to the assessment and approvals process under the EPBC Act.
The EPBC Act was passed through this place in 1999 after hundreds of amendments from the Democrats to significantly strengthen it. Whilst the act can still be improved further—there is no doubt about that—it was a major advance in national environmental law and in the ability of the Commonwealth government to ensure environmental protection; hence the title of the act. Unfortunately, despite it being a significantly improved act, the problem lies in the implementation of it and the lack of political will from the government to actually use its powers to ensure environmental protection. There are numerous examples of this, but particularly I would like to focus on the approval process. I really believe that the Auditor-General needs to go and have another look at this, and I am giving consideration to moving a motion next week to recommend that the Auditor-General reconsider the report with a view to correcting some of the errors that I believe it contains and to look at identifying some of the more obvious flaws in Environment Australia's administration of the act.
There are clearly failings in the way the act is being administered and these should be identified. As the National Land and Water Resources Audit and State of the Environment Report have highlighted, there are serious environmental problems in Australia that require urgent attention—including biodiversity loss and the degradation of land and water resources. The EPBC Act's referral, assessment and approvals process is intended to be one of the central pillars of the federal government's response to these challenges. It is intended that the act provide a regulatory safety net for the protection and conservation of matters of national environmental significance. However, this has not been provided by this government. The audit report should have provided this parliament with details of these failings, the great majority of which would be quite obvious to people who work with some of the various proposals that get referred, assessed and approved under the EPBC. 
My concerns include the department's having regard to beneficial impacts in controlled action decisions. This is where the minister or the department makes a decision that an action is a controlled action and has to be examined by the environment department because it relates to matters of national environmental significance. In making an assessment of whether or not the project should be approved it is against the act—that is, it is against the law—to take into account beneficial impacts of the action. The audit report makes reference to the fact that the minister is not permitted to have regard to beneficial impact. The report concludes that there is no evidence to suggest that beneficial impacts were considered at the referral stage, which would have been contrary to the act.
I find that finding truly astounding. There are numerous instances where it is quite clear that the minister has had regard to the beneficial impacts of an action when making controlled action decisions. These include a significant proportion of those instances where the minister has decided that an action does not require approval if it is carried out in particular manner. I could give the Senate a whole range of reference numbers of decisions but in the interests of time I will not do that. The extent of the practice, and the fact that it so obviously involves a contravention of the statutory requirements, makes a mockery of the Auditor-General's conclusion that in the overwhelming majority of the cases examined the reasons for decisions by the minister or delegate were consistent with the Prime Minister's guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility and the principles of administrative law.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2003-08-14,"—I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate, and probably more particularly of wheat farmers, the veiled activities of the Grain Growers Association. The vision statement in their 2002 annual report reads:
To increase the downstream involvement and influence of grain producers in the marketplace thereby assisting producers to maximise their productivity and profitability.
It is certainly a well-financed organisation, with net assets for 2002 showing at $344 million and cash at the end of the financial year at over $44 million. Yet, with this background, the Grain Growers Association at every forum they turn up to attempt to pass themselves off as a wheat farmers lobby group, cynically representing the best interests of the wheat growers. Some farmers lobby group they are, with $344 million worth of assets and $44 million in cash in the bank! I would ask: where does such a farmers group get that sort of money?
The truth about the Grain Growers Association is that it is the parent company of the bulk handler GrainCorp. GrainCorp has joint ventures with the internationally recognised grain merchant Cargill, the largest multinational grain trader in the world. The chairman of the Grain Growers Association is also the chairman of GrainCorp. Grain Growers directors are also GrainCorp directors. The reason I outlined this information is to show what a powerful player the Grain Growers Association is in Australia's domestic wheat market, which is a good thing. I repeat: this is a good thing—at least until they decide to misrepresent.
Their misrepresentation is threefold. Firstly, they cleverly attempt to parade themselves as a wheat farmers lobby group in name and in their vision statement. They claim to speak for the bulk of the wheat farmers. Secondly, their claim of a 13,000-strong membership is very misleading. It is a membership based on the most spurious grower representation. For example, doing a business transaction with or holding shares in GrainCorp makes you a member for life. There are no annual fees or fees at all. The most spurious contact gets you a membership. What is more, the members are inactive. Thirdly, led by their chief executive officer, the association has lobbied in Canberra, in the media and around the country for fundamental changes to the single desk under the mantra of: `We support the single desk, but'—and then they go on.
The truth is that this slick and well-resourced presentation is nothing but a guise for the interests of the grain merchants. It would not be news to any wheat farmer that the big grain merchants seek to dismantle the Australian Wheat Board arrangements and therefore the single desk. What is new is this Trojan Horse approach by the grain merchants. I bring this Trojan Horse tactic to the Senate's attention because the strategy of the Grain Growers Association has started to gather pace and credibility in some parts of the country. Admittedly, it is the same old suspects who have been against the Australian Wheat Board and their monopoly operations, but they too have now picked up the Grain Growers deceptive mantra of: `We are not against the single desk, but'—and in fact it has reached such a crescendo that you know them by their words.
The Grain Growers Association have had a series of some 22 so-called farmer workshops. The Grain Growers Association portray the workshops as having the endorsement of the Grains Council of Australia—the properly recognised farmers lobby group— and themselves as being there to discuss marketing arrangements within the industry. In reality, the meetings are subtle propaganda attempts to lure wheat farmers away from their belief in the single desk. The meetings begin with the distribution of a strategic planning paper endorsed—and, if not, paid for—by the Grain Growers Association that conveniently criticises the Australian Wheat Board and the single desk powers, I dare say just to open up debate. Further to this, the forum facilitator vigorously pushes certain lines during the meeting—for example, single desk at port and deregulation of bags and boxes along with the reconfiguration of the Australian Wheat Board International and the Australian Wheat Board Ltd. The attempt to indoctrinate does not stop there. The Australian Wheat Board have been effectively locked out of these so-called workshops. They have been refused permission to send a representative, let alone speak at all of the 22 workshops—which I would have thought was necessary at any of these forums. 
In short, the Grain Growers Association is attempting to carefully manipulate the workshops to get the result it wants: to set the agenda in the government's mind. I assume that the Grain Growers Association report from the 22 workshops will be ready to submit for the 2004 wheat marketing review. We already know the report it wishes to write: if it cannot abolish the single desk, it will undermine the integrity of the single desk. However, these pretenders will hit a brick wall, because over 90 per cent of the wheat farmers in Australia will not have a bar of any change of the single desk arrangements. So there are two camps: the Australian Grain Growers Association, representing the interests of the grain merchants; and the Grains Council of Australia, representing the 45,000 predominantly family wheat farmers. Whatever adjustments may be made or may have to be made to the wheat marketing arrangements following the 2004 review, the fundamental difference between the Grain Growers Association and the Grains Council must be kept in mind for the sake of an honest debate.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Grain Growers Association</title>,Adjournment,30,1,speech
