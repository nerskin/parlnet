Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (09:35):  When you are shopping for your weekly groceries at the supermarket and you turn over the packet to read the ingredients on a bag of chips, a block of chocolate or a box of biscuits, you would expect that what you see is what you get. But, believe it or not, that is not always the case. What is being hidden from us is potentially impacting our health and destroying the environment. Palm oil is one of the world's leading agricultural commodities and is widely used. In fact, palm oil can be found in approximately 40 per cent of food products at the supermarket, and every year the average Australian consumes around 10 kilos of palm oil without even knowing it. That is because, under the current food labelling laws, manufacturers are able to label palm oil as vegetable oil on the packaging. For starters, the palm is a fruit, not a vegetable. Secondly, palm oil is high in saturated fat and low in polyunsaturated fat, and, according to the Heart Foundation, biomedical research indicates that the consumption of palm oil increases the risk of heart disease. Thirdly, in South-East Asia alone, the equivalent of 300 soccer fields is deforested every hour for palm oil plantation, and each year more than 1,000 orangutans die as a result of the land clearing in this region. 


There is no question that the current labelling laws are inadequate and are misleading consumers. The fact that palm oil is allowed to be disguised as vegetable oil means that Australians aren't able to make an informed choice for themselves and for their family about what they buy at the supermarket because they are not being given all of the facts. In 2011, when my NXT colleague Senator Xenophon first introduced a bill to strengthen labelling laws for food containing palm oil, Zoos Victoria, Adelaide Zoo and Auckland Zoo in New Zealand launched the Don't Palm Us Off campaign, calling for palm oil to be labelled specifically on food packaging. In the first 12 months of that campaign, more than 130,000 people signed on to show their concern about palm oil. In November 2016, Zoos Victoria relaunched the same campaign, this time attracting a staggering 160,000 signatures. 


But the concerns of Australians are falling on deaf ears. Still nothing has been done to ensure consumers can easily determine if the products they are purchasing contain palm oil. In 2011, when Senator Xenophon's previous bill was debated in the Senate, the following remarks were made during the second reading debate by the coalition, who were then in opposition:


There are many processes. They go on for a long time. As Senator Siewert outlined, this has been proposed for many years. But there has been no action. So the coalition, in supporting this bill, is simply saying consumers have the right to know what is in the food and goods they purchase. We believe this will improve consumers' ability to make informed choices.


The community is backing these reforms. Some manufacturers are backing these reforms. It seems that, when the coalition was in opposition, they were also backing these reforms. So why isn't it compulsory for palm oil to be specifically listed as an ingredient on all packaging? Put simply, if the saying 'We are what we eat' is true, then we have the right to know what we are eating, and this bill will give consumers truthful, accurate and clear information about what they are purchasing. In the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations requires that each individual fat and/or oil ingredient of a food is to be declared by its specific common or usual name—that is, palm oil is listed as palm oil. Similarly, under the provisions of this bill, regardless of the amount of palm oil used in the product, palm oil must be listed as an ingredient. 


It is important to be clear that this bill is not calling for a boycott of products which contain palm oil; rather, it is designed to enable consumers to know the whole truth about the ingredients a particular product contains so that they can make their own informed choice prior to purchase. Just like the inclusion of wheat in a product is labelled to inform consumers with possible allergies, so too should shoppers be told that palm oil is contained in a particular food product. When Senator Xenophon announced his intention to move his bill back in 2010, he was contacted by dozens of people outraged that they didn't know and couldn't tell that palm oil was an ingredient in their food. Unfortunately, not much has changed in those seven years. The Nick Xenophon Team shares those frustrations. Consumers should be able to trust that, when the list of ingredients is printed on the packaging, all the ingredients are included on that list.


On the issue of conservation, palm oil can be produced sustainably and manufacturers should be encouraged to use certified sustainable palm oil rather than palm oil which is produced as a result of deforestation and a loss of wildlife habitat. In Malaysia and Indonesia, for example, a farmer will chop down all the trees on his land and sell the timber for money. He will then burn the stumps and plant oil palm, which is fast growing. He will crush the fruit to produce palm oil and he can sell the shells of the palm fruit as food for cattle. By cutting down the trees, orangutans lose their habitat. In fact, 90 per cent of orangutan habitat has been lost already. It is forecast that, at the current rate of deforestation, orangutans could be extinct in the wild in fewer than 10 years. On a broader scale, the environmental impact of deforestation is significant. How can we be serious about looking after the environment when we're not encouraging businesses to farm sustainably?


Palm oil can be produced sustainably under criteria set out by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. Sustainable palm oil plantations are established in already cleared land rather than through deforestation. The roundtable's criteria also includes requirements for reforestation along the river line, bans on pesticides, appropriate labour conditions and wildlife-friendly practices. Manufacturers who use certified sustainable palm oil will be able to list the use of the ingredient as CS palm oil to indicate its sustainable origins and to show consumers that they are sourcing their ingredient from a sustainable palm oil plantation. This bill will encourage food manufacturers to purchase from sustainable palm oil producers and will provide consumers with all the information they need to make their own choice. 


Calling palm oil vegetable oil is misleading. Not telling Australians that palm oil is one of the ingredients in or used to make a product is unfair. There have been some significant changes to food labelling laws made in this parliament and the NXT welcomes these changes. However, more can be done and the discontent felt by the community at the lack of action on this issue is growing. Consumers have a right to know and this bill gives them that right.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-08-17,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (09:43):  I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I congratulate the Nick Xenophon Team for bringing this important issue before the Senate. I don't doubt for a moment the very genuine sincerity of the Nick Xenophon Team in seeking to address an issue that many Australians are concerned about. However, the government does not support the bill. I will outline some of the concerns the government has about the proposed bill and some of the reasons why the government has reservations about this approach to tackling this issue.


We absolutely understand that Australian consumers are concerned about the ingredients in the products they purchase for themselves and their families. Primarily, what consumers want to know about the food they eat is that it's safe and that the household products that they purchase will not harm them or their families. This is how consumers make decisions about the products that they buy. They are also concerned, very critically, about the price of the products that they buy and they want to receive good value for those products. That's something we should never lose sight of. 


The other issues that consumers do and should take into account when buying products include environmental concerns. However, the purpose of government regulation for labelling is first and foremost, as it should be, about the health and safety of consumers and ensuring that consumers get the information they need so that they can make informed choices, including on environmental matters, if they so choose.


Palm oil is a product that is widely used in the foods and products that Australian households use every day. As the bill acknowledges, there is a difference between the sustainable production of palm oil and the production of palm oil that damages the environment, and the habitat of orangutans in particular. It is worth pausing and reflecting on that for a moment. Not all palm oil is bad, and there are ways and means of harvesting palm oil that are environmentally sustainable and do not have a negative impact on animal life. That is a very critical thing, because sometimes in this debate you are left with the impression that palm oil is an evil product that only does harm, when in fact that is not the case.


Currently, manufacturers and importers can—and many do—voluntarily declare in the ingredient list on their labels that there is palm oil in their products. Many businesses operating in Australia are taking action on this issue and seeking to use sustainable palm oil in the products that they manufacture and sell. In addition, these businesses clearly label the use of palm oil. If we think about it, that makes perfect sense. Businesses are aware of and responding to a consumer preference. They know that this issue is of concern to consumers and they're providing consumers with the information to make an educated choice about their purchases. That is something we should welcome. In addition, I think it is very promising and welcome to see that many companies are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which promotes the supply of palm oil that is sourced from eco-friendly areas. 


Voluntary certification allows businesses to provide information to consumers, who may be motivated by social, environmental, economic or other ethical concerns, by labelling their products as using sustainable palm oil. Voluntary certification is a really powerful tool that is used in a range of areas. Everyone will be familiar with, for example, the Heart Foundation's tick of approval. It's not government mandated; it is not compulsory; but many consumers value that Heart Foundation tick of approval in making their choices in the supermarket. It allows them to choose products which are healthier for them and their families. This solves the problem in the market without any government intervention. There are consumers who are motivated to buy products of this type, there is a private certifier who is willing to certify that products meet these standards, and there are businesses who want to ensure that their products receive this certification and meet those standards so that they can reach those consumers. Not every business wants to participate in this, and not every product will be labelled in this way. But if you are a consumer for whom this is an important issue then there is the necessary information in the marketplace for you to make an informed choice, and it didn't require any government regulation. 


There are lots of other examples like the Heart Foundation's tick of approval—for example, many of the Fairtrade and organic-certified products are done in a completely private-sector way, with no government regulation requiring it. There are other companies that choose to market their products based primarily on their environmental sustainability. A good example is—and this followed some media controversy—companies that sell tuna and choose to emphasise that it is sustainably harvested and dolphin-free. No government required them to do that, but they've gone out and done that because they know that it's important to consumers. This is now beginning to take place in the palm oil space, and I think that's a very welcome development. 


The private senator's bill that Senator Kakoschke-Moore has outlined proposes to amend schedule 2—Australian Consumer Law—of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. The Australian Consumer Law provides broad protections for consumers by ensuring that the information that businesses provide is not false, misleading or deceptive. The proposal to amend the ACL by inserting a new section 134A would require the government to make an information standard specifically relating to the labelling of goods containing palm oil within 12 months of the bill's passage. Importantly, this would include all goods that contain any amount of palm oil as an ingredient, including foods, shampoos, cosmetics and washing powders. To my knowledge, it doesn't differentiate between palm oil that is sustainably harvested and other palm oil; it just requires that any use of palm oil be labelled. Given that we know that some palm oil is unsustainably harvested and problematic but some is harvested in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way, this is one area of concern. 


The explanatory memorandum to the bill states that the amendment is for the purpose of environmental protection. This is not consistent with the role of the Australian Consumer Law. The purpose of the Australian Consumer Law is to improve consumer wellbeing through consumer empowerment and protection to foster effective competition and enable confident participation in markets. It is not the purpose of Australian Consumer Law to impose an obligation on businesses to provide all of the information that consumers may find useful in deciding whether or not to purchase a product. The Consumer Law is there to protect consumers from false and misleading representations that may appear on the label. Of course, it is not practical to mandate that every piece of potentially useful information is on the label of every product. There is a limited amount of real estate to do so. If we required companies to provide every potential piece of relevant information, there would be no room for anything else on a product's label other than government-mandated warnings and information.


This bill is motivated by genuine environmental concerns about deforestation—particularly in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia—but it is not particularly motivated by a concern that consumers are being misled about the nature of the goods or that palm oil poses a safety issue for consumers, which is the primary purpose of the Australian Consumer Law. 


The explanatory memorandum also provides that the proposed bill encourages the use of certified sustainable palm oil. However, there is nothing in the wording of the bill that would make such a proposal enforceable, nor is the Consumer Law the appropriate vehicle for environmental protection measures, as I've mentioned. The Consumer Law's objectives are to ensure that consumers are not disadvantaged when they engage in trade or commerce and that they are protected from unfair practices.


Importantly, the bill is also inconsistent with the requirements of the Intergovernmental Agreement for the Australian Consumer Law, which requires that any amendment to the Australian Consumer Law—including the making of information and standards—is subject to formal consultation and voting by states and territories. This process has not been followed with this bill—and it's worth noting that this intergovernmental agreement process is, in fact, not a coalition government process but a Labor process that was put in place by the previous government. 


If the proposed bill was successful, there is a very real possibility that the states and territories may decide not to apply the provision because the changes were not made in accordance with the intergovernmental agreement. This is appropriate, given many areas of consumer law are regulated by the states. In addition, while it's possible to insert such a provision, it would potentially be legally ineffective in compelling the minister to make an information standard—that is, the bill could have no effect.


The proposed amendment to the Australian Consumer Law is inconsistent with the generic nature of Australian consumer law, which is currently sufficiently broad enough to cover conduct relating to the representation of ingredients such as palm oil. The passage of the bill has the potential to erode the benefits of having a national, generic, consistent consumer law. Information standards are only considered as a regulatory option after other responses have been considered as insufficient and where there is strong evidence of consumer detriment or widespread noncompliance. To date, the government does not believe there has been strong evidence of consumer detriment presented.


The bill has not been subject to any regulatory impact analysis. The proposal would likely impose significant compliance costs on businesses, including the cost of designing new labels and potentially relabelling existing products. It would also potentially require stringent record keeping and information transfer procedures as the bill requires all products containing any palm oil be labelled—as I said before, even if it is not necessarily harmful or in meaningful amounts.


The labelling of palm oil or palm oil derived chemicals in cosmetics and products is already regulated through the Trade Practices (Consumer Product Information Standards) (Cosmetic) Regulations 1991. This information standard requires that cosmetic products list all ingredients or palm oil derived chemicals. While the Australian Consumer Law is not the appropriate place to deal with these issues, the Australian government is taking action in other areas. 


The government acknowledges that there is community interest and concern in the use and labelling of palm oil as an ingredient in food products in particular. The government is well aware of the issue of palm oil in foods and is currently examining these issues with our state and territory colleagues. Currently, the labelling of added fats—including palm oil and sugars—in food is being considered by the Australian and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation, with regulatory and non-regulatory options being developed. This is the appropriate forum to consider food labelling.


Currently, manufacturers do not have to list palm oil as an ingredient in food. They can, as Senator Kakoschke-Moore mentioned, use a generic term such as 'vegetable oil'. The issue of food labelling should be left to be considered in detail by the forum. This is important work, and it would be inappropriate for this bill to circumvent that process. The government must endeavour to balance improving the information on food labels to meet consumers' needs against maintaining the marketing flexibility and minimising the regulatory burden on industry and barriers to trade.


It's worth reflecting on the previous bill that Senator Xenophon introduced in 2011, which was called the Food Standards Amendment (Truth in Labelling—Palm Oil) Bill 2011. It sought to amend section 33 of the Australian Consumer Law. That bill was introduced and read for the first time on 4 July 2011. The bill was subsequently removed from the Notice Paper on 20 March, 2012, during the 43rd parliament. The 2011 bill was examined by the House Standing Committee on Economics. On 19 September, 2011, the House Standing Committee on Economics presented its report recommending that the House of Representatives at the time should not pass that Food Standards Amendment (Truth in Labelling—Palm Oil) Bill because the legislation was flawed and would result in a range of unintended consequences. The government members of the day—and I should point out that they were Labor members—recommended that the House not pass the bill.


Coalition opposition members at the time were also concerned about the bill. They particularly mentioned the trade related considerations raised in evidence to the committee. The coalition members were concerned that this issue was only briefly touched upon in a Senate inquiry report and that the evidence presented to the committee highlighted Australia's trade obligations as a legitimate area of public policy concern. Evidence to the committee highlighted a number of trade related risks. Opposition members at the time—coalition members—recognised that it may well be arguable that the bill offended World Trade Organization rules by indirectly advancing the interests of local vegetable oil production that may be a substitute for palm oil products and may invoke potentially harmful retaliatory action and lengthy dispute resolution processes.


These are the reasons the government is reluctant to support the bill, while still respecting the genuine motivations of the Nick Xenophon Team in raising this issue.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2017-08-17,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:57):  I rise to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Truth in Labelling—Palm Oil) Bill 2017. Palm oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from the pulp of oil palm fruits. Oil can also be derived from the kernel of the same fruit, but this is usually referred to as palm kernel oil. Palm oil is around half saturated fats, which is uncommon for vegetable fats. It is semisolid at room temperature. It's a common cooking ingredient in the tropical belt. Palm oil is also used extensively in the commercial processed food industry as it is cheaper than competitors like canola oil. It also yields more oil per hectare than any other vegetable oil. Palm oil's semi-solid state at room temperature also makes it suitable as a cheap substitute for butter or other shortening in baking. Interestingly, during the industrial revolution, palm oil became sought after by British traders in Asia and Africa for use as an industrial lubricant for machinery. It can also form the basis of soap products. It's part of the derivative behind the Palmolive soap brand—the other, of course, being olive oil.


The bulk of the world's palm oil is produced in Indonesia and Malaysia. Eighty five per cent of global production comes from these two countries. Indonesia produces 50 million tonnes per year while Malaysia produces 20 million tonnes. People in both countries have benefited significantly from economic development achieved through expanded palm oil agriculture and export. Of course, there has been criticism of the way that palm oil plantations have spread in South-East Asia over recent decades. Specifically, the concerns are around deforestation of rainforests and jungle to plant the palm oil monoculture.


There are two environmental concerns in relation to deforestation. Aside from general concerns around the loss of biodiversity, the native forests of Indonesia and Malaysia are the habitats of the Sumatran and Bornean orangutans. Along with illegal logging, clearing of rainforests for oil palm plantations has been blamed for orangutan habitat loss in South-East Asia. This is a particular concern because of the highly endangered status of these animals. There's also concern around carbon emissions. As we know, forests absorb carbon from our atmosphere and lock it up as trees grow. The deforestation process to clear for oil palm plantations is often done by burning. This, essentially, unlocks centuries of carbon absorbed by the forests and releases it into the atmosphere.


These concerns have led to campaigns against palm oil in developed countries like Australia. These campaigns have, in part, advocated an ethical consumption ethos, whereby consumers refrain from purchasing goods that they know contain palm oil. In Australia there are currently no legal requirements to list palm oil specifically as an ingredient. It is usually listed as 'vegetable oil' without a specific indication of which type of vegetable oil it is.


This bill, introduced by Senator Xenophon, seeks to oblige the minister to ensure that palm oil is labelled as such when used as an ingredient in consumer goods, including foods. The bill seeks to enable ethical consumption campaigns so that consumers who want to help save orangutan habitats know which products contain palm oil and can avoid purchasing them. Labor shares Senator Xenophon's concern about the deforestation in South-East Asia not only because of its impact on endangered primate populations but also because of a broader concern about the impacts on our climate. Labor also notes that Senator Xenophon has form in relation to labelling products that contained palm oil. Last time Senator Xenophon attempted to pass a change to the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act as his vehicle for achieving the purpose he now purports to achieve through this bill. It's worth reminding ourselves of that history because it is instructive to this debate. 


In government, Labor recognised that there was significant consumer and industry interest in food labelling, including in the area of environmental food labelling, so we worked through COAG and the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council to commission a comprehensive food-labelling review. This was undertaken by an independent expert panel headed up by Dr Neal Blewett, who was, of course, Minister for Health from 1983 to 1987, and who oversaw the implementation of Medicare. On 28 January 2011, the Gillard government officially released the report Labelling logic. It was the final report of the review of food labelling law and policy. Recommendation 12 of the review referred to labelling of added palm oils to food and it recommended:


That where sugars, fats or vegetable oils are added as separate ingredients in a food, the terms 'added sugars' and 'added fats' and/or 'added vegetable oils' be used in the ingredient list as the generic term, followed by a bracketed list (e.g., added sugars (fructose, glucose, syrup, honey), added fats (palm oil, milk fat) or added vegetable oils (sunflower oil, palm oil)).


In December 2011, the Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation agreed on a response to the recommendations contained in the review. As part of that response, the forum asked the food regulator, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, to work on a number of recommendations, including recommendation 12. Food Standards Australia New Zealand provided that advice in June 2016. In response to their meeting in November 2016, ministers noted that the Food Standards Australia New Zealand technical evaluation identified that labelling of sugars, fats and vegetable oils is a very complex issue. It also identified a number of developments in food labelling and dietary advice since the initial labelling review was undertaken.


Ministers agreed that consideration of the recommendations should continue as two separate pieces of work. One is for the food regulation standing committee to lead policy work on the next steps in relation to naming resources of fats and oils in order to support consumers to make informed choice consistent with the Australian and New Zealand dietary guidelines. In April this year ministers decided to extend the scope of the committee's work to develop regulatory and non-regulatory options for identifying fats and oils on food labels. Labor looks forward to these proposals for comprehensive labelling reform. The government may wish to use this debate to update the parliament on the progress of that work. I say all of that by way of background, but I return to Senator Xenophon's bill.


Senator Xenophon's bill falls short for a few reasons. The first is that the bill amends schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act, which is commonly referred to as the Australian Consumer Law, yet the Australian Consumer Law is not just a Commonwealth act. It was created in consultation with, and is enforced in concert with, states and territories and their respective consumer protection regulators. While I've no doubt as to Senator Xenophon's good intentions, seeking to change the Australian Consumer Law without consulting states and territories is, at best, discourteous and, at worst, undermines the settled agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and territories that underpins our national consumer protection regime.


The second is that the bill singles out palm oil labelling as requiring an explicit reference in the ACL, despite the fact that product labelling reform in Australia continues to be worked out far more broadly. Senator Xenophon seems to be unconcerned, for example, that the government is considering removing the requirement for product measurement markings—the weight or volume of a product—to be marked on the front of a package. They're doing this so as to remove the requirement for European cosmetic companies to relabel their imported make-up, but it can only lead to mums and dads having to spend more time in the supermarket aisle trying to figure out how much product is actually in the packet.


Senator Xenophon also seems to be unconcerned with enshrining the specification of other types of oils or fats—canola oil, for example—in legislation. More generally, the level of specificity that the bill proposes to insert in one section of the Australian Consumer Law is not in keeping with the structure of the rest of schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act. It undermines its structural integrity, fairness and consistency. Like many parts of public policy, product labelling is actually far more nuanced than many realise. Labor is committed to improving Australia's product-labelling requirements, as I've described, but not like this. Labelling reform should be done in the best interests of consumers, it should be done in consultation with relevant stakeholders and it should be done in accordance with the law as well as government agreements.


The third concern Labor has about this bill's inadequacy is that its intent is to prevent deforestation overseas. Notwithstanding our doubts about using Australian consumer law as an instrument of foreign policy, Labor notes that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in their submission to Senator Xenophon's 2011 bill:


There is no evidence to suggest that labelling products which use palm oil would be an effective means to address … concerns of deforestation in South East Asia.


DFAT went on to explain that they believe that the Australian government's $300 million investment in projects to directly address deforestation and illegal logging in South-East Asia would deliver inherent benefits for the region's biodiversity, including orangutan habitats. Also, in its inquiry into Senator Xenophon's previous bill—the Food Standards Amendment (Truth in Labelling—Palm Oil) Bill 2011—the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics could find no evidence that palm oil labelling arrested deforestation and concluded:


The committee is of the view that the Bill would not affect deforestation of orangutan habitats because it will not act on the factors driving deforestation. Deforestation is occurring because Indonesia and Malaysia wish to improve their living standards, and one of the most effective means of doing so is through agriculture. Further, one of the most commercially successful crops in the tropics is palm oil.


Indeed, since Senator Xenophon's last private senator's bill on deforestation in South-East Asia, Australia has not been idle and our national agencies have continued to work directly with the governments of Indonesia and Malaysia on deforestation issues. 


The fourth concern is that it won't work. Under section 134 of schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010—the act this bill seeks to amend—the minister already has the power to make the information standards that Senator Xenophon's bill prescribes. That section clearly says:




134 Making information standards for goods and services



   (1) The Commonwealth Minister may, by written notice published on the internet, make an information standard for one or both of the following:


      (a) goods of a particular kind;


      (b) services of a particular kind.


   (2) Without limiting subsection (1), an information standard for goods or services of a particular kind may:


      (a) make provision in relation to the content of information about goods or services of that kind; or


       (b) require the provision of specified information about goods or services of that kind; or


      (c) provide for the manner or form in which such information is to be provided; or


      (d) provide that such information is not to be provided in a specified manner or form; or


      (e) provide that information of a specified kind is not to be provided about goods or services of that kind; or


      (f) assign a meaning to specified information about goods or services.


Notwithstanding the current long white cloud hanging over the eligibility of Deputy Prime Minister Joyce to sit as a member of the House of Representatives, under current legislation this bill will only become law if the government agrees to it. But if the government is agreeable to implementing an information standard about palm oil or, indeed, about specifying all fats and oils in a product, the bill is redundant because the minister already has the power to do so. Labor respects the work that Senator Xenophon is doing to highlight this important environmental issue. We're ready to work with all comers on the issues around palm oil and the best way to address them. Indeed, Labor is methodically continuing to pursue improvements to Australia's product labelling arrangements in the interests of Australian consumers and will continue to do so.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-08-17,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:11):  I'm very pleased to be speaking today in support of the Nick Xenophon Team's bill to improve the labelling of palm oil in Australian products. My interest in the issue of palm oil and the impact of palm oil plantations on the world's environment dates back about 25 years, when I visited Sumatra. While there, I took the opportunity to spend a few days going on a walk through the Sumatran rainforest. I distinctly remember the experience of walking along a ridge line which had a national park on one side and unprotected forest on the other. What a contrast between the sounds—the amazing calls of the siamang gibbons and the sounds of vibrant, lively forest, absolutely rich with a whole range of different animal species, on one side and the constant roar of bulldozers and chainsaws on the other! It was a very moving experience.


Later in that trip, I visited the Bohorok Orangutan Centre, an orangutan sanctuary near the city of Medan, where I got to see some of the orangutans that had been rescued from the logging and deforestation activities in the surrounding area. To get up close to these orangutans was incredibly moving, to connect with them and to realise that we humans have no right to be sending such a species to extinction. And that's what the clearing of rainforests in Indonesia and Malaysia is doing. It's consigning to extinction these incredibly beautiful, valuable, precious species like orangutans and all the other species that live in these forests.


I came back to Australia pretty fired up. I was already working on Australian forest issues. What could we do about this problem as Australians? This comes to the heart of the bill that's before us today. The very least we can do is give people here in Australia knowledge about the consequences of the food that they eat or the products they use. They should know that, if they use a product or eat a product that contains palm oil, in almost all circumstances—not all, but almost all—it has a direct connection with the clearing of rainforests in Indonesia and Malaysia. By eating those products, they are directly connected to the close extinction of species like orangutans. It is due to that connection that there has been such a focus on palm oil in the Australian community, including from organisations that aren't activist organisations, such as the Melbourne Zoo. It's something that we here in Australia can do. We are empowered. We are able to make those consumer decisions.


There is the bigger question of how to stop the deforestation of tropical rainforests. There are so many ways in which we need to address that. Obviously, the most effective way would be for the governments of Indonesia and Malaysia to say that they will stop it happening by legislating and enforcing that legislation so that rainforest deforestation completely ceases. We, as Australians, can apply pressure. Our government can apply pressure to their governments to stop it happening, but that's an ongoing process. It's not easy for Australians to have the ability to suggest to other sovereign governments what they should be doing. Obviously, there are other international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement on climate, where the importance of stopping deforestation is recognised. There is international pressure on countries to maintain their forest cover and maintain the ability of the globe to soak up the carbon that we are polluting our atmosphere with.


For us here in Australia, the best thing that we have is the ability to act as consumers. In order to be able to act as consumers, we need information, and that's what this bill is aimed at providing people: information about whether the products that they are consuming actually contain palm oil. The other bit of information that we need is certification to account for palm oil that has been produced in a sustainable way. I note that there are still some question marks over the certification scheme and whether sustainably produced palm oil is necessarily sustainably produced, but that is an issue that's not covered by this legislation. The very minimum that we can do in order to have a tangible effect is give the citizens of Australia the opportunity to make informed decisions. I reject the arguments being put by the government today that this is too high a regulatory burden. Again, you're weighing up the value of giving consumers this information versus the regulatory burden. Every time we have had debates in this place about better labelling, we have heard the same tired arguments of the government—'It's going to increase the regulatory burden.' I'm sorry, there are things that we do because they are the right things to do. In fact, when those things are finally followed through, you see that the increased regulatory burden is actually very small and that having that regulation has a very significant impact that far outweighs the small extra cost of, in this case, improving labelling so that people know that palm oil is in the products.


I was interested to hear to Senator Farrell's contribution in terms of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's position—that having such labelling will not stop deforestation. Of course it's not going to stop deforestation in itself, but it's a contributing factor. It's something that we, as Australians, can do. It will make a connection between what's happening in Indonesia and Malaysia. It will put out a very public sign that there is no social licence. It will send a very strong message from Australia that we think that palm oil from plantations that have come from deforestation, the removal of tropical rainforest, is not acceptable.


I want to finish my contribution today by drawing the parallel between what's going on in Indonesia and Malaysia, and the deforestation there and the impact on species like orangutans and gibbons, with what is going on here in Australia. We have ongoing land clearing. In Queensland, we have land clearing of 300,000 hectares a year of woodlands. That is impacting species that are just as significant as the orangutans. They might not have the profile of orangutans, but one of them, koalas, absolutely has. Koala populations in Queensland are being devastated because of land clearing. We've got rare birds like the black-throated finch and we've got the endangered mahogany glider. They are being directly threatened by land clearing. They are endangered and being driven to extinction because of the land clearing that is going on here on our shores. 


For the same reasons we need to have much better information in the public sphere about the potential here in Australia and we should be legislating to make sure this land clearing stops. We don't hear the same calls for the labelling and certification of food production that's the result of the clearing of forests and woodlands in Queensland. I think we should have a certification and labelling system for the food products, the beef and the lamb, that come from the land that's being cleared in Queensland. There should be similar labelling on Australian products.


We've got the issue of the land clearing in Queensland; we also have the issue of the ongoing logging of our native forests in Australia, where there are other endangered species. These include the Leadbeater's possum as well as the threatened swift parrot in Tasmania. They are being driven to extinction because of the commercial pressures on our native forests. We should have labelling that shows people where the products have come from, so people know that if they're buying mountain ash products, timber products, that are coming from the central highlands of Victoria, they are directly contributing to Leadbeater's possums being threatened and heading to extinction. 


At the very least, if we had that labelling, we also need to make sure that certification schemes are meaningful so that people have the information about the wood products that are coming from Australian forests and plantations. It is about the whole issue of giving people adequate information. We know that there are two competing certification systems for wood products in Australia. There's the Australian Forestry Standard, which is hardly worth the paper it's written on. All it basically says is that the forest operations have been conducted in accordance with the current government law. As we know, that allows the ongoing destruction of really rich and diverse forests. The FSC certification, the Forest Stewardship Council, is a much stronger certification. In terms of giving the community information, it is something that people should be looking for. We've got plantation wood products here in Australia that meet the FSC certification. If people are concerned about labelling and if they're concerned about the protection of forests when purchasing wood products, I would encourage them to look for FSC certification rather than anything else. 


Coming back to this bill, it is a step forward and it is something that we as Australians can use. It is a relatively small thing for this parliament to agree to. Coming back to Senator Farrell's contribution that it actually won't be very meaningful because the minister already has the power, that the minister may move to allow such labelling—that's the whole point. The minister may move to do it but he or she has not moved to do it in the past. There hasn't been the political will to move on this sort of labelling. So this legislation would shift that from a 'may' to saying, 'This is something that has to happen.' It has to happen in the interests of giving Australians the information they need so that rather than contributing to ongoing environmentally destructive deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia, they can be making choices and decisions when purchasing these products that will be consistent with providing a much more sustainable future for us all. Thank you.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-08-17,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:24):  I want to thank the Nick Xenophon Team and Senator Kakoschke-Moore in particular for bringing forward the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Truth in Labelling—Palm Oil) Bill 2017. I think it's an interesting, timely and important debate for us to have. I have to say that you learn a lot by becoming an Australian senator. There are certain topics and issues that perhaps weren't the kinds of experiences that you may have had prior to coming into this place. I note that Senator Rice was outlining her experiences, having visited some of the areas that have been deforested, and the horrible things that palm oil has done to those communities. My own experiences with palm oil are nowhere near as serious or as significant. My understanding of it prior to coming into this chamber was as a product that my relatives used to put in their hair from time to time, and that created a devastation of its own kind, though nowhere near equivalent! That was a joke, Senator Rice. You're allowed to laugh now!


The intention of this bill I think is a good one. The intention of this bill is to draw attention and try and give consumers the power to make informed decisions when it comes to something like palm oil, being very conscious of the impact that it has in South-East Asia. That, as a point of principle, I think is quite a powerful one. In a strange way, I would even go so far as to say that I know others in the past, like Senator Leyonhjelm, with a strong libertarian perspective, have always supported the principle and the idea that people should be able to make informed decisions for themselves and that it leads to better outcomes when people are able to make those decisions.


The question, though, isn't whether or not those of us here believe that what is happening in the deforestation in South-East Asia is a good thing. Obviously it's not. The debate here is not about whether or not consumers should have as much information as possible and a broad right to know. I believe there is a universal view that informed consumers make better consumers and that people have the right to have an understanding so they can make decisions for themselves. But I do worry, I really worry, when we start going down the path of using labelling as the solution to everything, as a kind of very easy fix that we place on things, which is, 'If this is just labelled this way or that's labelled this way, then everything's going to be okay.' In fact, one could easily argue that there are a huge series of complexities with labelling, putting aside the many intersecting federal and state rules, regulations, agreements, laws, harmonisation and labelling structures that go on. Putting all that aside, there is also the point, worth making, that, when we place too much information in a lot of these labelling processes, we end up with a result in which the consumer ends up being less, not more, informed.


We found this where I spent a lot of my time in the Senate, working with financial services and financial service disclosures. I note that Senator Bushby, who also worked on these matters over a long period of time, was well aware that part of what we all, in a bipartisan manner, realised was wrong with the financial services industry wasn't that we weren't putting the obligation on companies to provide enough information; it was that so much information was being provided. People were getting 20- or 30-page disclosure statements that were incomprehensible and meaningless. That sense of overdisclosure, the tactic of 'snowing' people with information, actually made it more difficult for people to make informed choices and informed decisions.


I worry that it's sometimes a very, very easy fix, especially for politicians, to say: 'Just label it better. The issue's always going to be labelling. It's going to be simple; it's going to be labelling.' There are obviously challenges around labelling, but—and this is the debate—taking something like this one issue in isolation and treating it differently, breaking down the complicated processes we already have in place, the complicated structures, the complicated systems, the interweaving of federal and state relations when it comes to labelling, simply because we decide that this one issue of palm oil is particularly one that we're going to address, I think it opens a Pandora's box. I really do.


It worries me that we're making a series of special cases for this one product. If this were going to be presented as part of a broader debate—through the COAG process or through other formal processes for us to be able to have a debate within a broad structure—it is something that could be supported. I don't believe that what is happening here achieves the objectives that are wanted.


I note something that Senator Farrell said earlier, because I think it's the most important point here. It is that this bill just won't work. Under section 134 of schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, the act this bill seeks to amend, the minister already has the power to make the information standard that Senator Xenophon's bill describes. That section clearly says 




Making information standards for goods and services



(1)  The Commonwealth Minister may, by written notice published on the internet, make an information standard—


Then it goes through and explains that. I urge anyone who is interested to google it.


So there are steps that can be taken. I do have my own concerns about the path we have chosen to take. While very legitimate points are being made about deforestation and its consequences, and about making sure that Australian people are aware of the consequences of using palm oil, I don't believe this bill achieves the objectives that it sets out to. Nonetheless, I think the fact that we are debating these issues in the Senate and that we are raising awareness should be congratulated. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Kakoschke-Moore, Sen Skye",NXT,2017-08-17,"



Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (09:35):  When you are shopping for your weekly groceries at the supermarket and you turn over the packet to read the ingredients on a bag of chips, a block of chocolate or a box of biscuits, you would expect that what you see is what you get. But, believe it or not, that is not always the case. What is being hidden from us is potentially impacting our health and destroying the environment. Palm oil is one of the world's leading agricultural commodities and is widely used. In fact, palm oil can be found in approximately 40 per cent of food products at the supermarket, and every year the average Australian consumes around 10 kilos of palm oil without even knowing it. That is because, under the current food labelling laws, manufacturers are able to label palm oil as vegetable oil on the packaging. For starters, the palm is a fruit, not a vegetable. Secondly, palm oil is high in saturated fat and low in polyunsaturated fat, and, according to the Heart Foundation, biomedical research indicates that the consumption of palm oil increases the risk of heart disease. Thirdly, in South-East Asia alone, the equivalent of 300 soccer fields is deforested every hour for palm oil plantation, and each year more than 1,000 orangutans die as a result of the land clearing in this region. 


There is no question that the current labelling laws are inadequate and are misleading consumers. The fact that palm oil is allowed to be disguised as vegetable oil means that Australians aren't able to make an informed choice for themselves and for their family about what they buy at the supermarket because they are not being given all of the facts. In 2011, when my NXT colleague Senator Xenophon first introduced a bill to strengthen labelling laws for food containing palm oil, Zoos Victoria, Adelaide Zoo and Auckland Zoo in New Zealand launched the Don't Palm Us Off campaign, calling for palm oil to be labelled specifically on food packaging. In the first 12 months of that campaign, more than 130,000 people signed on to show their concern about palm oil. In November 2016, Zoos Victoria relaunched the same campaign, this time attracting a staggering 160,000 signatures. 


But the concerns of Australians are falling on deaf ears. Still nothing has been done to ensure consumers can easily determine if the products they are purchasing contain palm oil. In 2011, when Senator Xenophon's previous bill was debated in the Senate, the following remarks were made during the second reading debate by the coalition, who were then in opposition:


There are many processes. They go on for a long time. As Senator Siewert outlined, this has been proposed for many years. But there has been no action. So the coalition, in supporting this bill, is simply saying consumers have the right to know what is in the food and goods they purchase. We believe this will improve consumers' ability to make informed choices.


The community is backing these reforms. Some manufacturers are backing these reforms. It seems that, when the coalition was in opposition, they were also backing these reforms. So why isn't it compulsory for palm oil to be specifically listed as an ingredient on all packaging? Put simply, if the saying 'We are what we eat' is true, then we have the right to know what we are eating, and this bill will give consumers truthful, accurate and clear information about what they are purchasing. In the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations requires that each individual fat and/or oil ingredient of a food is to be declared by its specific common or usual name—that is, palm oil is listed as palm oil. Similarly, under the provisions of this bill, regardless of the amount of palm oil used in the product, palm oil must be listed as an ingredient. 


It is important to be clear that this bill is not calling for a boycott of products which contain palm oil; rather, it is designed to enable consumers to know the whole truth about the ingredients a particular product contains so that they can make their own informed choice prior to purchase. Just like the inclusion of wheat in a product is labelled to inform consumers with possible allergies, so too should shoppers be told that palm oil is contained in a particular food product. When Senator Xenophon announced his intention to move his bill back in 2010, he was contacted by dozens of people outraged that they didn't know and couldn't tell that palm oil was an ingredient in their food. Unfortunately, not much has changed in those seven years. The Nick Xenophon Team shares those frustrations. Consumers should be able to trust that, when the list of ingredients is printed on the packaging, all the ingredients are included on that list.


On the issue of conservation, palm oil can be produced sustainably and manufacturers should be encouraged to use certified sustainable palm oil rather than palm oil which is produced as a result of deforestation and a loss of wildlife habitat. In Malaysia and Indonesia, for example, a farmer will chop down all the trees on his land and sell the timber for money. He will then burn the stumps and plant oil palm, which is fast growing. He will crush the fruit to produce palm oil and he can sell the shells of the palm fruit as food for cattle. By cutting down the trees, orangutans lose their habitat. In fact, 90 per cent of orangutan habitat has been lost already. It is forecast that, at the current rate of deforestation, orangutans could be extinct in the wild in fewer than 10 years. On a broader scale, the environmental impact of deforestation is significant. How can we be serious about looking after the environment when we're not encouraging businesses to farm sustainably?


Palm oil can be produced sustainably under criteria set out by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. Sustainable palm oil plantations are established in already cleared land rather than through deforestation. The roundtable's criteria also includes requirements for reforestation along the river line, bans on pesticides, appropriate labour conditions and wildlife-friendly practices. Manufacturers who use certified sustainable palm oil will be able to list the use of the ingredient as CS palm oil to indicate its sustainable origins and to show consumers that they are sourcing their ingredient from a sustainable palm oil plantation. This bill will encourage food manufacturers to purchase from sustainable palm oil producers and will provide consumers with all the information they need to make their own choice. 


Calling palm oil vegetable oil is misleading. Not telling Australians that palm oil is one of the ingredients in or used to make a product is unfair. There have been some significant changes to food labelling laws made in this parliament and the NXT welcomes these changes. However, more can be done and the discontent felt by the community at the lack of action on this issue is growing. Consumers have a right to know and this bill gives them that right.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-08-17,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (09:43):  I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I congratulate the Nick Xenophon Team for bringing this important issue before the Senate. I don't doubt for a moment the very genuine sincerity of the Nick Xenophon Team in seeking to address an issue that many Australians are concerned about. However, the government does not support the bill. I will outline some of the concerns the government has about the proposed bill and some of the reasons why the government has reservations about this approach to tackling this issue.


We absolutely understand that Australian consumers are concerned about the ingredients in the products they purchase for themselves and their families. Primarily, what consumers want to know about the food they eat is that it's safe and that the household products that they purchase will not harm them or their families. This is how consumers make decisions about the products that they buy. They are also concerned, very critically, about the price of the products that they buy and they want to receive good value for those products. That's something we should never lose sight of. 


The other issues that consumers do and should take into account when buying products include environmental concerns. However, the purpose of government regulation for labelling is first and foremost, as it should be, about the health and safety of consumers and ensuring that consumers get the information they need so that they can make informed choices, including on environmental matters, if they so choose.


Palm oil is a product that is widely used in the foods and products that Australian households use every day. As the bill acknowledges, there is a difference between the sustainable production of palm oil and the production of palm oil that damages the environment, and the habitat of orangutans in particular. It is worth pausing and reflecting on that for a moment. Not all palm oil is bad, and there are ways and means of harvesting palm oil that are environmentally sustainable and do not have a negative impact on animal life. That is a very critical thing, because sometimes in this debate you are left with the impression that palm oil is an evil product that only does harm, when in fact that is not the case.


Currently, manufacturers and importers can—and many do—voluntarily declare in the ingredient list on their labels that there is palm oil in their products. Many businesses operating in Australia are taking action on this issue and seeking to use sustainable palm oil in the products that they manufacture and sell. In addition, these businesses clearly label the use of palm oil. If we think about it, that makes perfect sense. Businesses are aware of and responding to a consumer preference. They know that this issue is of concern to consumers and they're providing consumers with the information to make an educated choice about their purchases. That is something we should welcome. In addition, I think it is very promising and welcome to see that many companies are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which promotes the supply of palm oil that is sourced from eco-friendly areas. 


Voluntary certification allows businesses to provide information to consumers, who may be motivated by social, environmental, economic or other ethical concerns, by labelling their products as using sustainable palm oil. Voluntary certification is a really powerful tool that is used in a range of areas. Everyone will be familiar with, for example, the Heart Foundation's tick of approval. It's not government mandated; it is not compulsory; but many consumers value that Heart Foundation tick of approval in making their choices in the supermarket. It allows them to choose products which are healthier for them and their families. This solves the problem in the market without any government intervention. There are consumers who are motivated to buy products of this type, there is a private certifier who is willing to certify that products meet these standards, and there are businesses who want to ensure that their products receive this certification and meet those standards so that they can reach those consumers. Not every business wants to participate in this, and not every product will be labelled in this way. But if you are a consumer for whom this is an important issue then there is the necessary information in the marketplace for you to make an informed choice, and it didn't require any government regulation. 


There are lots of other examples like the Heart Foundation's tick of approval—for example, many of the Fairtrade and organic-certified products are done in a completely private-sector way, with no government regulation requiring it. There are other companies that choose to market their products based primarily on their environmental sustainability. A good example is—and this followed some media controversy—companies that sell tuna and choose to emphasise that it is sustainably harvested and dolphin-free. No government required them to do that, but they've gone out and done that because they know that it's important to consumers. This is now beginning to take place in the palm oil space, and I think that's a very welcome development. 


The private senator's bill that Senator Kakoschke-Moore has outlined proposes to amend schedule 2—Australian Consumer Law—of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. The Australian Consumer Law provides broad protections for consumers by ensuring that the information that businesses provide is not false, misleading or deceptive. The proposal to amend the ACL by inserting a new section 134A would require the government to make an information standard specifically relating to the labelling of goods containing palm oil within 12 months of the bill's passage. Importantly, this would include all goods that contain any amount of palm oil as an ingredient, including foods, shampoos, cosmetics and washing powders. To my knowledge, it doesn't differentiate between palm oil that is sustainably harvested and other palm oil; it just requires that any use of palm oil be labelled. Given that we know that some palm oil is unsustainably harvested and problematic but some is harvested in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way, this is one area of concern. 


The explanatory memorandum to the bill states that the amendment is for the purpose of environmental protection. This is not consistent with the role of the Australian Consumer Law. The purpose of the Australian Consumer Law is to improve consumer wellbeing through consumer empowerment and protection to foster effective competition and enable confident participation in markets. It is not the purpose of Australian Consumer Law to impose an obligation on businesses to provide all of the information that consumers may find useful in deciding whether or not to purchase a product. The Consumer Law is there to protect consumers from false and misleading representations that may appear on the label. Of course, it is not practical to mandate that every piece of potentially useful information is on the label of every product. There is a limited amount of real estate to do so. If we required companies to provide every potential piece of relevant information, there would be no room for anything else on a product's label other than government-mandated warnings and information.


This bill is motivated by genuine environmental concerns about deforestation—particularly in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia—but it is not particularly motivated by a concern that consumers are being misled about the nature of the goods or that palm oil poses a safety issue for consumers, which is the primary purpose of the Australian Consumer Law. 


The explanatory memorandum also provides that the proposed bill encourages the use of certified sustainable palm oil. However, there is nothing in the wording of the bill that would make such a proposal enforceable, nor is the Consumer Law the appropriate vehicle for environmental protection measures, as I've mentioned. The Consumer Law's objectives are to ensure that consumers are not disadvantaged when they engage in trade or commerce and that they are protected from unfair practices.


Importantly, the bill is also inconsistent with the requirements of the Intergovernmental Agreement for the Australian Consumer Law, which requires that any amendment to the Australian Consumer Law—including the making of information and standards—is subject to formal consultation and voting by states and territories. This process has not been followed with this bill—and it's worth noting that this intergovernmental agreement process is, in fact, not a coalition government process but a Labor process that was put in place by the previous government. 


If the proposed bill was successful, there is a very real possibility that the states and territories may decide not to apply the provision because the changes were not made in accordance with the intergovernmental agreement. This is appropriate, given many areas of consumer law are regulated by the states. In addition, while it's possible to insert such a provision, it would potentially be legally ineffective in compelling the minister to make an information standard—that is, the bill could have no effect.


The proposed amendment to the Australian Consumer Law is inconsistent with the generic nature of Australian consumer law, which is currently sufficiently broad enough to cover conduct relating to the representation of ingredients such as palm oil. The passage of the bill has the potential to erode the benefits of having a national, generic, consistent consumer law. Information standards are only considered as a regulatory option after other responses have been considered as insufficient and where there is strong evidence of consumer detriment or widespread noncompliance. To date, the government does not believe there has been strong evidence of consumer detriment presented.


The bill has not been subject to any regulatory impact analysis. The proposal would likely impose significant compliance costs on businesses, including the cost of designing new labels and potentially relabelling existing products. It would also potentially require stringent record keeping and information transfer procedures as the bill requires all products containing any palm oil be labelled—as I said before, even if it is not necessarily harmful or in meaningful amounts.


The labelling of palm oil or palm oil derived chemicals in cosmetics and products is already regulated through the Trade Practices (Consumer Product Information Standards) (Cosmetic) Regulations 1991. This information standard requires that cosmetic products list all ingredients or palm oil derived chemicals. While the Australian Consumer Law is not the appropriate place to deal with these issues, the Australian government is taking action in other areas. 


The government acknowledges that there is community interest and concern in the use and labelling of palm oil as an ingredient in food products in particular. The government is well aware of the issue of palm oil in foods and is currently examining these issues with our state and territory colleagues. Currently, the labelling of added fats—including palm oil and sugars—in food is being considered by the Australian and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation, with regulatory and non-regulatory options being developed. This is the appropriate forum to consider food labelling.


Currently, manufacturers do not have to list palm oil as an ingredient in food. They can, as Senator Kakoschke-Moore mentioned, use a generic term such as 'vegetable oil'. The issue of food labelling should be left to be considered in detail by the forum. This is important work, and it would be inappropriate for this bill to circumvent that process. The government must endeavour to balance improving the information on food labels to meet consumers' needs against maintaining the marketing flexibility and minimising the regulatory burden on industry and barriers to trade.


It's worth reflecting on the previous bill that Senator Xenophon introduced in 2011, which was called the Food Standards Amendment (Truth in Labelling—Palm Oil) Bill 2011. It sought to amend section 33 of the Australian Consumer Law. That bill was introduced and read for the first time on 4 July 2011. The bill was subsequently removed from the Notice Paper on 20 March, 2012, during the 43rd parliament. The 2011 bill was examined by the House Standing Committee on Economics. On 19 September, 2011, the House Standing Committee on Economics presented its report recommending that the House of Representatives at the time should not pass that Food Standards Amendment (Truth in Labelling—Palm Oil) Bill because the legislation was flawed and would result in a range of unintended consequences. The government members of the day—and I should point out that they were Labor members—recommended that the House not pass the bill.


Coalition opposition members at the time were also concerned about the bill. They particularly mentioned the trade related considerations raised in evidence to the committee. The coalition members were concerned that this issue was only briefly touched upon in a Senate inquiry report and that the evidence presented to the committee highlighted Australia's trade obligations as a legitimate area of public policy concern. Evidence to the committee highlighted a number of trade related risks. Opposition members at the time—coalition members—recognised that it may well be arguable that the bill offended World Trade Organization rules by indirectly advancing the interests of local vegetable oil production that may be a substitute for palm oil products and may invoke potentially harmful retaliatory action and lengthy dispute resolution processes.


These are the reasons the government is reluctant to support the bill, while still respecting the genuine motivations of the Nick Xenophon Team in raising this issue.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2017-08-17,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:57):  I rise to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Truth in Labelling—Palm Oil) Bill 2017. Palm oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from the pulp of oil palm fruits. Oil can also be derived from the kernel of the same fruit, but this is usually referred to as palm kernel oil. Palm oil is around half saturated fats, which is uncommon for vegetable fats. It is semisolid at room temperature. It's a common cooking ingredient in the tropical belt. Palm oil is also used extensively in the commercial processed food industry as it is cheaper than competitors like canola oil. It also yields more oil per hectare than any other vegetable oil. Palm oil's semi-solid state at room temperature also makes it suitable as a cheap substitute for butter or other shortening in baking. Interestingly, during the industrial revolution, palm oil became sought after by British traders in Asia and Africa for use as an industrial lubricant for machinery. It can also form the basis of soap products. It's part of the derivative behind the Palmolive soap brand—the other, of course, being olive oil.


The bulk of the world's palm oil is produced in Indonesia and Malaysia. Eighty five per cent of global production comes from these two countries. Indonesia produces 50 million tonnes per year while Malaysia produces 20 million tonnes. People in both countries have benefited significantly from economic development achieved through expanded palm oil agriculture and export. Of course, there has been criticism of the way that palm oil plantations have spread in South-East Asia over recent decades. Specifically, the concerns are around deforestation of rainforests and jungle to plant the palm oil monoculture.


There are two environmental concerns in relation to deforestation. Aside from general concerns around the loss of biodiversity, the native forests of Indonesia and Malaysia are the habitats of the Sumatran and Bornean orangutans. Along with illegal logging, clearing of rainforests for oil palm plantations has been blamed for orangutan habitat loss in South-East Asia. This is a particular concern because of the highly endangered status of these animals. There's also concern around carbon emissions. As we know, forests absorb carbon from our atmosphere and lock it up as trees grow. The deforestation process to clear for oil palm plantations is often done by burning. This, essentially, unlocks centuries of carbon absorbed by the forests and releases it into the atmosphere.


These concerns have led to campaigns against palm oil in developed countries like Australia. These campaigns have, in part, advocated an ethical consumption ethos, whereby consumers refrain from purchasing goods that they know contain palm oil. In Australia there are currently no legal requirements to list palm oil specifically as an ingredient. It is usually listed as 'vegetable oil' without a specific indication of which type of vegetable oil it is.


This bill, introduced by Senator Xenophon, seeks to oblige the minister to ensure that palm oil is labelled as such when used as an ingredient in consumer goods, including foods. The bill seeks to enable ethical consumption campaigns so that consumers who want to help save orangutan habitats know which products contain palm oil and can avoid purchasing them. Labor shares Senator Xenophon's concern about the deforestation in South-East Asia not only because of its impact on endangered primate populations but also because of a broader concern about the impacts on our climate. Labor also notes that Senator Xenophon has form in relation to labelling products that contained palm oil. Last time Senator Xenophon attempted to pass a change to the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act as his vehicle for achieving the purpose he now purports to achieve through this bill. It's worth reminding ourselves of that history because it is instructive to this debate. 


In government, Labor recognised that there was significant consumer and industry interest in food labelling, including in the area of environmental food labelling, so we worked through COAG and the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council to commission a comprehensive food-labelling review. This was undertaken by an independent expert panel headed up by Dr Neal Blewett, who was, of course, Minister for Health from 1983 to 1987, and who oversaw the implementation of Medicare. On 28 January 2011, the Gillard government officially released the report Labelling logic. It was the final report of the review of food labelling law and policy. Recommendation 12 of the review referred to labelling of added palm oils to food and it recommended:


That where sugars, fats or vegetable oils are added as separate ingredients in a food, the terms 'added sugars' and 'added fats' and/or 'added vegetable oils' be used in the ingredient list as the generic term, followed by a bracketed list (e.g., added sugars (fructose, glucose, syrup, honey), added fats (palm oil, milk fat) or added vegetable oils (sunflower oil, palm oil)).


In December 2011, the Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation agreed on a response to the recommendations contained in the review. As part of that response, the forum asked the food regulator, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, to work on a number of recommendations, including recommendation 12. Food Standards Australia New Zealand provided that advice in June 2016. In response to their meeting in November 2016, ministers noted that the Food Standards Australia New Zealand technical evaluation identified that labelling of sugars, fats and vegetable oils is a very complex issue. It also identified a number of developments in food labelling and dietary advice since the initial labelling review was undertaken.


Ministers agreed that consideration of the recommendations should continue as two separate pieces of work. One is for the food regulation standing committee to lead policy work on the next steps in relation to naming resources of fats and oils in order to support consumers to make informed choice consistent with the Australian and New Zealand dietary guidelines. In April this year ministers decided to extend the scope of the committee's work to develop regulatory and non-regulatory options for identifying fats and oils on food labels. Labor looks forward to these proposals for comprehensive labelling reform. The government may wish to use this debate to update the parliament on the progress of that work. I say all of that by way of background, but I return to Senator Xenophon's bill.


Senator Xenophon's bill falls short for a few reasons. The first is that the bill amends schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act, which is commonly referred to as the Australian Consumer Law, yet the Australian Consumer Law is not just a Commonwealth act. It was created in consultation with, and is enforced in concert with, states and territories and their respective consumer protection regulators. While I've no doubt as to Senator Xenophon's good intentions, seeking to change the Australian Consumer Law without consulting states and territories is, at best, discourteous and, at worst, undermines the settled agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and territories that underpins our national consumer protection regime.


The second is that the bill singles out palm oil labelling as requiring an explicit reference in the ACL, despite the fact that product labelling reform in Australia continues to be worked out far more broadly. Senator Xenophon seems to be unconcerned, for example, that the government is considering removing the requirement for product measurement markings—the weight or volume of a product—to be marked on the front of a package. They're doing this so as to remove the requirement for European cosmetic companies to relabel their imported make-up, but it can only lead to mums and dads having to spend more time in the supermarket aisle trying to figure out how much product is actually in the packet.


Senator Xenophon also seems to be unconcerned with enshrining the specification of other types of oils or fats—canola oil, for example—in legislation. More generally, the level of specificity that the bill proposes to insert in one section of the Australian Consumer Law is not in keeping with the structure of the rest of schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act. It undermines its structural integrity, fairness and consistency. Like many parts of public policy, product labelling is actually far more nuanced than many realise. Labor is committed to improving Australia's product-labelling requirements, as I've described, but not like this. Labelling reform should be done in the best interests of consumers, it should be done in consultation with relevant stakeholders and it should be done in accordance with the law as well as government agreements.


The third concern Labor has about this bill's inadequacy is that its intent is to prevent deforestation overseas. Notwithstanding our doubts about using Australian consumer law as an instrument of foreign policy, Labor notes that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in their submission to Senator Xenophon's 2011 bill:


There is no evidence to suggest that labelling products which use palm oil would be an effective means to address … concerns of deforestation in South East Asia.


DFAT went on to explain that they believe that the Australian government's $300 million investment in projects to directly address deforestation and illegal logging in South-East Asia would deliver inherent benefits for the region's biodiversity, including orangutan habitats. Also, in its inquiry into Senator Xenophon's previous bill—the Food Standards Amendment (Truth in Labelling—Palm Oil) Bill 2011—the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics could find no evidence that palm oil labelling arrested deforestation and concluded:


The committee is of the view that the Bill would not affect deforestation of orangutan habitats because it will not act on the factors driving deforestation. Deforestation is occurring because Indonesia and Malaysia wish to improve their living standards, and one of the most effective means of doing so is through agriculture. Further, one of the most commercially successful crops in the tropics is palm oil.


Indeed, since Senator Xenophon's last private senator's bill on deforestation in South-East Asia, Australia has not been idle and our national agencies have continued to work directly with the governments of Indonesia and Malaysia on deforestation issues. 


The fourth concern is that it won't work. Under section 134 of schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010—the act this bill seeks to amend—the minister already has the power to make the information standards that Senator Xenophon's bill prescribes. That section clearly says:




134 Making information standards for goods and services



   (1) The Commonwealth Minister may, by written notice published on the internet, make an information standard for one or both of the following:


      (a) goods of a particular kind;


      (b) services of a particular kind.


   (2) Without limiting subsection (1), an information standard for goods or services of a particular kind may:


      (a) make provision in relation to the content of information about goods or services of that kind; or


       (b) require the provision of specified information about goods or services of that kind; or


      (c) provide for the manner or form in which such information is to be provided; or


      (d) provide that such information is not to be provided in a specified manner or form; or


      (e) provide that information of a specified kind is not to be provided about goods or services of that kind; or


      (f) assign a meaning to specified information about goods or services.


Notwithstanding the current long white cloud hanging over the eligibility of Deputy Prime Minister Joyce to sit as a member of the House of Representatives, under current legislation this bill will only become law if the government agrees to it. But if the government is agreeable to implementing an information standard about palm oil or, indeed, about specifying all fats and oils in a product, the bill is redundant because the minister already has the power to do so. Labor respects the work that Senator Xenophon is doing to highlight this important environmental issue. We're ready to work with all comers on the issues around palm oil and the best way to address them. Indeed, Labor is methodically continuing to pursue improvements to Australia's product labelling arrangements in the interests of Australian consumers and will continue to do so.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-08-17,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:11):  I'm very pleased to be speaking today in support of the Nick Xenophon Team's bill to improve the labelling of palm oil in Australian products. My interest in the issue of palm oil and the impact of palm oil plantations on the world's environment dates back about 25 years, when I visited Sumatra. While there, I took the opportunity to spend a few days going on a walk through the Sumatran rainforest. I distinctly remember the experience of walking along a ridge line which had a national park on one side and unprotected forest on the other. What a contrast between the sounds—the amazing calls of the siamang gibbons and the sounds of vibrant, lively forest, absolutely rich with a whole range of different animal species, on one side and the constant roar of bulldozers and chainsaws on the other! It was a very moving experience.


Later in that trip, I visited the Bohorok Orangutan Centre, an orangutan sanctuary near the city of Medan, where I got to see some of the orangutans that had been rescued from the logging and deforestation activities in the surrounding area. To get up close to these orangutans was incredibly moving, to connect with them and to realise that we humans have no right to be sending such a species to extinction. And that's what the clearing of rainforests in Indonesia and Malaysia is doing. It's consigning to extinction these incredibly beautiful, valuable, precious species like orangutans and all the other species that live in these forests.


I came back to Australia pretty fired up. I was already working on Australian forest issues. What could we do about this problem as Australians? This comes to the heart of the bill that's before us today. The very least we can do is give people here in Australia knowledge about the consequences of the food that they eat or the products they use. They should know that, if they use a product or eat a product that contains palm oil, in almost all circumstances—not all, but almost all—it has a direct connection with the clearing of rainforests in Indonesia and Malaysia. By eating those products, they are directly connected to the close extinction of species like orangutans. It is due to that connection that there has been such a focus on palm oil in the Australian community, including from organisations that aren't activist organisations, such as the Melbourne Zoo. It's something that we here in Australia can do. We are empowered. We are able to make those consumer decisions.


There is the bigger question of how to stop the deforestation of tropical rainforests. There are so many ways in which we need to address that. Obviously, the most effective way would be for the governments of Indonesia and Malaysia to say that they will stop it happening by legislating and enforcing that legislation so that rainforest deforestation completely ceases. We, as Australians, can apply pressure. Our government can apply pressure to their governments to stop it happening, but that's an ongoing process. It's not easy for Australians to have the ability to suggest to other sovereign governments what they should be doing. Obviously, there are other international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement on climate, where the importance of stopping deforestation is recognised. There is international pressure on countries to maintain their forest cover and maintain the ability of the globe to soak up the carbon that we are polluting our atmosphere with.


For us here in Australia, the best thing that we have is the ability to act as consumers. In order to be able to act as consumers, we need information, and that's what this bill is aimed at providing people: information about whether the products that they are consuming actually contain palm oil. The other bit of information that we need is certification to account for palm oil that has been produced in a sustainable way. I note that there are still some question marks over the certification scheme and whether sustainably produced palm oil is necessarily sustainably produced, but that is an issue that's not covered by this legislation. The very minimum that we can do in order to have a tangible effect is give the citizens of Australia the opportunity to make informed decisions. I reject the arguments being put by the government today that this is too high a regulatory burden. Again, you're weighing up the value of giving consumers this information versus the regulatory burden. Every time we have had debates in this place about better labelling, we have heard the same tired arguments of the government—'It's going to increase the regulatory burden.' I'm sorry, there are things that we do because they are the right things to do. In fact, when those things are finally followed through, you see that the increased regulatory burden is actually very small and that having that regulation has a very significant impact that far outweighs the small extra cost of, in this case, improving labelling so that people know that palm oil is in the products.


I was interested to hear to Senator Farrell's contribution in terms of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's position—that having such labelling will not stop deforestation. Of course it's not going to stop deforestation in itself, but it's a contributing factor. It's something that we, as Australians, can do. It will make a connection between what's happening in Indonesia and Malaysia. It will put out a very public sign that there is no social licence. It will send a very strong message from Australia that we think that palm oil from plantations that have come from deforestation, the removal of tropical rainforest, is not acceptable.


I want to finish my contribution today by drawing the parallel between what's going on in Indonesia and Malaysia, and the deforestation there and the impact on species like orangutans and gibbons, with what is going on here in Australia. We have ongoing land clearing. In Queensland, we have land clearing of 300,000 hectares a year of woodlands. That is impacting species that are just as significant as the orangutans. They might not have the profile of orangutans, but one of them, koalas, absolutely has. Koala populations in Queensland are being devastated because of land clearing. We've got rare birds like the black-throated finch and we've got the endangered mahogany glider. They are being directly threatened by land clearing. They are endangered and being driven to extinction because of the land clearing that is going on here on our shores. 


For the same reasons we need to have much better information in the public sphere about the potential here in Australia and we should be legislating to make sure this land clearing stops. We don't hear the same calls for the labelling and certification of food production that's the result of the clearing of forests and woodlands in Queensland. I think we should have a certification and labelling system for the food products, the beef and the lamb, that come from the land that's being cleared in Queensland. There should be similar labelling on Australian products.


We've got the issue of the land clearing in Queensland; we also have the issue of the ongoing logging of our native forests in Australia, where there are other endangered species. These include the Leadbeater's possum as well as the threatened swift parrot in Tasmania. They are being driven to extinction because of the commercial pressures on our native forests. We should have labelling that shows people where the products have come from, so people know that if they're buying mountain ash products, timber products, that are coming from the central highlands of Victoria, they are directly contributing to Leadbeater's possums being threatened and heading to extinction. 


At the very least, if we had that labelling, we also need to make sure that certification schemes are meaningful so that people have the information about the wood products that are coming from Australian forests and plantations. It is about the whole issue of giving people adequate information. We know that there are two competing certification systems for wood products in Australia. There's the Australian Forestry Standard, which is hardly worth the paper it's written on. All it basically says is that the forest operations have been conducted in accordance with the current government law. As we know, that allows the ongoing destruction of really rich and diverse forests. The FSC certification, the Forest Stewardship Council, is a much stronger certification. In terms of giving the community information, it is something that people should be looking for. We've got plantation wood products here in Australia that meet the FSC certification. If people are concerned about labelling and if they're concerned about the protection of forests when purchasing wood products, I would encourage them to look for FSC certification rather than anything else. 


Coming back to this bill, it is a step forward and it is something that we as Australians can use. It is a relatively small thing for this parliament to agree to. Coming back to Senator Farrell's contribution that it actually won't be very meaningful because the minister already has the power, that the minister may move to allow such labelling—that's the whole point. The minister may move to do it but he or she has not moved to do it in the past. There hasn't been the political will to move on this sort of labelling. So this legislation would shift that from a 'may' to saying, 'This is something that has to happen.' It has to happen in the interests of giving Australians the information they need so that rather than contributing to ongoing environmentally destructive deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia, they can be making choices and decisions when purchasing these products that will be consistent with providing a much more sustainable future for us all. Thank you.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-08-17,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:24):  I want to thank the Nick Xenophon Team and Senator Kakoschke-Moore in particular for bringing forward the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Truth in Labelling—Palm Oil) Bill 2017. I think it's an interesting, timely and important debate for us to have. I have to say that you learn a lot by becoming an Australian senator. There are certain topics and issues that perhaps weren't the kinds of experiences that you may have had prior to coming into this place. I note that Senator Rice was outlining her experiences, having visited some of the areas that have been deforested, and the horrible things that palm oil has done to those communities. My own experiences with palm oil are nowhere near as serious or as significant. My understanding of it prior to coming into this chamber was as a product that my relatives used to put in their hair from time to time, and that created a devastation of its own kind, though nowhere near equivalent! That was a joke, Senator Rice. You're allowed to laugh now!


The intention of this bill I think is a good one. The intention of this bill is to draw attention and try and give consumers the power to make informed decisions when it comes to something like palm oil, being very conscious of the impact that it has in South-East Asia. That, as a point of principle, I think is quite a powerful one. In a strange way, I would even go so far as to say that I know others in the past, like Senator Leyonhjelm, with a strong libertarian perspective, have always supported the principle and the idea that people should be able to make informed decisions for themselves and that it leads to better outcomes when people are able to make those decisions.


The question, though, isn't whether or not those of us here believe that what is happening in the deforestation in South-East Asia is a good thing. Obviously it's not. The debate here is not about whether or not consumers should have as much information as possible and a broad right to know. I believe there is a universal view that informed consumers make better consumers and that people have the right to have an understanding so they can make decisions for themselves. But I do worry, I really worry, when we start going down the path of using labelling as the solution to everything, as a kind of very easy fix that we place on things, which is, 'If this is just labelled this way or that's labelled this way, then everything's going to be okay.' In fact, one could easily argue that there are a huge series of complexities with labelling, putting aside the many intersecting federal and state rules, regulations, agreements, laws, harmonisation and labelling structures that go on. Putting all that aside, there is also the point, worth making, that, when we place too much information in a lot of these labelling processes, we end up with a result in which the consumer ends up being less, not more, informed.


We found this where I spent a lot of my time in the Senate, working with financial services and financial service disclosures. I note that Senator Bushby, who also worked on these matters over a long period of time, was well aware that part of what we all, in a bipartisan manner, realised was wrong with the financial services industry wasn't that we weren't putting the obligation on companies to provide enough information; it was that so much information was being provided. People were getting 20- or 30-page disclosure statements that were incomprehensible and meaningless. That sense of overdisclosure, the tactic of 'snowing' people with information, actually made it more difficult for people to make informed choices and informed decisions.


I worry that it's sometimes a very, very easy fix, especially for politicians, to say: 'Just label it better. The issue's always going to be labelling. It's going to be simple; it's going to be labelling.' There are obviously challenges around labelling, but—and this is the debate—taking something like this one issue in isolation and treating it differently, breaking down the complicated processes we already have in place, the complicated structures, the complicated systems, the interweaving of federal and state relations when it comes to labelling, simply because we decide that this one issue of palm oil is particularly one that we're going to address, I think it opens a Pandora's box. I really do.


It worries me that we're making a series of special cases for this one product. If this were going to be presented as part of a broader debate—through the COAG process or through other formal processes for us to be able to have a debate within a broad structure—it is something that could be supported. I don't believe that what is happening here achieves the objectives that are wanted.


I note something that Senator Farrell said earlier, because I think it's the most important point here. It is that this bill just won't work. Under section 134 of schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, the act this bill seeks to amend, the minister already has the power to make the information standard that Senator Xenophon's bill describes. That section clearly says 




Making information standards for goods and services



(1)  The Commonwealth Minister may, by written notice published on the internet, make an information standard—


Then it goes through and explains that. I urge anyone who is interested to google it.


So there are steps that can be taken. I do have my own concerns about the path we have chosen to take. While very legitimate points are being made about deforestation and its consequences, and about making sure that Australian people are aware of the consequences of using palm oil, I don't believe this bill achieves the objectives that it sets out to. Nonetheless, I think the fact that we are debating these issues in the Senate and that we are raising awareness should be congratulated. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

At the end of the motion, add ""and in respect of Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, the Community Affairs Legislation Committee report by 13 November 2017"".


The opposition believes this is a reasonable time frame, considering the workload that is in front of the community affairs committee and that we've just asked them to deal with the Medicare levy amendment bill by October. We believe November is realistic to deal with a significant piece of legislation like this.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:57):  I indicate the Greens will be supporting this amendment. This is a significant piece of legislation, bringing in significant changes. As Senator Gallagher has just articulated, the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, of which I am deputy chair, and the Community Affairs References Committee have a very significant workload, which has just been added to with the referral of the Medicare NDIS bills, whose referral I do support, to be clear. 




Senator Bushby:
  We're on to Economics.




Senator SIEWERT:
  Sorry, to the Economics Legislation Committee. I beg your pardon. That's correct. It does already have a significant workload. I will say that many of us who are working on the Medicare levy and NDIS committee are also members of the community affairs committee. There will be a workload regardless of which committee it goes to. I think it's fair enough, given the significance of the bills and the workload that we all have already, that this reporting date be accepted.

""13 November 2017"", substitute ""16 October 2017"".


The government sees this as a very important piece of legislation. We recognise the desire of the Senate to have this referred to a committee for inquiry, but we seek, obviously, a shorter time frame in which that work can happen. I think we all now recognise that the Medicare levy bill is going to the Economics Legislation Committee, not the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, which has been acknowledged by Senator Siewert.

Senator McGRATH:
  In addition to the Minister for Foreign Affairs' day-to-day accountability for the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, parliamentary oversight of ASIS is conducted by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security under the Intelligence Services Act 2001. The joint committee reviews ASIS's administration and expenditure, as well as any matters referred to it by the responsible minister or through a resolution of either house of parliament. ASIS does not separately appear before the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade legislation committee. This reflects the joint committee's role, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security's investigation and review powers, and practical security related restrictions. The 2017 Independent Intelligence Review considered oversight arrangements and found they did not require fundamental change.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator XENOPHON:
  This relates to a fundamental issue that Witness K, a former ASIS officer, has been denied his ability to travel out of the country, notwithstanding that the reason for the denial related to a dispute between Australia and East Timor which now appears, if not on the verge of resolving, to have an alternative path to dispute resolution. I have asked questions in the estimates process in respect of this. I cannot get satisfactory answers, because ASIS is the responsible body. I note that the Director-General of ASIO has no issues with Witness K having a passport. This really is a very significant scandal in the fact that a citizen of this country has been denied the ability to travel overseas.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (12:48):  Labor will be supporting this Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 4) Bill 2017. Schedule 1 amends the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999 to improve the integrity of the wine equalisation tax producer rebate. Labor supports the WET integrity measures. Labor wants to give producers certainty about the wine equalisation tax regime. The WET producer rebate, as it currently stands, has distorted production in the wine industry, contributing to the increased supply of wine and wine grapes and preventing necessary adjustments that would improve the long-term strength of the industry.


The rebate was introduced in 2004 and currently provides up to $500,000 in tax relief to producers of wine. The intent of the policy was to benefit small wine producers in rural and regional Australia. As my colleagues, the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, and the shadow minister for agriculture, fisheries and forestry, Joel Fitzgibbon, noted in 2015, the intent of the policy is not being met, and there is consensus from the government, the opposition and the industry itself on the need for change. It took some time for the legislation to make its way to parliament, despite clear signals from the opposition that we would engage with the government on the issue and support sensible proposals.


Reform of the WET producer rebate would better target the rebate and improve its integrity. It would also ensure consistency with the original policy intent of benefiting small wine producers who are making a genuine investment in the wine industry, many of whom are in rural and regional Australia. If left in its current form, the WET producer rebate will continue to create a perverse incentive for businesses to structure themselves so as to maximise rebate claims. The result would be excess wine production, exacerbating challenging market conditions for growers.


The measures in this package are welcome and supported by many stakeholders, including most industry participants. As the Winemakers' Federation of Australia noted:


removing the rebate from bulk and unbranded wine is an important driver to industry's restructure and industry would like it to happen as soon as possible.


Schedule 2 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to provide income tax relief to superannuation funds who are transferring the account balances of their members as they transition to the MySuper rules. Labor was proud to introduce the MySuper reforms, which brought in new low-cost superannuation products with a simple set of features to allow members to more easily compare between products and to ensure that members do not pay for any features that they do not need or use. Superannuation funds have been able to provide MySuper products since 1 July 2013.


As part of the transition to the new rules, funds were required to transfer the existing balances of their default members to MySuper-compliant products by 1 July 2017. When superannuation funds are transferring these balances and the assets which support these balances, tax liabilities could arise on the transfer. This tax payable would reduce the balance of the member. Tax relief is currently available for those superannuation funds that transfer their default members to a different fund. However, this tax relief has not been available where the member transfers to a MySuper product with their existing superannuation provider. This legislation will extend the tax relief, providing an asset rollover for mandatory transfer of balances and assets to MySuper products within the same superannuation fund. Labor supports this change as it will make sure that members' balances are not negatively impacted by tax liabilities when their balances are removed. It will also ensure equity between those members who moved to a new fund provider and those who take up new products with their existing provider.


Labor supports the bill.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-08-17,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:52):  Very briefly, I understand the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 4) Bill 2017 is a non-controversial bill, but I just want to make a couple of brief statements and get on record that the Greens have been very involved in the process over the last couple of years of looking at the wine equalisation tax. I sat on the Senate references inquiry that looked at this and went all around the country and heard from wine producers. I myself have previously been a wine producer, having a small vineyard. I've manned my own cellar door and pruned my own grapes. I understand that this WET has been a very difficult tax, especially for a lot of smaller vineyards. It's been very complex, it's been rorted by a number of players in the industry and it needed to be fixed.


I'd just like to say that I have worked closely with stakeholders in my state and I wanted to get on record today that I recognise that a number of them are disappointed with the changes to the wine equalisation tax in the bill that we have before us today. There are some that, with the changes to the threshold, will lose $150,000 a year. These producers are by no means large producers; in fact, by Australian domestic standards, they're still very small producers. So that money is still very important to them, and I know they're bitterly disappointed with some of these changes.


I also want to recognise that we need to keep a very close eye on how the cellar door rebate system works. The rebate's critically important for small vineyards such as the one that I used to run. It helps employ people in regional areas and it helps bring tourism to regional areas. I'm not sure that we've got the balance exactly right on that.


Overall, though, we felt like putting this in contro and taking it to committee stage and trying to move amendments wouldn't get the support of the Senate, but I want to get on record today that I recognise the disappointment of some producers in Tasmania. But, to be fair, I also recognise there are a number of small producers that are happy with the changes. Unfortunately, it's a zero-sum game: some win and some lose. I'm not sure that the government's actually going to raise much revenue out of this at all, so I'm not quite sure what the purpose of changing the thresholds is, if it's not raising revenue. Nevertheless, it is what it is, and we will be supporting this today.

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2017-08-17,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (12:55):  I would like to make a couple of quick comments. I would like to thank the senators for their contributions. In terms of how the WET rebate currently operates, it applies to 29 per cent of the value of the last wholesale sale of the wine. The rebate currently provides producers a rebate of 29 per cent of the wholesale value of the eligible domestic sales of up to half a million dollars per year. The eligibility for the rebate is broad, with the rebate able to be claimed on bulk and unbranded wine. The rebate can be claimed multiple times on the same wine throughout the production chain where it is subject to blending or further manufacturing before being sold.


The current system allows the rebate to be claimed and the WET liability to be deferred through the supply chain to the last wholesale sale. This can result in the rebate being claimed and no corresponding WET paid when the wine is subsequently exported. The tightened eligibility criteria will remove rebate access from bulk and unbranded wine, which contribute to structures that exploit the rebate. It will stop the rebate from being claimed multiple times on the same wine through the production chain where it is subject to blending or further manufacture, and will strengthen the link between the rebate being claimed and the WET being paid. I thank senators for their contributions and I commend the bill to the Senate.

Schedule 2 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to provide income tax relief to superannuation funds who are transferring the account balances of their members as they transition to the MySuper rules. Labor was proud to introduce the MySuper reforms, which brought in new low-cost superannuation products with a simple set of features to allow members to more easily compare between products and to ensure that members do not pay for any features that they do not need or use. Superannuation funds have been able to provide MySuper products since 1 July 2013.


As part of the transition to the new rules, funds were required to transfer the existing balances of their default members to MySuper-compliant products by 1 July 2017. When superannuation funds are transferring these balances and the assets which support these balances, tax liabilities could arise on the transfer. This tax payable would reduce the balance of the member. Tax relief is currently available for those superannuation funds that transfer their default members to a different fund. However, this tax relief has not been available where the member transfers to a MySuper product with their existing superannuation provider. This legislation will extend the tax relief, providing an asset rollover for mandatory transfer of balances and assets to MySuper products within the same superannuation fund. Labor supports this change as it will make sure that members' balances are not negatively impacted by tax liabilities when their balances are removed. It will also ensure equity between those members who moved to a new fund provider and those who take up new products with their existing provider.


Labor supports the bill.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:52):  Very briefly, I understand the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 4) Bill 2017 is a non-controversial bill, but I just want to make a couple of brief statements and get on record that the Greens have been very involved in the process over the last couple of years of looking at the wine equalisation tax. I sat on the Senate references inquiry that looked at this and went all around the country and heard from wine producers. I myself have previously been a wine producer, having a small vineyard. I've manned my own cellar door and pruned my own grapes. I understand that this WET has been a very difficult tax, especially for a lot of smaller vineyards. It's been very complex, it's been rorted by a number of players in the industry and it needed to be fixed.


I'd just like to say that I have worked closely with stakeholders in my state and I wanted to get on record today that I recognise that a number of them are disappointed with the changes to the wine equalisation tax in the bill that we have before us today. There are some that, with the changes to the threshold, will lose $150,000 a year. These producers are by no means large producers; in fact, by Australian domestic standards, they're still very small producers. So that money is still very important to them, and I know they're bitterly disappointed with some of these changes.


I also want to recognise that we need to keep a very close eye on how the cellar door rebate system works. The rebate's critically important for small vineyards such as the one that I used to run. It helps employ people in regional areas and it helps bring tourism to regional areas. I'm not sure that we've got the balance exactly right on that.


Overall, though, we felt like putting this in contro and taking it to committee stage and trying to move amendments wouldn't get the support of the Senate, but I want to get on record today that I recognise the disappointment of some producers in Tasmania. But, to be fair, I also recognise there are a number of small producers that are happy with the changes. Unfortunately, it's a zero-sum game: some win and some lose. I'm not sure that the government's actually going to raise much revenue out of this at all, so I'm not quite sure what the purpose of changing the thresholds is, if it's not raising revenue. Nevertheless, it is what it is, and we will be supporting this today.

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2017-08-17,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (12:55):  I would like to make a couple of quick comments. I would like to thank the senators for their contributions. In terms of how the WET rebate currently operates, it applies to 29 per cent of the value of the last wholesale sale of the wine. The rebate currently provides producers a rebate of 29 per cent of the wholesale value of the eligible domestic sales of up to half a million dollars per year. The eligibility for the rebate is broad, with the rebate able to be claimed on bulk and unbranded wine. The rebate can be claimed multiple times on the same wine throughout the production chain where it is subject to blending or further manufacturing before being sold.


The current system allows the rebate to be claimed and the WET liability to be deferred through the supply chain to the last wholesale sale. This can result in the rebate being claimed and no corresponding WET paid when the wine is subsequently exported. The tightened eligibility criteria will remove rebate access from bulk and unbranded wine, which contribute to structures that exploit the rebate. It will stop the rebate from being claimed multiple times on the same wine through the production chain where it is subject to blending or further manufacture, and will strengthen the link between the rebate being claimed and the WET being paid. I thank senators for their contributions and I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (13:15):  I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the government response to an order for the production of documents.


Leave not granted.




Senator McKIM:
  I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator McKim moving a motion relating to the Government's failure to provide a response to an order for production of documents concerning the Member for New England.


The reason I'm doing this in this way is that the Attorney-General is failing to provide the legal advice that the government is relying on in its quite abject defence of the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Joyce. Certainly the Attorney-General has a right to decline to provide that legal advice, but it is the Senate's right to insist that the documents be produced irrespective of the claim for public interest immunity, because all we've got so far is a claim for public interest immunity made by a minister of the Crown. It is up to this place, the Senate, and all the senators in this place to determine whether it will accept that claim or, on the converse side of the discussion, to insist on the production of the legal advice. This suspension of standing orders will be, in effect, this Senate insisting that the Attorney-General provide the advice.


We've got a crisis in our democracy happening right now, as we speak. This is not just a crisis that is contained within the walls of this parliament or this chamber; it is a crisis of confidence in our democratic process out on the streets; in the pubs and the clubs, whether they be sporting or otherwise, of our country; and particularly around the dinner tables of ordinary Australians. We have a number of members of the Senate referred already to the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, and I'd bet my bottom dollar we will see more MPs referred to the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, as we move through the coming weeks and months.


What the Australian Greens want is evidence of two things, and really two things only. I am sure that the Senate will be prepared to compromise so that other matters can remain protected by a claim of public interest immunity. The first thing we want to see is the part of the legal advice that the Prime Minister was relying on when he issued his riding instructions to the High Court earlier this week and gave an absolute 100 per cent guarantee of certainty that the High Court would rule in favour of Mr Joyce remaining eligible to sit in this parliament, and that is that part of the legal advice that shows that the advice is unequivocal—in other words, that bit of the advice that allowed the Prime Minister to proceed with the 100 per cent level of certainty that he did earlier this week in the House of Representatives. What gives him and the Attorney-General such confidence that the High Court is, with absolute certainty, going to rule that Mr Joyce was eligible to be elected and therefore is eligible to remain as a member of parliament?


Remember, this isn't a humble backbencher we're talking about—I know humility's not a strong suit of Mr Joyce. This man is the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, and within a couple of weeks he's going to be the Acting Prime Minister of Australia. He's going to be running the show at the same time as the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, is going to be considering how to respond to the reference by the House of Representatives of the Deputy Prime Minister, who will soon be running the country when the PM is overseas.


So let's have a look at that part of the legal advice that the government, the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister are relying on that shows that the advice is unequivocal. It's worth placing on the record that government experts and their own legal counsel have told us that it's pretty much black and white, as Mr Joyce said. The second element we're after is the part of the S-G's advice that demonstrates that the member for New England is legitimately authorised to remain and vote in the parliament. That is what we are demanding. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-08-17,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:20):  First of all, I should point out to the Senate that neither I nor my office nor, so far as I can establish, the government received any notice of this motion by Senator McKim to suspend standing orders. I know that Senator McKim hasn't been here for very long, but it is a longstanding courtesy of this chamber that a motion of this kind is only moved after notice has been given. I see Senator McKim giggling away up there on the crossbench. Senator McKim, if you're not prepared to extend your colleagues the ordinary professional courtesy that is always extended by colleagues in this chamber to one another, despite party differences, you do not belong here.


The motion is a motion to suspend standing orders so as to take note of the response of the government to an order to produce documents. The order to produce documents sought the production of legal advice—specifically, Solicitor-General advice. It is well known to every member of this chamber that, as a matter of course, governments do not publish their legal advice. That is a practice observed by Labor governments and coalition governments alike. The principle, which was stated by a former Labor Attorney-General, Gareth Evans QC, some years ago, is this:


Nor is it the practice or has it been the practice over the years for any government to make available legal advice from its legal advisers made in the course of the normal decision making process of government, for good practical reasons associated with good government and also as a matter of fundamental principle.


Former Senator Evans said that in this chamber on 28 August 1995. The practice to which former Senator Evans then referred is a practice that had been observed by every Australian government since federation and, although that statement was made in 1995, it has been observed by every Australian government since, including, most recently, by the Gillard government, when Senator Ludwig, who represented the Attorney-General of that government, during an estimates hearing on 26 May 2011 said:


To the extent that we are now going to go to the content of the advice, can I say that it has been a longstanding practice of both this government and successive governments not to disclose the content of advice.


And that statement is not only correct; it is uncontroversial—indeed, it is canonical.


Now—on no notice whatsoever—what Senator McKim seeks to do is to overturn 116 years of constitutional orthodoxy. Of course the government will not be producing legal advice because we will be observing the fundamental, well-established and never-questioned constitutional orthodoxy that governments do not produce their legal advice. And I look forward to hearing Senator Collins, who represents the Labor Party in the chamber at the moment, confirming that that is the Labor Party's understanding of the constitutional orthodoxy.


The question of Mr Joyce was referred by the government, of its own free choice, to the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, on Monday of this week after receiving Solicitor-General advice and after having considered that advice. On the basis of the government's consideration of that advice, we have taken the position that we have taken. Nevertheless, the matter is going to be argued before the High Court in coming weeks and, because of that, of course it would put the parties in an impossible position if the legal advice on which the government acted, which was received confidentially, were to be published.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-08-17,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (13:25):  The opposition will not be supporting this suspension of standing orders today. This is not for the reasons advanced by Senator Brandis, however. He characterises courtesy in this chamber around matters around the order for production of documents. Yet I can recall not long ago Senator Birmingham refusing to respond to a Senate order for production of documents on that occasion. I can recall countless suspensions of standing orders that have occurred following the chamber's refusal to allow a senator to take note without any notice.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  'An issue of this kind,' says Senator Brandis. Well, I'm sorry, Senator Brandis, but I also differ with your characterisation about the position with respect to legal advice—but once again you will say, 'Not on matters of this nature.' There have been countless situations where, with careful consideration, government has provided legal advice.


I would like to make it very clear that the opposition thinks the Attorney-General should comply with the Senate's order yesterday for the production of documents. This Attorney-General is a serial offender when it comes to ignoring orders of the Senate, particularly when it comes to orders for production of documents. This is a very serious matter as it deals with the eligibility of the member for New England and Deputy Prime Minister to sit in the other place and, indeed, hold the second-highest office of the land.


We will not be supporting this suspension of standing orders for a few reasons. Firstly, the time frame for compliance with the order of the Senate was midday today. And while we note that the Attorney-General has not met this deadline, it is still now only around 90 minutes past that time. We would use this opportunity to remind the Attorney-General of the seriousness of the matter that surrounds this order for the production of document and we call on him to comply with the order as a matter of urgency. Secondly, we do not respect that the government does not always release legal advice. This is a matter that needs to be considered seriously. Thus, there is some flexibility in Labor's position about the time frame. However, it is open to the Attorney to release appropriate redacted advice that meets the order of the Senate without prejudicing hearings.


We also note that the matter surrounding the Deputy Prime Minister's citizenship is shortly to be before the High Court of Australia. I do, however, foreshadow to the Attorney-General and the government in the Senate that the opposition will be watching compliance with this order very carefully. It is open to pursuing this matter in the next sitting period in this chamber. We aren't supporting Senator McKim, because in this attempt to censure Senator Wong he has only given us as much notice as he gave the opposition yesterday. It is for these reasons that the opposition will not be supporting the suspension today.

Here we have this man, the second-highest officer in the land, the Deputy Prime Minister, holding onto his job there. The Attorney-General, himself, stood alongside Senator Canavan when he relinquished his ministerial position and his place in cabinet and said he would not vote until the High Court hearing had been done. I think that was right and proper. I saw the Deputy Prime Minister on Sky News last night. He didn't seem to be showing much remorse, given the situation. This should be discussed, and I agree that the standing orders should be suspended.

 (Queensland) (13:30):  This is a motion to suspend standing orders to deal with a matter that has already been raised a number of times in this chamber. If there is any doubt whatsoever about any member of parliament, the right institution to determine that is the High Court, not a kangaroo court of this chamber, which the Greens keep trying to set up.


I say to Senator McKim, by interjection, that it has been raised in several newspapers that he is English-born and has never, as I understand it, shown any material on how he has renounced that citizenship.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator McKim, a point of order?




Senator McKim:
  Senator Macdonald is misleading the Senate. What he has just said is false.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Perhaps, if Senator McKim takes some umbrage at that, he could easily fix it by tabling the documents in the Senate, which is what he asked everybody else to do. You see, it is always one rule for everyone else and a separate rule for the Greens political party. I might say to anyone having the misfortune to listen to this debate that Senator McKim was once a minister in a government—albeit, the government of Tasmania—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, a point of order?




Senator McKim:
  He's taking pot shots at my home state of Tasmania, which I resent and which every Tasmanian will resent.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It is not a point of order.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. You can see this particular senator has no respect for the chamber and keeps trying to stop other people from having their say, which is typical of the Greens. They always rail about freedom of speech. They talk about it for everyone else, but when people try to say something they continually take alleged points of order which they know are not points of order.


As I was saying, Senator McKim was—would anyone believe?—once a minister in a government, albeit the government of Tasmania. I might ask Senator McKim: how many legal advices did the government of which you were once a member release publicly? I put the same question to Senator Collins. We've heard what Mr Gareth Evans, former senator and Attorney-General, said about releasing legal advice. Senator Collins, you might indicate to us how many times your party in government did that. If it is one or two, I would be interested in hearing about it. But I certainly follow the dictum of former Senator Evans in relation to legal advice. I invite Senator McKim to indicate how many times the government of which he was a member released legal advice.


Senator McKim, in his flowery speech, spoke about a crisis of confidence in democracy. If there were ever an example of a crisis of confidence in democracy, it is the Greens political party. Time and time again we see the Greens political party wasting the resources of this parliament and stopping proper debate on an important bill that the government is trying to deal with by this Mickey Mouse suggestion of getting some legal advice. I refer to a Greens motion where they set up, with the support of the Labor Party and the Xenophon party, a committee to look into a matter of political donations, which is exactly the same thing a joint standing committee—a permanent standing committee of this parliament—is looking into at this very moment. It is exactly the same thing, exactly the same subject, and yet the Greens political party, supported by the Labor Party and by Senator Xenophon, are setting up yet another committee to do exactly the same.


So we're going to have two parliamentary committees inquiring into the same thing. Witnesses are going to be confused. We're using the resources of the Senate, which are limited—you wouldn't believe it if you saw the number of ridiculous inquiries the Greens have set up. The resources of the Senate are limited. Those resources should be directed towards real inquiries, not something where another committee is doing exactly the same. Mr Acting Deputy President, there, in that corner, where the Greens sit, is the crisis in democracy in Australia.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:35):  I just want to reiterate the comments of my fellow senator, in that we won't be supporting this suspension of standing orders. I'm going to be very brief here because I know other senators want to speak. I want make a little bit of a point with what Senator Macdonald said a moment ago. There have been instances where governments have made a decision to release legal advice.



A government senator:  After the event.




Senator DASTYARI:
  No, not only after the event. In September 2011, the Gillard government released the Solicitor-General's advice about offshore processing. In February 2000, the Howard coalition government released the Solicitor-General's advice about amendments to the Ministers of State Act. And, in August 1995, the Keating government released the Solicitor-General's advice relating to the Marks royal commission. My point is that there have been examples, both before and after events, where it has been done. There has not been a tendency at all times to do that. That's something that certainly on this side of the chamber we agree with.


I want to note that one of the arguments that was made was that no proper notice has been given for the production of documents and for the suspension motion. I would note that yesterday morning those of us on this side of the chamber came in to find out that suddenly there was a censure, or a proposal, and a suspension of standing orders.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator DASTYARI:
  Only moments beforehand. So, on this idea that the notice is the issue, it is not that.


I do however believe—and I know that others of us on this side of the chamber believe—that this is an important, complicated, significant debate that needs to be had. It has to be had in a rational and timely fashion. I again congratulate the Attorney-General for the words that he spoke in this chamber last week on this matter, broadly around the section 44 matters, where he said that there is a responsibility for us to act maturely—I am paraphrasing here—without stance and in a sensible manner because the integrity of this place gets held to account with that. I believe, and I believe that those of us on this side of the chamber believe, that, while it's proper for people to make claims for documents, and we'll support them from time to time in doing that, the idea of suddenly upending the Senate to try and grandstand on this issue at this point in time would certainly not be an appropriate way of doing that. The complexity of these issues—and they are complex issues—is best served by a mature, sensible debate around these matters, and I echo the words the Attorney-General used, as did Senator Farrell, in the chamber about this matter last week.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (13:38):  I rise to speak in favour of this suspension of standing orders. The reason is, of course, that we have asked the government to release the much-relied-upon legal advice. We're about to leave this chamber. Parliament's about to rise in some 2½ hours. There won't be an opportunity for votes. People are going to be getting back on their planes and going home for two weeks. Meanwhile, we have a Deputy Prime Minister who is apparently both an Australian citizen and a New Zealand citizen and therefore not eligible to be in the parliament, according to the Constitution.


When we talk about timeliness and we talk about the seriousness of this issue, cry me a river from the government when they want to complain that we've just sprung this upon them. All week the government have said that they rely on this legal advice from the Solicitor-General and that we should all just trust them. The Australian people are sick and tired of just being told, 'Trust us,' by the Turnbull government. I can tell them: they do not trust you. They do not trust you!


Only weeks ago, the member for New England, Barnaby Joyce, said there were no problems, that he'd done all the paperwork. His office phoned up and told a journalist, 'Everything's A-OK, mate.' It turns out that it wasn't. They asked the Australian people to trust them, and they blew it. He's not fit to be in the government, on the front bench as a minister, let alone—

Senator Brandis:
   The Senator is reflecting on Mr Joyce.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim on the point of order?




Senator McKim:
  Yes, thank you. What Senator Hanson-Young was doing was commenting on a matter that has been widely commented on in both the Senate and the other place this week, and that is whether or not the Deputy Prime Minister has been legitimately elected to the parliament. That's what she was commenting on and that has been a matter of continual comment for the entire week.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, I will hear from you again.




Senator Brandis:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Standing order 193(3) says:


(3) A senator shall not use offensive words against either House of Parliament or of a House of a state or territory parliament, or any member of such House, or against a judicial officer, and all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on those Houses, members or officers shall be considered highly disorderly.


Contrary to what Senator McKim represented, what Senator Hanson-Young said was that Mr Joyce was not fit to occupy the offices that he has occupied: not eligibility—not a legal question—but fitness, and that is plainly a reflection upon his character.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis has taken offence to the words you've used, Senator Hanson-Young, and as a consequence of that you need to withdraw.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I do not see how—I would like a ruling from the chair.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have just ruled. So it is no longer for debate; you either withdraw or not.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I am happy to withdraw, but I will be writing to the President and asking him to reflect on whether a minister who is ineligible to be elected to parliament is fit to be a minister.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   You have withdrawn. Thank you for that. You are free to consult the President, as any senator is. I will ask the clock to start and you have the call.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It seems that the government, of course, is incredibly nervous about releasing the legal documentation that they have and that they are relying on, to keep the member for New England, the Deputy Prime Minister, in protection.


The member for New England, Barnaby Joyce, seems more protected than the bilby. This is a ridiculous situation, when we have the government of the day saying that we need to rely on their word and the word of the Solicitor-General. They do not release the documentation but say that we should just all suck it up, that Barnaby Joyce remains Deputy Prime Minister. No-one trusts you. No-one trusts that you are doing this for the legitimate and right reasons. No-one believes you.


We all know what this is about: this is because you have a very slim majority in the House! The member for New England holds his seat by a very slim margin. Let's call this for what it is: a protection racket for the member for New England and for the numbers in the House for the Turnbull government. This is absolutely what this is. This is covering up the incompetence of the Deputy Prime Minister. I don't think anyone out there in the Australian public is particularly surprised that the member for New England didn't check his paperwork. Do you think anyone is surprised at the incompetence of the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce? I don't think so. I don't think so at all!


Look at the other foolish things that the Deputy Prime Minister has done in recent months. He has no regard for the position of Deputy Prime Minister. If he did, he would resign. If he really cared about the institution which he holds, and the institution of which he is part as a minister, he would resign. This has made the government a joke—an absolute joke! It's a farce and everybody can see it. Everybody can see what a farce this is. A protection racket is going on here. The member for New England is not even legitimately elected and he gets to sit there as Deputy Prime Minister. In a couple of weeks, when the Prime Minister goes overseas on diplomatic work, he's going to become the Prime Minister. What type of farce have we got when we have the acting Prime Minister of Australia as someone who couldn't be bothered to do his paperwork, lied about it, tried to cover it up and got caught out, and is now only there because of the protection racket being run by the Turnbull government?

So let's have a look at that part of the legal advice that the government, the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister are relying on that shows that the advice is unequivocal. It's worth placing on the record that government experts and their own legal counsel have told us that it's pretty much black and white, as Mr Joyce said. The second element we're after is the part of the S-G's advice that demonstrates that the member for New England is legitimately authorised to remain and vote in the parliament. That is what we are demanding. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-08-17,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:20):  First of all, I should point out to the Senate that neither I nor my office nor, so far as I can establish, the government received any notice of this motion by Senator McKim to suspend standing orders. I know that Senator McKim hasn't been here for very long, but it is a longstanding courtesy of this chamber that a motion of this kind is only moved after notice has been given. I see Senator McKim giggling away up there on the crossbench. Senator McKim, if you're not prepared to extend your colleagues the ordinary professional courtesy that is always extended by colleagues in this chamber to one another, despite party differences, you do not belong here.


The motion is a motion to suspend standing orders so as to take note of the response of the government to an order to produce documents. The order to produce documents sought the production of legal advice—specifically, Solicitor-General advice. It is well known to every member of this chamber that, as a matter of course, governments do not publish their legal advice. That is a practice observed by Labor governments and coalition governments alike. The principle, which was stated by a former Labor Attorney-General, Gareth Evans QC, some years ago, is this:


Nor is it the practice or has it been the practice over the years for any government to make available legal advice from its legal advisers made in the course of the normal decision making process of government, for good practical reasons associated with good government and also as a matter of fundamental principle.


Former Senator Evans said that in this chamber on 28 August 1995. The practice to which former Senator Evans then referred is a practice that had been observed by every Australian government since federation and, although that statement was made in 1995, it has been observed by every Australian government since, including, most recently, by the Gillard government, when Senator Ludwig, who represented the Attorney-General of that government, during an estimates hearing on 26 May 2011 said:


To the extent that we are now going to go to the content of the advice, can I say that it has been a longstanding practice of both this government and successive governments not to disclose the content of advice.


And that statement is not only correct; it is uncontroversial—indeed, it is canonical.


Now—on no notice whatsoever—what Senator McKim seeks to do is to overturn 116 years of constitutional orthodoxy. Of course the government will not be producing legal advice because we will be observing the fundamental, well-established and never-questioned constitutional orthodoxy that governments do not produce their legal advice. And I look forward to hearing Senator Collins, who represents the Labor Party in the chamber at the moment, confirming that that is the Labor Party's understanding of the constitutional orthodoxy.


The question of Mr Joyce was referred by the government, of its own free choice, to the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, on Monday of this week after receiving Solicitor-General advice and after having considered that advice. On the basis of the government's consideration of that advice, we have taken the position that we have taken. Nevertheless, the matter is going to be argued before the High Court in coming weeks and, because of that, of course it would put the parties in an impossible position if the legal advice on which the government acted, which was received confidentially, were to be published.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-08-17,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (13:25):  The opposition will not be supporting this suspension of standing orders today. This is not for the reasons advanced by Senator Brandis, however. He characterises courtesy in this chamber around matters around the order for production of documents. Yet I can recall not long ago Senator Birmingham refusing to respond to a Senate order for production of documents on that occasion. I can recall countless suspensions of standing orders that have occurred following the chamber's refusal to allow a senator to take note without any notice.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  'An issue of this kind,' says Senator Brandis. Well, I'm sorry, Senator Brandis, but I also differ with your characterisation about the position with respect to legal advice—but once again you will say, 'Not on matters of this nature.' There have been countless situations where, with careful consideration, government has provided legal advice.


I would like to make it very clear that the opposition thinks the Attorney-General should comply with the Senate's order yesterday for the production of documents. This Attorney-General is a serial offender when it comes to ignoring orders of the Senate, particularly when it comes to orders for production of documents. This is a very serious matter as it deals with the eligibility of the member for New England and Deputy Prime Minister to sit in the other place and, indeed, hold the second-highest office of the land.


We will not be supporting this suspension of standing orders for a few reasons. Firstly, the time frame for compliance with the order of the Senate was midday today. And while we note that the Attorney-General has not met this deadline, it is still now only around 90 minutes past that time. We would use this opportunity to remind the Attorney-General of the seriousness of the matter that surrounds this order for the production of document and we call on him to comply with the order as a matter of urgency. Secondly, we do not respect that the government does not always release legal advice. This is a matter that needs to be considered seriously. Thus, there is some flexibility in Labor's position about the time frame. However, it is open to the Attorney to release appropriate redacted advice that meets the order of the Senate without prejudicing hearings.


We also note that the matter surrounding the Deputy Prime Minister's citizenship is shortly to be before the High Court of Australia. I do, however, foreshadow to the Attorney-General and the government in the Senate that the opposition will be watching compliance with this order very carefully. It is open to pursuing this matter in the next sitting period in this chamber. We aren't supporting Senator McKim, because in this attempt to censure Senator Wong he has only given us as much notice as he gave the opposition yesterday. It is for these reasons that the opposition will not be supporting the suspension today.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (13:29):  I will be supporting the Greens' move to suspend standing orders because I do agree with Senator McKim that it is a matter of major importance. Here we have this man, the second-highest officer in the land, the Deputy Prime Minister, holding onto his job there. The Attorney-General, himself, stood alongside Senator Canavan when he relinquished his ministerial position and his place in cabinet and said he would not vote until the High Court hearing had been done. I think that was right and proper. I saw the Deputy Prime Minister on Sky News last night. He didn't seem to be showing much remorse, given the situation. This should be discussed, and I agree that the standing orders should be suspended.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:30):  This is a motion to suspend standing orders to deal with a matter that has already been raised a number of times in this chamber. If there is any doubt whatsoever about any member of parliament, the right institution to determine that is the High Court, not a kangaroo court of this chamber, which the Greens keep trying to set up.


I say to Senator McKim, by interjection, that it has been raised in several newspapers that he is English-born and has never, as I understand it, shown any material on how he has renounced that citizenship.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator McKim, a point of order?




Senator McKim:
  Senator Macdonald is misleading the Senate. What he has just said is false.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Perhaps, if Senator McKim takes some umbrage at that, he could easily fix it by tabling the documents in the Senate, which is what he asked everybody else to do. You see, it is always one rule for everyone else and a separate rule for the Greens political party. I might say to anyone having the misfortune to listen to this debate that Senator McKim was once a minister in a government—albeit, the government of Tasmania—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, a point of order?




Senator McKim:
  He's taking pot shots at my home state of Tasmania, which I resent and which every Tasmanian will resent.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It is not a point of order.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. You can see this particular senator has no respect for the chamber and keeps trying to stop other people from having their say, which is typical of the Greens. They always rail about freedom of speech. They talk about it for everyone else, but when people try to say something they continually take alleged points of order which they know are not points of order.


As I was saying, Senator McKim was—would anyone believe?—once a minister in a government, albeit the government of Tasmania. I might ask Senator McKim: how many legal advices did the government of which you were once a member release publicly? I put the same question to Senator Collins. We've heard what Mr Gareth Evans, former senator and Attorney-General, said about releasing legal advice. Senator Collins, you might indicate to us how many times your party in government did that. If it is one or two, I would be interested in hearing about it. But I certainly follow the dictum of former Senator Evans in relation to legal advice. I invite Senator McKim to indicate how many times the government of which he was a member released legal advice.


Senator McKim, in his flowery speech, spoke about a crisis of confidence in democracy. If there were ever an example of a crisis of confidence in democracy, it is the Greens political party. Time and time again we see the Greens political party wasting the resources of this parliament and stopping proper debate on an important bill that the government is trying to deal with by this Mickey Mouse suggestion of getting some legal advice. I refer to a Greens motion where they set up, with the support of the Labor Party and the Xenophon party, a committee to look into a matter of political donations, which is exactly the same thing a joint standing committee—a permanent standing committee of this parliament—is looking into at this very moment. It is exactly the same thing, exactly the same subject, and yet the Greens political party, supported by the Labor Party and by Senator Xenophon, are setting up yet another committee to do exactly the same.


So we're going to have two parliamentary committees inquiring into the same thing. Witnesses are going to be confused. We're using the resources of the Senate, which are limited—you wouldn't believe it if you saw the number of ridiculous inquiries the Greens have set up. The resources of the Senate are limited. Those resources should be directed towards real inquiries, not something where another committee is doing exactly the same. Mr Acting Deputy President, there, in that corner, where the Greens sit, is the crisis in democracy in Australia.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-08-17,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:35):  I just want to reiterate the comments of my fellow senator, in that we won't be supporting this suspension of standing orders. I'm going to be very brief here because I know other senators want to speak. I want make a little bit of a point with what Senator Macdonald said a moment ago. There have been instances where governments have made a decision to release legal advice.



A government senator:  After the event.




Senator DASTYARI:
  No, not only after the event. In September 2011, the Gillard government released the Solicitor-General's advice about offshore processing. In February 2000, the Howard coalition government released the Solicitor-General's advice about amendments to the Ministers of State Act. And, in August 1995, the Keating government released the Solicitor-General's advice relating to the Marks royal commission. My point is that there have been examples, both before and after events, where it has been done. There has not been a tendency at all times to do that. That's something that certainly on this side of the chamber we agree with.


I want to note that one of the arguments that was made was that no proper notice has been given for the production of documents and for the suspension motion. I would note that yesterday morning those of us on this side of the chamber came in to find out that suddenly there was a censure, or a proposal, and a suspension of standing orders.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator DASTYARI:
  Only moments beforehand. So, on this idea that the notice is the issue, it is not that.


I do however believe—and I know that others of us on this side of the chamber believe—that this is an important, complicated, significant debate that needs to be had. It has to be had in a rational and timely fashion. I again congratulate the Attorney-General for the words that he spoke in this chamber last week on this matter, broadly around the section 44 matters, where he said that there is a responsibility for us to act maturely—I am paraphrasing here—without stance and in a sensible manner because the integrity of this place gets held to account with that. I believe, and I believe that those of us on this side of the chamber believe, that, while it's proper for people to make claims for documents, and we'll support them from time to time in doing that, the idea of suddenly upending the Senate to try and grandstand on this issue at this point in time would certainly not be an appropriate way of doing that. The complexity of these issues—and they are complex issues—is best served by a mature, sensible debate around these matters, and I echo the words the Attorney-General used, as did Senator Farrell, in the chamber about this matter last week.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2017-08-17,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (13:38):  I rise to speak in favour of this suspension of standing orders. The reason is, of course, that we have asked the government to release the much-relied-upon legal advice. We're about to leave this chamber. Parliament's about to rise in some 2½ hours. There won't be an opportunity for votes. People are going to be getting back on their planes and going home for two weeks. Meanwhile, we have a Deputy Prime Minister who is apparently both an Australian citizen and a New Zealand citizen and therefore not eligible to be in the parliament, according to the Constitution.


When we talk about timeliness and we talk about the seriousness of this issue, cry me a river from the government when they want to complain that we've just sprung this upon them. All week the government have said that they rely on this legal advice from the Solicitor-General and that we should all just trust them. The Australian people are sick and tired of just being told, 'Trust us,' by the Turnbull government. I can tell them: they do not trust you. They do not trust you!


Only weeks ago, the member for New England, Barnaby Joyce, said there were no problems, that he'd done all the paperwork. His office phoned up and told a journalist, 'Everything's A-OK, mate.' It turns out that it wasn't. They asked the Australian people to trust them, and they blew it. He's not fit to be in the government, on the front bench as a minister, let alone—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Brandis on a point of order?




Senator Brandis:
   The Senator is reflecting on Mr Joyce.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim on the point of order?




Senator McKim:
  Yes, thank you. What Senator Hanson-Young was doing was commenting on a matter that has been widely commented on in both the Senate and the other place this week, and that is whether or not the Deputy Prime Minister has been legitimately elected to the parliament. That's what she was commenting on and that has been a matter of continual comment for the entire week.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, I will hear from you again.




Senator Brandis:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Standing order 193(3) says:


(3) A senator shall not use offensive words against either House of Parliament or of a House of a state or territory parliament, or any member of such House, or against a judicial officer, and all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on those Houses, members or officers shall be considered highly disorderly.


Contrary to what Senator McKim represented, what Senator Hanson-Young said was that Mr Joyce was not fit to occupy the offices that he has occupied: not eligibility—not a legal question—but fitness, and that is plainly a reflection upon his character.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis has taken offence to the words you've used, Senator Hanson-Young, and as a consequence of that you need to withdraw.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I do not see how—I would like a ruling from the chair.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have just ruled. So it is no longer for debate; you either withdraw or not.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I am happy to withdraw, but I will be writing to the President and asking him to reflect on whether a minister who is ineligible to be elected to parliament is fit to be a minister.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   You have withdrawn. Thank you for that. You are free to consult the President, as any senator is. I will ask the clock to start and you have the call.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It seems that the government, of course, is incredibly nervous about releasing the legal documentation that they have and that they are relying on, to keep the member for New England, the Deputy Prime Minister, in protection.


The member for New England, Barnaby Joyce, seems more protected than the bilby. This is a ridiculous situation, when we have the government of the day saying that we need to rely on their word and the word of the Solicitor-General. They do not release the documentation but say that we should just all suck it up, that Barnaby Joyce remains Deputy Prime Minister. No-one trusts you. No-one trusts that you are doing this for the legitimate and right reasons. No-one believes you.


We all know what this is about: this is because you have a very slim majority in the House! The member for New England holds his seat by a very slim margin. Let's call this for what it is: a protection racket for the member for New England and for the numbers in the House for the Turnbull government. This is absolutely what this is. This is covering up the incompetence of the Deputy Prime Minister. I don't think anyone out there in the Australian public is particularly surprised that the member for New England didn't check his paperwork. Do you think anyone is surprised at the incompetence of the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce? I don't think so. I don't think so at all!


Look at the other foolish things that the Deputy Prime Minister has done in recent months. He has no regard for the position of Deputy Prime Minister. If he did, he would resign. If he really cared about the institution which he holds, and the institution of which he is part as a minister, he would resign. This has made the government a joke—an absolute joke! It's a farce and everybody can see it. Everybody can see what a farce this is. A protection racket is going on here. The member for New England is not even legitimately elected and he gets to sit there as Deputy Prime Minister. In a couple of weeks, when the Prime Minister goes overseas on diplomatic work, he's going to become the Prime Minister. What type of farce have we got when we have the acting Prime Minister of Australia as someone who couldn't be bothered to do his paperwork, lied about it, tried to cover it up and got caught out, and is now only there because of the protection racket being run by the Turnbull government?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (13:54):  by leave—I move government amendments (1) to (5) on sheet JH138 together:


(1) Schedule 1, page 5 (after line 6), after item 12, insert:




12A


At the end of subsection


550(1)



   Add:


Note: If a person (the involved person) is taken under this subsection to have contravened a civil remedy provision, the involved person's contravention may be a serious contravention (see subsection 557A(5A)). Serious contraventions attract higher maximum penalties (see subsection 539(2)).


(2) Schedule 1, item 13, page 6 (lines 2 to 9), omit subsection 557A(1), substitute:


(1) A contravention of a civil remedy provision by a person is a serious contravention if:


   (a) the person knowingly contravened the provision; and


   (b) the person's conduct constituting the contravention was part of a systematic pattern of conduct relating to one or more other persons.


Note: For the liability of bodies corporate for serious contraventions, see section 557B.


Example:   Generally, subsection 323(1) requires an employer to pay an employee the full amount payable to the employee in relation to the performance of work.


   A contravention of subsection 323(1) is a serious contravention if the employer knowingly does not pay the employee in full (even if the employer does not know the exact amount of the underpayment) and that contravention is part of a systematic pattern of conduct by the employer. The systematic pattern of conduct of the employer may relate to more than one employee and may consist of different contraventions.



Systematic pattern of conduct



(3) Schedule 1, item 13, page 6 (after line 18), after paragraph 557A(2)(c), insert:


   (ca) the person's response, or failure to respond, to any complaints made about the relevant contraventions; and


(4) Schedule 1, item 13, page 6 (after line 36), after subsection 557A(5), insert:




Involvement in a serious contravention



   (5A) A person (the involved person) who is involved in a contravention of a civil remedy provision by another person (the principal) commits a serious contravention of the provision only if:


   (a) the principal's contravention was a serious contravention; and


   (b) the involved person knew that the principal's contravention was a serious contravention.



Application for a serious contravention order and alternative orders



(5) Schedule 1, item 13, page 7 (lines 14 to 17), omit subsection 557B(1), substitute:


(1) For the purposes of subsection 557A(1), a body corporate knowingly contravenes a civil remedy provision if the body corporate expressly, tacitly or impliedly authorised the contravention.


These amendments are clarifying amendments. Item (4) amends section 557A to clarify that an accessory may be liable for a higher penalty under the serious contraventions regime if they are involved in a serious contravention by the principal wrongdoer and knew that the principal's contravention was a serious contravention. The amendment flows from the Senate committee report in relation to this bill and basically clarifies when an accessory may be subject to the proposed higher penalties for serious contraventions. It clarifies that anyone who knowingly involves themselves in the deliberate and systematic underpayment of workers will face the higher penalties that apply to that conduct. This approach is consistent with the current approach to accessorial liability under section 550 of the Fair Work Act, under which an alleged accessory must have knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention to be liable for that contravention.


On the second amendment: I propose to amend section 557A(1) of the bill to clarify the existing intention that a contravention is deliberate in the context of the serious contraventions regime if the person knowingly contravened the provision. Again, this amendment responds to the Senate committee report and clarifies what a wrongdoer needs to know before they can be held responsible for a serious contravention. The amendment uses language and concepts already used elsewhere under the Fair Work Act and so should be easier to understand and apply. It also means that, for the higher penalties under the serious contraventions regime to apply, the wrongdoer must knowingly contravene the provision and it must form part of a systematic pattern of conduct.


On the final amendment that I have moved: I propose to amend section 557A(2) of the bill to add an additional matter to the non-exhaustive list of matters that a court may consider when determining whether a person's conduct was part of a systematic pattern of conduct. Again, the purpose of the amendment is to respond to the Senate committee report and it sets out additional guidance about when a contravention may qualify as serious. This amendment improves the operation of the bill by ensuring that employers who do the right thing by quickly and decisively responding to complaints about underpayments that are brought to their attention are not subjected to higher penalties. On the other hand, it will be relevant to the court's consideration if employers repeatedly fail to respond to wage complaints without a reasonable excuse. Again, these amendments are technical amendments that respond to the Senate committee's report, and I commend them to the Senate.

It arises from concerns raised with the Senate employment committee by Professor Andrew Stewart in his submission. Can the minister clarify proposed section 557A(5A)(b)? The statement is that the involved person knew that the principal's contravention was a serious contravention and it requires the involved person to know. Is it that the principal's conduct was part of a systemic pattern of conduct involving one or more persons, or is it something more than that?

(1) Schedule 1, page 5 (after line 6), after item 12, insert:




12A


At the end of subsection


550(1)



   Add:


Note: If a person (the involved person) is taken under this subsection to have contravened a civil remedy provision, the involved person's contravention may be a serious contravention (see subsection 557A(5A)). Serious contraventions attract higher maximum penalties (see subsection 539(2)).


(2) Schedule 1, item 13, page 6 (lines 2 to 9), omit subsection 557A(1), substitute:


(1) A contravention of a civil remedy provision by a person is a serious contravention if:


   (a) the person knowingly contravened the provision; and


   (b) the person's conduct constituting the contravention was part of a systematic pattern of conduct relating to one or more other persons.


Note: For the liability of bodies corporate for serious contraventions, see section 557B.


Example:   Generally, subsection 323(1) requires an employer to pay an employee the full amount payable to the employee in relation to the performance of work.


   A contravention of subsection 323(1) is a serious contravention if the employer knowingly does not pay the employee in full (even if the employer does not know the exact amount of the underpayment) and that contravention is part of a systematic pattern of conduct by the employer. The systematic pattern of conduct of the employer may relate to more than one employee and may consist of different contraventions.



Systematic pattern of conduct



(3) Schedule 1, item 13, page 6 (after line 18), after paragraph 557A(2)(c), insert:


   (ca) the person's response, or failure to respond, to any complaints made about the relevant contraventions; and


(4) Schedule 1, item 13, page 6 (after line 36), after subsection 557A(5), insert:




Involvement in a serious contravention



   (5A) A person (the involved person) who is involved in a contravention of a civil remedy provision by another person (the principal) commits a serious contravention of the provision only if:


   (a) the principal's contravention was a serious contravention; and


   (b) the involved person knew that the principal's contravention was a serious contravention.



Application for a serious contravention order and alternative orders



(5) Schedule 1, item 13, page 7 (lines 14 to 17), omit subsection 557B(1), substitute:


(1) For the purposes of subsection 557A(1), a body corporate knowingly contravenes a civil remedy provision if the body corporate expressly, tacitly or impliedly authorised the contravention.


These amendments are clarifying amendments. Item (4) amends section 557A to clarify that an accessory may be liable for a higher penalty under the serious contraventions regime if they are involved in a serious contravention by the principal wrongdoer and knew that the principal's contravention was a serious contravention. The amendment flows from the Senate committee report in relation to this bill and basically clarifies when an accessory may be subject to the proposed higher penalties for serious contraventions. It clarifies that anyone who knowingly involves themselves in the deliberate and systematic underpayment of workers will face the higher penalties that apply to that conduct. This approach is consistent with the current approach to accessorial liability under section 550 of the Fair Work Act, under which an alleged accessory must have knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention to be liable for that contravention.


On the second amendment: I propose to amend section 557A(1) of the bill to clarify the existing intention that a contravention is deliberate in the context of the serious contraventions regime if the person knowingly contravened the provision. Again, this amendment responds to the Senate committee report and clarifies what a wrongdoer needs to know before they can be held responsible for a serious contravention. The amendment uses language and concepts already used elsewhere under the Fair Work Act and so should be easier to understand and apply. It also means that, for the higher penalties under the serious contraventions regime to apply, the wrongdoer must knowingly contravene the provision and it must form part of a systematic pattern of conduct.


On the final amendment that I have moved: I propose to amend section 557A(2) of the bill to add an additional matter to the non-exhaustive list of matters that a court may consider when determining whether a person's conduct was part of a systematic pattern of conduct. Again, the purpose of the amendment is to respond to the Senate committee report and it sets out additional guidance about when a contravention may qualify as serious. This amendment improves the operation of the bill by ensuring that employers who do the right thing by quickly and decisively responding to complaints about underpayments that are brought to their attention are not subjected to higher penalties. On the other hand, it will be relevant to the court's consideration if employers repeatedly fail to respond to wage complaints without a reasonable excuse. Again, these amendments are technical amendments that respond to the Senate committee's report, and I commend them to the Senate.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Minister, I understand there is a supplementary explanatory memorandum—




Senator CASH:
  There is. I would seek leave to table the supplementary explanatory memorandum.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  You don't need leave. That is now tabled. Thank you, Minister.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-08-17,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:58):  We understand that the intention of this provision is to clarify what constitutes accessorial liability for serious contraventions. It arises from concerns raised with the Senate employment committee by Professor Andrew Stewart in his submission. Can the minister clarify proposed section 557A(5A)(b)? The statement is that the involved person knew that the principal's contravention was a serious contravention and it requires the involved person to know. Is it that the principal's conduct was part of a systemic pattern of conduct involving one or more persons, or is it something more than that?




The TEMPORARY CHAIR

But can I say that I have listened to my colleague Matt Canavan—Senator Canavan, who I'm representing today—on so many occasions talk about the necessity for a range of hydrocarbon answers to the power that we require at the moment. He comes from Queensland and he knows, as does everybody on this side, that coal has to be a complete and utter part of the answer. So I am a believer that the reality is that, in terms of the power mix in this country, coal has to be an absolutely fundamental part of the future.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-08-17,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs (Senator Scullion) and the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators McAllister and Dastyari today relating to coal-fired power and to the Report to Congress on International Religious Freedom released by the United States of America Department of State.


What a performance in the Australian Senate today. What a performance! There are many days where I question why we come into this place. Often, I feel that we would be better off just staying at the bar. And there are days where things go completely crazy. To top off the insanity of what has been a truly surreal week, we saw the stunt of all stunts in this chamber by Senator Hanson.


Firstly, Senator Brandis, rightly deserves to be congratulated for his strong words and strong sentiment, and for expressing the view, rightly, that the close to 500,000 Muslim Australians do not deserve to be targeted, do not deserve to be marginalised, do not deserve to be ridiculed and do not deserve to have their faith made into some political point by the desperate leader of a desperate political party—a leader who has sitting beside her a senator who the Senate itself questions whether they should even be in this chamber in the first place.


Today was embarrassing. It was insulting; it was hurtful and it was wrong. In the same week as the United States Secretary of State, Secretary Tillerson, himself listed One Nation as a risk to religious freedom, and in the same week that we saw white nationalism rear its ugly head in the country of our closest ally, a stunt like this gets pulled in the Australian Senate. It is hurtful, it is offensive and it is wrong.


It is wrong, what's more, when we're talking about national security and the threats that are posed by extremism. Those actions and behaviours do not achieve any objective other than to make the risks and dangers in this country worse. When you pull those types of stunts, when people try to trivialise other people's faith and other people's religion for the sole purpose of a cheap headline, national security is damaged, not helped. And the idea that it is somehow appropriate to be mocking people, their faith and their values in this chamber goes to the heart of attacking what makes this country so amazing and so great.


Let's be clear: Islamic extremism is a threat and a danger, as is radical nationalism. And we need to call out extremism wherever it is. If that extremism is Islamic extremism, it should be called out. But if that extremism is the type of fascism Pauline Hanson and One Nation bring into this chamber, it should be called out as well. Extremism is wrong in whatever form it takes. Extremism is wrong when a group of white nationalists take over a city like Charlottesville in the United States of America. That is wrong, that is fascism, that is extremism, that is terrorism and it should be called out. Just as we should call out Islamic extremism, Islamic fascism, we need to call that out across the world. In the same week, even the Trump administration, in its International religious freedom report for 2016, has listed One Nation as a threat to religious freedom. We've seen extreme nationalism rear its ugly head. We don't want to see that type of extreme nationalism, that fascism, come to our country. We don't want to see it imported here. The stunt from Senator Hanson does nothing but bring out the worst of Australian society.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:06):  Today in question time we had a very sobering reminder of the power that all of us have in this place and the power our words and actions can have in our broader community. For me, it was a salutary reminder that what we do and say in this place can have a great impact in the community. The impact can either be positive, uplifting and uniting or appeal to the worst aspects of human nature. For me, question time today was a salutary reminder of that. We've seen many things in the chamber this week that have united us, where we've come together on a bipartisan basis to do good for all Australians. But we've also seen on all sides of this chamber examples where that has not occurred.


I'm very conscious that we in this place have an important responsibility to all Australians. National security, and keeping our people safe, is probably the primary responsibility of governments and parliaments in this nation. However, the freedoms and liberties of all Australians—whether enshrined in our Constitution, by precedent or by an understanding of what we hold most valuable in this place—are two competing interests. We don't have a bill of rights in our Constitution. Our founders believed we could get right in this place a balance between keeping people safe and protecting their individual freedoms.


I think some people in this place would know that I am certainly a very strong supporter of tough national security measures. I worked in this area for many years. As I've said before in this place, I have seen and smelt the consequences of terrorism. I worked with the victims of terrorism for years. So I know better than most people in this place the consequences for Australians and the reasons we need to keep them safe. But I also know that if we let fear and the worse aspects of our natures, and the worse aspects of those who would do us evil, get the better of us then we've lost the fight and lost that balance.


In relation to the issue at hand today, in relation to the burqa, I do acknowledge that, in some parts of the world, many religions, including Christianity and Islam, are taken out of context and used to inflict great harm and great evil on people. That is the case sometimes with the burqa as well. But that is a very different situation from here in Australia.


The need for identification is not an issue of religion. I think, as Senator Fierravanti-Wells has said previously, it is an agnostic issue which needs to be separated from any issue of religion. As a member of a Liberal government, I know that we believe in inalienable rights and freedom for all people and being free from interference in our daily lives. I believe that involves people's choice of clothing and how they choose to express their religious beliefs, whether it is a nun's habit, a Christian cross, or a hijab or a burqa. If women or men are wearing their clothes of choice, free from interference, coercion and persuasion and not as a means of being subjected to somebody else's will but as an empowering action for themselves, I think that we have no place telling people what they should be wearing. But, that said, the President also outlined that there are national security issues and issues with security for all of us in this chamber, and also for those in the public galleries, and I believe the measures that are being taken to establish identity without interfering with anybody's privacy are sufficient.


Further in relation to this, I'd just like to quote a little bit more from my colleague Senator Fierravanti-Wells. She said this recently:


It is always regrettable that women, especially Muslim women, are criticised or attacked for what they choose to wear. We are a free society and it is not the business of government to tell people what they should and should not wear.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2017-08-17,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:11):  Before I move on to the energy part of my contribution, can I also associate my comments with those of my colleague Senator Dastyari in relation to his speech on the motion to take note of answers.


I want to move to the answers that we received from Minister Scullion to the question from Senator McAllister in relation to energy. Here we had Senator Scullion—who didn't know the context of the quotes by Mr Morrison, his own Treasurer, and who hadn't bothered to be briefed on the debate this week on resources and energy—refusing to take the first question from Senator McAllister on notice and saying that coal fundamentally has to be part of the future energy mix. When faced with the second part of the Treasurer's quote in the supplementary question, he realised that perhaps there was a change in policy and he then deferred to take that on notice. But then Minister Scullion had no answer when asked what the coalition government's position is on coal-fired power; he just took that on notice as well.


For the benefit of those who may be listening around the country, earlier this week the Treasurer, Mr Morrison—who, I have to add, kicked off 2017 by presenting a polished lump of coal in the House of Representatives and said, 'This is coal; don't be afraid'—said, 'Let's not think that there's cheap new coal; there's not,' and that the era of cheap coal-fired power is coming to an end. That's what he said earlier this week. Well, what a change of heart!


I note that the comment from the Treasurer came in the same week that the South Australian Labor government announced that a 150-megawatt solar thermal power plant would be built near Port Augusta. Construction of this exciting new project will commence next year, and the power plant will be operational by 2020. It will produce enough power to deliver five per cent of South Australia's energy needs, the equivalent of powering more than 90,000 homes, and it will be completely emissions free and produce energy at below $78 per megawatt hour.


Solar thermal technology works by using a huge mirror to concentrate sunlight onto a tower that heats molten salts. The heat created is then used to generate steam and, at this point, create power in a similar fashion to a coal-fired power station. Importantly, though, the solar thermal system can store energy for between eight and 10 hours and has no requirement for any coal or gas as a backup. The project will create more than 700 jobs in construction, with 50 full-time workers on an ongoing basis once the plant is fully operational.


The best part of this news, though, is that the South Australian government didn't pick a winner here. It didn't say, 'We love one type of energy,' as the former minister Senator Canavan has harped on about for the past year. It didn't seek to stop a company specialising in any type of energy source from submitting a tender. No, the South Australian government ran a tender process for 75 per cent of the state's power supply, and the company Solar Reserve submitted the lowest cost option over the 20-year tender period. I raise this story from South Australia because it demonstrates that it, as a government, goes through its internal processes on energy policy as it weighs up the recommendation from Professor Finkel to implement a clean energy target.


It's vital that members of the government stand up to those who seek to pick winners, and that those who support a market based economy actually defend the market. I note that this week it appeared that the Treasurer did his best to draw a line in the sand and say to Mr Abbott and Senator Canavan: 'Stop trying to pick winners,' because those winners do not stack up economically. Making these statements might make people feel good, but they drive a wedge through regional communities across our country. The people of regional Australia who work in the coal industry, in power generation and in heavy industry and whose small businesses support these industries right across this country care about reliability, price and sustainability, both in terms of economics and the environment. These people know that we need a technology-blind approach where we set our policy and then let the market decide. But at the moment we have a government with no energy policy. For a number of months, Labor has offered to work with the government to find middle ground. We want to move beyond the years of division and set in place a credible energy policy for Australia's future, to provide security, to provide jobs and, best of all, to try and provide a low-based economical cost basis for members.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2017-08-17,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:16):  Like my colleagues, I would like to stand today to take note of some of the things that have occurred in the Senate chamber today and the responses to it. I don't approve of Senator Hanson's stunt. There have been a range of expressions of disquiet about that today. Predominantly, my concern is that it is targeting a form of dress. I don't believe that we should be telling people what they wear, but on a security front we are reliant on good relations with all of our community, including the Muslim community, to provide information to our intelligence services. Having said that, there are three other points I would like to make.


One is about applying a common standard. We had great expressions of outrage here today about the fact that somebody wore what was seen as a religious form of dress in a manner that showed they clearly weren't of that religion and we had comments about freedom of religion and how we need to respect all religions. Yet, in this chamber, we've had comments, particularly, I have to say, from the Greens, not that the particular member who makes the comments is here at the moment—one has left the chamber, but one is still here—who frequently vilifies people of the Christian faith and other faiths who don't support his view around topics such as same-sex marriage. I don't dispute the fact that he has a right to a view on that—anyone has a right to a view on it—but to vilify somebody because of their view and to link that to their faith is, I believe, quite inappropriate. I would welcome the same degree of outrage I saw today, here, when people, on whatever side, make comments that vilify any other group of faith in this nation. Likewise, when we see somebody wear a nun's habit, for example, in something like the Mardi Gras—I'm not going to comment on whether the Mardi Gras should or shouldn't occur—if you're so outraged at what occurred here today, where is the equivalent outrage when another group or people of faith have their sense of dress, or something that is identified with their faith, mocked in a similar way? I just encourage a common standard.


The second point I would like to come to is international human rights law. The Attorney-General rightly mentioned the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I note that the Senate Select Committee on the Exposure Draft of the Marriage Amendment (Same-Sex Marriage) Bill, which looked at the intersection of human rights and religious freedom with the subject of same-sex marriage—that committee ran over Christmas and reported in February this year—noted that, unlike articles 2 and 26 of the ICCPR, on discrimination and equality, Australia has not legislated to enact in Australian law at the Commonwealth or a state level article 18, which goes to freedom of religion.


That is one of the key concerns of various faith groups, but also of people who are not of a faith group but who have a conscientious objection to a change in the definition of 'marriage', because, under our law, there is no protection for them, which is contrary to article 18. The committee found, and this was a consensus view, that Australia is not under an obligation to make a change, and that's by jurisprudence of the United Nations Human Rights Committee and also the European Court of Human Rights. Under international law, if you do not offend another human right then there is no legal basis to derogate a human right such as article 18. That is a significant issue which our nation needs to consider.


Lastly to the substantive point of the stunt that was pulled by Senator Hanson. We need to be careful in this country: just because we don't like the political party or the nature of the person who is raising an issue, we shouldn't disregard the substantive issue because we don't like the person who is delivering the message. I draw the Senate chamber's attention, for example, to the Kingdom of Morocco. It is a 99 per cent Muslim nation which has taken steps to ban the importation, production or sale of the burqa. They haven't banned people from wearing it, but they've taken very strict measures because they see that this is a sign of creeping extremism within the Islamic faith, and they tie it particularly to the Wahhabi stream of teaching. So even Muslim nations—people like President el-Sisi; the President of Indonesia; and those of other nations—have identified that there are concerns with extremism and the emblems that go with it. We need to be careful that we don't disregard the key issue that was raised because of who raised it.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-08-17,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:21):  I, too, want to support the words of Senator Dastyari. I know that when we got to the task of taking note today we were intending to focus on the first question that was asked of Senator Scullion, around power. But, obviously, some events have overtaken that, and I think they are of a serious nature. I acknowledge the comments from the Liberals, those who have so far made a contribution in this debate, and I also acknowledge the words of Senator Brandis in response to Senator Hanson's question.


I think one of the important things for me in talking about this is looking at the issue of national security. I think Senator Brandis did a good job here in response to Senator Hanson, and it is something that I also spoke about in my first speech. There is a level of bipartisanship amongst the government and opposition when it comes to dealing with issues of national security. I think the reason for that is that there are serious threats. The government takes them seriously and, indeed, as those who aspire to government the opposition does as well. Probably the most disappointing thing about what we saw today is that Senator Hanson was willing to use a stunt that would be so offensive to the Islamic or Muslim population to try to make a cheap political point around national security. There is no place or time for that to happen about something as serious as that.


I know there are a number of our armed forces serving overseas. There is no way that they are going to benefit from what we saw today in the stunt from Senator Pauline Hanson. It is not going to add to their security and it is not going to do anything for the security concerns that Australians legitimately have, given how we have been targeted so far.


I think Senator Hanson and Senator Fawcett touched on this in terms of not attacking the person. I don't think anyone has done that deliberately. But we also need to ensure that there is a strong response from the government and the opposition so that the people of Australia understand where the major parties are going to land on such an important topic as this, and the way that this chamber is used with regard to important debates such as religious freedom and national security. It is important that the Australian people see that this parliament takes those seriously.


From time to time, there will be differences of opinion from the major parties on this, but we always have those debates in a serious way, and I know that there are levels of briefing that the government and opposition are often aware of that the community aren't at the same time. The public put a lot of faith in members of parliament to ensure that they take those responsibilities around civil liberties, protecting freedoms and also getting security settings right. It would be a shame if that overwhelming consensus from the community is undermined by cheap political stunts that we saw from Senator Hanson today. In closing, I thank Senator Brandis for his comments in response and I echo the thoughts of Senator Dastyari as the first senator taking note from the Labor team.

The PRESIDENT
 (15:31):  Senators, it is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 15 August of this year of the Hon. Brian Francis Gibson AM, a senator for the state of Tasmania from 1993 until 2002, and, during this time, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:31):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep sorrow at the death, on 15 August 2017, of the Honourable Brian Francis Gibson, AM, places on record its gratitude and admiration for his service to the Parliament and the nation, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Brian Francis Gibson was born in Ascot Vale in Victoria on 4 November 1936. He was the eldest of 10 children of Kingsley Melbourne Gibson and his wife Agnes. After completing his secondary education at St Patrick's College in Ballarat, Brian followed his father into a career in forestry, undertaking further study by way of a Bachelor of Science in Forestry and a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Melbourne. From 1957 until 1972 he worked with the Forests Commission of Victoria, and it was during his early years with the commission that he married Pauline Veronica James, with whom he had three children, Sharon, Kieran and David.


The beginning of Brian's association with Tasmania came in 1972 when he was recruited by the paper and pulping firm Australian Newsprint Mills in the town of Boyer. Before taking up this new role, however, Brian travelled to Jamaica with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization to lend his expertise to a forestry project in that nation. Returning to Tasmania, he went on to serve as Managing Director of Australian Newsprint Mills from 1980 to 1989 and as President of the National Association of Forest Industries from 1987 to 1991. These were years during which the polarising disputes between conservationists and the Tasmanian forestry sector were particularly acute, and Brian's time at the helm of the industry's peak advocacy body no doubt coloured his views on the impediments to his state's future prosperity. He was no friend of the Greens. In his maiden speech, he lamented the fact that, although the environmental movement had successfully widened our understanding of the need for environmental consciousness, unfortunately the extremists of the movement had been successful in creating unnecessary concern about particular issues, and the political decisions which had arisen had done great harm to our economy and the investment climate.


Brian Gibson won preselection by the Tasmanian division of the Liberal Party and was elected to the Senate at the 1993 federal election, taking the place of the retiring Liberal senator for Tasmania, Shirley Walters, whose death we mourned only recently. In his maiden speech in this place, Brian paid tribute to the significant contributions of his predecessor but sought to assure his colleagues that they 'should not expect the same frequency of interjections from this seat', an assurance which I am sure all honourable senators who served with him would agree he lived up to. But that did nothing to diminish the significance of his contribution to the parliament. He was an exquisitely polite man.


At 56 years of age, Brian had already had an enormously successful career in business when he took his place in this chamber. He had been chief executive of Australian Newsprint Mills for nearly a decade and was also an independent director of several large corporations, including being chairman of the Hydro-Electric Commission. In 1988, he had been appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for his services to the forestry industry. Being responsible for managing Australian Newsprint Mills, one of Australia's few internationally competitive manufacturers in that sector, was, Brian observed, 'a good position from which to observe and understand the Australian economy'. In his maiden speech he made no secret of his intention to use his precious time in this place directing his energies towards reforming the economy and the business of government. It was microeconomic reform in particular which was for Brian an issue of moral concern, for he was adamant that it was only through increased productivity, together with fiscal restraint, that Australia could remain prosperous—wise words, indeed—not, as he insisted, for ourselves but for our children and their children, 'so that they have options available to them to devote what they wish to leisure, to the arts and to the environment, to those less well off in the world'.


Drawing upon a lifetime of managerial and business experience, Brian Gibson quickly established a reputation within the Liberal Party as a forceful and well-informed advocate for economic reform. Just 10 months into his first term, in May 1994, he was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Richard Alston, and from December 1994 he served as parliamentary secretary to the shadow Treasurer, Peter Costello. Reflecting on his time in parliament in the twilight of his Senate career, Brian Gibson identified his time in opposition as among the most productive years in which he was able to apply his economic and business expertise to the broad scope of significant legislative change then being pursued by the Keating government. Based on his reflections, it is clear that he saw himself as an economic reformist first and a partisan politician second, and he noted that he was proud to play a part in the formulation of national competition policy and the work of the newly minted Productivity Commission.


Following John Howard's election victory in 1996, Brian Gibson joined the first Howard government as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, a particularly important role for a newly elected government determined to embark upon a course of significant economic reform. He had responsibility, among other things, for the corporations law and the Australian Securities Commission, as it was then known.


However, sadly, his time in the ministry was short lived. In October 1996, just seven months into the life of the Howard government, the Prime Minister formed the view, on a strict reading of his new code of conduct, that Brian should resign from the ministry because it had been revealed that he had signed a statutory instrument related to banking which affected a bank in which he held a small parcel of shares but by which he could not, in any way, have gained advantage. I had cause some years into my Senate career to reflect on the circumstances that led to Brian Gibson's resignation and the foreshortening of what would have been a very significant career in executive government at the forefront of economic reform. I gave a speech on the subject of ministerial responsibility to the ANU College of Law, and I recalled that many thought at the time that Brian Gibson's dismissal was unwarranted in the circumstances, but those were the early days of the government, and the Prime Minister was no doubt concerned to reinforce the public perception that his new code of conduct was unforgiving in its strictness. Subsequently, amendments were made which would allow an appropriate flexibility without compromising its purpose—to some extent, no doubt, in response to the injustice of the Gibson case.


As I also said about the circumstances of Brian Gibson's resignation, no suggestion of dishonesty was made by anyone, because such a suggestion would have been risible. A more careful, more honest, more punctilious man than Brian Gibson it would have been impossible to know. And it is a great tragedy that an overzealous application of that document by a then inexperienced Prime Minister had that effect. The view I then expressed and express again today would, I think, be shared by virtually everyone, including, I dare say, Mr Howard himself.


The injustice of Brian Gibson's resignation was taken up again by many of his Senate colleagues on the occasion of his valedictory, as was the characteristic stoicism that he had displayed in the aftermath. Reflecting on the episode, Senator Boswell observed that the dignity with which Brian exited the front bench will go down as one of the highlights of his career. A lesser person could have said: 'That's enough; I've had a gutful. You go and do it yourself now.' But he did not. He 'knuckled down and made a considerable contribution'. But perhaps the most poignant reflection on Brian Gibson's contribution to this place came from a political foe and a former senator who would be familiar to many in this place, none other than the Hon. Stephen Conroy, who said of Brian, simply, that his resignation was Australia's loss.


I had a personal association with Brian Gibson, relatively fleeting, but one that meant a lot to me. When I was first elected to the Senate, some 17 years ago, I had the good fortune to be allocated a seat beside Senator Gibson, up there where he and I sat, where Senator McKenzie and Senator Canavan currently sit. The coalition in those days had the practice of seating new senators beside older, more experienced senators. We'd not met before, and our association was relatively brief because he resigned from the Senate in February 2002. But, in the less than two years during which I got to know Brian Gibson, particularly as a new and inexperienced and enthusiastic younger senator, he was very kind to me, and he was very patient with me. As I said, a more honest, fussy, punctilious gentleman you would never hope to meet.


Brian Gibson resigned from the Senate in February 2002 to return to the world of business, in which he had achieved such notable success in his prepolitical life. It is worthy of note that, at the time he served in this chamber, he was probably the most experienced senior businessperson to sit in the parliament, and the loss of all of that commercial experience was itself a tragedy. In his postpolitical life, he served on the board of the Australian Stem Cell Centre and as a director of the Australian National Maritime Museum, among other positions.


Brian Gibson was an astute businessman, a capable parliamentarian, a cherished and honourable colleague and a devoted husband and father. He came to this place at the peak of his career. He gave significant service in policy development in a complex field to which he brought almost unique expertise, and, after the political mishap that befell him, he left in good grace and high esteem. On behalf of the government, I offer my sincere condolences to his loved ones.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:45):  I rise on behalf of the opposition to join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate and acknowledge the passing of former senator and parliamentary secretary Brian Francis Gibson AM, who passed away this week. At the outset, I convey our condolences to Mr Gibson's family and friends. He was a senator for 8½ years and, considering his contribution, particularly in the context of economic policy, I think it is reasonable to say he was unfortunate not to have had the opportunity to contribute for a longer period as a member of the executive. However, his contribution as a leader in both public and private enterprise and his work as a senator means his legacy stands tall, particularly in economic policy.


Born in Victoria, Mr Gibson's professional career was in the forest and forestry products sector. Initially an employee of the Forests Commission Victoria between 1957 and 1972, it was a job opportunity with Australian Newsprint Mills in the Derwent Valley that saw him cross Bass Strait and make Tasmania his home. I note that prior to taking up this position he fulfilled his commitment to using his professional skills for greater economic and social good by working for the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations on a forestry project in Jamaica.


In 1980 he became managing director of Australian Newsprint Mills, a position he held until 1989, and he also served between 1987 and 1991 as the President of NAFI, the National Association of Forest Industries, an organisation with which I have some familiarity and which has played a prominent role in Tasmania's forest debates over many years. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for his contribution to the industry in 1988. It was his professional and managerial experience that led the Tasmanian government to appoint him as the chairman of Tassie hydro in 1989. He would serve on the commission at a time when it was attempting to modernise to meet the challenges posed by the impending introduction of the National Competition Policy, coincidentally a policy which accorded with his views on microeconomic reform.


As the Leader of the Government has said, Mr Gibson was elected to the Senate in 1993, replacing the late Shirley Walters. Re-elected in 1998, he served until 2002. He immediately indicated his interests and demonstrated his expertise in economic affairs by making a first speech that repudiated the protectionist policies that he described as the legacy of Alfred Deakin. He decried the way such policies had inculcated, in his words, 'an inward-looking attitude within a high proportion of Australians that so many believe they do not have to be internationally competitive'. He went on to speak about the links between investment and microeconomic reform. He also advocated for major efficiency gains within the budget sector of government in order to reduce the taxation burden on individuals and business so that people would be encouraged to work harder, to save and to invest.


Given his views, it is unsurprising he associated himself with what is known as the Modest Members group of parliamentarians, who championed fiscal responsibility and accountability. He also found a place with conservative senators and members connected by a shared Christian faith. He served on many parliamentary committees. I won't list them all but I do note in particular the role he played as chair of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee and of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. As we know, the legislation committees play an important role in our Senate and, in particular, in the estimates process. Senator John Faulkner, who spent a fair amount of time in the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee in particular had this to say about him:


But in relation to Brian Gibson, I do want to say something quite genuinely. Brian Gibson was one of the best chairs of a parliamentary committee I have seen. He was a very good chair of an estimates committee basically because he understood politics—that was the difference. It was really crucial.


However, as Senator Brandis has referenced, by far and away Mr Gibson's overarching contribution throughout his time in the Senate was in the area of economic policy. He came to this place with well-formed views about the place of government in the economy and the reforms he saw as necessary to lift the productivity of the Australian economy. His arrival was timely, as it coincided with a period of economic reform: the Keating government's own push for microeconomic reform. Then, of course, his career also flowed on to the Howard government's election and the changes that government sought and achieved for the tax system.


First in opposition and then in government, Brian Gibson articulated three fundamental reforms to the budget process. These were the application of an accrual accounting method to Commonwealth budgets; the appointment of a National Commission of Audit to report on Commonwealth finances and to lay out mid-term economic priorities; and the introduction of a Charter of Budget Honesty because he wanted governments to be held properly to account for their fiscal and economic policies. It says something about Mr Gibson's contribution that two of those have become the practice of the Commonwealth. Of course, the National Commission of Audit is something the previous governments have utilised. It is a testament to the way in which Brian Gibson made use of the opportunities presented to him by the parliament—such as through the Public Accounts Committee and as a member of the Select Committee on Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council—as well as within his parliamentary party that all three of these reforms were enacted during his time in the parliament.


Brian Gibson was a natural choice for the role of Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer following the election of the Howard government in 1996. He initiated overhauls in corporate law and administration, including corporate law simplification and reform. Senator Brandis has outlined in some detail the professional disappointment associated with his resignation after 10 months.


Brian Gibson went on to chair a government members' taskforce on taxation reform and to assist in the public consultation process on the new taxation system. His role in the development of what became known as the A New Tax System package, best known for the introduction of the goods and services tax, is another lasting contribution to public policy, notwithstanding our political differences on that policy. He described these measures as 'probably the most important bills with regard to the structure of the economy of Australia that this parliament has seen for many a long day'. Brian Gibson left the Senate on his own terms in 2002 and went on to serve as an executive and board member in the private and public sector.


Brian Gibson's political career was not long, but he made a substantial contribution. Any reading of his involvement at the forefront of many of the significant economic policy reforms of the mid to late 1990s shows a legacy that has endured. Perhaps most of all, he will be remembered as someone who stood by his principles both in ideology and in personal integrity. To leave politics with a reputation for dignity and honesty is something to which we would all aspire. On behalf of the opposition, I extend our deepest sympathies to Brian Gibson's family, friends and former colleagues at this time.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:53):  The life of the Hon. Brian Francis Gibson AM was one of understated achievement, commitment and service. For those of us on the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team on whose behalf I have the privilege of speaking this afternoon, can I say we had the privilege of working with him. We had the privilege of interacting with and learning from a man of principle, a man of deep knowledge, experience, understanding and wisdom.


Brian's many positions and achievements that have been fully detailed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, in anybody's language, is an impressive list. It needs to be understood that this list of achievements, appointments and positions was not just about padding out a CV. He devoted himself heart and soul to each task that he undertook. The understated nature of Brian is highlighted by the fact that his arrival in Canberra after the 'unlosable' election—which our side of politics went on to lose—was hardly recognised other than as a welcome new face rather than being recognised for the hotbed of policy talent and experience which was so sorely needed at the time.


It was through his friend former President Paul Calvert that the leadership was alerted to his wealth of capacities. Once realised, those talents were immediately and effectively harnessed as he helped develop the policies in opposition and at the beginning of the new Liberal government which ushered in and heralded the golden decade of 1996 to 2007.


His integrity was beyond question, yet an overly prescriptive and, quite frankly, senseless interpretation of ministerial standards saw him resign. As many said at the time, if there is a standard which requires Brian's resignation, I would back Brian any day over the particular requirement.


Brian just recently received a call from former Prime Minister Howard, who had learned of Brian's severe ill health. That was a call that Brian genuinely appreciated. It's an indication of former Prime Minister Howard's genuineness and the high regard in which John Howard held Brian Gibson.


His interest in public policy and political matters remained with him till the end. I, for one, was the beneficiary of numerous phone calls from him. I indeed met with Brian for a coffee as recently as 22 June, when he spoke realistically about his health challenges and stark prognosis, yet he did so with thankfulness for the extra decade of good living with which he had been blessed after a grim diagnosis with a different issue a decade earlier. His particular condition then was well treated and contained through the application of cutting-edge treatment. Regrettably, as one form of illness was being effectively treated, another was quietly taking hold of Mr Gibson, undetected, and ultimately claimed his life. On behalf of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team, I express the condolences of the team to his lovely and supportive wife, Pauline, and his three children and thank him for his unselfish service to our state and nation. May he rest in peace.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:57):  I too want to associate myself with the remarks that my leader and other speakers have made about Brian Gibson. I served with him in all the time he was here, and he was a real gentleman—perhaps unsuited to being in parliament because he was such a gentleman. But he was such a capable man.


I continue to be distressed at the way Brian was sort of forced out of the parliament—not, I might say, by the opposition but by his own team. The incident which was the catalyst for that was at a crazy time in our political history. Brian Gibson was as honest as any person who has ever worked in this chamber could be, and the fact that he was required through political pressure to resign over a very minor technical infringement has distressed me ever since. Brian was a person who could have made such a real contribution to Australian life. He had made a significant contribution to his own state and his own community in what he did in his pre-parliamentary life, and it is just one of those great shames of life and politics, I guess, that someone who could have made such a great contribution had such a short time here. But, in the short time he was here, he certainly captured the friendship of everyone. Everyone acknowledged him as a very significant contributor to the debate and the works of this parliament and of government.


Mr President, I don't have the authority to do this, but I'm sure I can say it if others perhaps haven't mentioned it: I know that former Presidents Calvert and Ferguson would want to be associated with this condolence motion as well. Unfortunately, they are all at the other end of the country from me, but, as Senator Abetz and other Tasmanians would know, former Senators Calvert, Ferguson and Gibson were a bit of a trio around the country doing various things in retirement.




Senator Brandis:
  Playing golf.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Playing golf! Well, I'll say 'doing things'—playing golf. I think they did a bit of fishing as well.




Senator Brandis:
  Along with Warwick Parer.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Along with Warwick Parer—and Bill Taylor I think might have been part of that crew as well. But I do know that the two former presidents were very close to Brian and would want to be associated with the motion as well.


My condolences to Pauline and to all of the family and extended family. I appreciate you've lost a husband, a very, very close friend and a father, but we as Australians have lost someone who did make and, regrettably, could have made a much greater contribution to public life in our country. Brian, rest in peace.



The PRESIDENT:  Could I ask senators to rise and to signify their assent to the motion by standing with me in silence.

 (Queensland) (16:23):  by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to China, which took place on 26 June to 1 July 2017. I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.


Leave granted.




Senator WATT:

That the Senate take note of the document.


I seek leave to make a short statement.


Leave granted.




Senator WATT:
  I was very privileged to have the opportunity to travel to China as part of a cross-party delegation, along with my colleague Senator Smith, who I think will speak on this shortly as well. This was a delegation that took place for about five days in June-July, led by the Speaker, Mr Tony Smith. The main purpose of the delegation was a continuation of a parliamentary dialogue that has been underway between the Australian and Chinese parliaments for a number of years now.


As someone who had not previously been to China, this was obviously a fascinating experience. It was only a brief delegation, and it only managed to visit Beijing and Shanghai, but, as I had been forewarned by many people who have travelled to China, the scale of development that you see when visiting these cities is quite astonishing. 


I think, if you speak to any foreign policy expert in Australia, pretty much everyone recognises that there is no country that is going to be more vital to the shaping of our region in the years ahead than China, so this delegation was a very important opportunity for Australian parliamentarians to get a better understanding of some of the issues between our two nations, some of the issues that we will need to work on together, and to get a sense of what the Chinese government and Chinese people see as priorities for their relationship with our country.


As usually occurs in these delegations, the delegation did have a number of different meetings that spanned business, trade, politics and culture. We learnt a lot from the experience through a variety of meetings with representatives of the Chinese government, including the third-most senior member of the Chinese government, who is the chair of the National People's Congress. We also had some extremely interesting meetings with Chinese businesses, including one business that I will single out—JD.com—that I've been describing as a Chinese version of Amazon. It is quite remarkable to see the scale of operations of online retail and the services sector in China going forward.


As I mentioned, the key focus of this delegation was the sixth meeting of the China-Australia bilateral parliamentary exchange, where we had an opportunity to meet our counterparts in the Chinese parliament and discuss issues of mutual interest, ranging from foreign policy and security to trade, law and justice issues. Clearly, from the number of times that it was raised during this delegation, the Chinese government's initiative—the Belt and Road Initiative—is an extremely high priority for the Chinese people and the Chinese government. I know that the Australian government has shown some interest in participating in this initiative, through the attendance of Minister Ciobo at a conference concerning it earlier this year. 


That is one example of the immense opportunities that still lie ahead for Australian businesses and Australian workers through deeper engagement with China. Obviously there are many Australian businesses that have already taken advantage of these opportunities, and I think it's probably a little bit tempting at times to wonder whether we've already seen the peak of China's development and the peak of the economic opportunities. But I certainly left this delegation very much convinced that we've only really seen the beginning. 


As a Queensland senator, one of the things that I have been thinking about—both during this delegation and subsequently—is that my own home state has done very well from the boom in China over recent years, when we think about commodity exports, whether they be coal, other minerals, or agricultural products. I think it's very important that all Australian governments, whether we're talking about the Commonwealth government or our state governments, including my own in Queensland, really apply themselves to thinking about how we can take advantage of the incredible growth that lies ahead in Chinese consumption. 


As I said, the business that we visited, JD.com, really gave an indication of the kind of trade in services and products that is still available. As we see the continued growth in China, I want to make sure that businesses in my own home state are adequately geared up to take advantage of these opportunities. We're already doing some great work in increasing the number of Chinese tourists visiting Australia and the number of students from China who are visiting and being educated in Australia. But there are a lot more opportunities ahead, and I want to make sure we're all focusing on them.

I also participated in the Australian parliamentary delegation to China, and in the very, very few moments available to me, I would like to reflect on what an insightful and important visit it was. It comes at a critical time, but not just for my state's development—of course, the modern prosperity of Western Australia has been well and truly built on the back of Chinese growth, but, more importantly, our agricultural sector enjoys great prosperity as a result of strong trade between Western Australian agriculturalists and China. 


Of course, it comes at a very important time because the geopolitical landscape is changing. As a nation, we must be prepared to manage what will be difficult and complex issues in regard to our relationship with China. Close and particular attention on managing human rights issues both inside China and between China and its neighbours is a critical issue for me and, I know, for other senators in this place. In conclusion, can I just thank Senator—

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-08-17,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:30):  Today I rise to continue my remarks on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Executive Remuneration) Bill 2017. The purpose of this bill is to put downward pressure on excessive salaries paid at Australia Post and the National Broadband Network, NBN. I have always intended that this bill would start the process to reduce excessive salaries paid by the taxpayer. In 2016, eight people at Australia Post were paid a total of nearly $14 million, including the managing director, who was paid $5.6 million. In that same year, Australia Post returned just $20 million as a dividend to government and had undisclosed plans to sell the iconic GPOs in capital cities. These assets were previously agreed to be held in trust for the people of Australia. When the Sydney GPO was sold to Singaporean billionaires we were told the money would be invested in people and services at Australia Post. My view is that these assets should not have been sold. The Labor government appointed Mr Fahour as the Managing Director of Australia Post and, in the six years that followed, taxpayers paid Mr Fahour approximately $24 million, approved and supported by the board of Australia Post. If the board of Australia Post were not paying excessive salaries to key management positions, it would not have been necessary to sell off these national treasures to invest in people and services.


So how do Australians find themselves watching iconic public assets being sold to enrich a few private individuals at Australia Post? Anyone can see the board of Australia Post is incompetent and the government weak. The Managing Director of Australia Post was paid $5.6 million in 2016, which is excessive, to say the least, when compared to equivalent positions such as Canada Post, at A$497,000; US mail, A$543,616; and the Royal Mail in the UK, A$2.5 million. Let's put this in perspective. The board of Australia Post paid Mr Fahour more than 10 times the salary of the Prime Minister of Australia. This does not pass the pub test. After I raised concerns about Mr Fahour's pay packet on the floor of this place, he handed in his resignation the following week, because his pay had never been challenged before.


So how did the board of Australia Post arrive at $5.6 million? The mischief is that the board did not compare the role of the managing director with similar roles in Canada Post, US mail or the Royal Mail in the UK. Instead, the board instructed a consultant to look at roles in the private sector, which were entirely different to those guaranteed by government and founded on a monopoly enshrined in law.


Australia Post is owned by the government, and two shareholder ministers are tasked with acting like ordinary shareholders of any company, but they were asleep at the wheel when Australia Post went off the road. It's a tragedy and a disgrace that this government cannot manage the board of Australia Post in a way that the people of Australia expect. This government needs to learn the art of making its budget balance, and it can start with reducing the salaries of many hundreds of executives who are excessively paid with taxpayer money.


Australians are sick of seeing their hard-earned taxpayer dollars going to overpaid executives while government assets are being sold off, and I include the sale by Australia Post of the iconic GPOs in each capital city. I hear that the sales of the Brisbane and Melbourne GPOs are being negotiated, but I don't know because the government, as shareholder in Australia, keeps us all in the dark. I am sick and tired of being told about the sale of public assets after the deal is done. Australians own these assets and they want a say on whether they are sold or not. I am not going to keep fighting for the rights of Australians to be told in advance what is being done with their assets.


This week the Commonwealth Bank announced it would cut the remuneration package of its chief executive officer by 35 per cent. The board of the bank took the decision in response to shareholder concerns and wider community outrage. The lesson here is that remuneration can go down.


The government, as a matter of urgency, should be conducting a review of the salaries paid to our university vice-chancellors. This group of some 38 men and women are excessively paid. They are on average the highest-paid vice-chancellors in the world, but their universities are not the highest-performing universities in the world. Sydney university is ranked 60th in the world, but the vice-chancellor of Sydney university receives more than double the pay of the No. 1 university in the world, which is Oxford university. The Oxford university vice-chancellor is paid $577,000 a year. In Australia, the average vice-chancellor receives $890,000 a year, and all bar two are paid more than the vice-chancellor of Oxford university. This is a disgrace given many of our universities rank outside the top 300 in the world, and some are not even on the list that ends at 981. Universities cannot expect more funding from taxpayers when they overpay their vice-chancellors. That sets unrealistic relativities throughout the university.


Some senators may recall the public outrage when they learned $5.6 million had been paid to the managing director of Australia Post by the board of Australia Post. Equally outrageous is the payment of $3.6 million to the chief executive officer of the poorly performing NBN. My pressure on government forced them to issue a press release with the heading 'Remuneration Tribunal to oversee Australia Post managing director salary and conditions'. The key word here is 'oversee', because the government wants you to believe that the Remuneration Tribunal exercises some oversight over the determination of the salary for the new managing director of Australia Post. This was not the case and it could never have been the case.


Australians know that, when you say one thing but do something else, you break trust. But still the government was willing to do that and so implemented an underhanded strategy. The government pretended it was outraged at Mr Fahour's pay packet of $5.6 million. Labor also pretended to be outraged, but both parties had opportunities to deal with this excessive remuneration in past years and chose not to do anything. The government press release on 23 February 2017 was a quick and cheap way of giving the appearance of responding to the concerns of Australians, because the press release said the Remuneration Tribunal would determine the pay packet of future managing directors at Australia Post. We know the press release was misleading, because section 86 of the Australian Postal Commission Act 1989 says:


The Managing Director holds office on such terms and conditions (including terms and conditions relating to remuneration and allowances) in relation to matters not provided for by this Act as are determined by the Board.


Nevertheless, the day after the press release, the government purported to give the role to the Remuneration Tribunal, knowing full well that a letter signed by a minister cannot override an act of the parliament. The letter, a legal instrument, declared the board of the Australian Postal Commission would continue to be the employing body, and it assigned the position of managing director at Australia Post a classification E, with a minimum salary of over $469,340, with no upper limit. Let me repeat that: no upper limit. This is no accident. Classifications A, B, C and D all have upper limits. So they have given it completely back to the hands of the board of Australia Post to pay whatever they want to their CEO or managing director.


The board of Australia Post has now offered the new managing director of Australia Post a target reward of $2,337,500 and a stretch incentive of a further $412,500, making the package of $2,750,000 a year. This is half of the $5.6 million paid to Mr Fahour, but it does not reset relativities in pay at Australia Post, where seven key upper-management positions received $8,167,942 in 2016.


Despite all the government's pretence about the Remuneration Tribunal being the body to oversee and determine the quantum of the pay for the managing director of Australia Post, there is nothing to stop the pay rising back to $5.6 million or beyond in the near future. The underhanded way in which the government has gone about this whole matter simply reinforces the need for the Communications Legislation Amendment (Executive Remuneration) Bill 2017 to pass. In my bill, the right of the board of Australia Post to set remuneration will be taken out of the Australian Postal Corporation Act, and that right will by given to the Remuneration Tribunal.


The second part of my bill relates to the position of the CEO at NBN. NBN is on the government books as an asset, not a liability. It has been valued at close to $30 billion, which no-one would pay for the performance it delivers to the poor bunnies of Australia, who have been forced to take it, pay more and receive less than before. I am a member of a Senate inquiry dealing with NBN. It is heartbreaking to listen to the ordinary Australians who have made submissions to the committee. It is a disaster. Yet, despite NBN not meeting its own targets, the chief executive officer of NBN is being paid $3.6 million.


The government will not consider doing anything to reset the remuneration package at NBN because all the focus has been on Australia Post. The government is like a consumer who pays twice what they need to for designer label goods because they have no confidence in their ability to judge quality. The government needs to learn that there is not a direct correlation between how much you pay and what you get. I am determined to see excessive salaries and bonuses paid by hardworking Australian taxpayers reined in, but the government, the opposition and some crossbenchers want to fight that aim at every turn.


Australia Post and NBN are the worst cases of excess. If the Senate will not deal with the worst cases of excess, then there is no hope that a long line of other excessively paid positions will be reduced. Boards of government businesses have proven poor at negotiating remuneration packages. Just look at Australia Post and NBN. These boards do not have the skills nor the ability to stay at arm's length from what one paper describes as rolled-gold negotiators. We need the Remuneration tribunal to set the terms and conditions for all key positions in government-owned businesses. I ask senators to support this bill.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-08-17,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:44):  I agree with some of what Senator Hanson has just said. She makes, in my view, a very good point: that the leader of our nation, the Prime Minister, from whichever political party, is paid a fraction of what many other people are paid in this community. I always smile at the fact that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, who is in charge of financial matters in Australia, receives, I suspect—I am not quite sure what it is—around $350,000 to $400,000. But he deals with the executive heads of the major banks, who receive $17 million, $5 million, $3 million plus. When the people who have charge of monetary policy in Australia are paid a pittance compared to what the people they deal with in this country have, it just seems to be a very skewed way of remunerating people. I made the point even when Mr Wayne Swan was the Treasurer—and, heaven forbid, if you were paying him by value, you wouldn't have paid him a cent. But he was there, he was in charge of the monetary system, and it was ridiculous that even Mr Swan was paid only a pittance compared to those he was dealing with.


However, I digress a little bit. I simply wanted to say I'm glad that Senator Hanson has raised these issues. They are issues that we've tried to raise many a time. Senator Hanson, you left out of your contribution something I thought you might've raised. It's something that, for years, we tried to get a handle on, and that is: what is paid to the totally taxpayer funded ABC? I remember we had Senate committee after Senate committee, we had advice from the clerks, and we used to say to the ABC, 'What are your presenters paid?' They refused to tell us. We eventually got to a compromise where we learned that the three major presenters from the ABC got within this range, which meant that some of these people, who, in my view, are nothing more than spruikers for the ALP and the Greens political party, were getting $5 million, $6 million, $7 million in salary for a couple of hours work a week. So maybe there needs to be a bit more transparency in what the taxpayers pay to some senior ABC presenters, on-air people, who I say work a few hours a week because they only do one show a week. As a parliamentarian, I know they do a bit of preparation work. But it's interesting to think about why these presenters, a couple of whom we know have very strong Labor Party connections, are paid these enormous salaries by the taxpayer to propagate what seems to me to be Labor Party propaganda. Others will disagree with that. That's a personal view on these particular presenters. I won't mention them by name. But I think it's time for the ABC, which is totally taxpayer funded, to be brought into this scrutiny, as we politicians always are. If any of my colleagues in this chamber make an indiscretion in their financial matters, it's always the media that are first in to query it and to make it a front-page story. And yet, with the ABC, we have no idea what individuals are paid, and I think that, as a national broadcaster, paid for by the taxpayers' money, that's something parliamentarians should have more oversight of.


But I've digressed from this particular bill. While I listened intently to Senator Hanson's contribution, insofar as Australia Post is concerned, this proposed legislation is superfluous. The intent of the bill was to limit the remuneration of the managing director of Australia Post—I'll come to NBN later. But the government has acted to ensure the remuneration of the managing director of Australia Post now aligns with community expectations. For that reason I suggest to Senator Hanson, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, that the bill's not required, in order to achieve the outcome that she and her party obviously seek to achieve. You don't need to do that, because the government has already acted. In February this year, Senator Cash, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, declared that Australia Post is the employing body for the principal executive officer, the managing director, of Australia Post. This had the effect of bringing the managing director's remuneration under the oversight of the Remuneration Tribunal, and that meant that the board of Australia Post had to set the terms and conditions for the managing director consistent with the requirements of the Remuneration Tribunal. The remuneration for the incoming managing director, as all senators will know, was set under these new arrangements and is half of the remuneration of the outgoing managing director. The Remuneration Tribunal already sets the remuneration for Australia Post's chair and deputy chair and non-executive directors. The government took this decisive action to address community concerns regarding the remuneration paid to the former managing director.


These matters have been raised in any number of Senate committees over the many years that I have been here, but, as Senator Hanson rightly said, it was always difficult for Senate estimates committees to get any real information as to what the former managing director was actually paid. When it was revealed that he was on a total of $5.6 million in 2015-16, everybody appreciated that that was well out of step with community expectations—at a time, I might say, when Australia Post was losing money and the services it was providing to those who needed its services was limited.


I remember trying to do something about the mail centre in Rockhampton, to help out a couple of little people who couldn't get a night's sleep because of all this activity happening next door to their place in a residential area of Rockhampton. We interacted with Australia Post for a period of time. I must say, they treated us courteously, and they responded to everything. But we never achieved much because to remove the mail centre from a residential area and put it on an industrial estate would've cost too much money—though I suspect, in retrospect, it probably wouldn't have cost more than half the managing director's salary. So certainly what was paid to the previous managing director was out of step with the community's expectations.


The Remuneration Tribunal has looked at this matter and they have set a total remuneration reference rate for the office of managing director of $1.4 million, and they have agreed to a performance pay incentive arrangement that provides for access to up to 100 per cent of the total remuneration—that is, an additional $1.4 million. So the board can, if it so wishes, pay a total of $2.75 million, if my arithmetic is correct. That is a matter for the board. But it is overseen by the Remuneration Tribunal, which accepts that Australia Post is a big business with a lot of outlets right around Australia and that it has a lot of dealings with franchisees and a lot international dealings and so it does require the very best person to take on that role.


I know that I—and, I am sure, all other senators—get lots of complaints from licensed post office operators about the treatment they receive from Australia Post. I am currently trying to help the LPO operator in Normanton, way up in the Gulf of Carpentaria, in a dispute with Australia Post as to where the post office in this fairly remote area delivers the money it collects from all those grey nomads travelling up to Karumba near Normanton, and I am hopeful that that matter, which has gone to mediation, will be resolved so that the genuine issues which the operator had can be addressed at the very earliest time.


Whilst I understand what Senator Hanson is getting at, can I again repeat that the government has already addressed that. The Remuneration Tribunal does oversee what the board can pay the managing director of Australia Post. I know that at the time the managing director changed there were changes to the board of Australia Post. I don't know all of the board, but I do know one or two of them. Contrary to Senator Hanson's description of none of them being rolled-gold negotiators, one of the board members that I do happen to know you can class as a rolled-gold negotiator. So the board has changed. I think there is a new appreciation of what needs to be done. It's not an easy business, Australia Post, I concede. It requires good people, and you have to pay well to get good people. But I'm confident now that the board, with the oversight of the Remuneration Tribunal, has got the right balance.


In relation to NBN, you can't but have sympathy with some of the issues Senator Hanson raised today. The reason that the CEO of NBN is not subject to the Remuneration Tribunal is that the shareholder ministers of the NBN actually wrote to the Remuneration Tribunal and told them that they weren't to look at this. Those two ministers, I hasten to add, are not the current ministers. They were, of course, Mr Lindsay Tanner and former senator Stephen Conroy. In a letter dated 24 June 2009, they wrote to the President of the Remuneration Tribunal and said: 


Given that the company has been established with the view to taking on private owners within the next few years, we do not propose to have the position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company designated as a Principal Executive Officer, or to seek a Remuneration Tribunal determination in relation to the role.


I was around when this NBN was set up. There was never any way in the world—and I bet Senator Conroy, I think, a carton of Grange; I was confident in making the bet quite expensive because I knew I would never have to pay up—that in my lifetime or in Senator Conroy's lifetime would the NBN in the Conroy model ever be sold to private enterprise, because it would be a loss-making company and no profit-making private enterprise would ever consider buying something that was losing so much money. The Conroy model was such that it was impossible for NBN ever to make a profit and, therefore, ever to be in the hands of private owners.


Since the coalition has taken over, NBN will still struggle, I suspect, to make a profit, but it has a chance. I guess at some time in the long-distant future it may become a profitable company and it may then be more appropriate that a private entity run a business rather than the government trying to run a business. The days of governments and public servants trying to run a business passed in the '50s and in Russia and in Eastern Europe in the 1980s, when everyone realised—you didn't have to be an economic genius to realise—that governments and public servants shouldn't be running private businesses. But that is why that wasn't done.


I suspect another reason the Labor Party didn't want the Remuneration Tribunal anywhere near this organisation was that the early stages of the NBN under Senator Conroy turned out to be a repository for failed Labor apparatchiks to get a well-paying job. There was a former Queensland Labor member of parliament by the name of Kaiser who was thrown out of parliament for indiscretions. Would you believe it? He ended up working for NBN as a government liaison person at twice the money he would have received as a politician in the Queensland parliament. I always used to wonder why NBN, which was at that time a government-owned organisation totally under the control of Senator Conroy, needed a government liaison person. They were the government! It was the government liaising with themselves. I guess that, with some of the early payments made by NBN to middle-order officials, the last thing Senator Conroy or those in charge would have wanted was for the Remuneration Tribunal to be anywhere near it.




Senator Smith:
  Mike Kaiser.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mike Kaiser—you're quite right, Senator Smith. It is the government's view, however, that, for the moment, it remains appropriate that the NBN retain responsibility, or the board retains responsibility, for recruiting key management personnel and setting the remuneration. The NBN board itself is now made up of leaders with specific telecommunications, industry, government and wider commercial expertise. The government is, at this stage, prepared to leave the NBN board to determine the appropriate remuneration required to attract the talent needed to manage the NBN rollout. When compared to Australian businesses of similar size and to executive salaries in the communications sector—and I particularly mention the communication sector—NBN's remuneration is comparable with executive salaries in public companies.


But, again, I know that under the guidance of Senator Fifield and the government, generally, the NBN board will be aware that they should pay industry standards. If they go beyond it, as happened in the case years ago with the Australia Post board, then the government would be watching that very closely. It is the government's and the public's view that what was happening in Australia Post didn't pass the community standard that is expected. The government is very conscious of that. They changed the laws in relation to Australia Post. Whilst at the moment the government is happy to leave the qualified board at NBN to get industry-standard people there at the industry-standard price, it will be keeping a very close watching eye on that.


So the government won't be supporting the bill, because (a) part of it has already been actioned by the Turnbull government, and (b) we think that with NBN at the moment and in that particular sector of the economy, it's one that's best left to a qualified board, which NBN now has.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2017-08-17,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (17:02):  The Communications Legislation Amendment (Executive Remuneration) Bill 2017 would formally give the Remuneration Tribunal the ability to set the remunerations of the CEOs of Australia Post and NBN Co. This is in the wake of revelations that the remuneration of Australia Post's previous chief executive officer was $5.6 million last year. This has quite rightly been widely criticised and was not in line with community expectations for an entity that is ultimately supported by taxpayers. Australia Post did not report the CEO's salary and, rightly, was roundly criticised for this. Indeed, it was only after a Senate committee denied their request to keep the figure private was it actually finally revealed. The CEO affected has since stood down from his position at Australia Post.


The government then moved to designate the CEO of Australia Post as a principal executive officer and Australia Post as an employing body under the Remuneration Tribunal in response to the outcry over the former CEO's salary. The government has stated that this has had the effect of ensuring the Remuneration Tribunal has appropriate oversight of the CEO's pay. We understand that the tribunal did oversee the setting of the remuneration package for the incoming chief executive officer, who is on a considerably lower salary package.


Labor and the government undertook significant reforms to the Commonwealth's financial management arrangements. This has established a framework necessary for a modern public sector. These reforms were based on a number of key principles: that the government should operate as a coherent whole; that a common set of duty should apply to all public resources handled by Commonwealth entities; and that these should be managed prudently and efficiently. The performance of the public sector is more than financial, and engaging with risk is a necessary step in improving performance. The PGPA Act provided more flexible arrangements for entities and relied on the management of a number of subordinate rules and regulations where officials were expected to be held to a high standard of accountability. And yet we have recently seen, through the Australia Post example and other agencies, decisions not to disclose the remuneration of their senior executives.


As we have learnt now, the Abbott and Turnbull governments did not ensure that Commonwealth entities had sufficient checks and balances on executive remuneration. This led to Australia Post's not revealing the chief executive officer's $5.6 million remuneration package, which was clearly out of step with community expectations. The failure by Australia Post management and board to reveal detailed remuneration information as part of its annual report was enabled by changes to reporting rules which had been made by the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. This demonstrates very much the gaps in the Commonwealth's financial reporting framework that have opened up under this government, and this bill does not actually fix that problem.


We on this side are of the view that greater transparency and scrutiny through Senate estimates will assist to ensure boards and management are held to account for the setting of remuneration, and that it is within the community's expectations, as was shown through the Australia Post example. The Auditor-General considered that there would be benefit in making the aggregate level of transparency for key management remuneration in the public sector consistent with that required for listed entities, and the government has also requested a number of Commonwealth entities revert to the previous regime of remuneration reporting. We welcome the release of those reports under the Minister for Finance's request. However, we believe the government should act to ensure that these are formally required of all Commonwealth entities, and not just at the request of the minister. The government is yet to act on this.


When everyone else is tightening their belt and experiencing record low wage growth, the government was happy for CEOs' salaries to be hidden, as in Australia Post's example. But in comparison to the poor choice by Australia Post, NBN Co chose to disclose much more detailed information. Labor is keen to consider how to formalise the requirements for executive remuneration to enhance transparency, thereby enhancing trust from the community and hold boards and secretaries to account for their remuneration arrangements.

"Burston, Sen Brian",PHON,2017-08-17,"



Senator BURSTON
 (New South Wales) (17:07):  I rise to speak on Senator Hanson's bill, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Executive Remuneration) Bill. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 and the National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011 to remove the ability of the respective boards to set remuneration and to give that authority to Remuneration Tribunal by amending the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973.


It is my understanding that the Remuneration Tribunal already sets remuneration for most of the other government business enterprises, such as the Australian Rail Track Corporation, which is responsible for some 10,000km of interstate rail; the Australian Submarine Corporation, which is responsible for naval shipbuilding and the proposed spend of $50 billion on new submarines; Defence Housing Australia; and the Moorebank Intermodal Company, which is responsible for the major infrastructure hubs in Sydney. If the Remuneration Tribunal can handle the remuneration of the Prime Minister, members of parliament, the judiciary and others managing government businesses, then it can handle the remuneration for the most senior officers at Australia Post and NBN.


While I'm on the subject of the Remuneration Tribunal, I would like to take the opportunity to remind the Senate that in March this year only senators Bernardi, Leyonhjelm and Lambie and the One Nation senators voted to forgo pay rises set by the government until the federal government delivered a budget surplus. It seems there is not a more unifying issue in this place for senators than their own hip pocket—maybe a parliamentary dual citizenship audit is a close second, but I digress.


No-one in this place could reasonably argue that the annual remuneration of almost $6 million for the previous managing director of Australia Post, Mr Ahmed Fahour, was out of community step and expectations, especially when you compare it to the United States, where the postal service employs over 600,000 staff and delivers more than 660 million pieces of mail a day, yet its CEO gets a package worth A$1.2 million.


The flow-on effect to taxpayers of such an excessive remuneration is significant. It makes payments of between $1.3 million and $1.8 million to a number of other executives seem reasonable. That further reduces the dividend back to the taxpayer. This in turn reduces the ability of Australia Post to absorb some of the increasing costs of delivering the mail, making posting letters and other mail more expensive. It is also a slap in the face to the real workers at Australia Post: the staff, the contractors and the owners of licensed and franchised post offices, who deliver such a valuable service to our community.


On 24 February 2017, after significant pressure from One Nation and an outcry from the Australian community, the government announced that it would bring the position of Managing Director of Australia Post within the regime administered by the Remuneration Tribunal, but it said nothing about the CEO of NBN. I note that the new Managing Director of Australia Post, Ms Christine Holgate, who starts her new role in October, has had her salary set in accordance with the parameters set by the Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal and, as such, will receive a base salary of $1.379 million a year, with the potential to earn 100 per cent of that as a bonus. While I personally think that is still excessive compared to the remuneration of the US Postal Service CEO, it is still a step in the right direction.


This bill also brings the CEO of NBN Co within the framework of the Remuneration Tribunal, and I will speak on the board of the NBN Co and its payment of $3.6 million to the chief executive officer at a later date. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-08-17,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:30):  Today I rise to continue my remarks on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Executive Remuneration) Bill 2017. The purpose of this bill is to put downward pressure on excessive salaries paid at Australia Post and the National Broadband Network, NBN. I have always intended that this bill would start the process to reduce excessive salaries paid by the taxpayer. In 2016, eight people at Australia Post were paid a total of nearly $14 million, including the managing director, who was paid $5.6 million. In that same year, Australia Post returned just $20 million as a dividend to government and had undisclosed plans to sell the iconic GPOs in capital cities. These assets were previously agreed to be held in trust for the people of Australia. When the Sydney GPO was sold to Singaporean billionaires we were told the money would be invested in people and services at Australia Post. My view is that these assets should not have been sold. The Labor government appointed Mr Fahour as the Managing Director of Australia Post and, in the six years that followed, taxpayers paid Mr Fahour approximately $24 million, approved and supported by the board of Australia Post. If the board of Australia Post were not paying excessive salaries to key management positions, it would not have been necessary to sell off these national treasures to invest in people and services.


So how do Australians find themselves watching iconic public assets being sold to enrich a few private individuals at Australia Post? Anyone can see the board of Australia Post is incompetent and the government weak. The Managing Director of Australia Post was paid $5.6 million in 2016, which is excessive, to say the least, when compared to equivalent positions such as Canada Post, at A$497,000; US mail, A$543,616; and the Royal Mail in the UK, A$2.5 million. Let's put this in perspective. The board of Australia Post paid Mr Fahour more than 10 times the salary of the Prime Minister of Australia. This does not pass the pub test. After I raised concerns about Mr Fahour's pay packet on the floor of this place, he handed in his resignation the following week, because his pay had never been challenged before.


So how did the board of Australia Post arrive at $5.6 million? The mischief is that the board did not compare the role of the managing director with similar roles in Canada Post, US mail or the Royal Mail in the UK. Instead, the board instructed a consultant to look at roles in the private sector, which were entirely different to those guaranteed by government and founded on a monopoly enshrined in law.


Australia Post is owned by the government, and two shareholder ministers are tasked with acting like ordinary shareholders of any company, but they were asleep at the wheel when Australia Post went off the road. It's a tragedy and a disgrace that this government cannot manage the board of Australia Post in a way that the people of Australia expect. This government needs to learn the art of making its budget balance, and it can start with reducing the salaries of many hundreds of executives who are excessively paid with taxpayer money.


Australians are sick of seeing their hard-earned taxpayer dollars going to overpaid executives while government assets are being sold off, and I include the sale by Australia Post of the iconic GPOs in each capital city. I hear that the sales of the Brisbane and Melbourne GPOs are being negotiated, but I don't know because the government, as shareholder in Australia, keeps us all in the dark. I am sick and tired of being told about the sale of public assets after the deal is done. Australians own these assets and they want a say on whether they are sold or not. I am not going to keep fighting for the rights of Australians to be told in advance what is being done with their assets.


This week the Commonwealth Bank announced it would cut the remuneration package of its chief executive officer by 35 per cent. The board of the bank took the decision in response to shareholder concerns and wider community outrage. The lesson here is that remuneration can go down.


The government, as a matter of urgency, should be conducting a review of the salaries paid to our university vice-chancellors. This group of some 38 men and women are excessively paid. They are on average the highest-paid vice-chancellors in the world, but their universities are not the highest-performing universities in the world. Sydney university is ranked 60th in the world, but the vice-chancellor of Sydney university receives more than double the pay of the No. 1 university in the world, which is Oxford university. The Oxford university vice-chancellor is paid $577,000 a year. In Australia, the average vice-chancellor receives $890,000 a year, and all bar two are paid more than the vice-chancellor of Oxford university. This is a disgrace given many of our universities rank outside the top 300 in the world, and some are not even on the list that ends at 981. Universities cannot expect more funding from taxpayers when they overpay their vice-chancellors. That sets unrealistic relativities throughout the university.


Some senators may recall the public outrage when they learned $5.6 million had been paid to the managing director of Australia Post by the board of Australia Post. Equally outrageous is the payment of $3.6 million to the chief executive officer of the poorly performing NBN. My pressure on government forced them to issue a press release with the heading 'Remuneration Tribunal to oversee Australia Post managing director salary and conditions'. The key word here is 'oversee', because the government wants you to believe that the Remuneration Tribunal exercises some oversight over the determination of the salary for the new managing director of Australia Post. This was not the case and it could never have been the case.


Australians know that, when you say one thing but do something else, you break trust. But still the government was willing to do that and so implemented an underhanded strategy. The government pretended it was outraged at Mr Fahour's pay packet of $5.6 million. Labor also pretended to be outraged, but both parties had opportunities to deal with this excessive remuneration in past years and chose not to do anything. The government press release on 23 February 2017 was a quick and cheap way of giving the appearance of responding to the concerns of Australians, because the press release said the Remuneration Tribunal would determine the pay packet of future managing directors at Australia Post. We know the press release was misleading, because section 86 of the Australian Postal Commission Act 1989 says:


The Managing Director holds office on such terms and conditions (including terms and conditions relating to remuneration and allowances) in relation to matters not provided for by this Act as are determined by the Board.


Nevertheless, the day after the press release, the government purported to give the role to the Remuneration Tribunal, knowing full well that a letter signed by a minister cannot override an act of the parliament. The letter, a legal instrument, declared the board of the Australian Postal Commission would continue to be the employing body, and it assigned the position of managing director at Australia Post a classification E, with a minimum salary of over $469,340, with no upper limit. Let me repeat that: no upper limit. This is no accident. Classifications A, B, C and D all have upper limits. So they have given it completely back to the hands of the board of Australia Post to pay whatever they want to their CEO or managing director.


The board of Australia Post has now offered the new managing director of Australia Post a target reward of $2,337,500 and a stretch incentive of a further $412,500, making the package of $2,750,000 a year. This is half of the $5.6 million paid to Mr Fahour, but it does not reset relativities in pay at Australia Post, where seven key upper-management positions received $8,167,942 in 2016.


Despite all the government's pretence about the Remuneration Tribunal being the body to oversee and determine the quantum of the pay for the managing director of Australia Post, there is nothing to stop the pay rising back to $5.6 million or beyond in the near future. The underhanded way in which the government has gone about this whole matter simply reinforces the need for the Communications Legislation Amendment (Executive Remuneration) Bill 2017 to pass. In my bill, the right of the board of Australia Post to set remuneration will be taken out of the Australian Postal Corporation Act, and that right will by given to the Remuneration Tribunal.


The second part of my bill relates to the position of the CEO at NBN. NBN is on the government books as an asset, not a liability. It has been valued at close to $30 billion, which no-one would pay for the performance it delivers to the poor bunnies of Australia, who have been forced to take it, pay more and receive less than before. I am a member of a Senate inquiry dealing with NBN. It is heartbreaking to listen to the ordinary Australians who have made submissions to the committee. It is a disaster. Yet, despite NBN not meeting its own targets, the chief executive officer of NBN is being paid $3.6 million.


The government will not consider doing anything to reset the remuneration package at NBN because all the focus has been on Australia Post. The government is like a consumer who pays twice what they need to for designer label goods because they have no confidence in their ability to judge quality. The government needs to learn that there is not a direct correlation between how much you pay and what you get. I am determined to see excessive salaries and bonuses paid by hardworking Australian taxpayers reined in, but the government, the opposition and some crossbenchers want to fight that aim at every turn.


Australia Post and NBN are the worst cases of excess. If the Senate will not deal with the worst cases of excess, then there is no hope that a long line of other excessively paid positions will be reduced. Boards of government businesses have proven poor at negotiating remuneration packages. Just look at Australia Post and NBN. These boards do not have the skills nor the ability to stay at arm's length from what one paper describes as rolled-gold negotiators. We need the Remuneration tribunal to set the terms and conditions for all key positions in government-owned businesses. I ask senators to support this bill.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:44):  I agree with some of what Senator Hanson has just said. She makes, in my view, a very good point: that the leader of our nation, the Prime Minister, from whichever political party, is paid a fraction of what many other people are paid in this community. I always smile at the fact that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, who is in charge of financial matters in Australia, receives, I suspect—I am not quite sure what it is—around $350,000 to $400,000. But he deals with the executive heads of the major banks, who receive $17 million, $5 million, $3 million plus. When the people who have charge of monetary policy in Australia are paid a pittance compared to what the people they deal with in this country have, it just seems to be a very skewed way of remunerating people. I made the point even when Mr Wayne Swan was the Treasurer—and, heaven forbid, if you were paying him by value, you wouldn't have paid him a cent. But he was there, he was in charge of the monetary system, and it was ridiculous that even Mr Swan was paid only a pittance compared to those he was dealing with.


However, I digress a little bit. I simply wanted to say I'm glad that Senator Hanson has raised these issues. They are issues that we've tried to raise many a time. Senator Hanson, you left out of your contribution something I thought you might've raised. It's something that, for years, we tried to get a handle on, and that is: what is paid to the totally taxpayer funded ABC? I remember we had Senate committee after Senate committee, we had advice from the clerks, and we used to say to the ABC, 'What are your presenters paid?' They refused to tell us. We eventually got to a compromise where we learned that the three major presenters from the ABC got within this range, which meant that some of these people, who, in my view, are nothing more than spruikers for the ALP and the Greens political party, were getting $5 million, $6 million, $7 million in salary for a couple of hours work a week. So maybe there needs to be a bit more transparency in what the taxpayers pay to some senior ABC presenters, on-air people, who I say work a few hours a week because they only do one show a week. As a parliamentarian, I know they do a bit of preparation work. But it's interesting to think about why these presenters, a couple of whom we know have very strong Labor Party connections, are paid these enormous salaries by the taxpayer to propagate what seems to me to be Labor Party propaganda. Others will disagree with that. That's a personal view on these particular presenters. I won't mention them by name. But I think it's time for the ABC, which is totally taxpayer funded, to be brought into this scrutiny, as we politicians always are. If any of my colleagues in this chamber make an indiscretion in their financial matters, it's always the media that are first in to query it and to make it a front-page story. And yet, with the ABC, we have no idea what individuals are paid, and I think that, as a national broadcaster, paid for by the taxpayers' money, that's something parliamentarians should have more oversight of.


But I've digressed from this particular bill. While I listened intently to Senator Hanson's contribution, insofar as Australia Post is concerned, this proposed legislation is superfluous. The intent of the bill was to limit the remuneration of the managing director of Australia Post—I'll come to NBN later. But the government has acted to ensure the remuneration of the managing director of Australia Post now aligns with community expectations. For that reason I suggest to Senator Hanson, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, that the bill's not required, in order to achieve the outcome that she and her party obviously seek to achieve. You don't need to do that, because the government has already acted. In February this year, Senator Cash, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, declared that Australia Post is the employing body for the principal executive officer, the managing director, of Australia Post. This had the effect of bringing the managing director's remuneration under the oversight of the Remuneration Tribunal, and that meant that the board of Australia Post had to set the terms and conditions for the managing director consistent with the requirements of the Remuneration Tribunal. The remuneration for the incoming managing director, as all senators will know, was set under these new arrangements and is half of the remuneration of the outgoing managing director. The Remuneration Tribunal already sets the remuneration for Australia Post's chair and deputy chair and non-executive directors. The government took this decisive action to address community concerns regarding the remuneration paid to the former managing director.


These matters have been raised in any number of Senate committees over the many years that I have been here, but, as Senator Hanson rightly said, it was always difficult for Senate estimates committees to get any real information as to what the former managing director was actually paid. When it was revealed that he was on a total of $5.6 million in 2015-16, everybody appreciated that that was well out of step with community expectations—at a time, I might say, when Australia Post was losing money and the services it was providing to those who needed its services was limited.


I remember trying to do something about the mail centre in Rockhampton, to help out a couple of little people who couldn't get a night's sleep because of all this activity happening next door to their place in a residential area of Rockhampton. We interacted with Australia Post for a period of time. I must say, they treated us courteously, and they responded to everything. But we never achieved much because to remove the mail centre from a residential area and put it on an industrial estate would've cost too much money—though I suspect, in retrospect, it probably wouldn't have cost more than half the managing director's salary. So certainly what was paid to the previous managing director was out of step with the community's expectations.


The Remuneration Tribunal has looked at this matter and they have set a total remuneration reference rate for the office of managing director of $1.4 million, and they have agreed to a performance pay incentive arrangement that provides for access to up to 100 per cent of the total remuneration—that is, an additional $1.4 million. So the board can, if it so wishes, pay a total of $2.75 million, if my arithmetic is correct. That is a matter for the board. But it is overseen by the Remuneration Tribunal, which accepts that Australia Post is a big business with a lot of outlets right around Australia and that it has a lot of dealings with franchisees and a lot international dealings and so it does require the very best person to take on that role.


I know that I—and, I am sure, all other senators—get lots of complaints from licensed post office operators about the treatment they receive from Australia Post. I am currently trying to help the LPO operator in Normanton, way up in the Gulf of Carpentaria, in a dispute with Australia Post as to where the post office in this fairly remote area delivers the money it collects from all those grey nomads travelling up to Karumba near Normanton, and I am hopeful that that matter, which has gone to mediation, will be resolved so that the genuine issues which the operator had can be addressed at the very earliest time.


Whilst I understand what Senator Hanson is getting at, can I again repeat that the government has already addressed that. The Remuneration Tribunal does oversee what the board can pay the managing director of Australia Post. I know that at the time the managing director changed there were changes to the board of Australia Post. I don't know all of the board, but I do know one or two of them. Contrary to Senator Hanson's description of none of them being rolled-gold negotiators, one of the board members that I do happen to know you can class as a rolled-gold negotiator. So the board has changed. I think there is a new appreciation of what needs to be done. It's not an easy business, Australia Post, I concede. It requires good people, and you have to pay well to get good people. But I'm confident now that the board, with the oversight of the Remuneration Tribunal, has got the right balance.


In relation to NBN, you can't but have sympathy with some of the issues Senator Hanson raised today. The reason that the CEO of NBN is not subject to the Remuneration Tribunal is that the shareholder ministers of the NBN actually wrote to the Remuneration Tribunal and told them that they weren't to look at this. Those two ministers, I hasten to add, are not the current ministers. They were, of course, Mr Lindsay Tanner and former senator Stephen Conroy. In a letter dated 24 June 2009, they wrote to the President of the Remuneration Tribunal and said: 


Given that the company has been established with the view to taking on private owners within the next few years, we do not propose to have the position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company designated as a Principal Executive Officer, or to seek a Remuneration Tribunal determination in relation to the role.


I was around when this NBN was set up. There was never any way in the world—and I bet Senator Conroy, I think, a carton of Grange; I was confident in making the bet quite expensive because I knew I would never have to pay up—that in my lifetime or in Senator Conroy's lifetime would the NBN in the Conroy model ever be sold to private enterprise, because it would be a loss-making company and no profit-making private enterprise would ever consider buying something that was losing so much money. The Conroy model was such that it was impossible for NBN ever to make a profit and, therefore, ever to be in the hands of private owners.


Since the coalition has taken over, NBN will still struggle, I suspect, to make a profit, but it has a chance. I guess at some time in the long-distant future it may become a profitable company and it may then be more appropriate that a private entity run a business rather than the government trying to run a business. The days of governments and public servants trying to run a business passed in the '50s and in Russia and in Eastern Europe in the 1980s, when everyone realised—you didn't have to be an economic genius to realise—that governments and public servants shouldn't be running private businesses. But that is why that wasn't done.


I suspect another reason the Labor Party didn't want the Remuneration Tribunal anywhere near this organisation was that the early stages of the NBN under Senator Conroy turned out to be a repository for failed Labor apparatchiks to get a well-paying job. There was a former Queensland Labor member of parliament by the name of Kaiser who was thrown out of parliament for indiscretions. Would you believe it? He ended up working for NBN as a government liaison person at twice the money he would have received as a politician in the Queensland parliament. I always used to wonder why NBN, which was at that time a government-owned organisation totally under the control of Senator Conroy, needed a government liaison person. They were the government! It was the government liaising with themselves. I guess that, with some of the early payments made by NBN to middle-order officials, the last thing Senator Conroy or those in charge would have wanted was for the Remuneration Tribunal to be anywhere near it.




Senator Smith:
  Mike Kaiser.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mike Kaiser—you're quite right, Senator Smith. It is the government's view, however, that, for the moment, it remains appropriate that the NBN retain responsibility, or the board retains responsibility, for recruiting key management personnel and setting the remuneration. The NBN board itself is now made up of leaders with specific telecommunications, industry, government and wider commercial expertise. The government is, at this stage, prepared to leave the NBN board to determine the appropriate remuneration required to attract the talent needed to manage the NBN rollout. When compared to Australian businesses of similar size and to executive salaries in the communications sector—and I particularly mention the communication sector—NBN's remuneration is comparable with executive salaries in public companies.


But, again, I know that under the guidance of Senator Fifield and the government, generally, the NBN board will be aware that they should pay industry standards. If they go beyond it, as happened in the case years ago with the Australia Post board, then the government would be watching that very closely. It is the government's and the public's view that what was happening in Australia Post didn't pass the community standard that is expected. The government is very conscious of that. They changed the laws in relation to Australia Post. Whilst at the moment the government is happy to leave the qualified board at NBN to get industry-standard people there at the industry-standard price, it will be keeping a very close watching eye on that.


So the government won't be supporting the bill, because (a) part of it has already been actioned by the Turnbull government, and (b) we think that with NBN at the moment and in that particular sector of the economy, it's one that's best left to a qualified board, which NBN now has.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2017-08-17,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (17:02):  The Communications Legislation Amendment (Executive Remuneration) Bill 2017 would formally give the Remuneration Tribunal the ability to set the remunerations of the CEOs of Australia Post and NBN Co. This is in the wake of revelations that the remuneration of Australia Post's previous chief executive officer was $5.6 million last year. This has quite rightly been widely criticised and was not in line with community expectations for an entity that is ultimately supported by taxpayers. Australia Post did not report the CEO's salary and, rightly, was roundly criticised for this. Indeed, it was only after a Senate committee denied their request to keep the figure private was it actually finally revealed. The CEO affected has since stood down from his position at Australia Post.


The government then moved to designate the CEO of Australia Post as a principal executive officer and Australia Post as an employing body under the Remuneration Tribunal in response to the outcry over the former CEO's salary. The government has stated that this has had the effect of ensuring the Remuneration Tribunal has appropriate oversight of the CEO's pay. We understand that the tribunal did oversee the setting of the remuneration package for the incoming chief executive officer, who is on a considerably lower salary package.


Labor and the government undertook significant reforms to the Commonwealth's financial management arrangements. This has established a framework necessary for a modern public sector. These reforms were based on a number of key principles: that the government should operate as a coherent whole; that a common set of duty should apply to all public resources handled by Commonwealth entities; and that these should be managed prudently and efficiently. The performance of the public sector is more than financial, and engaging with risk is a necessary step in improving performance. The PGPA Act provided more flexible arrangements for entities and relied on the management of a number of subordinate rules and regulations where officials were expected to be held to a high standard of accountability. And yet we have recently seen, through the Australia Post example and other agencies, decisions not to disclose the remuneration of their senior executives.


As we have learnt now, the Abbott and Turnbull governments did not ensure that Commonwealth entities had sufficient checks and balances on executive remuneration. This led to Australia Post's not revealing the chief executive officer's $5.6 million remuneration package, which was clearly out of step with community expectations. The failure by Australia Post management and board to reveal detailed remuneration information as part of its annual report was enabled by changes to reporting rules which had been made by the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. This demonstrates very much the gaps in the Commonwealth's financial reporting framework that have opened up under this government, and this bill does not actually fix that problem.


We on this side are of the view that greater transparency and scrutiny through Senate estimates will assist to ensure boards and management are held to account for the setting of remuneration, and that it is within the community's expectations, as was shown through the Australia Post example. The Auditor-General considered that there would be benefit in making the aggregate level of transparency for key management remuneration in the public sector consistent with that required for listed entities, and the government has also requested a number of Commonwealth entities revert to the previous regime of remuneration reporting. We welcome the release of those reports under the Minister for Finance's request. However, we believe the government should act to ensure that these are formally required of all Commonwealth entities, and not just at the request of the minister. The government is yet to act on this.


When everyone else is tightening their belt and experiencing record low wage growth, the government was happy for CEOs' salaries to be hidden, as in Australia Post's example. But in comparison to the poor choice by Australia Post, NBN Co chose to disclose much more detailed information. Labor is keen to consider how to formalise the requirements for executive remuneration to enhance transparency, thereby enhancing trust from the community and hold boards and secretaries to account for their remuneration arrangements.

"Burston, Sen Brian",PHON,2017-08-17,"



Senator BURSTON
 (New South Wales) (17:07):  I rise to speak on Senator Hanson's bill, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Executive Remuneration) Bill. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 and the National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011 to remove the ability of the respective boards to set remuneration and to give that authority to Remuneration Tribunal by amending the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973.


It is my understanding that the Remuneration Tribunal already sets remuneration for most of the other government business enterprises, such as the Australian Rail Track Corporation, which is responsible for some 10,000km of interstate rail; the Australian Submarine Corporation, which is responsible for naval shipbuilding and the proposed spend of $50 billion on new submarines; Defence Housing Australia; and the Moorebank Intermodal Company, which is responsible for the major infrastructure hubs in Sydney. If the Remuneration Tribunal can handle the remuneration of the Prime Minister, members of parliament, the judiciary and others managing government businesses, then it can handle the remuneration for the most senior officers at Australia Post and NBN.


While I'm on the subject of the Remuneration Tribunal, I would like to take the opportunity to remind the Senate that in March this year only senators Bernardi, Leyonhjelm and Lambie and the One Nation senators voted to forgo pay rises set by the government until the federal government delivered a budget surplus. It seems there is not a more unifying issue in this place for senators than their own hip pocket—maybe a parliamentary dual citizenship audit is a close second, but I digress.


No-one in this place could reasonably argue that the annual remuneration of almost $6 million for the previous managing director of Australia Post, Mr Ahmed Fahour, was out of community step and expectations, especially when you compare it to the United States, where the postal service employs over 600,000 staff and delivers more than 660 million pieces of mail a day, yet its CEO gets a package worth A$1.2 million.


The flow-on effect to taxpayers of such an excessive remuneration is significant. It makes payments of between $1.3 million and $1.8 million to a number of other executives seem reasonable. That further reduces the dividend back to the taxpayer. This in turn reduces the ability of Australia Post to absorb some of the increasing costs of delivering the mail, making posting letters and other mail more expensive. It is also a slap in the face to the real workers at Australia Post: the staff, the contractors and the owners of licensed and franchised post offices, who deliver such a valuable service to our community.


On 24 February 2017, after significant pressure from One Nation and an outcry from the Australian community, the government announced that it would bring the position of Managing Director of Australia Post within the regime administered by the Remuneration Tribunal, but it said nothing about the CEO of NBN. I note that the new Managing Director of Australia Post, Ms Christine Holgate, who starts her new role in October, has had her salary set in accordance with the parameters set by the Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal and, as such, will receive a base salary of $1.379 million a year, with the potential to earn 100 per cent of that as a bonus. While I personally think that is still excessive compared to the remuneration of the US Postal Service CEO, it is still a step in the right direction.


This bill also brings the CEO of NBN Co within the framework of the Remuneration Tribunal, and I will speak on the board of the NBN Co and its payment of $3.6 million to the chief executive officer at a later date. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-08-17,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:11):  I move:


That the Senate—


(a) notes that:


(i) violent extremism in Australia is perpetrated or inspired by terrorist groups that claim to act in the name of Islam,


(ii) the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and similar groups exert influence through a violent ideology, persuasive propaganda and the grooming of young people which has produced significant numbers of radicalised Australian Muslims, and


(iii) the so-called 'lone actor terrorists' are in fact part of a wider group of radicalised communities within Australian Muslim enclaves in Australia; and


(b) calls on the Government to ban full face coverings in public places on the grounds of social cohesion, the need to identify people seeking community support and for public safety.


I rise to speak to the notice of motion standing in my name, which concerns some of the matters I raised in my proposed amendment to the Criminal Code Amendment (Prohibition of Full Face Coverings in Public Places) Bill 2017. I call on the government to ban full-face coverings in public places. The central issue in this motion before the Senate is the right of others to see a face. No-one should be permitted to hide behind a veil of secrecy while there is a security concern. No-one should be able to receive taxpayer funded support when their identity cannot be confirmed with facial recognition.


Our law recognises some cases where the right to see an individual's face is more important than the right of another to keep their face hidden. These situations include when a person is committing an unlawful act or giving evidence to a court. In the UK, they are now debating whether a patient in a public hospital has the right to see the face of a treating nurse or doctor. In Canada, they have decided that a woman in a burqa can take the oath of citizenship.


In June this year, men disguised in burqas entered the Iranian parliament building and detonated a number of suicide devices, killing 12 people and wounding 35 others. This is not the first case of this kind, and it will not be the last. These terrorists had no fear of an earthly law. They considered themselves martyrs and bound for heaven, taking as many lives as they could.


Our laws are outdated, and we need new ones like a ban on full-face coverings. While it is an offence in most states of Australia to be disguised with unlawful intent, it is self-evident that two years in jail is not a deterrent for a suicide bomber. We need laws to stop terrorism before it happens, and the ability of others to see a face is an important part of assessing risk. As you wander down the corridors of many major airports, you will see security cameras. These cameras relay information to security experts, who need facial recognition to identify terrorists and criminals. Full-face coverings like a niqab or a burqa take away a valuable source of information from counterterrorism experts. Full-face coverings deny us all the right to be as safe as we can be in public places.


The No. 1 job of any government is to keep its citizens safe, and that is why a number of Islamic countries, including Malaysia, Turkey, Tunisia, Egypt and the Congo have banned full-face coverings. If the burqa was a religious requirement then it would not have been banned in public places in Islamic countries. The fact is, wearing a burqa is not a religious requirement.


Non-Islamic countries like Switzerland, Norway, Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, China and Russia have also banned full-face coverings. Again, lawmakers believe a ban improves public safety and enables social cohesion.


Australians don't like double standards. How can you justify banning the wearing of a helmet or a balaclava but not a burqa when entering a bank?


Australia is a Christian country built on Judaeo-Christian values, but many Muslims see Christians as a threat to Islam because it celebrates a falsehood, and so we are progressively seeing the celebration of Christmas in public spaces withdrawn. It is a case of a small minority telling the majority how to live. Development applications for halal housing estates have been rejected to date, but it is only a matter of time before Muslims will have the numbers to get these estates approved.


There is no place in Australia for migrants who want to come here and change the foundation stones of our way of life. My message to those who want to live under sharia law is: migrate to an Islamic country, but don't come here to Australia.


In 2014, Roy Morgan asked Australians whether or not the burqa should be banned in public places. Seventy per cent of Liberal voters wanted the burqa banned and 44 per cent of Labor voters agreed. Overall, 55 per cent of those questioned wanted the burqa banned, but still there is no support for the proposal in this parliament. Labor and Liberal senators fear losing the Muslim vote, and this was never more evident than today with their reaction to my wearing the burqa. They berated me. But let me remind you again: two men in burqas entered the Iranian parliament, detonated a bomb and killed 12 people.


On my way to this chamber today wearing the full burqa, Senator Whish-Wilson extended his hand to me, not knowing who I was, and shook my hand. He has never done that to me in all my time in this place. It was actually just symbolism—wanting to shake my hand. I've never seen him do that. He has not only not shaken my hand in the past, but he has not shaken the hand of any other woman just walking the corridors. It was the burqa that drew him. Was it tokenism? I don't know.


And Senator Cameron was visibly overcome after my senator's statement last week. Well—through you, Chair—Senator Cameron needs to do much better than call me a racist. What you need to do, Senator Cameron, is to prove me wrong with facts from reliable sources.


I will say it again: Muslims determine the electoral outcomes in up to 15 lower house seats. The Muslim vote will continue to increase in importance because of the high birth rates in Australian Muslim communities. The number of Muslims in Australia doubled in the decade from 2006 to 2016 through immigration and the high numbers of children born to Muslim families. If we do not draw a line in the sand against immigration from Islamic countries, the influence of Muslims in this country will continue to grow and Australia will continue down the path of Islamisation. We need to learn from other countries. We need to ban further Islamic immigration for at least five years, so that we can have the debate on the impact of Islam on our country before it is too late. It has been reported that fears over terrorism have caused Sydney to fall from the top 10 in key listings of the world's most liveable cities published by The Economist Group's Intelligence Unit.


Lebanon was once a safe place for Christians in the Middle East, but that was long ago. Today the majority of Christians live to the north of Beirut and the Muslims to the south and east, and towards the northern borders. No-one knows how many Muslims and Christians there are in Lebanon, because the last census was conducted in 1932. Since that time it has been considered too sensitive to know the actual numbers of Muslims and Christians. What we do know is that in 1932, the Christians outnumbered the Muslims, and now Muslims outnumber Christians. Christians in Lebanon are threatened from Sunni and Shiite radical Islam. Christians are in real danger and could face the same fate as other minorities in the Middle East who have needed to leave to survive. Many have found their way here to Australia, for a peaceful life in a country where they feel safe. It is a disgrace that the Labor Party has been silent on the plight of Christians in Lebanon but outspoken in its support for a Palestinian state run by Muslim terrorists.


Australians expect everyone who migrates here to be an active citizen and to work to make Australia a better place. Many Muslims want to adopt our values and way of life, but to gain my trust they need to call out radical Muslims with extreme views. If they are not willing to work to keep their fellow Australians safe then, in my view, they should leave and go to live in an Islamic country.


I want to return to the need for a general ban on the Islamic veil and the burqa in public places. Has anyone ever considered the plight of women forced to wear the burqa and who cannot speak up? That is the issue here. I'm sure there are a lot of women who wish to get rid of the wearing of the burqa, but it's forced on them by their husbands, by their fathers and by men within their family. Many migrants have come here to avoid living under Islam and are deeply worried by the Islamisation of Australia and the failure of parliamentarians to take action. I turn to the fact that I got in a taxi and the Muslim driver recognised me. He said, 'I actually was born a Muslim. I left the faith at 14.' He said, 'I am happy here in Australia. This is my home. But because I have left the Muslim faith my uncle has told my father now he must murder me.' He said, 'You are right in what you are doing. We have to stamp out the extremism in this country, and we must live by Australian values, ways and culture in this country.'


Another big issue is genital mutilation. Cutting is illegal in Australia, but still the practice continues, and at least 60 children have ended up at Westmead Children's Hospital as a result of savage injuries in the name of Islam. The meaning of the Islamic veil, niqab or burqa has varied over time. But what has never changed is the way that the wearer is separated from everyone else. This separation is a barrier to the formation of the relationships that are necessary to integrate into the Australian way of life.


More and more taxpayer money is being spent to keep us safe from homegrown Islamic terrorism. We pay for security at airports, hospitals and in public buildings, and we put the lives of police and others in danger because of thousands of radicalised Australian Muslims. I don't know the cost of keeping Australia safe from extreme and violent Muslims, and invite the government to publish those figures annually. The threat from radicalised Australian Muslims was recognised in a recent decision by the New South Wales Land and Environment Court, when the court agreed with a submission made by Waverley Council that the building of a new synagogue could attract the attention of Muslim terrorists. The Jewish people are no threat to religious freedom in this country, nor to any other freedom, and there have been no plots by Australian Jews to take the rights of others away. But they have paid the price for radicalised Australian Muslims.


Any further outdated immigration policies which support Islamic migration can only drive up the cost of providing safety against Muslims; money that could otherwise have been spent building schools and hospitals. Banning full face coverings in public places is a low-cost safety measure for the taxpayer and it is one step that should be taken, because that is what the majority of Australians want.


The case for a general ban on full-face coverings in all public places rests on the need for social cohesion and for the ability to identify and confirm eligibility in a variety of situations and for public safety. Social cohesion rests very largely on the relationships we form as we go about our daily lives. These relationships are built slowly over time, one by one, and these relationships act like the glue that keeps society peacefully together. We have migrants from over 250 countries in Australia, and we value those relationships. Sydney is the largest immigrant city in the world, with some 60 per cent of people born overseas, whilst 75 per cent of Australians claim a heritage other than Australian, but still we cannot take social cohesion for granted. Our social cohesion is founded on seeing one another's face; on a common language, English; and on a willingness to integrate into an Australian way of life.


Australia is a true democracy based on gender equality and freedom of expression, and where everyone is equal under the law. Most Australians like it that way, but not radical Muslims. Radical Muslims want sharia law, where women are not treated equally to men and homosexuals are not tolerated. The Muslim world has yet to learn that secularism avoids religious conflict. When you look at the Middle East, you can see the conflict created by Islam.


In Australia, the ability to see a face is essential to communication and the formation of relationships on which our society is founded. Non-verbal communication is essential to understand the content of verbal communication.


Section 116 of the Australian Constitution prohibits the Commonwealth from making any laws which prohibit the free exercise of any religion, but the courts have made it clear there are limits to that freedom when conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of civil government. Let me say it again: wearing a niqab or a burqa is not a religious requirement. Courts around the world have decided that an individual's right to wear religious face coverings in public is secondary to the rights and freedoms of others.


The New Zealand District Court held that two women from Afghanistan would have to remove their full face veils to give evidence. It was argued that the barrister needed to see their faces to be able to understand their evidence. The court found it was not necessary to decide whether a full-face covering was or was not a religious requirement, because in all cases the human right to freedom of religion was secondary to the human right to justice.


In late 2016, Judge Balla in the Sydney district court was faced with a similar problem. She decided not to hear evidence from Moutia Elzahed, the second wife of Islamic recruiter Hamdi Alqudsi, because she would not reveal her face. Hamdi Alqudsi's other wife, Carnita Matthews, was imprisoned for falsely accusing a police officer of trying to remove her veil, but—bad luck for her—the incident was caught on a car camera, and the footage showed she had lied. It also showed she could not be properly identified behind the veil, and the conviction was overturned on appeal. Is this parliament willing to do anything at all to support the police and the courts to work smoothly, or are senators satisfied to do nothing and let three per cent of Australians decide whether or not someone wearing a full face covering can waste taxpayers' money and precious police and court resources?


The argument about full-face coverings and human rights has been lost. The European Court of Human Rights in 2014 held 15 to two that a ban on full-face coverings did not violate human rights. This is a problem with full-face coverings, whether they are Islamic veils or burqas, a mask or any other covering, like bandages. Full, face coverings isolate people on both sides of the covering, denying important non-verbal information to set the context of verbal communication. We have immigrants from over 250 countries, many of them from non-English-speaking backgrounds. How do we expect people to integrate into the Australian way of life when faces are covered?


It is clear that Muslims, particularly those with extremist views, have chosen to live separately from other Australians in a way no other religious group has done in Australia. The 2016 census shows us that no other religious group is so strongly concentrated and so alienated from other Australians.


In closing, I want to say that everyone has the right to their own religious beliefs, but it is only Islam that threatens our way of life. The members in this parliament agreed to spend $16 million to upgrade security here because of a threat from radical Islam. Why don't senators show some leadership and ban the burqa in public places? It is outrageous that we allow hate preachers to be here, but women like Ayaan Hirsi Ali are unsafe in our country.


This needs to be debated, and I'm pleased that it is on the floor of the chamber today, so we can hear other people talk on this matter, because Australians want this debated. Australians want to hear what our members and the leaders of this nation have to say about banning the burqa. As I said in my statement, a large percentage of Australians, over 70 per cent, believe that banning the burqa is necessary and important. They are confronted by it. Two of our former prime ministers, Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott, have also indicated they found it confronting. Standing in this chamber today with the burqa on, even Senator Hinch wanted to see my face. Every Australian will want to see a face. It may be that, in coming into this chamber with a burqa on, what I did was radical. Yes, it was. But it was a case of saying I do not believe that at any point in time in the future any full-face covering should ever be worn in this place.


Every Australian who watches or hears this has the right to see the face of everyone in this chamber to ensure that it is the right person. And I will say again: when I walked from my office down to this chamber, I was not challenged once by any security guard to check to see that it was me under that veil. We have a real problem. My coming here today wearing the burqa was also to prove the point that we in this chamber have to ensure that the person taking their place in the chamber has the right to be here. We have to ensure full safety. I go back to this: the Iranian parliament building was bombed. Do not always consider that this is the safest place. It is not. We have a better chance here than many people out on the streets of this nation.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (17:32):  Firstly, I want to congratulate Senator Brandis for the response that he gave to what was an outrageous stunt by Senator Hanson and One Nation. It wasn't just Senator Hanson; it was all of One Nation who engaged in that stunt. I thought the response from Senator Brandis was excellent—and I don't think I've ever congratulated Senator Brandis on anything since I've been in this place.


I just want to go to some of the issues that have been raised by Senator Hanson in the contribution that she has just made—a contribution underpinned by racism; a contribution underpinned by religious intolerance; a contribution, from my point of view, underpinned by just plain stupidity. This is not good for our nation. This is not good for Australia. Why would anyone have to gain the trust of Senator Pauline Hanson? I say to all the Muslims out there: you don't need to gain the trust of Senator Pauline Hanson, because the bulk of Australians trust you. They trust you to make good, effective contributions to this country. You don't need to prove anything to One Nation or to Senator Pauline Hanson.


I oppose this motion from One Nation. I'm not religious. I think most people know I'm not religious; I'm an atheist. But I do respect the Constitution, which says people should have the right to practise their religion, so I just find it absolutely mind-boggling that, for the second time this week, we have a contribution so terrible for multiculturalism in this country and so bad for a decent society in this country. It is a contribution that is about breaking apart a cohesive society and a country that is renowned around the world for its capacity to welcome people here and have them integrate effectively in a good society.


I am a migrant, as most people would be aware. I came here in 1973. I came here along with my wife, Elaine, and my then only daughter, Lynn. We came here because we wanted to get away from religious intolerance. I was brought up a Presbyterian, and my wife was brought up a Catholic in the west of Scotland. In those days it was not considered by many to be a good thing that we married. You cannot have a cohesive society when religious intolerance is practised the way that Senator Pauline Hanson and One Nation are practising and promoting religious intolerance. It didn't do the west of Scotland any good having that intolerance. Some of it is still there, but, thankfully, people are moving away from that sort of nonsense. There are lessons for us all when we look at religious intolerance around the world.


I think Senator Hanson is in here pushing this agenda for pure political purposes. She has a small base and she's playing up to that base. Of stunts like today I want to say to any Muslims that are listening in and to all Australians that may be listening in that this Senate condemns that approach. That was overwhelming in the response led by Senator Brandis and supported by Senator Wong. Every other party and politician in this place was appalled at that stunt that was pulled today.


Talking about the influence of Muslims: I just looked up some of the young Muslim high achievers. They're going to make huge contributions to this country. Every country wants high achievers so they can have growth in the economy, a good society and jobs for people. If you look at these young high achievers—and I've just picked one area from across Australia—of the Australian International Academy, a Melbourne senior campus, the dux of the school is Mohammed Habbal with a score of 97.6. What does Mohammed want to do? He wants to go to Monash University and study biomedical science. If that's not a contribution to Australia, I don't know what is. Asmaa Barakat, a young Muslim woman, wants to go to the University of Melbourne to study science. That, not the vile racism and nonsense we hear from Senator Hanson, is what contributes to this country.


Hussein Kaddour, with 94.6, wants to go to the University of Melbourne and study science. Other young people want to do biomedical science, engineering honours, applied science and psychology. I'll tell you what: I welcome this contribution from young Muslims in this country. They are the future of this country as much as the future of this country depends on any religion or any individual. Muslims make their contribution. It's a welcomed contribution. It is a significant contribution. And to come here and run a stunt like we've just seen belittles this place. I am so proud that Senator Brandis and the rest of the Senate just said, 'We are not tolerating this.'


I want to go back to former senator Ron Boswell. Former Senator Boswell always maintained strong views about One Nation. I disagreed with former Senator Boswell on many, many issues, but he has written a recent opinion piece entitled 'Why Pauline Hanson's One Nation is catastrophic for the bush'. In it, he said:


It was the Aboriginals. Then the Asians. Then the Muslims. The story is always the same, it's just the characters that change based on who's most unpopular at the time. It's good for winning a few votes but it's a disaster for Australia and its relationships with its trading partners.


Ron Boswell was being pragmatic about this. Ron Boswell was clearly understanding the threat that One Nation posed to this nation, not the other way around. One Nation, according to former Senator Boswell, is the threat to the nation, not the Muslims who are in here becoming the scientists, the doctors, the GPs and the engineers of the future. It's not them; it's One Nation and the bitterness and political opportunism we see from them.


I know Senator Sinodinos is well respected, but he said that One Nation had evolved in the 16 years since his former boss John Howard decreed that the Liberal Party would always put One Nation last on their how-to-vote card. He said:


The One Nation of today is a very different beast to what it was 20 years ago—they are a lot more sophisticated, they have clearly resonated with a lot of people.


Our job is to treat them as any other party. That doesn't mean we have to agree with their policies.


Senator Sinodinos, I said it to you today and I will say it again: if this is the evolution of One Nation, God help us—and I'm an atheist! I tell you, this is not a party that is evolving. I don't think it is a different beast. I think it's the same beast. It's a beast that's out there trying to create division in this community, and I just don't accept his proposition. Senator Sinodinos was sitting here when we saw that stunt today. If that's more sophistication from One Nation, we don't want more sophistication like that. One Nation are anything but a sophisticated political party.


This argument that we are being 'swamped by Muslims' is just another racist rant from this so-called political party. Last week, Senator Hanson ran the rant that the Muslims were a drain on the public purse. I've got to tell you, these high-achieving young Muslims that want to be the doctors of the future, the engineers of the future and the scientists of the future are not a drain on the public purse. The Muslim families that I know are families that have got the same aspirations and the same goals I have, and that is to have their family with a roof over their head, to have a job in the future, to be able to put food on the table and to make a contribution to our society. Those are the Muslims I know. I just don't understand why any political party would come here and try to divide our nation the way that Senator Hanson does now on a regular basis in this place.


She argued we were in danger of being swamped. Then she was on Facebook holding up a poster saying, 'Pray for a Muslim ban.' The election platform from One Nation includes ceasing Muslim migration and holding a royal commission on Islam. What is wrong with these people? What's wrong with them? The election platform also includes installing surveillance cameras in mosques, banning the burqa and the niqab and prohibiting members of parliament being sworn in under the Koran. This is racist, this is religious intolerance and this is manifest stupidity from Senator Hanson and One Nation. 


Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts share the stage with groups like Reclaim Australia and the Love Australia or Leave Party. The Love Australia or Leave Party's platform includes the right to bear arms, national profiling of 10- to 14-year-olds, mandatory singing of the national anthem in all schools, a ban on Muslim migration and Muslims in the Australian military and a mandatory reporting obligation for all Australians who form a reasonable suspicion of unacceptable risk about another person. Does that remind you of something? Doesn't that remind you of what happened in Nazi Germany? It certainly reminds me of the history of Nazi Germany. These are the people that One Nation are sharing platforms with, spewing their bile and racial intolerance day after day.


They also share the platform with the United Patriots Front. Their leader, Shermon Burgess, who organised the Reclaim Australia rallies that Pauline Hanson spoke at, said:


I recruited a lot of patriots who come from backgrounds as body builders, ex-martial arts, one of our guys is an ex-cage fighter and we said we are going to get them on the front line.


Does that remind you of something that happened in the United States last week? It does me. And that is not acceptable in this country. We cannot accept this white nationalism, this racism and these attacks on our fellow Australians, because Muslims are our fellow Australians. That's what they are. They are not Muslims on their own and Catholics are not Catholics on their own. They are our fellow Australians. It doesn't matter if you are Hindu; you are a fellow Australian. 


Everyone that I know and speak to has the same views: they want their kids to be brought up in a secure, decent society. If I was a young Muslim listening to Senator Hanson, the United Patriots Front and these other racist groups, I would be concerned; I would not feel secure. This is not the Australia that I migrated to in 1973, wanting a better life for my kids and grandkids. I don't want them to be worrying about some race riots or white Nazi supporters out there attacking young Muslims because of religion. I don't want that to happen. Banning the burqa and running the rubbish that we've heard today are absolutely the antithesis of what sensible Australians want. They don't want that. We don't want to be turned into the worst aspects of the US or some of the countries in Europe that are running white-racist arguments. We don't want to go down that path. We want to give to young Muslim Australians who are here excelling at school job opportunities for the future and a life for the future so that they can bring their kids to Australia and get ahead in this country. They are part of our community.


We are a multicultural migrant nation. We have welcomed people from all over the world. Muslims have been an important part of our migrant history. Muslim people are our neighbours, our friends and our colleagues. They are valued and they are great contributors to our society in all walks of life. It is in our culture, our tradition and our democratic political system that minorities are protected and not vilified. We are a secular nation with religious freedom and tolerance. Bigotry should be reviled, called out and named for what it is, whenever and wherever it is seen. Australia is better than One Nation.


This will probably be seen around the world. I want to say to anyone who sees this anywhere that that is not Australia. What we saw today in question time is not Australia. Australia is a great country. Australia is a multicultural country. Australia is a country that welcomes different religions and different ethnic groups to our country. They even accepted me!




Senator Williams:
  Not yet, Dougie!




Senator CAMERON:
  Oh, yeah, not yet! We have so many challenges in this country, and the challenges are made harder, tougher and worse because of the racism and religious intolerance that underpins One Nation. They are an absolute disgrace.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (17:52):  I don't want to give this too much oxygen, so I will keep it quick. If Senator Hanson wanted to prove that it is possible for dangerous extremists to get into the Senate chamber, she proved it alright. She proved that Australians have something to fear, and it is her! With her stunt, Senator Hanson wanted to prove the need for a ban on full-face coverings. She could have made the same point by wearing a balaclava, but she didn't, and she didn't for a reason.


This week, the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee issued 24 unanimous recommendations to end the silent epidemic of veterans' suicide. We should be really proud of ourselves for that. All sides came together in a rare moment to make people's lives better. But what was needed next was unity, and what we saw today was an effort to divide all of us. I didn't want to talk about Senator Hanson today, but here we are. What she has done has diminished this place, and it has diminished us all. She is an absolute embarrassment. But what is even worse is that because of her actions she is dividing a nation. She is not One Nation; she is Divided Nation.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-08-17,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (17:53):  Today we saw the true face of Pauline Hanson's One Nation. It wasn't actually concealed behind a burqa. It was in the twisted smiles of Senator Burston and Senator Roberts sitting behind their leader, grinning and laughing as she mocked and demeaned an entire religion. This is mere days after the Charlottesville attacks in the United States, which showed how easily hateful words can become hateful deeds. And that's the warning for this country: how quickly things can change, and how quickly words that demean can become deeds that harm and kill. It showed what happens when violent extremists are encouraged or even appeased by chickenhawk politicians—and there's a few of those in this place—and their fellow travellers in the media.


Last month the Islamophobia in Australia report revealed some of the appalling attacks that Senator Hanson and her colleagues today endorsed and encouraged, and it showed that women, especially women wearing Islamic head coverings, have been the main targets of these attacks. I want to quote a couple of incidents from that report, Islamophobia in Australia, which give a picture of some of the things that are going on in this country. One woman said this: 'I'm not sure if they started to follow me on foot, but once I entered the medical centre I didn't hear or see anything else from them. I am 19 weeks pregnant and have never felt so afraid and so vulnerable in my life. I thought they were going to physically try harming my daughter and me. There were lots of passers-by who did not come to my aid.' And another woman said this: 'I was walking with my head down and a group of young males yelled out, ""ISIS bitch! Go back to where you came from!"" and snickered and said, ""Shoosh, or she will behead you,"" and they followed me down the street, and none of the train staff helped me out or stopped them.'


To the vast majority of Australians, these are disgusting attacks. But to Senator Hanson and her colleagues, these are laughing matters. They claim to be representing the Australian people, but they are doing no such thing, because we are a fair country, a decent country, a welcoming country, a country that respects and celebrates diversity, and a country in fact that has been built on the rich, multicultural fabric that exists in our country to this day.


As elected MPs, we have a responsibility to confront these slurs and these attacks on freedom of religion whenever they occur, and I want to echo and commend the comments of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Brandis, and the many others from the Labor Party, from the crossbench and from the Australian Greens who have condemned these disgraceful attacks on over half a million Muslim Australians. It was a fantastic moment in this Senate this afternoon when Labor, Green and crossbench senators stood and applauded Senator Brandis's remarks. It is notable that many of his Liberal colleagues did not. Senator Brandis showed the kind of leadership that has been sorely lacking in government in Australia today.


So let us today, please, finally draw the line. Let those of us who believe in freedom of religion, who believe in multiculturalism, who believe in the right of women to choose what they want to wear, stand up today and represent the vast majority of Australians who are sick to their guts with what they saw from Pauline Hanson's One Nation today. And we'll stand with these men and these women, these Australians who believe in decency and want to see everyone in this country have a chance to live their own lives and to make their own choices, without being so disgustingly disrespected as we saw from One Nation in this place today. And let's demand that all of us in this place stop comforting and appeasing the extremists in our own ranks and particularly those in Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, because it's only through confronting hatred, naming it and calling it out, wherever we see it and wherever we hear it, that we can hope to defeat it.

 (South Australia) (18:01):  I would like to put on the record that this is an extremely complex area of public policy. The chair of the committee, the Hon. Kevin Andrews; other members of the committee; and I ,as deputy chair, are extremely effective in a bipartisan way. What we've been able to do in our examination of the implementation of the national disability scheme is take quite specific segments, in this case the area of people with psychosocial disabilities, and produce an interim report about how the implementation of the scheme is going in that particular area. There will also be an interim report on the area of deafness.


What we're finding is that it is extremely complex public policy. There is a vital sector which is advocating for their representative groups, their constituents, so to speak. We're able to take their evidence in public hearing, reduce it to recommendations and, hopefully, allow the full implementation of the scheme across the whole gamut of Australians with disability, with the view that they'll be able to enjoy a more productive, a more compassionate spend, if you like, on their particular plans—and have more control over that spend.


I would like to conclude by saying that we have a silo-type approach in respect to each area that is coming up with particular concerns.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (18:45):  Woe betide anyone who tries to mess with Western Australia. Tonight I rise to address an outrage perpetrated on Western Australia's large and vibrant sporting community—one we are all taking very, very personally—and that is the Australian Rugby Union's disgraceful decision to cut the Western Force from the national competition. I stand 100 per cent with the Western Australian sporting community, with my WA Liberal colleague senators and members, with the state government, with the state opposition and with Rugby WA on this issue. I don't think the ARU has the foggiest idea of what they have unleashed on themselves. Talk about an own goal! If the ARU thought WA would just cower and lie back in the face of this outrage and would not fight back, the ARU is sadly mistaken.


The Western Force is one of Australia's most popular Rugby Union teams, and they have been extraordinarily successful in growing Rugby and developing local players in WA since their foundation in 2005. In the current season, the team were the second-best team in Australia in the Super Rugby competition. Currently they have the third-largest playing base in Australia, and they have no less than six players in the 2017 Bledisloe Cup Wallabies squad—a testament to the strength of the club and the sporting capability and pride resident in Western Australia.


Transparency in public life is just as important in publicly funded sporting organisations as it is here in this chamber. After very carefully reviewing the case made by Rugby WA and the Western Force, I am at a complete loss to understand the ARU's decision. And I completely understand why tens of thousands of supporters are absolutely gutted by this inexplicable decision.


Therefore, I call on the ARU to do two things. Firstly, I call on the ARU to publicly release the information the board have used to justify the decision to cut the Western Force—particularly what they called the 'big spreadsheet' that they claimed demonstrates the decision was in the best interests of Australian rugby. A big, secret spreadsheet—it reminds me a lot of Ros Kelly's great big thumping whiteboard, for those of you in this chamber and elsewhere old enough to remember her whiteboard. Secondly, I also call on the ARU to enter into an open dialogue with Rugby WA and all other interested parties who can propose alternative solutions to the crisis that apparently has resulted in this secret decision.


Today I've also written to the federal Minister for Sport, the Hon. Greg Hunt MP, requesting Commonwealth support to encourage the ARU to publicly release the information on this decision and have the courtesy to open a dialogue with Rugby WA. I've also requested Commonwealth support in making public the basis for this decision by the ARU and ensuring the Western Force have the opportunity to address any issues which have led to this decision. I say this to the ARU: if you have nothing to hide, release the documents, make it public, work with Rugby WA, and support Western Australian sporting fans. If you've got nothing to hide, release the documents and do not hide behind your lawyers.
