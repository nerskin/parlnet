Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (12:33):  by leave—I am pleased to present the government's second ministerial statement on the Centenary of Anzac. The government committed to delivering regular and informative updates to the Australian people about the progress of centenary preparations. Today's statement, coming at the beginning of the parliamentary sitting year, will further update Australians about the progress of the ballot for the 2015 Gallipoli dawn service and further commemorative events across the centenary period. 


Since coming to office, the government has set about taking the hands-on approach necessary to ensure that the centenary commemorations are the success they must be. This has included addressing funding shortfalls for the National Anzac Centre in Albany, of which the Commonwealth has provided a further $1.35 million, on a 75:25 funding split arrangement with the Western Australian government.


The Commonwealth is confident that the Western Australian government, together with the Albany City Council, will deliver the Anzac Interpretive Centre on time to mark the 100th anniversary, on 1 November, of the departure of the convoy of ships which carried Australian and New Zealand troops to the Middle East in 1914. The government has also increased funding for local community based commemorations, lifting grants under the Anzac Centenary Local Grants program to $125,000 per federal electorate.


In this ministerial statement I will outline the government's agenda in the lead up to centenary of, arguably, one of the most defining moments in our nation's story—the landing of Australian and New Zealand troops, the Anzacs, at Gallipoli.


Last Friday, I had the opportunity to meet with my New Zealand counterpart, the Hon. Michael Woodhouse MP, to discuss preparations for the Centenary of Anzac. Our discussion reinforced the importance of our two nations' working together with a common purpose to deliver commemoration of events of fundamental importance to each nation's story. Minister Woodhouse assured me of the New Zealand government's ongoing desire to see the centenary marked in a solemn and dignified manner. New Zealand will be an active participant in Australia's major commemorative events in 2014, particularly the Albany convoy commemorative event on 31 October and 1 November this year.


I now turn to the 2015 ballot. The ballot for the 2015 Anzac Day dawn service at Gallipoli is now closed, with more than 50,000 applications being lodged by Australians and New Zealanders. The government, working with Ticketek, is aiming to advise applicants in the ballot on or around 31 March this year of the outcome. The strong response from first-generation sons and daughters of Gallipoli veterans will result in the ballot for the direct-descendant category considering only these applicants in the first cascade. All other direct descendants who registered will be considered in the veteran category, if they are also veterans, or otherwise in the general public category. 


Anzac Day 2015 will not be confined to the Gallipoli peninsula. Events will take place not just in Australia, but across the world. Those who do not receive a ticket through the ballot may wish to explore other options for commemoration of Anzac Day in 2015. In addition to commemorative ceremonies which will take place in towns and cities right across Australia, major commemorative events will occur in the state capitals and in Canberra at the Australian War Memorial. With Anzac Day falling on a Saturday in 2015 this may present families unable to travel overseas with an opportunity to visit places in Australia normally out of reach. 


On an international level, the Australian government will also be organising an Anzac Day dawn service at the Australian National Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux, in France. There are annual Anzac Day services held in London, in Belgium, in Papua New Guinea and throughout South-East Asia. Services will also be taking place in New Zealand.


To ensure the safety of the Anzac commemorative site, and the dignity and solemnity of the Anzac Day dawn service and other commemorative events, it is anticipated that restrictions on travel to and from the Gallipoli peninsula may be in place on and around Anzac Day 2015. For those Australians without tickets to the dawn service on 25 April 2015, the Australian government strongly recommends against travel to the Gallipoli peninsula around this time. Access will be carefully and strictly managed. As noted in my earlier statement, Australians are encouraged to consider visiting the Gallipoli peninsula at times other than Anzac Day.




Anzac Centenary Public Fund



On 12 December last year, I was honoured to join with the Prime Minister and Mr Lindsay Fox AC to officially launch the Anzac Centenary Public Fund. I acknowledge again the tremendous work of Lindsay Fox. Mr Fox has given a great deal of his personal time and energy to work with corporate Australia to encourage them to give generously to the fund. The Australian government is grateful to Mr Fox for his efforts and thanks him most sincerely for his ongoing generosity.


The government's first fundraising priority is the Centenary of Anzac national travelling exhibition. The travelling exhibition will enable Australians, particularly those living outside the capital cities, to share in the Centenary of Anzac and to learn about the Australian experience of the First World War and our century of service since. Earlier this week, the Australian War Memorial, who are managing the exhibition on behalf of the government, signed a contract with Imagination Australia Pty Ltd to develop the creative content for the exhibition. The Centenary of Anzac exhibition proposal is an exciting one and I will be working closely with the Australian War Memorial and Imagination Australia Pty Ltd to ensure the exhibition accurately tells the story of Australia and Australians during the First World War.


If I can deviate briefly: on behalf, I am sure, of senators and members in the other place, I thank the chairman of the Australian War Memorial and the Director, Dr Brendan Nelson, for the last post service that so many of us attended last night. I know we were all very grateful for the opportunity to do so. I know that the director and the chairman were absolutely thrilled that so many of our colleagues took the opportunity to go to that event.


In addition to the travelling exhibition, and based on promises already made, the government expects that funds will be available to assist state and territory governments to develop their own commemorative infrastructure. To aid this, the government encourages corporate Australia to dig deeply and give generously to the Anzac Centenary Public Fund. In the tabled statement I have made reference to those companies who have generously supported the fund to date. Through their generosity more Australians will be able to share in the Centenary of Anzac.




Centenary of Anzac merchandise



As minister, I have a responsibility to ensure that use of the word 'Anzac' is dignified and in line with rules established under legislation. I can assure all Australians that I am using this responsibility diligently and that I will approve merchandise for sale only where it is appropriate and dignified. I can report to honourable senators that there have been a number of occasions in the last two months where I have refused to give recognition because I was very strongly of the view that the test of being appropriate and dignified was not met.




2015 and beyond



The Australian government is determined to ensure that the sacrifice of all 61,512 Australians who made the supreme sacrifice in the First World War, and whose names are recorded on the roll of honour at the Australian War Memorial, is appropriately honoured and recognised during the Centenary of Anzac period. Later this year we will remember Australia's first battle of the First World War, at Rabaul in New Britain in September 1914, and our first battle casualties of the war.


The Centenary of Anzac goes beyond just the events which took place at Gallipoli. As is recorded in the history books, following the withdrawal of Australian and New Zealand forces from the Gallipoli campaign in December 1915 Australian forces then went on to fight on the Western Front in France, where more than 46,000 Australians were killed in action and another 130,000 were wounded.


From 2016 onwards, Australia will ensure that the efforts of our men and women on the front line in France, Belgium and the Middle East are appropriately honoured. In France, in 2016, commemorative services will be held to mark two of the most significant battles of 1916—the battle of Fromelles, on 19 July, and the battle of Pozieres, on 23 July.


In September 2017, a service at the Buttes New British Cemetery in Belgium will commemorate the service and sacrifice of Australians who served in the battle of Polygon Wood, a campaign during the third battle of Ypres. The service will commemorate all who served in Belgium during this period. Also in 2017, and together with New Zealand, we will commemorate the Australian Light Horse and the desert campaign with a commemorative service planned for Beersheba in Israel.


The year 2018 will see services conducted to commemorate the extraordinary service of Australians on the Western Front in 1918. These services will focus on Villers-Bretonneux, the site of the Australian National Memorial in France. The Australian attack at Villers-Bretonneux, which took place on 24 and 25 April 1918, played a vital role in preventing a German breakthrough at a critical time in the war. Later, on 4 July 1918, at nearby Le Hamel, Australians led by General Sir John Monash would secure a stunning model victory which would become a much studied template for further Allied success. Both of these events are proposed to be marked in 2018, along with a suitable day of commemoration on 11 November—the 100th anniversary of the armistice which was to be the end of 'the war to end all wars'.


Over coming years, the Australian government will continue to provide all Australians with advice about official commemorative events to mark the Centenary of Anzac and the First World War, both at home and overseas. We will also ensure that commemorative events are held to mark significant anniversaries of the Second World War, such as D-day, VE Day and VP Day, along with events to remember the 65th anniversary of the Korean War and the 50th anniversary of battles during the Vietnam War.




Conclusion



In conclusion, the Australian government is committed to ensuring that the Centenary of Anzac leaves a lasting legacy for all Australians. We will honour the extraordinary deeds of ordinary men and women: men and women who did not go to battle to seek glory but who, by their deeds and actions, achieved greatness.


It will be a legacy not just of bricks and mortar but, and perhaps more importantly, a legacy of understanding. It will be an understanding of what we fought for, where we fought and why we fought. It will be an acknowledgment of our defeats and an awareness of our stirring victories and decisive achievements on the field of battle, on the seas and in the sky.


Equally and importantly, it is an opportunity to reflect on the horror, tragedy and waste of war. As a nation, we have a responsibility to ensure that the service and sacrifice of past generations is never forgotten. The Centenary of Anzac is not a period to glorify war but to reflect on its horror. We will remember those who made the supreme sacrifice in defence of our beliefs and our way of life. We will remember those who came home wounded in body and spirit, and we will remember their families.


The Centenary of Anzac is not just about the past but also about the future. It is the understanding that tens of thousands of men and women continue to serve our nation today, upholding a tradition that started a century ago. These men and women, and their families, devote their lives to the protection of ours and we owe them—as we owe their forebears—our gratitude and respect for the work they do in our country's name.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia) (12:46):  by leave—I have stated in this house before that if there is anything on the Australian landscape that is above politics it is the celebration of the Centenary of Anzac. The opposition certainly appreciates the update that Senator Ronaldson has just given us in the house this afternoon; but we also want to ensure that we do not forget the work of the former minister Warren Snowdon, who has laid much of the groundwork for this monumental occasion in Australia's history.


The Centenary of Anzac is above political point-scoring. Rather, the Centenary of Anzac is truly a great opportunity to unite to honour the Anzac spirit and the sacrifice and bravery of those who have served over the past century. It is an opportunity to remember and give thanks for the 416,000 Australian volunteers in World War I, including the 61,522 Australians killed in bloody battle. We will honour, in a special way, the 5,482 Australians who were killed in action at Gallipoli and the 2,677 who subsequently died from wounds or disease. We will not forget the one million Australians who have served and continue to serve in our defence forces.


I welcome, on behalf the opposition, today's announcement outlining the ongoing ballot process. A response of over 50,000 applications lodged by Australians and New Zealanders is extraordinary proof that Anzac Day, and in particular the Centenary of Anzac day in 2015, will be considered one of the most important events to occur in Australian history. Making sure that successful ballot applicants are informed of their place as quickly as possible is very important so that they can then make their arrangements to attend this event next year.


It is accepted on both sides of parliament that the Anzac commemorative site on the Gallipoli peninsula can safely hold up to 10,500 people. This will comprise 8,000 Australians, 2,000 New Zealanders and approximately 5,000 official representatives of all countries that served in the Gallipoli campaign. The ballot process represents a fair and transparent approach. Widows of World War I veterans were rightly offered special invitations to attend Anzac Day at Gallipoli and do not need to enter the ballot.


In the lead-up to these commemorations, it is particularly important to remember the hospitality and the generosity of the Turkish government. Every year, they allow thousands of Australians to make a pilgrimage to the hallowed beaches of Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula. It is wonderful that more and more young Australians join the annual pilgrimage to the birthplace of the Anzac legend. Another example of how this event in Australian history will live on through the generations and will never be forgotten is the 400 places set aside for students and their chaperones to attend the centenary event. That will ensure that the event is shared with all generations of Australians. Braving the cold, as well as a harsh landscape with few facilities, they connect with the Anzacs and the horrors that they endured. 


Unfortunately, the downside of having such a large response is that it means some people are going to miss out. Those who do not receive a ticket should make an effort to explore other more local options for the commemoration of Anzac Day in 2015. They may also wish to attend the Anzac Day dawn service at the national memorial at Villers-Bretonneux in France.


Locally, across cities and country towns in Australia there will be Anzac Centenary projects, which were funded by the government's Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. These are available through every federal electorate in Australia and, as we have heard, the Department of Veterans' Affairs is administering these grants. I encourage all Australians to become involved in centenary commemorations, because the Centenary of Anzac is for and about the Australian people and the Australian way of life. It is about ordinary Australians remembering those brave men and women who left their cities and towns to join theatres of war in unfamiliar and unkind lands.


I would also finally like to mention and congratulate those companies who have committed to the Anzac Centenary Public Fund. I was at the launch late last year with Mr Fox and the minister. The fund has gained financial support from some of Australia's largest businesses. The minister read these out, but I think it is worth repeating them. They include BHP Billiton, Woodside Petroleum, the National Australia Bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the ANZ Bank, Telstra, the Australian Football League, Crown Resorts Limited, Horizon Holdings Ltd, News Corp, Leighton Holdings, James Packer, the Linfox Group and Boral. Mr Lindsay Fox has been instrumental in campaigning for the support of corporate Australia and in encouraging them to give generously to this fund, and I would like to extend my appreciation to Mr Fox for his terrific work in this regard.


Also, I put out a call to any other businesses who have been approached but as yet have not committed to the fund to give generously to this great cause, as the legacy the fund will leave will mean a very great deal to many Australians.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-02-11,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:53):  by leave—I rise today to thank the government for the update that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided with regard to the Anzac Centenary. It is, as the minister has said, a commemoration. It is to honour and respect those who have served our nation in both war and peace in the past and in the present. It is actually about the last hundred years of service to our country. And it is about framing that experience of our service men and women and of our nation and of our community in their response to war and about working out how that will influence the way we approach this century in the pursuit of peace. 


This centenary event is not a hundred years of glorification of war or any kind of 'reductionist jingoism', as Paul Keating put it once, but in fact it is—and I borrow the name of a play that has currently opened in Sydney—The Long Way Home. I think this centenary is the long way home to our hearts, minds and national story of what the sacrifice has meant to us.


The years 1914 to 2014 has been a bloody, violent century. It was dominated by war, not least because the nature of warfare and the weapons of war became ever more powerful, ever more destructive. We went from the Light Horse, for example, in the First World War through to nuclear bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki through to the drones that are used in modern warfare today.


When we think about this Anzac Centenary covering the hundred years of Australian service, we are talking about the first and second world wars, we are talking about Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan and we are also talking about Australian service men and women trying to facilitate peace everywhere from Indonesia in 1947 through to Cambodia, Rwanda, Somalia, East Timor, Darfur and so on. 


So much has been written of Anzac Day and the sacrifice at Gallipoli in World War I, but I think it is important to put it in the population context of the day. Australia's population at that time was less than five million people, and 416,809 enlisted. For a population of fewer than five million, it is clear why people were so profoundly impacted, because, if you think of a population of that size, you realise that everybody knew someone. In that war, 61,512 died but 156,000 came back wounded, gassed or with the experience of having been taken prisoner. It is why part of the national identity is the small-town memorial. I want to read for a moment from a poem by a Canberra based poet, Geoff Page, Smalltown Memorials:


No matter how small


Every town has one;


Maybe just the obelisk,


A few names inlaid;


More often full-scale granite,


Marble digger (arms reversed),


Long descending lists of dead:


Sometimes not even a town,


A thickening of houses


Or a few unlikely trees


Glimpsed on a back-road


Will have one.


…   …   …


Unveiled;


Then seen each day —


Noticed once a year;


And then not always,


Everywhere.


The next bequeathed us


Parks and pools


But something in that first


Demanded stone.


It is certainly my experience in Tasmania, but also as I move around the country, that every town has their war memorial, and the First World War did demand stone from communities to commemorate the sacrifice.


I did study the First World War at university and travelled in my youth to many of the allied cemeteries on the Western Front, and then in 2005 I visited Gallipoli. I have to say it was a profoundly moving experience, but I was really distressed at the time about the changes that were being made to the site at Gallipoli to facilitate greater numbers of visitation. Bulldozers ripped into the cliff face behind Anzac Cove, spoil was dumped straight over the side onto the beaches, and the result is that you now have a terraced effect at Anzac Cove. You have lost the physical context of the troops arriving and facing those cliffs, as it was when they arrived at Gallipoli on, as we refer to it, Anzac Day. I find it really disturbing that we have lost that physical context, but we have not lost the context of the emotional engagement with our nation or the respect for the bravery, the sacrifice and the human characteristics of mateship, courage and humour and everything else we have come to understand about Australians serving in any war—World War I but other wars as well. They did not fight for some old idea of empire, what they did fight for was the future of our country and the defence of the values which we regard as important as Australians—freedom and our future.


I would like to finish by saying I am pleased the government is saying that this year is not about a glorification of war, but rather it is about recognising the horror, the tragedy, and the waste and futility of war and recognising the bravery and courage of those who follow orders to fight on our behalf. It is in that context that I would say that as parliamentarians we want to make sure that we change the law in this country to ensure that it is only the parliament which can commit young Australians to serve in war, because there is no greater responsibility for a parliament than taking that decision. 


I want to end with The Long Way Home. I went to the opening in Sydney on Saturday night and I would encourage all members of parliament to try and see this. It will tour the country. It is a play which is a collaboration between the Defence forces and the Sydney Theatre Company and it is about the experience of the war in Afghanistan. It talks about the trauma of the experience, the difficulty in coping on returning home and the grieving for a military identity that defined the lives of troops at that time. It is an important part of this Centenary of Anzac to look at the experience of our troops in that war and to support them now in every way we can to help with the healing process. The Long Way Home certainly does that. 


I want to thank the government for the work they are doing on the Centenary of Anzac, and I am certainly proud of the bravery, courage and humour of the Anzacs. I am grateful for their sacrifice; and I am mindful of the responsibility as a member of parliament to honour that sacrifice but also to move to make sure that in the future it is the parliament that takes that responsibility.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:02):  by leave—I want to congratulate the minister on the tabling of his statement and congratulate the government on the work that they have been doing to commemorate the very significant Australian involvement in World War I generally. There are stories all around Australia, fortunately given firsthand by just a few of the children of the original Anzacs that need to be recorded. I did not see the minister's statement before he delivered it a little while ago, and I am delighted to see the work that minister and the government is planning post-2015. It brings to mind a constituent of mine, who is also a friend, whose father, Lieutenant Thomas Dwyer, was very much involved in the Western Front. I am pleased that the minister is acknowledging that, whilst Gallipoli was almost the birthplace of our nation, other elements of the fighting in World War I were particularly important to Australia and Australians. Indeed, by far the greatest casualties occurred on the Western Front. For example, Lieutenant Thomas Dwyer enlisted in March 1916; he embarked in November 1916; he was wounded at Polygon Wood in September 1917; he was then wounded again at Villers-Bretonneux in April 1918; he was wounded a third time at Corbie in June 1918. He was wounded again in the Battle of Hemal near Vaire Wood in July 1918, and as a result of that particular incident he was awarded the Military Cross. He had the honour of having that Military Cross presented to him directly by His Majesty King George V.


My friend and constituent is hoping to get to the Western Front next April, mainly because, whilst it is not the 100th anniversary of his father's activities at Polygon Wood, Villers-Bretonneux and Hemal, he fears that he may not be alive if he waits until the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Hemal, which is particularly close to him. Whilst this is an individual example that I am citing, I am sure that there are literally thousands of other cases across Australia of relatives, and indeed first descendants, of those who participated in those battles who do want to be part of the very significant commemorations of the First World War, starting next year. I was pleased to hear the minister say that there will be further commemorations for these significant battles post-2015. I want to congratulate the minister for doing that, because it is important that the minister is aware of the circumstances of my constituent and thousands of other immediate descendants and is able to do something to commemorate those very significant battles and the contributions of so many Australians, and to allow those descendants to be part of those commemorations.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (13:45):  I would like to make some remarks on the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. I want to open my remarks with a quote by Dr Frank Jotzo, Director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University—and apologies, Dr Jotzo, if I am pronouncing your last name incorrectly:


Axing the Authority would be the most severe blow to Australia’s climate change policy institutions. Even if the carbon price was repealed, the authority has an important role. It has to advise on Australia’s national emissions target, and provide deep and critical analysis on any policy aimed at cutting emissions.


There we have it. This is an independent authority, established by the Climate Change Authority Act 2011, which the coalition wants to abolish. It is trying to do so in a package of legislation to remove a carbon price. Removing a carbon price and abolishing the Climate Change Authority are separate things and should be dealt with as such. This should not be hidden away in other legislation, as the coalition has tried to do.


Australian voters do not realise what beneficial and effective climate change tools they will lose in this package. As I have said, the CCA is an independent body that provides expert advice on climate change policies. It provides expert advice based on facts. It presents them—and it is up to the government how they act on the information provided. The CCA is an essential tool in properly dealing with climate change. Australia will be left behind the rest of the world if we do not deal with climate change appropriately.




Senator Boswell:
  Come on, the rest of the world is going nowhere.




Senator GALLACHER:
  I will go with you, Bozzie, in a minute. The rest of the world is taking action. If we do not do anything we will be left behind in environmental terms and Australian jobs will be affected. It makes no sense to get rid of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and it makes no sense to get rid of the Climate Change Authority if we are serious about climate change. I understand the other side is not serious about climate change. To abolish the Climate Change Authority will send the message that this government is not serious about reaching its target to reduce carbon emissions by five per cent by 2020. It also will increase the opinion of the rest of the world that this government is not serious about climate change. There is no science minister and there was no minister representing Australia at the Warsaw climate talks. The coalition want to abolish the CEFC and the CCA and they have a leader who has called climate science 'crap'.


An authority like the CCA is essential because it is important that targets and policies recommended to deal with climate change come from agencies that are independent of government. If they are not independent of government, there will be a cloud of doubt over what is recommended. There is no transparency. This ensures policies are created not by the politics but by the facts. We have seen the coalition cut the Climate Commission in their haste to keep their pre-election promise. Getting rid of the carbon tax is one thing; getting rid of independent bodies that are making a positive contribution to the fight against climate change is quite another. You can have the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Climate Change Authority and still get rid of a price on carbon. In fact, you need independent bodies such as these. We can repeal the carbon tax but still keep the authority that is essential to tackling climate change.


The coalition's biggest mistake is they are bundling all of these issues into one basket when they need to be dealt with separately. They are threatening to throw away a lot more than most people realise. There seems to be no thought or care about what is going to disappear. Effective tools are being thrown away in their haste. 


In the UK they have the Committee on Climate Change, which is very similar to the Climate Change Authority. It was established in 2008. The UK Conservative government has not cut it; it is still there. It acts in a very similar way to the Climate Change Authority. If the coalition were to move the role of the CCA to the environment department, they would be removing all transparency and scrutiny and this would bring uncertainty about information. It would take away expert advice. It would take away an authority independent of government. It would add uncertainty. On a topic as important as climate change none of this makes a lot of sense. 


This is bringing the politics back into it and making the facts insignificant. Australians do want to know that they are being given factual information on climate change. They want to know that action is being taken based on expert advice. There should be facts over politics in this argument for an independent authority, and that is what the CCA brings.


I accept that those on the other side have a view about climate change, the carbon tax and the like. I accept that they believe they have a strong mandate with respect to repealing the carbon tax. What I do not understand is that they do not look at the money of the reinsurance industry. Swiss Re is probably the largest reinsurer in the world. It is their task to take the insurance sold to households in Australia and the US and Europe and reinsure that risk. This is a company that, at the request of 722 investors representing US$87 trillion in assets, took part in the Carbon Disclosure Project's investor survey on climate change, a program designed to increase awareness of how to achieve efficiencies, realise monetary savings and capitalise on commercial opportunities from the management of energy, carbon emissions and climate change. This is a global insurer who says in its mission statement that 'climate change is in its DNA'. These are the people who manage the risk in a global sense, who have been saying there is an increased prevalence of natural disasters, who have been saying there is an increased number of hurricanes to hit the United States, and they reinsure those risks. These people have actually been working at this quite diligently for many years.


Look at Munich Re. Munich Re has been active around climate change and acquiring knowledge since 1973. It has devoted intense work re the issue of climate change and the consequences of global warming. So do not worry about the scientists, do not worry about the vast number of Australians who are concerned about climate change—I honestly am asked repeatedly whether I am personally going to fold on climate change. I say I am not, no. No, Labor is going to continue to resist this attempt to repeal the carbon tax. It was a then-opposition tactic used to win government. It disparaged the science, it disparaged the vast number of views in the Australian community, and it was very successful. I have to say the 'no carbon tax' line was a great opposition tactic, but we in this place have a greater responsibility to Australian voters and Australian citizens, to our children and grandchildren, than simply waving this bill through.


The money people of the world, the people who have been reinsuring risk for centuries, think that climate change is real, climate change is here—'it's in our DNA'—and they underwrite the risks which have been clearly identified. Natural disasters cost the global insurance industry around US$77 billion in 2012. These are the people who underwrite that risk—it is all about money: it is about maths, it is about actuaries, it is about economics—and they have no zealotry in them; it is all about facts and figures. But, interestingly, it is not only about money and facts and figures. The human toll, according to Swiss Re, of natural catastrophes and man-made disasters in 2012 cost 14,000 lives.


What we are talking about here is something that has not been portrayed by this current government. There is no leadership by this Prime Minister on this matter, and that is really interesting. I accept that you went there and you rattled that can on carbon tax—




Senator Back:
  It won the election.




Senator GALLACHER:

I do not know if voters have ever actually voted for a tax, so I do not suppose that the dropping of 'carbon' from in front of 'tax' would have made much difference, but the reality is the scientists are all saying that there is an issue. They are staking their reputations on it. Labor put up a couple of institutions, the CCA and the CFC, which would provide independent, rational advice—the government did not have to abide by the advice, it just had to be responded to—and ensuring that they had independence in what we are telling voters. And when you do go down the reinsurance side of climate change—the money men and women, those people who run these vast global conglomerates underwriting insurance re climate change and national disaster—there is no dispute there. You do not get any dispute there. Swiss Re says climate change and the management of those efficiencies arising from it is 'in their DNA'. They say that they underwrite 722 organisations representing $77 trillion worth of assets.


This issue has been distorted for short-term political gain. It has been disparaging to a vast number of conscientious scientists, and ignores the DNA of the Liberal Party to look where the money is. The money is saying that climate change is real, that natural disasters cost lots of money. And what nation should not take responsible action, including taking responsible, independent advice from the CCA, to mitigate the effects of that not only on the Australian population but on the Australian economy? It defies common sense that this government take a low-ball strategy to win an election and ignore the national imperatives of climate change and the effect on the economy. If they go their way—and I have had a look at their policy—they will be paying polluters not to pollute. Forget all the other arguments. All economists will tell you a price is what changes behaviour—a price on speeding stops people speeding and a price on pollution will stop people polluting—not paying people to pollute a little bit more slowly, which is what appears to be the guts of the Abbott government's policy on climate change.


I would like to simply restate that they need to have a good look at their policy, look at where the financial institutions of the world, in terms of reinsurance—

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (13:45):  I would like to make some remarks on the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. I want to open my remarks with a quote by Dr Frank Jotzo, Director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University—and apologies, Dr Jotzo, if I am pronouncing your last name incorrectly:


Axing the Authority would be the most severe blow to Australia’s climate change policy institutions. Even if the carbon price was repealed, the authority has an important role. It has to advise on Australia’s national emissions target, and provide deep and critical analysis on any policy aimed at cutting emissions.


There we have it. This is an independent authority, established by the Climate Change Authority Act 2011, which the coalition wants to abolish. It is trying to do so in a package of legislation to remove a carbon price. Removing a carbon price and abolishing the Climate Change Authority are separate things and should be dealt with as such. This should not be hidden away in other legislation, as the coalition has tried to do.


Australian voters do not realise what beneficial and effective climate change tools they will lose in this package. As I have said, the CCA is an independent body that provides expert advice on climate change policies. It provides expert advice based on facts. It presents them—and it is up to the government how they act on the information provided. The CCA is an essential tool in properly dealing with climate change. Australia will be left behind the rest of the world if we do not deal with climate change appropriately.




Senator Boswell:
  Come on, the rest of the world is going nowhere.




Senator GALLACHER:
  I will go with you, Bozzie, in a minute. The rest of the world is taking action. If we do not do anything we will be left behind in environmental terms and Australian jobs will be affected. It makes no sense to get rid of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and it makes no sense to get rid of the Climate Change Authority if we are serious about climate change. I understand the other side is not serious about climate change. To abolish the Climate Change Authority will send the message that this government is not serious about reaching its target to reduce carbon emissions by five per cent by 2020. It also will increase the opinion of the rest of the world that this government is not serious about climate change. There is no science minister and there was no minister representing Australia at the Warsaw climate talks. The coalition want to abolish the CEFC and the CCA and they have a leader who has called climate science 'crap'.


An authority like the CCA is essential because it is important that targets and policies recommended to deal with climate change come from agencies that are independent of government. If they are not independent of government, there will be a cloud of doubt over what is recommended. There is no transparency. This ensures policies are created not by the politics but by the facts. We have seen the coalition cut the Climate Commission in their haste to keep their pre-election promise. Getting rid of the carbon tax is one thing; getting rid of independent bodies that are making a positive contribution to the fight against climate change is quite another. You can have the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Climate Change Authority and still get rid of a price on carbon. In fact, you need independent bodies such as these. We can repeal the carbon tax but still keep the authority that is essential to tackling climate change.


The coalition's biggest mistake is they are bundling all of these issues into one basket when they need to be dealt with separately. They are threatening to throw away a lot more than most people realise. There seems to be no thought or care about what is going to disappear. Effective tools are being thrown away in their haste. 


In the UK they have the Committee on Climate Change, which is very similar to the Climate Change Authority. It was established in 2008. The UK Conservative government has not cut it; it is still there. It acts in a very similar way to the Climate Change Authority. If the coalition were to move the role of the CCA to the environment department, they would be removing all transparency and scrutiny and this would bring uncertainty about information. It would take away expert advice. It would take away an authority independent of government. It would add uncertainty. On a topic as important as climate change none of this makes a lot of sense. 


This is bringing the politics back into it and making the facts insignificant. Australians do want to know that they are being given factual information on climate change. They want to know that action is being taken based on expert advice. There should be facts over politics in this argument for an independent authority, and that is what the CCA brings.


I accept that those on the other side have a view about climate change, the carbon tax and the like. I accept that they believe they have a strong mandate with respect to repealing the carbon tax. What I do not understand is that they do not look at the money of the reinsurance industry. Swiss Re is probably the largest reinsurer in the world. It is their task to take the insurance sold to households in Australia and the US and Europe and reinsure that risk. This is a company that, at the request of 722 investors representing US$87 trillion in assets, took part in the Carbon Disclosure Project's investor survey on climate change, a program designed to increase awareness of how to achieve efficiencies, realise monetary savings and capitalise on commercial opportunities from the management of energy, carbon emissions and climate change. This is a global insurer who says in its mission statement that 'climate change is in its DNA'. These are the people who manage the risk in a global sense, who have been saying there is an increased prevalence of natural disasters, who have been saying there is an increased number of hurricanes to hit the United States, and they reinsure those risks. These people have actually been working at this quite diligently for many years.


Look at Munich Re. Munich Re has been active around climate change and acquiring knowledge since 1973. It has devoted intense work re the issue of climate change and the consequences of global warming. So do not worry about the scientists, do not worry about the vast number of Australians who are concerned about climate change—I honestly am asked repeatedly whether I am personally going to fold on climate change. I say I am not, no. No, Labor is going to continue to resist this attempt to repeal the carbon tax. It was a then-opposition tactic used to win government. It disparaged the science, it disparaged the vast number of views in the Australian community, and it was very successful. I have to say the 'no carbon tax' line was a great opposition tactic, but we in this place have a greater responsibility to Australian voters and Australian citizens, to our children and grandchildren, than simply waving this bill through.


The money people of the world, the people who have been reinsuring risk for centuries, think that climate change is real, climate change is here—'it's in our DNA'—and they underwrite the risks which have been clearly identified. Natural disasters cost the global insurance industry around US$77 billion in 2012. These are the people who underwrite that risk—it is all about money: it is about maths, it is about actuaries, it is about economics—and they have no zealotry in them; it is all about facts and figures. But, interestingly, it is not only about money and facts and figures. The human toll, according to Swiss Re, of natural catastrophes and man-made disasters in 2012 cost 14,000 lives.


What we are talking about here is something that has not been portrayed by this current government. There is no leadership by this Prime Minister on this matter, and that is really interesting. I accept that you went there and you rattled that can on carbon tax—




Senator Back:
  It won the election.




Senator GALLACHER:
  and won the election on it. I do not know if voters have ever actually voted for a tax, so I do not suppose that the dropping of 'carbon' from in front of 'tax' would have made much difference, but the reality is the scientists are all saying that there is an issue.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz), the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) and the Assistant Minister for Health (Senator Nash) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


I remind the Senate that question time today reflects how this government have degenerated into purveyors of lies. This government have predicated their approach on peddling lies. They lie about the way in which the automotive industry operates and they lie about the way in which SPC operates. This government have degenerated into peddlers of lies.


They said that Toyota said that no matter what we did, they would leave as Holden did—which we know is untrue. Holden wanted to invest $1 billion. Jobs were driven overseas as a direct result of this government's actions. Toyota wanted to build not one but two new models in this country, which would have seen investment of around a similar proportion to that of General Motors.


Both these companies wanted long-term certainty. They did not want more; they just wanted to guarantee that the current support arrangements would be there into the next decade. What happened? The government promised to cut $500 million from the automotive industry assistance arrangements.


This is a government that has killed the automotive industry in this country. This is a government that will not face up to the fact that a new car plan, as Labor announced, would have secured the future of the automotive industry in this country and the jobs that go with it—the new investment, the new technologies and the new skills for Australia.


Senator Abetz says that we should not misquote Toyota, but I think Senator Abetz should refresh his own memory of what Toyota actually said. Toyota spoke to the Productivity Commission, which faithfully reported the statements on the 31 January—less than two weeks ago. Toyota Motor Corporation, on page 166, has stated that government assistance 'needs to be consistent and it needs to be ongoing' in order for Australian manufacturing operations to be viable. Senator Abetz, instead of acting blatantly in his party's interest, ought to think for a little while just about the national interest of this country and about the welfare of the people of this country.


It cannot be anything other than a social and economic disaster to see the loss of 50,000 jobs from the automotive industry, and the loss of maybe four or five times that number from subsequent industries that support the automotive industry. How can it possibly be in the national interest to get rid of Australian capabilities in regard to automotive manufacturing? How can the loss of those jobs, skills, technology, investment and taxation revenue be in the national interest? But this is a government that has pursued that course of policy. 


They sicced the Productivity Commission on the industry, in what we have said would always be a post-mortem. Well, it is a situation here—and I repeat my statements from before—where the coroner is inquiring into a death which the government welcome. This is a government that welcome the destruction of the automotive industry.


When it comes to SPC, Senator Cormann makes the claim that he stands by all the assertions that this government, the Prime Minister and other ministers have made. None of their claims, he said, were false—none, whatsoever, of their claims was false. That is not what the company says. That is not what his own Liberal Party member in the seat of Murray says. That is not what the workers say. That is not what the press in the Goulburn Valley say. This is a government that turns its back on entire communities, not just on individual firms.


So we have a situation where over 3,000 people are now facing an economic catastrophe because of the government's blatant arrogance. The press reported that it is understood that, in the Liberal Party room itself, blatant arrogance is running this government. The government have a textbook view about how the economy works. It is a view that might be popular in the north shore of Sydney, but it bears no relationship whatsoever to the realities of economic life for working Australians and no relationship whatsoever to the way in which investment decisions are made internationally.


This is a government that is turning its back on ordinary Australians. This is a government that has no commitment to securing the investment, new technologies, new skills and new jobs this country needs. (Time expired)

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-02-11,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:06):  I also rise to take note of answers to a variety of questions—a suite of questions, I might say—asked by the opposition. I rise just as Senator Carr sits down. He wants to tell me, a National Party senator from Victoria, what people in the seat of Murray, from Shepparton and Kyabram et cetera, are saying.




Senator Kim Carr:
  What are they saying?




Senator McKENZIE:
  I will tell you what they are saying, Senator Carr. They are saying, 'Get rid of the carbon tax.' They voted en masse, not for your promise—




Senator Kim Carr:
  What were they saying in the party room this morning?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my left! Order. Senator McKenzie, you have the call.




Senator McKENZIE:
  I think we want to look at what the people from the seat of Murray actually think about the suite of options available to them, Senator Carr in his former role put it on the table. He also put a whole other range of legislation options on the table—keeping the carbon tax, keeping the regulation that is strangling industry in this country. I tell you what, Senator Carr, as you leave the chamber: the people from the seat of Murray in my state voted en masse to get rid of your government, to get rid of those policies. It would be nice if the opposition and those having a crack today could get on board and get rid of one of the millstones on industry—particularly food manufacturing and processing in the regions—the carbon tax.


Senator Cameron, you talked of SPCA, and I might say your party had to be dragged kicking and screaming to initiate the safeguard action under the Productivity Commission and in relation to some of the strategies that the new management at SPC Ardmona had started to implement to get their company back on track. One of them was to address the international trade regime that their industry has been operating under, and it took a lot of effort, including from your own AMWU president at a state level, to get you guys on board. So do not come crying now that somehow we have been slow to act. You were ready to jump to attention for automotive workers at the time, but you were dragged kicking and screaming in relation to regional workers in the seat of Murray.


The Productivity Commission's safeguards inquiry identified the supermarket strategy as being an issue of concern for manufacturing and food processing in this country. We know that Senator Ludwig, in his previous role, tried to get a voluntary code together throughout the supply chain to get producers, processors and retailers on the same page to start to address some of those issues. But it was not Senator Ludwig who could come up with the solution; rather it was private industry. It was SPC Ardmona, it was Woolworths and it was Coles that responded to the very strong demand in the Australian community to back our local produce. Thank you to Coles and Woolworths for ensuring that 100 per cent of their product is now locally produced. 




Senator Marshall:
  One hundred per cent—I don't think so.




Senator McKENZIE:
  That is as a result not of your government's policy agenda but rather of private industry taking leadership, and that is what it should be about, Senator Marshall. I should not be surprised, Senator Marshall, that you are here. It is all about political game-playing for the Labor Party—using workers, not supporting them. 


There was no greater case for us down south in Victoria, when the state leader of the Labor Party, Daniel Andrews—I notice you chuckling over there, Senator Marshall—came out in support of the workers, promising $25 million. He quickly did his figures and jumped it up a little more. That, folks, is not going to assist Coca-Cola Amatil in reaching their decision on 18 February because that money will not be arriving until the state election campaign come November 2014. Too little, too late by Daniel Andrews. The people of Murray clearly voted in September on what they wanted, and it was not more of the same. Yet here we are in February 2014 still debating whether the people of Murray meant what they said at the ballot box. Using workers for your state election campaign in November 2014 is beyond the pale.


The decision by Coca-Cola Amatil, a private company, on 18 February will determine whether SPC Ardmona in its current form continues in the Goulburn Valley. This is the company that has backed our region, that has backed our growers. It has invested in R&D and it has taken steps to address workplace relations practices. The management has changed and is going forward, and I hope the company does support them. But our job is to govern, to reduce the regulation—environmental regulation—right throughout our supply chain. (Time expired)

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:11):  One thing is clear from Senator McKenzie's session here: Senator McKenzie is no Dr Sharman Stone. You are not prepared to stand up for the people of your region. You have dodged the issue; you have wandered all over the place. Yet Dr Sharman Stone was prepared to stand up and call it how it was. You have said that you want to tell us in the Senate what the people of Murray are saying. Let me remind you what the people's representative in the seat of Murray, Dr Sharman Stone, a Liberal member, is saying. No wonder the Nationals are concerned that the Liberals might get more seats in National Party territory, especially after that weak performance of yours here.


Dr Stone said that the Prime Minister was attempting to scapegoat the workers at SPC. There was not a word from the heroes of the National Party to stand up for the workers at SPC—not a word. Dr Stone said that what the Prime Minister was saying was just rubbish—it was a witch-hunt, it was a furphy, it was not the truth and it was a distraction from the facts that would require some government action. She went on to say that it is lying. This is a senior member of the Liberal Party out in what should be National Party territory calling it how it is. Where were the Nationals? They stood up here bleating about blue-collar jobs when they were in opposition. Where were you? Where was Senator Boswell? Nowhere to be seen. It is an absolute disgrace.


Dr Stone went on to say that the Prime Minister was blackening the character of SPC Ardmona workers. The Prime Minister was blackening the character of workers who are in trouble, who do not know if they are going to have a job, who will have a very limited future in that regional area. Yet what does the Leader of the Liberal Party do—the leader of the government, the Prime Minister? According to Dr Sharman Stone, a Liberal member, he is blackening the character of the workers at SPC. Don't come in here telling us what the people of Murray are saying. The member knows exactly what the situation is and she has gone out on the front foot with far more courage than the National Party have had on this. The National Party was done-over in the party room when they supported SPC—done-over once more trying to support regional communities. National Party members will continually be done-over as long as the Liberal Party extremists have control economic policy in this government. They will get done over time and time again, and workers' jobs will be lost.


I actually know what it is like to lose a job and be made redundant—not too many on the other side would. I have worked as blue-collar worker; I know what it is like to go home and tell my wife with a young child that I have lost my job, that I have been made redundant and that I do not know what the future is for the family. Yet what does this federal government do? It treats jobs with a cavalier attitude. There will be no government intervention. The extremists will say, 'It's all about destroying jobs in one area, with jobs being created in another area.' These are all economic fears of Schumpeter and all the nonsense we hear from the coalition. This is about real families; this is about real kids; this is about real communities. And you have let them down, Senator McKenzie, you have let them down by your craven approach to this issue.

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:16):  How shrill.




Senator Cameron:
  Here's another hero.




Senator EDWARDS:
  I have listened to you, Senator Cameron, and I have listened to Senator Carr. How shrill you are, when for six years you presided over the manufacturing industry. Yet, Senator Carr has the gall to talk of lies. He brings that into this chamber, Senator Cameron. I see that you are exiting the chamber. 'Lies,' he says, 'lies.' It is very emotive. He did not say that in his press conferences, but he comes in here and talks about lies. I will tell you what is a lie—'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and 'We will have a green car policy, but, no, we won't, because we'll rip $1.2 billion out of it.' This is what has happened to the sector: the carbon tax has been a $460 million impost on the industry sector. Senator Gallacher belled the cat in an earlier contribution to this chamber—it is in Hansard. He has worked it out, and he is from the TWU. So, I presume his patriarchal master, Tony Sheldon, the national president of the Transport Workers Union, knows this too.




Senator Conroy:
  Secretary!




Senator EDWARDS:
  Secretary, thank you. What did they do? He said this morning that the coalition has a mandate—he agrees that we have a mandate—to abolish the carbon tax. What are those opposite doing? In this chamber they are stalling it. 


What is going on in the car industry and what is going on with unions is completely dysfunctional. What has gone on? We have had 12e years of Labor in South Australia. Rabbits in the headlights, they are. We have a sector that has suffered with a high Australian dollar. What do Toyota, Holden and Ford—and Mitsubishi before them—have in common?—the cost of manufacturing. You heard from Senator Abetz: if the workforce had its way and if the unions had not stood in their way, there might have been another 2,000 working days on the floor each year. Now, that is productivity gain, but the workers were not allowed to do that. What happened to the car industry was systematic dysfunction. And what about the policy settings of the green car funds and the carbon tax? Then there was that $1.8 billion clanger—the FBT, just on the eve of the election. That worked! Cripple the industry by sending messages to the owners of these businesses about policy settings that the Labor Party provided the Australian environment. You were all over the place—'There'll be no carbon tax. We'll have green car funds; we'll put $1.2 billion into it. Oh, no, we won't; we can't balance the budget so we'll rip it out of there. Nobody will notice.' But they did notice. It was not on our watch; it was on your watch. You set the dysfunction in place, and you are totally responsible. 


By the way, last week in South Australia we had Senator Farrell, who is leaving this place on 30 June, wanting to go to the northern suburbs of Adelaide to represent those poor people from Holden out there in the seat of Napier. What happened? There was a factional stitch up, and he was not allowed to. I quite like Senator Farrell; I have always found him to be a straight-shooting bloke. He wanted to introduce some intellect into that area. What do the members for Little Para, Newland, Playford, Light, Taylor and the current member for Napier have in common? Apart from being silent on this issue, they are all from the Labor Party. There has been 12 years of dysfunction in that area. 


Senator Farrell wanted to go there to try to fix it, but Minister Michael O'Brien—not to be confused with our colleague in the Victorian Liberal Party—stood aside to let Senator Farrell come in. But what happened? The lefties stitched Senator Farrell up and snuffed out his political career. I feel he could have worked with the coalition government on arresting the dysfunction that Labor has put into the car industry.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (15:21):  If anyone needs a demonstration of the abject poverty of the coalition's position on manufacturing, they only need read Senator Edwards's contribution. This government has presided over the death of a $21.5 billion industry, and we get that sort of nonsense and rubbish as a contribution by Senator Edwards. I do not think he has done his party any service, he certainly has not done the Senate any service, and he is doing the people of Australia absolutely no service at all.


We are talking about an industry which employs up to 50,000 highly skilled workers. That means 50,000 highly skilled jobs are set to go from Victoria, and all you can do is talk about some nonsensical local political stuff. You have no understanding—as the coalition has no understanding—of the policy settings required to save an industry. There are 2,900 Holden workers in Victoria and South Australia, and they are set to lose their jobs in 2017. From Toyota in Victoria 3,500 jobs will go in 2017. Ford will be sacking an additional 300 workers soon, two years ahead of its decision to close completely in 2016. In total 1,200 jobs will go at Ford.


But the even bigger costs are in the supply chain. Each car produced in Australia has around 30,000 parts. Car manufacturers spend $2.5 billion every year with Victorian suppliers alone, and those companies together employ 18,000 full-time workers. It is estimated that, Australia-wide, 30,000 people supplying parts and components in the car industry will be impacted by the decisions to close. But the impact will be even greater than this. Allen Consulting Group, using economic analysis from Monash University, found that if Australia lost its car manufacturing, which we are now set to do, Australia's GDP would be $7.3 billion smaller by 2018. Furthermore:


Employment losses in Melbourne would equate to some 33,000 jobs in 2018, and around 6,600 in Adelaide.


… employment levels would not return until around 2027 for Melbourne and 2025 for Adelaide.


These are catastrophic figures. Yet when it is put to the government, 'Why didn't you act quicker?' they come back with this response: 'The decisions were already made. There was nothing we could do.' But that shows great ignorance about what is necessary to assist with long-term planning and to get the policy settings right for the automotive industry.


The coalition in the lead-up to the last election and through the election campaign announced that they were going to cut $500 million from car assistance over a long period, and these threats must have sent shudders through the boardrooms of Ford, Toyota and Holden. These threats, and the goading by Mr Hockey of GMH to get up and leave the country, must have had a major impact. Then there is the fact that the coalition tried to explain to us that Toyota was not under threat, because it had a different business model: that, on the whole, its cars were being exported. But again the coalition in its ignorance failed to understand that, once a critical mass in the car supplying, technology and R&D industries is lost, you make it unviable for companies to continue. It is so disappointing that the government failed to understand this and then came back and said, 'We didn't know; there was nothing we could have done anyway.'



At this very moment there is a delegation of shipbuilders in this building. The shipbuilding industry is also under enormous pressure, and the delegation has sought meetings with the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott; the Treasurer, Joe Hockey; the Minister for Industry, Ian Macfarlane; the Minister for Trade and Investment, Andrew Robb; and the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. Not one of these ministers has yet agreed to meet with the delegation. Some have blatantly refused, and some have simply ignored the request. So when they say, 'We didn't know; what is it we could have done?' they rejoice in their ignorance. They do not want to know. They do not meet with people who have information from the coalface, and that means that they can be happy in their ignorance when things go bad. (Time expired)

That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 5 January 2014, of the Honourable Arthur Thomas Gietzelt, AO, former Senator for New South Wales, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. 


Arthur Thomas Gietzelt had a long life, spanning 93 years. He was born in San Francisco, California, in 1920 and grew up in Newton, Enfield and Sans Souci in Sydney. He attended Hurstville high school but left school at 15 to help support the family during the Depression. In 1941, he enlisted in the army and, in 1943 and 1944, went to New Guinea with his brother Ray as part of the 9th Field Company Royal Australian Engineers. Their job was to build a road over the Owen Stanley Range to support the front line in the north of New Guinea. After his discharge from the Army in 1946, he served three years on the state executive of the Returned Soldiers League. 


Arthur Gietzelt became Councillor Arthur Gietzelt when he was first elected to the Sutherland Shire Council in 1956. He served nine terms as shire president—from 1961 to 1963 and again from 1966 to 1971. He was instrumental in setting up a scheme whereby the council acquired land, developed it and then auctioned the finished product. The proceeds paid for public infrastructure in the shire. In 1967, he was elected to the executive of the New South Wales Local Government Association, a role he remained in until 1971. 


Councillor Gietzelt then became Senator Gietzelt on his election to the Senate in 1970. In 1971, he and his family were the victims of what one assumes was an attempted assassination when their house was bombed with 17 sticks of gelignite. The blast occurred at 2.20 am outside the main bedroom which adjoined the front veranda about five feet from where Senator Gietzelt and his wife were sleeping. A double layer of bricks was the only thing that saved their lives. According to Senate Gietzelt, the community response was magnificent. A former independent shire councillor and retired builder arrived with a small workforce to remedy the immediate damage. I also note that Don Dobie, the then local federal Liberal member for Cook, and Jim Cover attended on behalf of the Liberal Party, as did others. 


In 1975, Senator Gietzelt led the backbench revolt opposing the Labor cabinet's decision to issue export permits for sandmining on Fraser Island. In 1976, Senator Gietzelt became shadow minister for agriculture and later shadow minister for consumer and administrative affairs. From 1983 to 1987, the former engineer sergeant was Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the Hawke government. He instigated the Agent Orange royal commission, recognised the role of the Indigenous Australians who patrolled the northern coastline of Australia in World War II, was a strong supporter of the Vietnam Veterans Association, introduced homecare services for veterans and simplified disparate veterans' welfare entitlements under the new Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986. 


Senator Gietzelt also brought his own political views to the Veterans' Affairs portfolio. In 1985, he declared that the War Memorial should play a greater role in educating people about the causes and consequences of war—including 'the intermittent war that Australians had waged on the Aboriginal people'—and teaching them that occasionally wars are fought for narrow sectarian, ideological, economic or xenophobic reasons that have brought little credit to us as a nation. He also said:


Australia needed to learn more about the consequences that powerful military alliances could lead to for small and nominally independent nations, consequences that ranged from threats of economic warfare to the imposition of brutal military dictatorships should those nations seek to assert a measure of independence within such alliances.


Senator Gietzelt was joint Father of the Senate from 1987 until his departure from parliament in 1989 at the age of 68, after 18 years in federal politics. In deference to my colleague Senator Faulkner, it is said that Senator Gietzelt's exit, causing a casual vacancy, was deliberately timed to ensure that his Senate spot would be taken by Senator John Faulkner—one of the few left-wingers from New South Wales Labor Party headquarters—who would allegedly otherwise not have secured a winnable spot on a Senate ticket. I thank Senator Faulkner for his assistance with this part of my speech. 


In an interview at the time, Senator Gietzelt listed his and the Left's achievements as the restructuring of all industry awards, the Hawke government's Prices and Income Accord, the capital gains tax and the defeat of Paul Keating's proposed consumption tax which, he said, would have had disastrous effects on the economy. 


No comment on or indeed tribute to Arthur Gietzelt's life would be thorough if it failed to address the persistent accusations that Gietzelt, despite his denials, was also a member of the Communist Party. A recent article by Troy Bramston in The Australian notes that Gietzelt was widely believed to have been either a member or secret member of the Communist Party of Australia and that he had acted as an agent of influence on its behalf inside Labor, unions and community-based organisations. As former New South Wales Labor senator Graham Richardson said:


He was a very powerful opponent. How powerful? He became a minister even though everyone knew he was a communist.


Gietzelt was also a member of the national executive of the ALP from 1971, rising to junior vice president in 1983 and senior vice president in 1986. 


Much of Gietzelt's career and public commentary involved what might be described as a preoccupation with ASIO. It appears the preoccupation was reciprocated. In 1973 Gietzelt told the Senate that he had been told that 'some members of parliament are part-time operatives for ASIO'—a proposition that he found credible. More recently it has been alleged that there was in fact an ASIO informant within the Right faction of his own party who passed on information to ASIO. Such were the Cold War years. There is no doubt that in the seventies and eighties Gietzelt wanted to build a bridge between the communists and Labor. An article he wrote for the Nation Review in 1978 was billed as follows:


Senator Arthur Gietzelt, a key figure on the Left of the Labor Party for a generation, comes as close to calling for a Labor-communist dialogue as the Australian political atmosphere will allow.


Gietzelt's sweeping polemic acknowledged Stalinist authoritarianism that praised modern Euro-communism. He called on 'the Right wing in the Labor movement to stop putting more favourable labels on themselves' and describing others as part of the 'totalitarian Left,' and instead make 'an intelligent contribution to an alternative society to capitalism, one that is an extension of democracy and one that is thoroughly socialist.' In the same article he saw the defeat of the Whitlam government through the prism of class struggle:


We did not see that any change in the allocation of resources, wealth and privilege—the desire to give more opportunity to disadvantaged people to create a more egalitarian society, meant ipso facto, taking from some to give to others.


And that meant change. That meant struggle. To take from the privileged and to give to others meant we were involved in a class struggle.


To Gietzelt the Whitlam government's faults were naivety about what he saw as vested interests and a failure to prepare the ground. I quote again:


But did we prepare the electorate, or did we rely too much on government legislation, administrative fiats, the cooperation of the conservative bureaucracy and the ‘understanding’ of the media, least of all the acceptance of those ‘born to rule’ to accept the people’s verdict?


On bowing out of the Senate in 1989, Arthur Gietzelt told a journalist that he would write his memoirs in between taking his wife to dinner and going to the theatre. He must have been to a lot of plays and he and his wife must have enjoyed a lot of dinners, because we have had to wait till now, 25 years later, to get those memoirs. Arthur Gietzelt's long-awaited memoir, Sticks and Stones, was launched at his wake last Thursday. I note that a website set up to celebrate Gietzelt's life says that his denial of ASIO communist claims will be released after his family has had the opportunity to grieve their loss.


Arthur Gietzelt was awarded the Order of Australia for services to local government and parliament in 1992 and a Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to the community through the ALP and the trade union movement. He was made a life member of the ALP in 1994. It is a pity that former senator Bob Carr, a long time Gietzelt antagonist, is no longer here, as it would have been good to have had his reflections on the life of Senator Gietzelt as well as those of Senator Faulkner, from whom we expect to hear very shortly.


On behalf of the coalition, I extend our sincere sympathies to Arthur Gietzelt's wife, Dawn; his children Lee, Dale and Adam and their spouses; his grandchildren Tom, Jarrah and Skye; and his sister Fay. We extend our sympathies to them all.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (15:44): On behalf of the opposition, I support this condolence motion on the death of former Labor senator and minister Arthur Gietzelt. I said at Arthur's memorial service last week that I felt as if I knew Arthur Gietzelt all my life; I certainly knew him for all my political life. For more than 60 years, Arthur was a constant for those of us in the Labor Party in New South Wales—constant in his commitment to his community in the Sutherland Shire; constant in his determination to stand up for what he believed in and believed to be the best traditions of Labor; constant in his opposition to the sharp practices and underhand tactics of the Right; constant in his presence whether as a councillor, senator, mentor or stalwart of the Left.


Arthur was born on 28 March 1920 in San Francisco. He spent his early life in the Sydney suburb of Newtown, where his parents owned a tyre business. During the twenties the business prospered, but it faltered during the Great Depression, when many of its clients were unable to pay their debts. For a time the family struggled and, like so many of Arthur's generation, the hardship of this period shaped his politics. Despite these trying circumstances, Arthur performed well at Hurstville high school and, in his final year, he won a scholarship to attend St George business college. He studied there at night and for a time entertained the idea of becoming a journalist. But his first job was as a messenger with Myer needlework company. He duly joined the Federated Clerks' Union, the industrial Labor Party and the Australian Labor league. Like so many of his generation, his life was changed forever by the outbreak of war. There was no question he would serve in his nation's cause.


In 1941, Arthur and his brother, Ray, responded by enlisting. Arthur joined the 51st Field Park Company of the Royal Australian Engineers. He served in New Guinea with the 9th Australian Field Company, which built a road through thick jungle and difficult terrain to lay. From the Army, Arthur received permission to possess a camera, a radio and film development material. In his own time and at his own expense, Arthur started a company newspaper. His thoroughness was already apparent, and his eye for detail and passion for keeping a record. He began the war as a private and finished a sergeant.


Arthur returned to a job in his father's chemical business and to a block of land in north Caringbah. The fate of this land, where Arthur planned to build his war-service home, drew Arthur into local politics and the ALP. The council proposed rezoning the land from residential to industrial. Arthur made his first public speech at a protest meeting, demanding council change its decision. He won. But that protest was about more than zoning; it was about issues that Arthur was to make his causes for many years: the need for fair process and transparent decision making; the power of democratic action to change policy; and the importance of unified, intelligent, consistent planning decisions in the development of a new community.


Arthur served, as we have heard, as a councillor on the Sutherland Shire Council from 1956 until 1971, including nine years as shire president. Those were crucial years in making Sutherland Shire what it is today. During his presidency, Arthur took the shire from having little or no infrastructure to having the amenities of established suburbs. Many of the shire's swimming pools, playing fields and beach facilities are a direct result of Arthur's efforts—so too is much basic infrastructure that today we take for granted as part of life in suburban Sydney: paved roads, stormwater drainage, sewerage and street lights. Arthur stopped high-rise development around Cronulla Beach and Caringbah, refusing to allow developers free rein. Although he was pilloried as an anti-growth radical for this, it was Arthur's vision that saw Sylvania Waters developed in partnership between council and the private sector.


Arthur Gietzelt was not a consensus politician. He believed in following his principles. Arthur saw Sutherland Shire as part of a wider community, the Australian community, and he never shied away from wider causes. He led Sutherland Shire Council to be the first Australian government body to ban South African competitors from a national sporting event, a surf-lifesaving carnival at Cronulla—a principled action which saw him blacklisted for decades by the local surf-lifesaving movement. During that time he also, as we know, endured a terrifying attack on his home, his family and himself when 17 sticks of gelignite were detonated on the doorstep of the family home.


Through all these years, Arthur was an active Labor Party member. He was one of the small number of dissident ALP branch members, appalled at the direction of New South Wales Labor, who decided to hold covert meetings at an out-of-the way place, the Esperanto Room in the northern pylon of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. That was 1953. 


By 1956, Arthur and another party activist, John Garland, who was later to become the first National Secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and an MLC in New South Wales, had been approached to support the ALP Trade Unions Steering Committee—a meeting of unionists opposed to the industrial groups. Thus was born the Combined Unions and Branches Steering Committee, as the left-wing faction of the New South Wales ALP was known for 50 years. Arthur served as secretary of the steering committee through the 1960s. His role was crucial in building links to activists in affiliated unions and party branches. Those links mattered when, in 1970, Arthur contested preselection for the Senate. It was a tough fight.


Arthur saw off his internal Left rival, Jack Heffernan, and won against the official ticket described in a brochure sent to Senate convention delegates as 'a balanced, qualified group supporting Gough Whitlam and the officers in NSW'. This claim was sophistry from the utterly ruthless, winner-take-all New South Wales Right. Arthur's success against the official ticket and against the odds says much for his organising ability and his tenacity. Arthur's term as a Senator began on 1 July 1971, and he soon became a significant player in the federal parliamentary Labor Party. 


Arthur joined forces with Paul Keating to promote a ticket in the caucus ballot for the Labor ministry after the election of the Whitlam government in 1972. The ticket was stunningly successful. It upset the applecart, blocked several of Gough's preferred candidates and absolutely infuriated Gough. Only two caucus members on the ticket missed election—Arthur and Paul Keating! Clem Lloyd and Gordon Reid wrote about that ballot in their book Out of the Wilderness:


The most widely publicised ticket was a joint one devised by Mr P. Keating and Senator A. Gietzelt as representatives of right and left limits of the Caucus spectrum. Ironically both missed places in the cabinet, although their ticket did have considerable influence.


For the record, it was Al Grassby and Bill Morrison who broke the ticket and won through to become ministers. Paul Keating was the runner-up in the final caucus ballot and would have comfortably won if his candidature had not been sabotaged by the leadership of the New South Wales Right of the party. As he described it: 'They stuck to me like a limpet mine'! 


The highlight of Arthur's parliamentary career was his service as Minister For Veterans' Affairs in the Hawke government. His achievements in the portfolio were considerable. He was one of those ministers who made a difference. He oversaw a complete rewriting of veterans legislation, which had been amended nearly 100 times in its 70-year history, culminating in the simplification of disparate veterans welfare entitlements after the passage of the Veterans' Entitlements Act in 1986. He overhauled and modernised Australia's repatriation hospitals after years of neglect and rock-bottom staff morale. Under Arthur's watch, the Australian War Memorial was transferred to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the memorial's staff was increased, several major conservation projects were initiated and the first female chairperson, Dame Beryl Beaurepaire, was appointed to the memorial's council. At a time of expansion and with some difficulty, Arthur balanced the competing interests of memory, exhibition and learning at the War Memorial—always conscious of CEW Bean's vision of the memorial as a monument that commemorates through understanding. 


As a minister, his concern for equity and justice and belief in the government's role in providing support for those in our society who needed it showed through the recognition of the role of Indigenous Australians who patrolled the northern coastline of Australia in the Second World War; his strong support for the Vietnam Veterans Association, including instigating the Agent Orange royal commission; and the introduction of home care services for veterans. 


All the while, Arthur fought many battles within the Labor Party. He spearheaded the drive for federal intervention into the New South Wales branch of the party in 1970. Federal intervention had many consequences—one was compulsory power-sharing. Proportional representation ensured that Arthur became one of New South Wales' two representatives on the federal executive; the other was the redoubtable John Ducker. It seemed to me, a young left-party activist at the time, that their internal battles characterised New South Wales Labor in the early 1970s. John Ducker and the New South Wales machine always won the matches at home. Arthur was an away specialist, winning more than his fair share of the tussles at the federal level. The Shortland preselection, which saw a local ballot, then a state council ballot, then another local ballot and finally a federal executive decision, was a great example of Arthur's relentless determination. He backed the locals, the best candidate—Peter Morris—and good process; and it worked.


These were years when Arthur Gietzelt was at the height of his power and influence. His attention to detail was legendary. It was Arthur Gietzelt who rang Jack Ferguson on the morning of the 1973 New South Wales state parliamentary Labor Party leadership ballot between the incumbent, Pat Hills, and challengers Neville Wran and Kevin Stewart. Arthur reminded Jack that, in the event of a tie after the distribution of preferences, the winner would be the candidate who polled the greatest number of primary votes. As a result of Arthur's call, Jack confirmed the count-back practice with the caucus returning officer. Wran polled 18 votes, Hills 17 and Stewart nine. After the distribution of preferences it was Wran 22, Hills 22. The returning officer declared Wran the winner on a count-back of primaries. Arthur's phone call helped make history.


In the 1970s and '80s the steering committee in New South Wales operated with an activist executive which Arthur religiously attended, even as a federal parliamentarian. And in small meetings of a dozen or so around a table, Arthur was at his most effective. He was persuasive, compelling. He was a real force with years of experience, a prodigious memory and a command of detail—but an utter lack of humour. If you disagreed with him, be prepared for a piercing and steely glare and a very long lecture, with his hearing aid buzzing away providing a constant annoying accompaniment. And I was on the receiving end of that steely glare on more than a few occasions. Arthur and I had our disagreements—everyone knows that. Once he made up his mind, he stuck to it—a great strength with opponents within and without the party, but at times a great frustration for his allies. And he was loyal to those he decided to support, not all of whom deserved that loyalty. Never naive about opponents, he could be far too trusting of those who professed their support. He was by no means a good judge of character.


However, despite our occasional disagreements, I could always rely on Arthur's support when I was working in ALP head office. A telephone call from him in those years was an experience. Arthur was convinced that my office telephones were tapped. So he would speak in riddles—incomprehensible to anyone listening in, unfortunately they were also often incomprehensible to me. A conversation would start like this. Arthur would say, 'It's me.' I would say, 'Hello, Arthur.' He would say, 'Don't use my name!' He would go on: 'There's a meeting in the sandwich king's office at 12 o'clock on Friday. I'll let our printer know. Can you tell the sewing lady.' And on and on it went. Roughly translated, this meant that there would be a meeting at Deputy Premier Jack Ferguson's office and we needed to make sure that the then Senator Bruce Childs and the then MLC Delcia Kite joined us.


A sensible phone conversation could become an impossibility. An example. Arthur: 'Make sure you invite the man who spilt tomato sauce on his shirt at the barbecue last Tuesday to our meeting.' I could never conform to such a request given that I had not attended any barbecue, I had no idea who the individual was and Arthur would not use his name. In call after call, Arthur would use pseudonyms, codenames and deliberately ambiguous language to confound those listening in. Of course, he could only hear my answers if I shouted down the line—often, to his dismay, ignoring his anti-surveillance protocol. Because of his deafness I am sure everyone in Sussex Street could hear what I was saying on my end of the phone.


With the sound of his hearing aid so audible, Arthur developed the habit of switching it off when he stood up in the Senate to speak. This solved one problem but, of course, created others. Without his hearing aid, Arthur could not hear interjections—no great loss, but he could not hear anyone at all, including the President or a frustrated party whip giving instructions. Regardless of any call to order, regardless of whoever might be on their feet and speaking at literally the same time after being recognised by the chair, Arthur just kept on speaking.


And that hearing aid caused even more disruption at one ALP federal executive meeting when an electronic background noise could be heard somewhere in the room. Given this happened very soon after the dismissal of the Whitlam government, the immediate suspicion of the attendees was that ASIO had installed a listening device to monitor discussions. There was absolute pandemonium. A frantic but fruitless pursuit ensued, until eventually the culprit was identified: it was a listening device indeed, but not the sort ASIO would use. And after adjustment to Arthur's hearing aid, the meeting reconvened. Ironically, the innocent offender was the one member of the executive most paranoid about bugging devices.


But Arthur's concerns were not entirely unfounded. ASIO's files reveal that he, among others, was a target for surveillance. They suspected him of links to the Communist Party. I do question what civic responsibility ASIO was fulfilling in those years by spying on the Communist Party of Australia or its members, let alone those who had contact with its members.


I can say that Arthur consistently and categorically denied the allegation of CPA membership to me—and I have scant regard for information provided by paid informants who, it is obvious from the records, knew little about the trade union movement and even less about the Australian Labor Party. I reject absolutely the notion that Arthur was an agent of the Soviet Union or less than loyal to Australia. He fought for his nation in war, he served his nation in its parliament, he served his nation in its executive government, and he was privy to no secrets of use to any foreign power.


I do give a great deal of credit to Arthur's record. Whatever speculation some might foster about his political associations, there is absolute proof of his decades of hard work and of his dedication to Labor values and Labor's electoral success. He had an enduring influence on the left and on all of us who value the same principles of democratic decision making and representation and of service to the community, on which Arthur expended so much of his efforts and to which he devoted his life.


Arthur was an inveterate optimist. Whatever the political setback, however thumping the defeat at the hands of the New South Wales Right, he would assure us all that a win was just around the corner. But it never was in the New South Wales ALP, although on the racetrack Arthur was tinny. He loved a punt on a Saturday afternoon and had an uncanny knack for picking long-priced winners. In the early sixties, the first leg of his daily double, Glenhurst Girl, won at 100 to one, and the second leg of his double, Calmness, another roughie, got up. Arthur won 662 pounds and five shillings for an outlay of five bob. In 1979 he did a lot better. For a $6 outlay on a box trifecta, he won $30,000. For Arthur's family it meant a holiday home at Warilla.


The death of Arthur Gietzelt is the end of an era. On behalf of the opposition, I express our very sincere sympathy to Arthur's wife, Dawn, a committed political activist in her own right who stood beside Arthur in so many struggles, and to Arthur's children Lee, Dale, Adam and their families. Their loss is keener than ours, but we will all miss him.

  The government believes that all people are entitled to respect, dignity and legal protection, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender entity. We condemn discrimination on these grounds, particularly violence, intimidation or harassment of LGBTI persons or communities. The Australian government advocates strongly for non-discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, in all fora, including in the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly.


The government respects the independence of the Indian judiciary and the sovereignty of the Indian government. For that reason we cannot support a motion that denigrates the institutions of our friends in democratic India.


The Australian government engages broadly with India in a constructive manner on human rights, including on LGBTI issues. I note calls by Indian members of parliament to introduce legislation to repeal section 377 of the Indian penal code and to decriminalise homosexual acts. The Australian High Commission in New Delhi will continue to monitor the issue closely.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:18):  The loss of Australia's last major motor vehicle producer is a national tragedy. It is an economic and social catastrophe that will be felt for generations. And, of course, all we have seen from the government in response to this suggestion is that there is some bright new day ahead in the future. Like one of those old happy-clappy folk singers from the 1960s, the Prime Minister is out there suggesting that a better day will come sooner or later. There is no plan, no suggestion of a plan and no understanding of the consequences of the government's action.


So we have tens of thousands of high-quality jobs, especially those of blue-collar workers but also those of some of the most creative people working in manufacturing—our scientists, our engineers and our designers—all of whom are now facing the extraordinary anxiety and distress that comes from this kind of situation. We will lose what is now some $700 million that the automotive industry provides by way of its national contribution to our research and development. We will lose an extraordinary array of capabilities in regard to technologies, in skills and in infrastructure. The industry estimates that the death of the automotive industry will slash $7.3 billion from Australia's GDP by 2018; that it will take more than 10 years for the economy to recover and possibly as many as 20 years for manufacturing to recover; and that unemployment levels in the regions most affected will not recover until the end of the 2020s.


So this is a government that has traded-in Australia's automotive industry for a $20 billion welfare bill, and they say they have no regrets. We ought to be shocked at the sheer audacity of this government. In this example of a situation where people are faced with a bleak future, what does this government do? It blames workers; it blames carbon pricing; it blames anyone except the government and its failure to develop an industry policy to meet the needs of Australia.


This is a government that is dominated by those who believe in textbook economics, a textbook view of the way in which the world works. This might be very popular on the north shore of Sydney and in the merchant bankers' suites—bankers, who, of course, enjoy the enormous protections that this government provides to the banking industry—but the government takes the view that we have to turn our back on manufacturing workers.


We of course know the reality. This is a government that, in the last parliament, launched a campaign to slash $500 million from the Automotive Transformation Scheme. It is a decision they had many chances to revisit, but chose not to. This is a government that chose to play chicken with the international automotive industry. They stalled, they delayed, they made snide remarks, they insulted the international investment committees, they bullied General Motors, and they cleared the hurdle which they were seeking: to remove General Motors. I remind senators that on 10 December last year the then Acting Prime Minister, Warren Truss, wrote to General Motors demanding that it make an immediate statement about the future of its Australian plants. That was before the company here had even heard the outcome of the government's much vaunted process around the Productivity Commission. That was before the formal process as to whether or not the government would provide any future support had been concluded. GM's managing director, Mike Devereux, had told the commission on Tuesday of that week that the company had made no decision about its future in Australia and that the company was waiting to hear whether the coalition would offer long-term support. Mr Devereux reminded us then that the cost to Australia of losing the car industry would dwarf the cost to the budget in saving it. We know that Mr Hockey waltzed into the House of Representatives and demanded an answer from General Motors. He got one the next day.


We know the reality of what this government has been about: the ideological obsession of the hard right wing of the Liberal Party, which took the view that there is some legitimate expenditure when it comes to industry assistance—for instance, in oil and gas and in livestock. We actually spend more money on sheep and goats than we do on the automotive industry. But this government took the view that support for the automotive industry was somehow or other immoral. Their unrelenting hostility has produced the result they sought: the destruction of the automotive industry, the destruction of the jobs in the automotive industry and the destruction of the capacity of this country to develop highly advanced, elaborately transformed manufactured goods.


They have tried to present the view that the automotive industry is Old World. They do not recognise that the average car today has some 250 microprocessors on board. Over 30,000 parts have to be delivered on time in exactly the right order, every time. They do not acknowledge the importance of the automotive industry to so many other industries in this country—to steel, to aluminium, to plastics, to electronics, to robotics—all of which have a tremendous impact on other manufacturing industries. They do not acknowledge any of that. All we see from this government is the statement from the Prime Minister on 14 December that there would be no support for Toyota. In fact, we have heard from the Prime Minister the suggestion that there was nothing they could have done. The reality is very different. This government sent a clear, unrelenting message of hostility to Japan, as they did to Detroit. At a time when we know the investment decisions which could have secured billions of dollars worth of new investment, new jobs and new technologies for this country were being made, this government said they were not interested in providing assistance. They have traded on the welfare and the prosperity of tens of thousands of Australian workers. They have shipped offshore the great export industry of this government—they are exporting jobs—because they refuse to acknowledge the economic realities of how decisions are actually made when it comes to investment.


Isn't it ironic that it is the Labor Party that has to make the appeal for international investment in Australia and that it is the hard Right of the Liberal Party that says, 'We're not interested. Unless it is Cadburys or a fishing company in Hobart that is in a marginal seat, we're going to draw a line in the sand and we're going to say that we're not interested in the welfare of Australian workers. We're going to make Australian jobs the biggest export industry of all.'


This is a government that will not face up to the reality that for every dollar invested by the Commonwealth in the automotive industry that industry was spending $20, in Toyota's case, and $35, on the advice of General Motors. Last year alone, $1.5 billion was spent by Toyota on its suppliers across Australia. How are you going to replace that? Where are the jobs going to come from to replace that? Where is the investment? Where are we going to see the economic activity? (Time expired)

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2014-02-11,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (16:28):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance; it is a matter of significant public importance. It is evident from the contribution by Senator Carr that, yes, those on that side have a very different approach to the way the country should run from the approach of we on this side. I acknowledge that up-front.


Senator Carr spent much of his contribution talking about whether there was a plan for industry, a plan for the economy, a plan for jobs in Australia. Yes, we have a plan. We have a plan to create one of the world's most highly productive and highly competitive economies. Australia has a strong economic base. We have a sound future. We have much that we can build upon and grow jobs upon, as we have done through different waves of economic transformation in this country over decades.


That is what we will do, and we will do it by getting the fundamentals right across every stretch and every part of the economy that we possibly can: by making Australia a lower-taxing country, where it is actually more competitive for people to do business; by making Australia a lighter-regulatory country; and by making Australia a country that is attractive in which to invest, whether you are a small business or a large business and whether you are an Australian-owned business or a multinational business.


We will not be adopting what seems to be Senator Carr's command-and-control approach to economic planning. That is the old socialist approach, which is no surprise coming from Senator Carr. What is the surprise though is that his approach, his command-and-control approach to economic planning and to industry planning, seems basically to be, 'We should give more money to foreign multinationals to prop up jobs here.' That seems to be the genesis of Senator Carr's argument. Boil it all down and that is what his industry planning is. That is certainly what it was throughout his time as industry minister. Throughout his time as industry minister, time and time again it was simply, 'Let's just give more money, because that will fix the problem.'


It was too bad if you were a small business who could not get the ear of government; you did not get any more money in those circumstances. It was too bad if you were somebody who was not from one of the previous government's pet, favoured industries—most likely a highly unionised industry of the previous governments—because you would not get any more money. But if you were able to make a lot more noise, if you were one of the favoured industries and if you were a highly unionised industry, then there was every chance that you could manage to get from the Labor government a bit more money that could go back to your shareholders overseas.


That is their approach. Our approach is different. Our approach is fundamentally to ensure Australia is as productive, competitive and efficient as we can possibly be so that this country can compete on the world stage and grow new jobs in the future. How are we going about doing that? Of course, we have laid out some plans already. We laid them out before the election and we are seeking to implement them.


We will grow new jobs, first and foremost, by reducing the tax base that is affecting manufacturing in particular but also a whole range of industries. If the Labor Party would just get out of our way, we could have repealed the carbon tax already. It is a tax that had a $460 million impact on the automotive industry that Senator Carr was just bemoaning. The carbon tax was a $460 million impact imposed upon that industry by the previous government, which we have been seeking to remove. But, no, they would have us leave the tax there, but give money away instead.


We are seeking to scrap the mining tax. We are seeking to restore the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Why? Because that can help drive greater productivity across the Australian economy. By reducing the rorts, the corruption and the type of activities that some of Senator Carr's union mates undertake, we can make sure that we have a far more competitive environment in that sector.


We are going to continue to cut taxes to make Australia a more competitive place to invest. That is why we have promised a 1½ per cent cut to the company tax rate to 28.5 per cent, making Australia—in our region and in the world—a more attractive place in which to invest for all businesses, not just those who get handouts. We have committed to reducing the amount of red tape, green tape, bureaucracy and regulatory hurdles that businesses face, to the tune of $1 billion a year. Shortly, this parliament will sit on dedicated days to consider the repeal and winding back of the legislation and the red tape that strangles business investment all too much.


So we absolutely have a plan. We have a far clearer plan than those who went before us, whose plan was simply a muddled and befuddled approach of launching new packages every couple of years, changing those packages and stripping money from one to give to another. We all remember the Green Car Innovation Fund: it came and it went, it had money and it did not have money. Little wonder that industries were confused about what they were getting!


What industry will get from our government are the lowest taxes we can create, the lightest regulatory touch we can create and the best opportunities for them to invest that we can create. That is what they will get from us. They will get policy certainty and they will get a government that knows in which direction it wants to take the economy. And we will keep going in that direction to make sure we create the best opportunities for job creation into the future.


You would be forgiven—listening to Senator Carr, Mr Shorten and all of those opposite—for thinking that somehow everything was shipshape in the automotive industry on 7 September 2013 when they lost government. You would be forgiven for thinking there were no issues, there had been no problems and that everything was going along swimmingly well. If you listen to them today you hear them say, 'You should have been able to prevent the closure of Toyota. You should have been able to prevent the closure of Holden.'


What about in May last year, when Ford announced their closure? What about that one? Should that have been preventable when it happened under the previous government? What about in 2008, when Mitsubishi closed its doors? Was that preventable, when it, too, happened under the previous government? The truth of the matter is that the rot in the automotive industry set in under the previous government. The critical mass for the industry was lost under the previous government. By the time we came to power, there were just two automotive manufacturers left in this country.


The critical mass had already been undermined. There was already a huge amount of debate about whether it would be possible to sustain just two manufacturers, about the scope of bailouts that would be required to do that, and about the cost and whether it would be worthwhile. During the time of the previous government, we saw the number of cars made locally in Australia, in the period between 2007 and 2013, reduced by one third. We saw a 25 per cent job reduction in that time.


Yet through that same period of time, we saw ever more money being given to the automotive industry. We saw more money being paid to make fewer cars and to sustain fewer jobs. It sounds like something out of Catch-22, where they paid Major Major not to grow alfalfa sprouts. It sounds like an EU subsidy arrangement, where they pay the farmers not to grow something. The arrangement in Australia under the Labor Party was that we kept paying more for automotive industry companies to employ fewer people and make fewer cars. That is no way to grow your economy, because over time you have fewer people employed and, of course, you have ever-mounting debt and tax burden on the rest of the economy. The problem with Labor's approach compared to ours is that the only way you pay those big multinationals is to tax everybody else more. The small businesses who could never get handouts from Labor had to pay more tax so that Labor could give more money away to the big businesses, who were shrinking anyway. It made no sense then and it would make no sense to continue with it now. It would truly be a case of throwing good money after bad. 


That is why we have given a commitment to support the entire Australian economy and to make sure that every Australian business gets a chance to be as competitive as it possibly can. That is why we will be making sure that, as we move forward, we support investment absolutely, in helping those workers, in helping the communities adjust, in making sure the support is there for those in my home state and in Senator Carr's home state, which are particularly affected by the loss of these jobs, so that they can transform. But it has happened before. We have seen significant changes in the Australian economy over the last few decades and, with the policy settings of this government, we will successfully transition to better days again.

"Madigan, Sen John",DLP,2014-02-11,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (16:38):  The demise of Australia's car industry will impact this country, including my home state of Victoria, enormously. We are watching the death throes of manufacturing. As this happens I worry for our workers, for their families and for the small businesses that are part of the automotive supply chain. The impact of the loss of Toyota, which follows closely similar announcements by Holden and Ford, goes beyond the economic. This is not about pie charts and statistics or about GDP and economic theory—the stuff of so many speeches in this place. This issue—the future of manufacturing in my home state of Victoria—is about people. It is about real people, real skills, real jobs. It is about how people will put food on their tables, pay their mortgages and rents and raise their families. It is about how the fallout of failure will change the face of our communities and how those changes may affect the stability and cohesiveness of those communities. 


Our government has failed the people of Victoria and the people of Australia, and what is our future, with an estimated 50,000 jobs in the balance? We only have to look at America to see a snapshot of what we will face if things continue this way. According to a recent report, the number of American workers who are low-wage and low-income earners jumped 94 per cent from 1979 to 2011, reaching 20.9 million workers. That means that one in seven US workers lives in a household whose main source of income is a low-paying job such as working as a retail sales assistant or a fast-food restaurant cashier. For a long time I have been warning of similar likely outcomes in Australia unless our government acts with urgency and with vision. Will thousands more Australian workers and their families be left to barely survive in low-wage, casual jobs—jobs with no certainty, with no sick pay, with no holiday pay and with little or no future? What are the Abbott government's plans for the post-manufacturing Australian economy? Jobs are not simply created or invented out of thin air. It is research and development that will create the jobs of the future. Our manufacturers need encouragement, support and a clear, bipartisan policy approach. They are looking for their government to act in Australia's interests. The great countries of the world manufacture goods; they do not survive simply by digging holes in the ground, by turning their country into a nation of drink waiters or by educating their competitors on how to bury them.


We need our manufacturing research and development industries here in Australia to provide for our future. Simply put, if we keep exporting these industries, we are exporting our future and that of future generations. I call for the government to step up on this issue, to tell us what its plan is for manufacturing in my home state of Victoria and the rest of the country, because I hate to think of the alternative if things are allowed to drift further in the current direction.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (16:42):  I rise to make a contribution to this matter of public importance debate. I listened intently to Senator Birmingham's contribution and I did not get any great sense of empathy for the workers and their families. I wonder what Thomas Playford—that icon of the Liberal Party after which the city of Playford is named—would think if he were to hear that contribution. He was critical in instigating and developing the manufacturing plant in the area.


We on this side get a fair bit of vitriol from Senator Brandis and others about our contribution and who we represent and where we are from. I did take a quick look at Senator Birmingham's personal CV, and I note that he has always been in politics. From university, he went straight into an adviser's job, and that is basically where he has lived his whole life. Knowing that made it a bit easier for me to understand the lack of empathy, the lack of passion, the lack of feeling for his own constituents in South Australia. 


Thousands of workers at Holden are facing an uncertain future. Their families are worried. Their children are going to school concerned about whether or not their fathers have a job. Families have to explain that life goes on: 'We will progress through this.' There was a completely chilling lack of empathy for the thousands of workers in this situation. We in this place are duty-bound to represent our constituents. I was particularly struck by Senator Birmingham's contribution, which was to the effect of, 'Let's wipe the board clean and promise a better future.' There are thousands of workers looking at redundancy, retraining, redeployment and relocation. On top of that, there are thousands of small business people who have depended on that workforce and their aggregate income. That small business might be a barber shop. I did read of a woman who has a business adjacent to the Holden plant which provides wedding dresses. She has now immediately relocated, because, she says, 'There's no money coming into this area and so I'd better get into another suburb.' There are thousands of small business people—if you listen to the other side these people are their constituents—who will be dramatically affected by the spin-offs of these terrible close-downs. The dry economic arguments really do not stack up. 


I keep returning in this debate to the key point of the Allen Consulting Group report: automotive manufacturing in Australia receives around $500 million in government funding each year and for this investment the Australian economy is $21.5 billion larger for having an automotive manufacturing industry. On a per person basis, government assistance to automotive manufacturing is around $18, a very low figure by international standards. Those figures have been read out in the Senate previously. The $21.5 billion return equates to a net positive $934 per person. This government has come in without too many plans. They were an effective and brilliant opposition; they could tear down any policy; they could misrepresent any situation. Now they are in power and they have their hands on the wheel, and the first thing they do is say, 'No.' 


Prior to Christmas, we left this place with the close-down of manufacturing of Holden motor cars. I am probably one of the last people—and certainly the last person in my family—who have never bought anything other than a Holden or a Ford. That loyalty is not shared by my children or my neighbours. I daresay even my wife drives a Mazda. There is nothing wrong with competition, but there is something wrong with just walking away from a very resilient, not heavily subsidised sector of manufacturing, which, as Senator Carr says, is not just about cars. It is about technology; it is about microchips; it is about plastics; it is about glass; it is about engines that are brilliant—engines that have emission standards—and braking systems which are top of the range. 


The simple wipe-the-slate-clean approach of Senator Birmingham is to say, 'That's all done, we're not going to make cars here anymore. We'll just get them from overseas.' Let's think about that. We know there are very cheap cars made in India, but most recent studies say that, if you drove one and had a collision, you would not survive too well. We know that the Great Wall brand from China performs abysmally in terms of safety ratings. We know from personal experience and from independent agencies that we make a very good car—we make a startlingly good car. I personally drive a Ford, which I think is the equivalent of a BMW, but it is only about a quarter of the price. We know that, but we also know that what has really driven this position in the automotive manufacturing industry is the high dollar. We were exporting our Camaros to America when the dollar was at a much lower level; we were exporting cars to the Middle East when the dollar was at a lower level. Nothing has changed in respect of the technology or in respect of the quality of the cars produced. I daresay not a lot has changed in relation to industrial relations or the efficiencies of the manufacturing plants other than that they have endorsed change, accepted change, employed more robotics and become very much more efficient.


Today, there has been a disparaging of the union movement in this place. I would like to place on the record that the secretary of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union in South Australia, John Camillo, has been driven all of his working life about employment for his members. And that has meant doing all sorts of things with every manufacturer he has come in contact with to save this industry. It is in his DNA; it is in his lifeblood. Building cars is something Australia was always going to do. Talking to John over Christmas was very disheartening. 


I refer to Senator Birmingham's chilling economic view of wiping the board clean and creating a brand-new future. I did not hear in his short speech—maybe he will inform us later on—where these people are going to go. When will these people transition into this brand-new world that this government is going to create? Has he been out and spoken to people about their opportunities? I do not think so; I am not aware that he has been out to speak to people about it. There are many people who would be very grateful if he were to paint the same picture he has tried to paint here today—that the government is going to transition the economy into good jobs, more jobs, whatever.


Unfortunately, without manufacturing in this country we will not have R&D. This is a government without a science minister. We know that the R&D, which comes out of things like the automotive manufacturing industry, is a vast asset to the general economy of Australia. No workforce is static. There is, I think, a photographer in this place who did his apprenticeship at Holden in Elizabeth. He worked in the industry and he went on to take his skills into a different sphere. That is quite normal, but training people to a high standard and then having them take their skills into other sectors of the economy will be completely lost. Let me talk about the warehouse on the road. There are thousands of transport workers and operators currently carrying, exactly on time, every component that goes into a car. There is no great warehouse where these components are stocked; the warehouse is actually on the road—off the ship, on the road, out of the warehouse. What happens to all those people? They will probably start taking things off the wharf, but they will not be transporting components. It will be a much smaller task to transfer any number of cars off a ship to any place in Australia. But the components industry does not work that way. You have V8 motors rolling down the highway on a truck to go to an assembly line. All of that is going to disappear. If you throw in the fundamental offshoots to other sectors of the economy—like coffee shops and other small businesses like coffee shops—then it is really a disaster.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2014-02-11,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) (16:52):  I commence my contribution today with a thought for the families who yesterday got the bad news from Toyota about their jobs. As I have mentioned before in this place, I have had personal experience of similar bad news in my family, and I do not think—despite the implications of some of those opposite—that there is a single person in this place who does not feel for people who have to go home and tell their families about the news they got yesterday at Toyota or last year at Holden or before that at Ford—or, might I add, before that at Mitsubishi; or before that at Nissan in Dandenong in the early 1990s; or at International Trucks; or at the Ford plant which used to be in the western suburbs of Sydney; or at the Leyland and Valiant plants which used to be in Melbourne. We always feel for those people.


We are hearing from a Labor Party which I do not recognise as the same one that existed in my youth. As the former Prime Minister John Howard outlined, the process of ending protection and exposing Australia to the global economy—the economic liberalisation which has seen Australia become, if not a perfect economy, an economy which has withstood more shocks than any comparable economy around the world—in many ways started while the Labor Party were in office in the 1980s. The arguments which I have heard put here by Senator Carr and by Senator Gallacher are the very arguments which were completely dismissed, demolished, attacked and repudiated by people such as Bob Hawke and Paul Keating during their terms in government. It shows you how far the modern-day Labor Party have come that they put forward arguments in this place which many of them would remember were repudiated in the course of their own time in parliament or as active members of the Labor Party.


In spite of all the attempts at partisanship and crocodile tears opposite, let us look at Labor's record. In the last two years, as they chopped and changed, Labor broke promises worth nearly $1.5 billion in funding for car industry policies. That is a record unbeaten even by the previous, chaotic government. Senator Kim Carr in his book criticised the government of which he was a member, when he was a minister, for cutting the Green Car Innovation Fund. He wrote:


Unfortunately the Green Car Innovation Fund was abolished, leaving international company executives wondering just what they had to do to get a consistent government policy commitment in Australia.


That statement did not come from someone on this side; it came from the person who was the Labor minister concerned and who opened the debate on this matter of public importance. Two years ago Prime Minister Gillard announced $34 million in funding for Ford and said that it would create 300 new jobs. Yet 330 people lost their jobs eight months later—so it was just a cash handover. In March 2012, Prime Minister Gillard announced $215 million in funding for Holden and, with Premier Weatherill of South Australia, said the funding would 'secure Holden's future in Australia until 2022.' This was either incompetence or an intentional fabrication, because the evidence says otherwise.


Now we get to the bigger issue: the accusation by Senator Carr that somehow the loss of jobs at Toyota is the result of an ideological crusade by the government. I am going to quote the father, in many ways, of the liberalisation agenda which has seen Australia have such a strong economy. Bert Kelly, the former member for Wakefield, was accused of being an ideologue. But, when he was arguing against things such as tariffs, he said:


I do not dread government intervention . . . for ideological reasons. It is just because they are such messers.


Labor's history in the industrial portfolio illustrates the truth of this statement. They handed over cheque after cheque and all the while made not a whit of difference to prevent the downsizing of automotive companies in Australia. What Senator Carr will not reveal to the Senate and the Australian people is the limit for the Labor Party. At what point will they stop writing cheques? How much will the Labor Party contribute? How much will they hand over to other companies to protect a smaller number of jobs than were lost at Toyota? Their record is of abject failure.


It is time to say, despite the phrase 'co-investment' having come into common use through various people seeking government money and through the Greens and the Labor Party over the last few years, that there is no such thing as co-investment. If the taxpayer puts money into a corporation, they do not get a dividend, a say in running the company, the ability to turn up to the AGM, or a vote on the remuneration report of the directors. There is no such thing as co-investment; it is a subsidy. Call it what it is and have the courage to mount the argument for it. We do subsidise some things in this country, but we do it on the honest terms of saying, 'This is an activity worth subsidising,' either for social reasons or, more rarely, for economic reasons. The term 'co-investment' for certain kinds of funding is being used by certain people who want to hide the fact that such funding amounts to subsidies for corporate operations.


We heard this afternoon in question time from the Greens, the party which bleats about corporate welfare and which, in our local governments and in the states, does everything it can to stop people using cars—including in the area where I live—by advocating things such as higher car taxes and congestion charges, all of which make the use of private motor vehicles harder. Yet they come in here and criticise the government for defending the taxpayer. Every cent that was available to the car industry six months ago is available now, but what is not being revealed by those opposite—and this was examined in detail in estimates—is that the accounting measure for the ATS and the $500 million mentioned by Senator Kim Carr was funding for future years, which was not being used because the volumes of car manufacturers had fallen so far. In other words, the ATS is partly a volume-based program. The same amount of money was available to GM and Ford this week as there was in December and as there was in July. 


This government is trying to remove barriers to manufacturing—those costs imposed by those opposite, in concert with their Greens allies, that make manufacturing in Australia more expensive. Why on earth, no matter how marginal the cost, would we impose an internal energy tariff—the carbon tax—on every manufacturer in Australia? What it goes to show is that those opposite have absolutely no experience in business. In business, it is about the marginal choices you make. It is how you shave margins that is the difference between success and failure. It is how you shave half a per cent off an energy bill. It is how you shave off a tiny bit of the cost of complying with one of the new regulations brought in by the Labor Party and the Greens—such as the national OH&S laws, which made it harder for every smaller manufacturer around the country. 


But the Labor Party do not understand that. They say, 'Oh, it is insignificant.' That betrays their complete lack of experience in running a business and employing people. Everyone who has been involved with or worked in a small business where you get to know your boss, on a farm or in any other form of small enterprise, knows that it is the marginal decisions that make the difference between success and failure. Those opposite do not understand that and that is why they do not care.


I also want to highlight the numbers being used by those opposite. We have heard them time and time again. I turn first to the comparison between the level of subsidy to the motor manufacturing industry in Australia and the level of subsidy in other countries. This idea that Australia has the lowest level of subsidy—because Labor are measuring it on a per capita basis—is a farce. According to the measure used by those opposite, if Australia took the current amount of subsidy and produced only one car with it, we would still have the lowest level of subsidy in the world for car manufacturing—because you are measuring per head of population. I will repeat that. The Labor Party are measuring the level of subsidy based on the number of people in Australia, not the number of cars we produce. Using the Labor Party's measure, the level of subsidy if we only produced one car would be exactly the same as if we produced 100,000 cars. It is a flawed measure and they know it. 


When you compare subsidy levels based on subsidy per unit of car production, we have the highest level of subsidy in the world. What the Labor Party will not tell us is how much higher it needs to be. Instead, we get this empty rhetoric, this venal political campaign that does not respect the sacrifices of those who have already lost their jobs in the decades of restructuring that started under Labor. It is all about politics and an attempt to find a diversion from the other issues which face the Labor Party, particularly their union mates. (Time expired)

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:02): No country is ever successful in the long term … without a really strong and vibrant manufacturing base. It's the foundation of all economic development.


That was said by Alan Mulally, the President and CEO of the Ford Motor Company. We know that just last year, under the Labor government, Ford made the decision to leave Australia. We know that Mitsubishi decided to leave Australia in 2008—also under the former government. That is something the current government is making much of. But, because there are only two remaining manufacturers standing, General Motors Holden and Toyota, there is now a greater duty of care for the government of the day. It is their responsibility to make sure that the industry remains alive—because, if you lose that industry, the consequences will be, according to Richard Reilly, the Chief Executive of the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers, 'devastating' and 'diabolical'.


It is all well and good for the government to say that Mitsubishi and Ford left under the former government's watch, but there is a greater duty of care now—we have to make sure that the supply chain does not collapse. That would cause great harm to the Australian economy. But that is what is happening here. That is why people like Richard Reilly, a good man who as Chief Executive of the Federation of Automotive Product Manufacturers knows firsthand what the impact will be, are speaking out. 


This industry is an ecosystem. It is a big economic ecosystem which employs tens of thousands of Australians. We know that automotive component manufacturers employ something like 40,000 people, most of them in South Australia and Victoria. Those jobs will be lost. In my home state of South Australia, we have really good component manufacturers like ROH, Futuris Automotive Interiors, Multi Slide Industries, Tenneco Australia, TI Automotive, Toyoda Gosei Australia, SMR Automotive, and Precision Components. They have state-of-the-art facilities, but they need to be part of a supply chain. That supply chain will now collapse and that will have a huge impact on our economy. 


Paragraph 4 of Toyota's media release refers to 'increased competition due to current and future free trade agreements'. I was wrong earlier when I asked a question in which I said that a Ford Territory costs about $40,000 here and about $100,000 in Thailand. I apologise. It is actually about $57,000 for the top-of-the-line model here and it costs over $100,000 in Thailand. Why? Because of non-tariff barriers. We have been mugs in the way we have negotiated these free trade agreements. We are causing great damage to our economy. We are laughed at internationally. They talk about us as the 'free trade Taliban' because we take such a literalist, purist approach to free trade—to the detriment of jobs in this country.


Let us talk about some of the cost inputs. I think Senator Abetz was right to talk about intervening in the dispute between Toyota and the union, because I think there should have been a bit more flexibility to allow the workers to have a say. But to blame unions and the workers, when you consider that labour costs only make up about 10 to 16 per cent of the cost of a vehicle, is really stretching it. Maybe there is scope for flexibility, but it would not have made much difference. What would have made a difference is the government committing to the co-investment. It might have cost an extra $500 million, but I suggest that this government will be forking out a hell of a lot more than that in welfare benefits to the many thousands of Australians who will lose their jobs and will not be able to get a new one. This is very serious stuff. Let us talk about the carbon tax. Let us get rid of it—but let us also achieve lower electricity costs by making sure that the electricity industry is not inefficient. These are important issues.


I want to conclude with an observation. From the mid-1990s, for almost a decade, John Howard had the so-called 'Howard battlers' behind him—hundreds of thousands of people who, up until then, had been Labor voters but who voted for John Howard because they felt that he was making good decisions. They felt safe with his economic management. I suggest that, as a result of what we have seen today and other decisions this government has made, those Howard battlers will turn into people who will battle against the Abbott government.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:07):  I thank Senator Xenophon for raising the critical issue of the government's duty of care. Senator Birmingham has come back into the chamber, and I listened to Senator Gallacher earlier, and the suggestion is that we can wipe the slate clean now—it is a new order and a new age, or, if you pick up Mr Hockey's comments, the age of entitlement is over. They completely neglect the government's duty of care. Immeasurable irresponsibility has been demonstrated in the way the Australian government has been dealing with industry policy not only in the automotive area but also in food processing. We continue to ask: where is there any consideration of the national interest? 


Putting aside some of the cheaper rhetoric in Senator Ryan's speech, his contribution highlighted for me the debate that must be going on in the Liberal-Nationals coalition at the moment. Senator Ryan says we should call it a subsidy. I do not care whether you call it co-investment or subsidy; the point is that the government determines in the national interest to invest in activities that support the economy. I understand that in the Liberal Party there are some who think that there should be no government role at all. That debate is occurring in the coalition at the moment. The victims of that debate are starkly evident. As Senator Xenophon just pointed out, the situation while this government tries to sort out what its industry policy should be is diabolical. 


Let us consider a few of the facts. For every one dollar of government support, Toyota currently spends at least $20 in its Australian manufacturing operations. That will go. Fifty thousand direct Australian jobs in the automotive industry will be lost because of this announcement and, as others have highlighted—Senator Gallacher particularly—200,000 jobs which rely indirectly on the automotive industry will also be lost. The impact on our economy of this government's approach to the automotive industry—and this is without thinking about food processing as well—is diabolical.




Senator Xenophon:
  The road to recession.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Indeed, they are on the road to recession. The approach to economic management being exhibited is completely irresponsible. We talk about co-investment or, to pick up Senator Ryan's comments, subsidy, because that is what governments around the world do—they compare the benefits of supporting one industry or another with the impact on the economy overall of losing that activity. Jobs, manufacturing, research and development and a skilled labour force all contribute to a vibrant and healthy economy. It is difficult to believe that Australia will be any better off without an automotive industry. I have been in industry policy debates involving coalition colleagues in years gone by, and we have talked about the benefits of maintaining an automotive industry—the importance for skilling and defence, for instance. I have mentioned food processing. We need to contemplate food security issues as well. 


This government, Mr Hockey and Senator Cormann have failed to offer any cogent explanation for why they are deciding to intervene in one case and not another. The suggestion that it is Coca-Cola Amatil as opposed to Cadbury or a small seafood operator in Tasmania simply does not cut the mustard. This government needs a cogent industry policy. It does not have one at the moment. All we hear is glib rhetoric—let's blame the workers, let's blame the workers' conditions, let's suggest that these workers do not have a right to expect a job that pays somewhere around $50,000 or $60,000 a year, let's suggest that there is something wrong with the workers in these cases, as opposed to addressing the need for a cogent industry policy.


We have heard Mr Abbott make incorrect references to enterprise agreements and, as I mentioned before, Mr Hockey has said that the age of entitlement is over. I do not know any Australians who really do think that they are in the age of entitlement but to suggest that workers do not deserve good jobs is rubbish. (Time expired)

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (17:12):  It certainly is rubbish to suggest that workers do not deserve good jobs but unfortunately you do not get good jobs in bad industries that are not going to survive or can only survive while being propped up by the government. I would have thought an unsustainable job was worse than no job at all. This government is very concerned about doing what it can to assist workers who, over the next three years, will lose their jobs in the automotive industry and in the downstream areas of the automotive industry. However, it is laughable for the opposition to suggest that this is our fault or our problem. As they so often illogically do—and it is cruel to the workers who they allege they represent—they are misrepresenting the truth and misrepresenting the real situation. Under Labor, the last government this country had, one manufacturing job was lost every 19 minutes. 


I would like to refer to a couple of examples of the previous government's automotive industry policy. In 2012, Ms Gillard announced that the government would give $34 million to Ford, saying that it would create 300 new jobs. Within eight months, 330 employees had lost their jobs at Ford. Ms Gillard announced a $215 million assistance package for Holden, saying that that would secure its future in Australia until 2022. Last time I checked, we were not up to 2022. Yet, within six months of Ms Gillard's announcement, 670 jobs were gone. Then, of course, part of their brilliant industry policy strategy was to hit the car industry with a $1.8 billion fringe benefits tax slug, just when it looked as though the industry might actually take advantage of some of the money that the then government had thrown at them. There was no logical reason to do that. There is no logical reason to do anything other than what this government is doing to maintain and build manufacturing in Australia. We are going to improve the manufacturing industry across the board in Australia, not just for the big firms that happen to have senior union reps who can go a-whining to the opposition. We are going to do it by getting taxes down, getting rid of rid of regulation and getting productivity up.


Twenty years ago, I could have stood here and said, 'I, as a national manufacturer …' I cannot say that anymore because our family business, which is almost 90 years old, is now a manufacturer, importer and distributor. The reasons that we had to go down that path are exactly the same reasons that industry is hurting right across the board in Australia: you have to adapt, change and learn to function within the environment you have, not listen to the untruths and exaggerated nonsense from the opposition suggesting that somehow the car industry could have been maintained as it was. It could not be maintained as it was. That is very, very basic. You just have to look at some of the figures that come from the Productivity Commission, for example. In June 2012, the effective assistance rate was about four per cent for manufacturing and about three per cent for agriculture; but, for motor vehicles, it was nine per cent—an effective assistance rate of nine per cent, an unsustainable rate that was going up, not down, under the stewardship of the people who allegedly care about jobs. Those jobs could not continue to exist. Sustainability does not exist in an industry where the government help rate is nine per cent.


We will make a sustainable industry possible. We will assist the firms to have a broad-based economic approach through good regulatory reform and by getting rid of some of the impediments to workplace flexibility. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,17,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:18):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


We are here to discuss the ministerial statement on the conclusion of the free-trade negotiations with the Republic of Korea that the Minister for Trade and Investment made in the other place. Sixty-two days ago, that statement was made. And, 62 days ago, when the minister made the statement, Labor welcomed the progress in the negotiations for a free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea and urged the minister to release the text of the agreement. Well, 62 days later, we are still waiting. In fact, it is 69 days since the Prime Minister stood on the floor of the House of Representatives and told the Australian people that the agreement had been 'successfully concluded'. But, 69 days after the Prime Minister made that statement, we still have not seen the text.


Labor do recognise that reducing barriers to trade can boost economic growth and create Australian jobs, and negotiations on a bilateral agreement with the Republic of Korea were initiated by our government in 2009. In government we also focused on the opportunities and the challenges of this the Asian century and acted to deepen and enrich our relationships in the region, including through trade. The Republic of Korea is our third-largest export market, and a bilateral trade agreement presents significant opportunities for Australian exporters and Australian workers. We welcome the opportunities an agreement could present for our exporters in both goods and services, and note in particular the potential gains for beef producers.


The fact is an agreement will present challenges for a number of our industry sectors, including the textile, clothing and footwear sector, the steel sector and the automotive sector. As senators would know, sadly, prior to the minister's statement in the House, Holden announced it would cease its manufacturing operations in Australia; and, sadly, yesterday Toyota also announced its intention to cease manufacturing in Australia. Toyota's announcement made reference to the impact of free trade agreements. In Labor's view, the full impact of the agreement with Korea on our auto sector will need to be carefully assessed. Unfortunately, despite the passage of 62 days since this statement was first tabled in the other place, we cannot make that assessment, nor can the Australian people, because the government has still not released the text of the agreement.


Today, in question time, the Leader of the Government in the Senate made reference to the potential benefits for automotive component manufacturers, but no-one can make a judgement about the claims he made because the terms of the agreement remain secret. Australians do not know the detail of what has been agreed by its government, our government, in relation to the auto sector. What we do know is that this is the same government that has taken $500 million support from the auto industry between now and 2015, and that this is the same government whose ministers publicly goaded Holden to leave—the same ministers who have sat on their hands whilst Toyota reached the same decision. The tens of thousands of workers in the auto industry and its suppliers simply cannot trust this Prime Minister or this Liberal Party. They do not care about industry and they do not appear to care whatsoever about Australian jobs. The reality is that this Prime Minister has not lifted a finger to save Australian jobs or to find ways to create new opportunities. He has become part of the problem rather than part of the solution.


In the minister's statement, he noted the government's decision to agree to an investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS, mechanism. Labor has grave reservations about the inclusion of ISDS mechanisms in this and other bilateral trade agreements. These mechanisms give foreign corporations the right to take action against our governments when they make public-interest decisions that adversely affect their commercial interests. Australian taxpayers, for example, are already footing the bill for such a challenge launched by Philip Morris Asia against our world-leading plain packaging laws. We are told by the minister that ISDS mechanisms in the Korean agreement and other agreements will include so-called safeguards—but without any public discussion or scrutiny of these safeguards. In fact, 62 days ago the minister did not outline the so-called safeguards in the proposed ISDS provisions in the Korean free trade agreement, and he has not subsequently done so. 


In a newspaper piece published earlier this week, the minister attacked critics of the government's trade policy as 'peddlers of misinformation'. Instead of attacking those who question him, the minister should recognise legitimate concern in this parliament and in the community about the impact of ISDS mechanisms. Australians are entitled to ask what these provisions would mean for our environmental standards, labour laws, copyright and the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme, amongst others. It is time for the minister to start explaining his decisions.


Before anyone accepts the proposition that bilateral trade agreements without an ISDS cannot be negotiated, they should reflect on the Howard government's negotiation of an agreement with the United States and the more recent negotiation with Malaysia by the former Labor government, both of which did not include such provisions. Labor's position is that the outcome of any negotiation should be assessed against the national interest, and of course Australia's interest must never be traded way. 


So I again renew Labor's call for the release of the full text of the negotiated agreement, including the ISDS mechanism, so that the parliament and the Australian community can assess its potential benefits and, if applicable, its detriments. If the government believes this is a good deal then the government would not be frightened of releasing it to the Australian people and to the parliament. Last year the Senate ordered the release of both bilateral and plurilateral trade agreements before signing. Not only has the government not tabled the text of the agreement with Korea; it has indicated it will not comply with the audit in relation to this agreement or any other agreement. I would urge the government and the minister to reconsider their position. 


A week before, the minister delivered this statement to the House. As I said, the Prime Minister said that the minister had 'successfully concluded negotiations for a free trade agreement between Australia and the Republic of Korea'. The minister's statement indicates that he had 'substantially concluded negotiations'. Last December, the minister did not explain what, if any, stumbling blocks remained, and the somewhat stale statement before the chamber shines no additional light on this matter. The fact is that we have a shroud of secrecy in relation to these trade negotiations, and what that has done is emboldened opponents of trade liberalisation. Transparency should be one of the pillars of trade policy. It informs debate; it builds understanding; and, therefore, it leads to better outcomes. The minister should recognise this truth before he does further damage to community support for a more open and engaged economy. Labor look forward to examining the terms of the proposed agreement with Korea, and we will assess it carefully to ensure it is in the national interest.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2014-02-11,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:25):  We have heard significant debate and rhetoric today about the unfortunate decision taken by Toyota yesterday. Some economists are already talking about a recession in Victoria in 2017, following the simultaneous shutdown of both Ford and Toyota. I certainly hope it does not come to that—and we have all got a lot of work ahead of us to prevent it. 


I want to focus on the free trade aspect of the decision announced by Toyota yesterday. I quote directly from their media release: 


… with one of the most open and fragmented automotive markets in the world and increased competitiveness due to current and future  free trade agreements, it is not viable to continue building cars in Australia.


The topic of free trade is very seldom debated; it is very seldom in the public realm. Certainly, it does not seem to be a popular topic for the media either. There is this implicit assumption that somehow free trade deals are always good for us, in whatever country we live. I would like to spend some time debunking that notion, but unfortunately I do not have enough time today. However, I want to talk specifically about why we can use this as an opportunity to have a bigger national discussion on free trade deals and how we need to prevent this sort of thing from occurring in the future. 


In previous years, we have heard Mitsubishi, Holden and Ford talk about the impacts of free trade deals. They have been vocal, for example, on the unilateral deal that we did with Thailand, where we pushed agricultural product at the expense of their industries. Whether you believe it or not, that is the rhetoric that has been coming out of the car industry. Minister Robb had an op-ed in the Australian newspaper yesterday in which he exhorted the benefits of trade agreements. He said that free trade agreements 'can deliver truly enormous gains for Australia'. This is a similar to Labor's view. There is no doubt that trade agreements can deliver jobs, investment and wealth, but they can also have negative impacts on industries. There is actually a logic inherent in trade agreements that is often overlooked. 


There are always trade-offs inherent in trade agreements. Negotiation, by definition, means trade-offs. Free trade has winners and losers. Who picks those winners and who picks those losers is the crucial question here: negotiators in secret deals behind closed doors? What is the logical extension of those negotiations? Who feeds the information to our very good DFAT negotiators who have been in secret trade talks on the TPP or on the Korean free trade deal for three or four years? 


The way I see the world working, especially during my short period of time in the Senate, is that it tends to be those special interest groups who get into your office and push their agendas. This is how the world has always worked. Free trade agreements are the ultimate feast for friends with special interests. For example, I had some very fine gentlemen from the meat and livestock industry in my office recently. We were discussing free trade deals to enhance their export overseas. They said, 'Why have you got an issue with the TPP?' I listed whole areas of public interest which the Greens have particular issues with—for instance: health regulations; the PBS being under threat and how new patent provisions can cause the price of pharmaceuticals to rise; and freedoms being curbed by draconian copyright provisions et cetera. These are general matters of public interest. One of the gentlemen shrugged his shoulders a little bit nervously and said, 'Well, I don't know anything about that; I'm here to sell more beef.' 


That is fine. He is doing a good job representing the people that he has come to parliament on behalf of. But the point is that there are much broader areas of public interest that impact under free trade deals—and, once again, that is something we do not ever seem to have a discussion on. It is not just me and a few people out there in civil society who are saying this. Treasury and the Productivity Commission also agree with this proposition. Treasury, in their incoming government brief in 2010, stated:


Current approaches to preferential trade agreements, FTAs, are not meeting Australia's needs. The proliferation of FTAs has not built support for multilateral liberalisation and is delivering only modest preferential market access outcomes at the cost of reduced government policy reform flexibility.


In 2010 the Productivity Commission also released a report into bilateral and regional trade agreements. In that report they recommended that the Australian government should 'improve the scrutiny of the potential impacts of prospective trade agreements and opportunities to reduce barriers to trade and investment more generally. It should commission and publish an independent and transparent assessment of the final text of the agreement at the conclusion of negotiations but before an agreement is signed.' That is exactly in line with the order for the production of documents that the Greens and Labor pushed through the Senate earlier this year to compel the government to provide a draft text to the public for scrutiny prior to this going to parliament and prior to it being signed by cabinet—before the issue becomes political, before the government give it their stamp of approval.


I understand that a big, complex trade deal that covers 29 chapters and just about every aspect of economy, our community life and our environment is going to take a long time to negotiate. But if that is the logic for doing it in secret—and I do not believe it is justification—then at least release it and make it available for public scrutiny prior to it being signed by cabinet.


So, two premier economic advisory institutions have both expressed strong reservations about the trade path Australian governments are going down—and this includes Labor prior to the current Liberal government. Despite this advice, and concerns expressed by civil society, it is clear from the behaviour of successive governments that they are uncomfortable with the notion of transparency in trade agreements.


Without transparency the Australian people have no insights into the trade-offs inherent in these types of agreements. For example, lack of transparency allowed the Howard government, when negotiating the Australia-US free trade agreement, to extend drug patents, meaning 70 per cent of the drug patents expire later in Australia than in other countries. This means more expensive pharmaceuticals and the suppression of Australia's generic drug manufacturing industry. I have met these guys, and that is exactly what they are telling me. There may have been a legitimate reason for this trade-off. However, the government did not have to present its case. So who makes these trade-offs in our name? Who are the decision makers? We will never know the reason we agreed to that provision.


Minister Robb also wrote yesterday that he would not sign up to anything that does not materially advance the national interest. The national interest is a contested concept. That is why there are different political parties in this chamber today. The national interest is a very broad area, and politics and the role of parliament is an ongoing test of national interest. I would expect that Minister Robb's concept of national interest is very different from mine and that of many Australian voters. For example, Minister Robb has made it clear that he supports a free trade deal with Japan, and the necessity of that, over putting pressure on the Japanese government and causing a diplomatic incident in relation to whaling and preventing the slaughter of whales in the Southern Ocean. That is something most Australians feel very strongly about. More than nine in 10 Australians do not want to see Japanese whaling fleets in our Southern Ocean. The Liberal government had a very strong policy, going into the last election, to prevent that from happening by sending a Customs vessel.


It was only this week that Minister Robb went on record and admitted that our priority is a trade deal with Japan and not jeopardising that. That is a matter of public interest to this country that has not been incorporated into looking at the costs and benefits of these agreements. Who can put a value on the death of whales? For people like me, there is no economic value that can justify that. No doubt, people in the agricultural industry will feel differently.


Transparency is very, very important, particularly when free trade deals in their current form cover such a broad area of public interest. We are not just dealing with traditional exports and imports of goods and services like we used to, mostly around agriculture. We are now dealing with investment, the internet, access to generic medicines, and also the ability for a new world order to emerge from these types of deals where corporations have the ability to seize sovereign governments if they believe a decision is not in the spirit of a trade deal or will impact their future profits. To most Australians, that is totally unacceptable. 


The Greens will continue to call for transparency. We call on the government to release not only the text of this agreement, as it has done for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, but also the modelling that outlines the costs and benefits of this trade deal. This is something we negotiated with Labor last year for any future free trade deals—that these costs and benefits had to be assessed upfront. We have been calling for this for months. It is time to release the modelling, as well as the draft text, so that this country can scrutinise it and we can put the public interest on a level with special interests in this country. While I agree that special interests are sometimes in line with public interest, they are not always.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2014-02-11,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (17:36):  I rise to make a few brief comments following the tabling of the statement from Minister Robb. In relation to trade—and I speak as a farmer as much as a minister in this building—there is absolutely no doubt that we have some of the most efficient farmers in the world. I know that Senator McKenzie would back me up on this. Farmers in her state of Victoria and, indeed, right around the country, are continually showing their efficiency, their resilience and their ability to innovate and move forward with the times. I say that notwithstanding the very, very difficult circumstances we are seeing now in terms of the drought that has taken such a significant hold over so many parts of our farming areas across the nation. But one of the things we realise as farmers in this country is that we are an exporting nation. Because, as farmers, we do not have the population they do in the United States, where they are very much a nation of consumption of their agricultural commodities, we have to export, and we recognise that. So we do understand that we need to put in place trading arrangements with other nations that are going to facilitate our agricultural communities and our agricultural businesses.


I certainly do take note of the previous speaker's contribution that the FTA is not in the national interest. I can tell you that the agricultural sector which stands to gain significantly from this free trade agreement does believe it is in the national interest. I will put on record some of those things. The 40 per cent tariff on beef will be eliminated over 15 years, not 18 years, because it was this country that pushed for the same deal as the United States. The 22½ per cent tariff on lamb and sheep meat will go. Tariffs on dairy products ranging from 36 to 176 per cent will be eliminated. And the three per cent tariff on sugar, in a market currently were worth nearly $500 million to Australia, will be eliminated as soon as the FTA comes into effect. The tariffs on wheat, seafood items, wine, chocolate, beer, a range of horticulture, pharmaceuticals, canned fruit—and the list goes on—will all go.


Now, I take it that there are some views around the FTA that may well be somewhat different in nature, as we have seen from the contributions in the chamber. But, if we are going to look to the future, and if we are going to look at where we want agriculture in this nation to be in 30 and 40 and 50 years' time, how do we put in place an environment that allows our farmers to prosper and to be sustainable? We have to look at our trading arrangements with other nations around the world, and that includes putting in place free trade agreements where they are appropriate and where they are of benefit to our agricultural producers. Somebody who does know this probably as well as anybody in the building is my colleague Senator Back, whom I have spent many an hour with on the Senate Standing Committees on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport—which, sadly, I am no longer part of—looking at precisely these types of issues. If we are going to have sustainable farming into the future then we need to have a long-term vision. It is this side of the chamber, it is this coalition government, that has a long-term vision for agriculture in this nation.


Unfortunately, under the previous government we saw very much a disconnect between the government and the agricultural sector in what was needed in terms of that agricultural sector going forward. We need look no further than the live-export debacle, when we saw the knee-jerk reaction from the previous Labor government in banning live exports. That is a singular, most devastating decision for our agricultural farm-producing sector. It was just appalling. We have the opportunity now, with a coalition government, to finally have some long-term vision in where we want to place our agricultural sector in the world and in what decisions need to be made to make that agricultural sector sustainable. In light of that, we actually understand that that forward-thinking needs to contain agreements with other nations around the world that are going to provide that sustainability and that opportunity of access and that return to our farm sector that they so desperately need.


I commend the minister, Mr Robb, for the work that he has done and I also commend the supporting work from others in the coalition that I am sure was behind that to make sure that we have the best trading environment in place for our farmers, who deserve the recognition of this government for what they do for this economy and this nation. For too long our agricultural sector has been ignored. It is about time that they were given the recognition that they deserve for the contribution that they make not only to the social fabric of this nation but to the economy as a whole. It is generation of real wealth. So we, as a government, need to take all the decisions we can to provide them with some sustainability. The agreement around the Korean FTA is certainly an example of that.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:44):  by leave—I rise to take note of Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop's response to a Senate motion regarding the Arctic Sunrise that was agreed by the Senate on 2 December, and I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I remind the Senate: this motion, which was carried, supported the right to freedom of assembly and peaceful protest. It expressed deep concern about Russia's disproportionate charges of hooliganism against two journalists and 28 crew of the Greenpeace vessel Arctic Sunrise. It also urged the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be in continuous direct contact with the Russian government, to urge it to abide by the law of the sea and also to help ensure the release of Colin Russell, Australian citizen. I note that the minister has indicated that she and the government had done everything possible, and I just want to note that I do not believe that that is the case.


I want to first put on the record the gratitude of the Greens, of the Australian community, and of the family—who have said this publicly—for the excellent assistance of the consular staff, who, at all times, supported Colin Russell and did everything they could on the ground. When Mr Russell came home, he again praised the brilliant consular support that he had received. So I am not making comment about people in the consular service; they did a great job.


The point here is: the Prime Minister did not engage, at any level, compared to countries of the other people detained. The Netherlands' Prime Minister held a press conference and initiated action against Russia. The British Prime Minister called President Putin. The French Prime Minister met with the Russian Prime Minister and President. Germany did not even have any of its citizens jailed, and yet its Chancellor still expressed her concern. The best that Australia did is that the minister wrote to the Russian foreign minister. There was no formal meeting with him or any other Russian minister. The highest level reached was a side meeting with the deputy foreign minister. Well, I do not think that is good enough, especially given that, in opposition, the now Prime Minister, then opposition leader, Tony Abbott, criticised the Labor Party with regard to two Australian businessmen who were being held in the Middle East. And when Tony Abbott became Prime Minister he went to the Middle East and had a meeting with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi to secure the release of Mr Joyce and Mr Lee. I think that, at the very least, when he was at APEC the Prime Minister had the opportunity to raise this issue with President Putin, and he did not.


I would urge him now to reflect on that and to act in the case of Peter Greste, who is an Australian journalist now being held in Egypt and will face trial later this month, beginning on 20 February. Again, I want to congratulate the Australian consular officials in Egypt, who are doing a fantastic job. I have been assured by the family that not only have the consular officials been doing everything possible to assist Peter Greste but also here in Australia they have been supporting the family and keeping them informed to the best of their ability to do so.


I particularly want to call on the Prime Minister to do more. I know that Minister Bishop has been in contact with her counterpart in Egypt; I am aware of that. But I think that, given the seriousness of the charges that have now been laid against Mr Greste; given the fact that he is going to face trial, beginning 20 February; and given the global campaign that is now underway—we have had the human rights chief of the United Nations and senior political figures in the US speaking out—it is time that the Australian Prime Minister spoke out on behalf of Peter Greste and took this matter up in the same way that he was prepared to do for two Australian businessmen who were being held in the Middle East.


I understand that, whilst Minister Bishop has said it is not possible for a nation to interfere in criminal proceedings in another country, precisely when Prime Minister Abbott went to see the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, the charges were reversed. So I think that the behaviour of the Prime Minister previously sets a precedent. He has been prepared to intervene personally in the case of Australian citizens, and I would urge him to do so in the case of Peter Greste. There is a global campaign now being run by journalists around the world, by Al Jazeera colleagues. It is well worth noting that this is also about the safety of journalists and a free and fair press. Mr Greste has worked for Reuters, for CNN, for the BBC; he is a well-known, respected journalist accused of very serious crimes. I do not want to see a situation—as occurred previously with Colin Russell—where there is not the level of political engagement that is necessary. That engagement occurred for many other leaders around the world. I would urge that the Australian government, the Prime Minister, now intervene on behalf of Peter Greste.


In relation to Colin Russell, I want to say how pleased I am that he is now home with his family. I think it is important that, again, the right to peaceful protest is reaffirmed, because we are going to see, clearly, with global warming, a fight over the resources of the Arctic, and this was a measure to show the world what response the Russian government would take to nonviolent peaceful protest highlighting the impacts of global warming and of course oil drilling and fossil fuel extraction.


We have to have an ability for the world to be able to express its concern—for other countries, places and people to be able to express their concern. Equally, we need a free and fair press, and that is exactly what Peter Greste was doing in reporting on the situation in Egypt for Al Jazeera. I think all Australians would be horrified to think that he now faces a seven-year jail sentence because he has been charged under article 86 of the Criminal Code. He has been accused of collaborating with the Egyptians by providing them with, money, equipment, information, airing false news and so on. 


It is really important now that a point is made about the Australian Prime Minister's support for freedom of the press. I note that he said at a press conference today that he supports a free media. I am glad to hear that he supports a free media abroad and recognises that detaining journalists who are going about their ordinary business is not conducive to the kind of free media that, in the end, is in the long-term best interests of everyone. 


Having made that observation, I call on the Prime Minister to intervene in the case of Peter Greste as soon as he possibly can, because the charges that Peter Greste now faces are serious. I do believe that they are absolutely unjustified charges. I believe he was doing his job as a journalist and we should support him in what he was doing. As an Australian citizen, we should stand up for him. 


I want to thank all those people who worked and stood up for Colin Russell throughout his ordeal. I also thank the other members on the crew and the journalists on the Arctic Sunrise. I am glad they are now all released. Including Greenpeace, I thank the people who were part of a strong global campaign. Let us get behind the campaign to free Peter Greste. I call on the Prime Minister to now personally intervene. I reiterate my thanks for the consular support that he is receiving and express how much that is appreciated. It was appreciated by Colin Russell's family, and is currently appreciated by Peter Greste's family.

 (Western Australia) (18:03):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the second report of the 44th Parliament of the committee on the examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SMITH:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This second report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in the 44th Parliament sets out the committee's consideration of 12 bills introduced during the period 9 to 12 December 2013, 315 legislative instruments received between 23 November 2013 and 31 January 2014, and six responses to the committee's comments in previous reports. The committee considers that the majority of the bills and instruments it has considered do not give rise to human rights concerns. Some of these bills and instruments do not engage human rights, some engage and promote rights, and some engage and limit rights but are accompanied by statements of compatibility that set out adequate justification for each limitation.


The committee has identified nine bills, 12 legislative instruments and two responses for which it will seek further information before forming a view on compatibility with human rights. The committee has deferred its consideration of three instruments to allow time for consideration of recommendations for review of certain legislative schemes made by the committee in the 43rd Parliament. The committee has identified six instruments that do not appear to raise any human rights concerns but are accompanied by statements of compatibility that do not fully meet the committee's expectations. The committee has written to the relevant ministers in a purely advisory capacity providing guidance on the preparation of statements of compatibility.


In my statement at the tabling of the committee's first report of the 44th Parliament I set out the committee's expectations of statements of compatibility. I emphasised the importance of a statement of compatibility setting out the objective of the legislation and the manner in which human rights are being considered. In framing the legislation to achieve this objective I noted that it is particularly important when in order to achieve a particular objective certain rights are to be limited. I stressed the committee's expectation that the statement of compatibility demonstrate that there is a rational connection between the limitation and the objective and how the limitation is proportionate to that objective. I also stated that the committee expects statements of compatibility to set out the safeguards that will be applied to ensure that any limitations are implemented in the least restrictive form.


Regrettably, the committee notes that some of the statements of compatibility accompanying bills and instruments considered in this second report have fallen short of the committee's expectations. The committee is particularly concerned to note that some statements of compatibility provide assertions with no supporting evidence. The committee wishes to emphasise that it is not enough for a statement of compatibility to merely claim that a measure will contribute to the achievement of a particular objective or that a measure is necessary, reasonable and proportionate.


The committee considers that the sponsor of a bill or instrument bears the onus of demonstrating that this is the case. Where the matter is capable of evaluation in light of empirical evidence, the statement of compatibility should set this evidence out in sufficient detail to facilitate the committee's consideration of the compatibility of the measure with human rights. Where further information is required to determine these questions, the committee will write to the sponsor of the legislation in a spirit of constructive dialogue to request clarification. I commend the report to the Senate.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:07):  by leave—I table a report of parliamentary advisers to Australia’s permanent mission to the United Nations in 2013.




Senator BACK:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


It was my privilege last year to be one of two parliamentary representatives to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and in fact it was particularly advantageous that Australia, in the years 2013 and 2014, is a member of the 15-member Security Council. This of course was a tremendous advantage given the fact that the Australian delegation was able to go into any open or closed meetings of the Security Council.


It is interesting to note that the very first president of the UN Security Council meeting, held in London in 1946, was Australian ambassador the Hon. Norman Makin AO. In 2013 Australia earned universal praise from UN member states during its presidency of the Security Council in the month of September for its leadership following the use of chemical weapons against civilians in Syria on 21 August, and it was only days, in fact, that the Security Council, in concert with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, was able to achieve the consensus of all members of the Security Council, which led to personnel being deployed to Syria within weeks.


The report has eight appendices. It was too voluminous to present the appendices, so they will appear on a website to ensure that they are available for scrutiny.


The fact of Australia being on the Security Council was of particular significance again during the month of September. During our presidency in that time a motion of the Australian delegate ensured that the Security Council passed a resolution dedicated to the limiting of the threat of small arms and light weapons. In the appendices of my report, I speak in greater detail about that.


It is a fact that the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is a key driver of conflict and instability around the world, including in the vast majority of the conflict situations on the council's agenda. Of course it is of significance the fact that women and children in these affected areas are so much the victims of the abuse and illicit use of small arms and light weapons.


Small arms and light weapons are intrinsically linked to terrorism, piracy and transnational crime. They impede peace building efforts and pose threats to civilians, peacekeepers, humanitarian workers and civil society organisations. I would commend people to read through what was the resolution simply because, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher, as you would know, of the 15 members there are five permanent members and it was very pleasing to record that while one or two of the permanent members did not oppose that motion, neither did they actually vote, so that particular motion went through and it was announced by Australia's foreign minister acting in her capacity as president of the Security Council in September last year in New York.


In terms of the General Assembly itself, it was the 68th session of the General Assembly. The General Assembly works through six committees, of which I had the pleasure and privilege of being particularly involved in two. It was an added benefit for me that our United Nations ambassador, the Hon. Gary Quinlan, was tied up in the Security Council because it did actually allow the opportunity to make some statements on Australia's behalf in the General Assembly and in its committees.


Those two committees with which I had the greatest association were the First Committee dealing with disarmament and international security, and the Second Committee dealing with economic and financial matters. Again the report and its appendices deal in some more detail with the discussions and particularly the resolutions of those committees, and I want to briefly outline some if I may.


In the First Committee those in which Australia particularly had input related to the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in the region of the Middle East; the implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction; the Arms Trade Treaty; assistance to states for curbing the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons, of which I have already spoken; and a Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction. There are several more that would also be of interest.


In the Second Committee, again the attention of this committee was directed to challenges of economic growth and development, including international trade, financing for development, debt sustainability, eradicating poverty in least developed countries—LDCs—and small island developing states, and of course in developing countries themselves. I have included in my report some of the key resolutions of the Second Committee, which went to the United Nations General Assembly for approval in December 2013, and I list in my report some 12 of those key recommendations that went forward for acceptance: dealing with external debt sustainability and development and international strategy for disaster reduction; human resources development; international financial system development and commodities; the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.


And I now refer to the influence of this committee and its resolutions in the field of agriculture and its related areas: the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty; agricultural development, food security and nutrition; the indication of a World Soil Day in December this year and the International Year of Soils in 2015; the fact of 2014 being the Year of the Family Farmer—and I was pleased to make a contribution when the FAO announced in early December last year that this would be the International Year of the Family Farmer—aspects of sustainable agriculture technology; and a range of other areas.


I kept my Western Australian staff very, very busy during my time. I reflected and reported, again, in the report and its appendices, on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, which had their origins in September 2000 and are due for completion by December 2015. There were eight of them, relating to: eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; universal primary education; promoting gender equality and empowering women in the world; reducing child mortality; improving maternal health; combating HIV-AIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensuring environmental sustainability; and developing a global partnership.


I have presented in the report my summary of where we are, with 22 months to go in achieving them. But what was of significant interest to me was what the Millennium Development Goals in 2000 did not do. The first failure was that, regrettably, perhaps because of the speed of their implementation, there was not much consultation by the providing states with those who would be the recipients. The second failure, I believe, was the fact that the corporate sector was largely left out of the Millennium Development Goals and their achievement. The third—and it has been agreed and understood—was that there was a relative lack of focus on governance as to how we would understand the achievement of those Millennium Development Goals.


Interestingly, given the fact that agriculture is so important in the least developed countries and the developing countries of the world, and given the fact the vast majority of people in low-socioeconomic areas are engaged in agriculture, not one of the Millennium Development Goals actually addressed agriculture. I am pleased to say that the Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, is already pressing on with work beyond 2015, on the post-2015 sustainability goals, and I can assure you that each of those is front and centre.


I have attempted to present my summary of where I believe the Millennium Development Goals have achieved and where I believe they are not achieving. I thought I would draw a line in the sand for people who are interested as to where we would go. I also spent time—annoying my staff intensely—on trying to come to an understanding of the whole question of financial support and the receipt of financial support within the UN. There are 193 countries members of the UN. It is little wonder they do not achieve a lot. If you had 193 members of the one family around the Christmas table there would only be arguments. Of that 193, there are 31 developed countries, three advanced economies, 93 developing countries, 30 least developed countries and 36 small island developing states. Again, it is interesting to reflect on those countries which are donors—we are one of those—those countries which are recipients and the way forward, because we have to address the question of financial support in the future.

BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY (IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY) BILL 2013




Introduction



Today I introduce the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013.


The construction industry provides many jobs for workers in small business, large enterprises and contractors. It is critical to a productive, prosperous and internationally competitive Australia.  The Coalition Government recognises the importance of an industry that is vital to job creation and essential to Australia's economic and social well-being.


This Bill re-establishes the Australian Building and Construction Commission, a genuinely strong watchdog that will maintain the rule of law to protect workers and constructors and improve productivity on building sites and construction projects, whether on-shore or off shore.


This Bill will reverse Labor's changes to the laws which underpinned the Australian Building and Construction Commission before it was abolished in 2012.


The Bill prohibits unlawful industrial action, unlawful picketing, and coercion and discrimination. Penalties that are high enough to provide an effective deterrent will apply to breaches of these provisions. A wide range of effective remedies such as injunctions will also be available to the ABCC and persons affected by unlawful behaviour.




The need for the Australian Building and Construction Commission to be re-established



For many years, the building and construction sector provided the worst examples of industrial relations lawlessness.  Then Workplace Relations Minister in the Howard Government, the Hon. Tony Abbott MHR, was prepared to tackle this long-standing bad behaviour and in 2001 established a Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. The final report of that Royal Commission provided compelling evidence of the need for reform in this industry. It found consistent evidence that building sites and construction projects in Australia were hotbeds of intimidation, lawlessness, thuggery and violence.  Projects were delayed, costs blew out and investment in our economy and infrastructure was being jeopardised.


Central to the Royal Commission's findings was industry lawlessness. It concluded that the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the building and construction industry represented a significant departure from that in the rest of the Australian economy.  Witnesses reported criminal conduct, unlawful and inappropriate conduct, including breaches of the relevant workplace relations and work health and safety legislation and a disregard for Commonwealth and State revenue statutes. Inappropriate conduct was defined by the Royal Commission as ""...behaviour that infringes the Workplace Relations Act 1996, a person's right of choice or other conduct which departs from recognised norms of civility and behaviour"".


The Royal Commission's findings publicly established what everyone in the industry had known about for years, but previous governments had been unwilling or too intimidated to tackle. The Howard Coalition Government was prepared to step in and make the tough decisions required to clean up this sector.  The establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2005 provided a genuinely strong watchdog, dissolving the 1970s style practices that plagued this industry.  It was a strong, specialist regulator that enforced the rule of law applying to the building and construction sector.


While the ABCC existed, the economic and industrial performance of the building and construction industry significantly improved.  For example, a 2013 Independent Economics report on the state of the sector during this period found that:


building and construction industry productivity grew by more than 9 per cent;


consumers were better off by around $7.5 billion annually; and


fewer working days were lost through industrial action.


The former Labor Government came under sustained pressure from building and construction unions to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the Building Code that supported its work.  The Labor Government procrastinated for five years, before then Workplace Relations Minister Bill Shorten gave in to union demands and abolished the organisation in 2012 and replaced it with a regulator with significantly reduced funding and powers.  This saw the 'bad old days' return – wildcat stoppages, militant protests, demands from unions that their mates be employed on projects ahead of non-unionists, and an increase in construction industry disputes to a seven year high.


No one needs reminding of the scenes we saw late last year, merely weeks after the Australian Building and Construction Commission was abolished: violence on the streets in the City of Melbourne, with militant union protestors intimidating the community and their supporters attacking police horses. We had workers on the site purchasing an advertisement in the Herald Sun with an open letter to their own union bosses asking for the blockades to stop.  Images of these protests were seen on television screens around the world.  What message did that send to national and international companies about investing in building and construction projects in Melbourne or Australia?


We saw the CFMEU grossly bullying non-members by creating posters labelling them – amongst various other things—'scabs' and advocating that they be run out of the industry in open defiance of the Fair Work Act and Supreme Court orders to end the protests.


We saw a violent dispute at the Little Creatures Brewery site in Geelong where union picketers were accused in court documents of making throat-cutting gestures, making threats to stomp heads in, workers who wanted to get on with the work being told they were 'dead' and shoving, kicking and punching motor vehicles.


We saw union protestors threatening people with 'Columbian neckties' at City West Water in Werribee, where the dispute was so heated that workers had to be flown in by helicopter.  The term 'Columbian neckties' came from the Columbian Civil War of 1948 and involves slashing a victim's throat horizontally and pulling their tongue out through the open wound.


And just last month, we saw CFMEU officials threaten to stop work on a Lend Lease project in Adelaide if a union flag was not moved to a more prominent position.


The previous government was well aware of this type of behaviour in the building and construction industry and so was understandably reluctant to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission despite strong union pressure. It contracted Justice Murray Wilcox to review the industry to buy time. Justice Wilcox recognised the need for, and the benefit provided by, the Australian Building and Construction Commission, stating in his report that, ""the ABCC's work is not yet done"". And, ""it would be unfortunate"" if the ABCC's replacement body ""led to a reversal of the progress that has been made"".  But that is exactly what we have seen.


The Labor Government set up a severely curtailed version of the ABCC called the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate. As well as having its powers substantially curtailed, it faced significant reductions in funding and staffing of around 30 per cent.  The inspectorate was hampered by quite novel restrictions on its ability to initiate or continue with proceedings if matters the subject of litigation had been settled by the parties.  These amendments were introduced without any prior notice or forewarning by the Leader of the Opposition when he was the responsible Minister. They are equivalent to a person running a red light and causing an accident then Police being unable to charge that person with any offences, including running the red light, if that person has settled with the other person involved in the accident. These provisions are certainly contrary to former Prime Minister Gillard's views, whilst she was the responsible Minister in 2009. At this time she said, in relation to misbehaviour in the building industry, that ""…Each and every breach of the law is wrong and each and every breach of the law should be acted upon.""


These provisions in the Labor Government's legislation were heavily criticised by the Law Council of Australia as giving primacy to the interests of private litigants over the application and enforcement of laws of the Parliament.  The Law Council of Australia urged reconsideration of this provision and the community can be reassured that there is no such provision in the Coalition Government's Bill.




The election commitment



In the Government's Policy to Improve the Fair Work Laws, the Coalition Government committed to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission to once again ensure the rule of law and productivity on commercial building sites and construction projects, whether on-shore or off-shore.


We took this commitment to the 2010 and 2013 federal elections as a key policy.  So important did we see this commitment that we also committed to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission within 100 days of the Parliament first sitting.  This Government was given a clear mandate by the Australian people to make this change.


The Coalition Government is committed to ensuring that the rule of law is maintained and that workers in the building and construction sector can go to work free of intimidation and harassment. As the Cole Royal Commission concluded a decade ago, the behaviour that we too regularly see in this industry marks it as singular. It is an industry in which conventional standards of commercial and industrial behaviour do not apply. Like in the textiles, clothing and footwear sector – special circumstances require special laws.


We also promised that a re-established Australian Building and Construction Commission will administer a code that will govern industrial relations arrangements for Government-funded projects.  This step will ensure that taxpayers' dollars are used efficiently.  We also promised we would work with state governments to ensure consistency with guidelines introduced by those governments who saw the urgent need to set up their own schemes in response to the Gillard Government's abolition of the ABCC.  A new statutory code is being developed that is intended to commence at the same time as the re-established Australian Building and Construction Commission on 1 January 2014.




Description of the Bill



The main object of the Bill is to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building and construction work to ensure that it is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole.


The Bill aims to improve the bargaining framework so as to further encourage genuine bargaining at the workplace level. Enterprise bargaining negotiations must be harmonious, sensible and productive and should be tailored to the particular workplace.


The Bill upholds and promotes respect for the rule of law and ensures respect for the rights of all building industry participants.  The Bill contains provisions to ensure that unlawful action, including unlawful industrial action and unlawful pickets, are dealt with appropriately.  The Bill includes the ability for the courts to impose significant penalties for individuals and organisations that participate in unlawful action.


The Bill provides effective means for investigating and enforcing the law.  The Australian Building and Construction Commissioner will be able to exercise their power to obtain information quickly and effectively without being hindered by unnecessary bureaucratic red tape around the issue of examination notices.  However, to ensure accountability and transparency, the use of these powers will continue to be reviewed and reported on by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.


Importantly, this Bill encourages productivity and the pursuit of high levels of employment in the building and construction industry.  It will ensure that the Government's Policy to deliver the Infrastructure of the 21st Century is delivered on time and on budget.  This Bill will create jobs and investment by ensuring employers and workers in the industry can get on with the job without fear of intimidation.




The definition of building work



The definition of building work in the Bill includes off-site prefabrication of made to order components for parts of buildings, structures or works.  The definition of building work also includes the transporting or supplying of goods to be used in building work.  This is a change from the previous ABCC legislation and is included to ensure that large resource construction projects cannot be indirectly disrupted through coordinated 'go slows' on the supply of materials to those projects.




The extension to the Exclusive Economic Zone and continental shelf



The Bill extends to the exclusive economic zone and waters above the continental shelf.  This extension will bring the legislation into line with the Fair Work Act.




The structure of the ABCC



This Bill will re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission to ensure the rule of law is enforced in the building and construction industry.  The Australian Building and Construction Commission will be led by its Commissioner, who will have the critical task of monitoring, promoting and enforcing appropriate standards of conduct by building industry participants and referring matters to other relevant agencies and bodies as required.


The Australian Building and Construction Commissioner will also be responsible for investigating suspected contraventions of the law by building industry participants. The Commissioner will also institute or intervene in proceedings in accordance with these laws; and, provide assistance and advice to building industry participants on their rights and obligations under designated building laws.


The Australian Building and Construction Commissioner will be supported by Deputy Commissioners, and by a statutory agency, to be known as the Australian Building and Construction Commission, comprising persons engaged under the Public Service Act 1999.  The Australian Building and Construction Commissioner will be the head of that statutory agency. The agency will be properly funded to ensure it can do its work – the funding taken away by the Labor Government will be restored.




Penalties



Changing the lawless culture of the building and construction industry requires strong regulation, a strong regulator and penalty levels that will act as a deterrent to unlawful behaviour.


Higher penalties are justified in an industry that is so critical to Australia's economic performance. Building and construction organisations are well resourced and some show a blatant disregard for court orders and shrug off fines as 'simply part of the cost of doing business.'.




Unlawful action



The Bill makes it clear that unlawful action will not be tolerated and there are significant penalties for taking unlawful industrial action, or for engaging in, or organising, an unlawful picket.  Safeguards are built into the legislation that ensure that the Commissioner is able to separate unlawful and organised picketing aimed at disrupting building and construction work from legitimate protests.


The Bill also reinstates civil remedy provisions in relation to coercion and discrimination and makes it clear that project agreements are unenforceable where the intention is to secure standard employment conditions relating to a particular site or sites covering employees from different enterprises. These types of project agreements inhibit genuine enterprise bargaining.




Coercive powers



The Bill enables the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner to compel witnesses to attend an examination or to produce documents where he/she reasonably believes that the person has information or documents relevant to an investigation into a suspected contravention of workplace relations laws.  These powers are needed to ensure the Australian Building and Construction Commission is able to carry out its investigations effectively and is a key tool for breaking down the historical and unacceptable 'culture of silence' in the sector. These kinds of powers are not novel and are also granted to a range of other Commonwealth regulatory bodies such as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Australian Taxation Office, Centrelink and Medicare.


The Bill does, however, contain appropriate and effective safeguards to ensure due process and transparency in the use of these powers.  The Bill requires the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner to provide the Commonwealth Ombudsman with a report about the examination along with a video recording and transcript of the examination.  At the end of each financial year, the Commonwealth Ombudsman is required to prepare and present to the Parliament, a report about examinations during the year.  This will ensure public transparency and accountability and give the community confidence in the work of the ABCC.




Federal Safety Commissioner and the Australian Government Building and Construction OHS Accreditation Scheme



The Government is committed to using its influence as a funder of large building and construction projects nationally to lead the way on improving work, health and safety standards and culture throughout the building and construction industry.  For this reason, the Bill retains the role of the Federal Safety Commissioner and the Australian Government Building and Construction Industry WHS Accreditation Scheme.




Conclusion



The Coalition Government is committed to doing all that is necessary to reform the building and construction industry and to reinstitute the rule of law in this sector.


The Coalition Government wholeheartedly believes that workers deserve to be able to go to work each day without the fear of being harassed, intimidated or the subject of violence.


The former Labor Government undermined confidence in the building and construction industry.  Abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission has seen a return to lawlessness and an increase in the number of days where work is simply not being done in the industry.


Australia cannot afford to have a building and construction industry which is inefficient and unstable.  The restoration of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the code which supports its work is a critical reform for Australia. The contents of this Bill reflect this commitment.


BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2013


Today I also introduce the Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013.


This Bill deals with consequential and transitional matters relating to the re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and other matters set out in the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013.


This Bill will ensure a smooth transition from the institutions, functions and powers created by the Fair Work Building Industry Act 2012 to the new regime established by the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013. This Bill also deals with residual operation of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 where necessary.

Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:22):  I just want to make a few comments about the Procedure Committee report.


The recommendations in the report include enshrining in standing orders the changes that the Senate has trialled with regard to speaking time limitations on the adjournment on Tuesday nights. I am pleased to say that those changes have been well received by senators, and it is appropriate that standing orders are amended to put those changes in there.


Importantly, the recommendations in the Procedure Committee report also go to the issue of gendered language in the standing orders. The recommendation in the Procedure Committee report is that the standing orders be changed so that gender-specific language is removed from those standing orders. So, for example, where the standing orders refer to a 'chairman', that language will be changed to the word 'chair'. Within the standing orders there are many inconsistencies already with regard to whether language is gender specific or gender neutral, so this recommendation from the Procedure Committee report will ensure not just consistency in the standing orders but gender-neutral language. I am really pleased to say that the Procedure Committee had no disagreement in our deliberations about changing the standing orders to gender-neutral language and, of course, it is about time that we did that.


In closing, I would like to pay tribute to former senator, Trish Crossin, who raised the matter with the President in a letter to him before she departed from the Senate about the inconsistencies in the standing orders and the fact that there was gender-specific language in there. Former Senator Crossin, as we know, always paid a lot of attention to the issue of gender equality, and right to the last minute she was obviously doing that. It is because of her letter to the President, I believe, that these important changes are now going to be made to the standing orders. I look forward to seeing the revised standing orders and the gender-neutral language that will be in there, and which should be in there.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (18:25):  I continue my remarks on the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013 from just prior to question time.


We had a situation where an election was basically run and allegedly won as an adjudication of climate change—whether there is climate change, whether there is global warming and whether the solutions of the previous government were correct, or if the incoming government had the right strategy. A brief look at the incoming government's strategy in respect of climate change was that they would plant more trees—or plant lots of trees—and that they would pay polluters to pollute slowly.


In amongst the incessant negativity that emanated from the other side during the whole term of the Labor government and, increasingly, towards the election timetable, it was 'Climate change, carbon taxes: bad, bad, bad, bad'. Basically, the scientists were not reputable or their views were that of zealots.


It was Senator Whish-Wilson who first raised in this chamber the reinsurance industry. It is really interesting to go and look at not the zealots of the world but the reinsurers of the world. There are probably about 10 reinsurers in the global sense, in a very large way: Munich Re, Swiss Re, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and the Gen Re group, Hannover Re Group, Lloyd's, SCOR, Everest Re Group, PartnerRe, TransRe and ACE Tempest Re Group. These are reinsurers with a global reach, and they all make clear, unequivocal comments. Munich Re has stated:


Climate change is a subject that concerns us all. It is one of the greatest risks facing mankind. In recent years, Munich Re has actively supported and advanced climate protection and adaptation to global warming.


This is a company that since 1973 has had a strategy, not born out of philosophy—although I hesitate to denigrate their motives in any way—but basically born out of experience and practicalities. They reinsure risk.


There have been catastrophic storms in the US and they cost lots of money. They cost billions of dollars. As I said earlier, Swiss Re, representing 722 investors who hold some US$87 trillion worth of assets, is seeking to insure those assets. These are the people who do that, so they are working from years of history, they are working from actuaries, they are working at reducing the carbon footprint and they are working with global companies which understand this problem.


The challenge in this debate is to get over the opposition to representing the best interests of the Australian population and the best interests of future Australians in terms of economic damage and climate change damage, and we do not see any signs of that. Planting more trees and paying polluters to pollute slowly is not a coherent national strategy for dealing with a global position.


I can understand the politics of it. I personally am very challenged at the impact of the carbon price on a lot of sectors in our economy. But what you cannot do is forgo the national interest and pretend to act for one sector only and pull the wool over everyone else's eyes. Basically, the reinsurers of the world, representing billions of dollars worth of reinsurance, believe that climate change is real, that it is happening, and that, unless there are strategies to mitigate global warming, it is going to get much worse.


Any government that goes ahead with a strategy of simply planting more trees and paying polluters to pollute slowly is not in the ballpark. All of the economists and all of the economic advice is that if you want to change behaviour you have to put a price on that behaviour. No economic strategy to pay people to pollute slowly will be effective. It is simply the case that we need to change behaviour, and that is extremely challenging for lots of us on this side of the chamber, too. But the strategy we have at the moment is for more trees and paying people to pollute slowly. It flies against all of the evidence. I urge Mr Abbott and his team to reconsider.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (18:31):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. We are not making a lot of progress, I have to say, because we on this side of the chamber for very good reasons absolutely disagree with the proposition that this authority should be abolished. None of us need to be reminded very much about the fact that, just a month after the government announced its plans to abolish the Climate Change Authority, here in New South Wales—and I know in other states, because we can see what is happening in Victoria and Western Australia—we have experienced some of the worst bushfires in a decade, and our continent remains a tinderbox, having stayed on high alert all summer.


In November, the newly re-formed Climate Council released a landmark report called Be prepared: climate change and the Australian bushfire threat, which highlighted the demonstrable connection between climate change and the duration and severity of Australian bushfires. The reason today's debate is so important is that this government is burning up the means that we had to be prepared. That is the message we are all being given: be prepared.


The independent research we have seen into the impacts of climate change is critical, because it helps us to prepare ourselves. The Prime Minister spent the election campaign reassuring the public that he accepts the science on climate change, so it is pretty frustrating and hard to understand why his government is removing the very authority that will help Australia's community leaders to prepare for the inevitable impacts of hotter summers and prolonged droughts, increases in bushfires and flooding threats and so on.


Minister Hunt says he will be able to seek advice from the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, but to do so diverts these organisations from their primary function: collecting and analysing data and forecasting and warning, in the case of the bureau; and scientific research, in the case of CSIRO. In an article in The Conversationnot too long ago, Monash University professor Neville Nicholls critiqued this arrangement. At the time, in December last year, he wrote:


One might think, however, that having a local agency to collate and assess this information for the Australian government might be more prudent than relying on other organisations, with their various biases. And it is hard to see how the Bureau of Meteorology or CSIRO could fill this role and provide advice on this aspect of climate change—it seems way outside their comfort zone.


Over the summer I have been reminded very clearly that it is not just the federal and state governments that require authoritative advice on our changing climate. We are a nation with 565 local government authorities, which are scrambling to put in place the best infrastructure and economic development plans for their communities. The question needs to be asked: can we really expect local councils to get on the phone to their local weather station and ask for advice on how best to prepare their communities for climate change?


As we well know, the effects of climate change are being particularly felt in regional and rural Australia. I know the minister has had her concerns when experiencing the drought that is significantly impacting in New South Wales at the moment, because her own country has been affected by it. Think about what has been going on down in the Riverina and out west. In March 2012, the Riverina, in Wagga Wagga for example, was devastated by the Murrumbidgee flooding. Then, just a few months later, it was threatened by a series of uncontrolled bushfires. Also, in November just last year farmers in that area experienced freak frosts. That followed the breaking of the decade-long drought, and now we are back into this drought situation again. So, floods, fires, droughts and frosts have all been experienced by one community down in the Wagga Wagga region. That is a good example of the challenges that one local government authority is having to deal with. So where is that council going to go to getting the advice they need on tackling this multitude of climate challenges? We need the Climate Change Authority for those reasons.


We can choose to proactively address climate change, or we can mop up afterwards. That response, which is really encapsulated in this bill to abolish the Climate Change Authority, means that Australia will actually miss out on a whole range of opportunities.


The mayor of Geelong, someone else who has been affected by the recent fires, said not long ago: 'We believe there is considerable scope for Geelong to use its manufacturing capability to share in the growing green technology market.' He said that before we heard the news about the car industry. They will be desperately seeking to capture and engage their manufacturing workforce in the innovation, research and development that will help build their economy for the future. He said at the time that, rather than job losses, there is the potential to expand jobs in the region as demand for green technology increases. So we have local governments and regional development authorities around the country trying to be innovative, trying to diversify their local economies and trying to deal with the real challenges of climate change. Then we have an authoritative research arm of the government being abolished by this legislation. It robs our mayors and business leaders of the advice they need to allow them to lead their communities with confidence. This probably is something that has not really had much attention paid to it.


The Climate Change Authority offers many inconvenient truths to our current government, such as this, which came from the draft report of its Targets and Progress Review: '…it is possible to sustain economic growth while reducing emissions.' That statement is a truth that repudiates the Prime Minister's ideological stance. This report is due to come out at the end of this month. 


As long as the Climate Change Authority exists, the government will not want to receive the report of the Targets and Progress Review, which the authority is legislated to produce and which we are awaiting with interest. It is easy to understand why the government is eager to abolish this organisation and prevent the report from seeing the light of day. That is quite a strong motivation in this abolition bill. The draft report suggests a number of areas where the government's climate policy will be found to be lacking. Much of that evidence is being reiterated in the Senate's inquiry into the direct action plan, which we have been undertaking for the last few months. It is very difficult to find anywhere in any of the submissions evidence that the direct action plan is going to deliver the targets that are being proposed.


The draft report recognises a clear global trend towards more ambitious climate action at the same time that this government has decided to claw back the climate change targets. I quote again from the draft report, which says:


… international action on climate change is strengthening, particularly in some of the world’s largest economies.


Ninety-nine countries, including Australia’s major trading partners and neighbours, and covering over 80 per cent of global emissions and over 90 per cent of the world’s economic output, have 2020 emissions reduction pledges. All of these countries are implementing policies to reduce emissions, including renewable energy targets, emissions trading schemes and vehicle emissions standards.


In particular, the world’s two largest emitters—China and the United States (jointly producing over a third of global emissions)—are stepping up their efforts to reduce emissions. Both countries have emissions reduction targets. China is investing heavily in renewable energy projects, closing inefficient coal power plants and trialling market mechanisms to reduce emissions. President Obama announced an ambitious plan for US action in June 2013, including new restrictions on emissions from coal-fired power plants, strengthened vehicle emission standards and renewable energy activities. These complement state-based market initiatives to reduce emissions.


Despite the trend towards increased climate action, the draft report of the Targets and Progress Review notes that more must be done here in Australia. The international community must increase its emissions reduction targets and Australia cannot step away from that obligation either.


The draft report's critique of the government's present stand gets more pointed. It argues that Australia's five per cent emissions reduction target should be increased for at least three good reasons. The report says:


First, the scale and pace of international action suggests that Australia should be pursuing a stronger target.


…   …   …


Second, 5 per cent is considered an inadequate first step if Australia is to play its part in limiting warming to below 2 degrees.


…   …   …


Third, the Authority considers that moving to a stronger target now could be accommodated at a relatively low cost to the economy, based on modelling of Australia’s economy and emissions outlook.


The draft report notes that since our five per cent target was initially set the efforts required to achieve this target have decreased significantly, so present efforts will guide us in the direction of an 11 per cent reduction by 2020. In light of that, the coalition's determination to retain the target at its five per cent level is paltry, to say the least.


The draft report suggests that we could be doing so much more without too much effort. Should the coalition fail to shut down the Climate Change Authority before the end of February they will have to contend with a Targets and Progress Review that will recommend that Australia's emissions reduction target be increased to either 15 per cent or 25 per cent. The government know that direct action alone will never be able to meet these targets—as does the Climate Change Authority, of course. This sets the government up for perhaps the biggest embarrassment of all, because they will have to acknowledge that Australia needs a carbon-pricing mechanism. There is going to have to be a market mechanism. Direct action, in and of itself, is not going to achieve the kinds of outcomes that this government is pursuing.


Seeing that the abolition of the Climate Change Authority stands to save the government a paltry $1.6 million annually, you really have to ask the question: what is the real saving being made by today's bill? Ordinary Australians might be forgiven for presuming that, in fact, this legislation is about saving face rather than about saving money.


So when you think that Labor actually established the Climate Change Authority to be an authority—an independent body—designed to sit outside of the strictures of party politics, you realise that that is the true reason the coalition are seeking its abolition. They know that as long as this authority exists, their medieval approach to climate policy will be embarrassed. By seeking to abolish the Climate Change Authority, the government is taking a crucial resource from every community in Australia simply to limit their own embarrassment.


But the Australian community itself has demonstrated that it understands how critical the Climate Change Authority will be for our future. It crowd funded $1 million in a little over a week. That was a herculean effort. It is a fundraising effort that now ensures the Climate Council's survival should this bill proceed. That does not make this debate irrelevant. On the contrary, it heightens the yawning chasm between the concerns and the hopes of the Australian people and the obstinacy that is the government's position at the moment.


Coalition members and senators have continually returned to the argument that they have a mandate to deconstruct Australia's Clean Energy Future. Twenty thousand donations to the Climate Commission in just one week show that the Australian people support climate action. It is alive and well in Australia. This is, according to the Climate Commission, actually the biggest crowd-funding campaign in Australia's history.


When we think now about the public polling that is going on we find that the Newspoll figures continually ask the questions about climate change. There are enough figures to refute the Prime Minister's claim that he is acting on popular support. The Australian people believe that we must take action on climate change. Older Australians believe we must take this action for generations in the future, for our farming communities, for our farming industries, for coastal communities, for the Great Barrier Reef and for all the natural resources that we have in our country. To ignore the reality of climate change is a folly that we should not allow this government to get away with.


Then there is more evidence that refutes the existence of the imaginary mandate that this government professes to have. If we go back to the exit polling conducted by the Climate Institute on the election day we find that Tony Abbott's views on carbon pricing and on climate change are:


… sharply at odds with the views of the electorate.


Again, I can quote from some additional exit polling which says:


National exit polling done on behalf of the Climate Institute showed that voters' primary concern was for the economy and jobs (31 per cent) …


I think voters everywhere would be very concerned by what has happened in the last week about jobs and the economy the polling continues:


… with climate change (5 per cent) and carbon tax (3 per cent) significantly lower. Even among Coalition voters only 3 per cent listed the carbon tax as a top issue.


So the coalition has an obstinate attitude to climate action and its opposition has been incessant for the past six years.



Hansard shows that 'carbon tax' is the most overused term by coalition members and senators, having been spoken more than 14,000 times in the last parliament between 2007 and 2014. Their strategy was to repeat something often enough for it to be believed. I feel that perhaps the only people who believe this are the coalition members themselves. The only Australians who are actually convinced by all of that repetition are those attempting to pass today's bill. This is a bill that does not deserve to be passed. It is not deserve the support of Labor and the opposition. We will not be supporting the bill.

None of us need to be reminded very much about the fact that, just a month after the government announced its plans to abolish the Climate Change Authority, here in New South Wales—and I know in other states, because we can see what is happening in Victoria and Western Australia—we have experienced some of the worst bushfires in a decade, and our continent remains a tinderbox, having stayed on high alert all summer.


In November, the newly re-formed Climate Council released a landmark report called Be prepared: climate change and the Australian bushfire threat, which highlighted the demonstrable connection between climate change and the duration and severity of Australian bushfires. The reason today's debate is so important is that this government is burning up the means that we had to be prepared. That is the message we are all being given: be prepared.


The independent research we have seen into the impacts of climate change is critical, because it helps us to prepare ourselves. The Prime Minister spent the election campaign reassuring the public that he accepts the science on climate change, so it is pretty frustrating and hard to understand why his government is removing the very authority that will help Australia's community leaders to prepare for the inevitable impacts of hotter summers and prolonged droughts, increases in bushfires and flooding threats and so on.


Minister Hunt says he will be able to seek advice from the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, but to do so diverts these organisations from their primary function: collecting and analysing data and forecasting and warning, in the case of the bureau; and scientific research, in the case of CSIRO. In an article in The Conversationnot too long ago, Monash University professor Neville Nicholls critiqued this arrangement. At the time, in December last year, he wrote:


One might think, however, that having a local agency to collate and assess this information for the Australian government might be more prudent than relying on other organisations, with their various biases. And it is hard to see how the Bureau of Meteorology or CSIRO could fill this role and provide advice on this aspect of climate change—it seems way outside their comfort zone.


Over the summer I have been reminded very clearly that it is not just the federal and state governments that require authoritative advice on our changing climate. We are a nation with 565 local government authorities, which are scrambling to put in place the best infrastructure and economic development plans for their communities. The question needs to be asked: can we really expect local councils to get on the phone to their local weather station and ask for advice on how best to prepare their communities for climate change?


As we well know, the effects of climate change are being particularly felt in regional and rural Australia. I know the minister has had her concerns when experiencing the drought that is significantly impacting in New South Wales at the moment, because her own country has been affected by it. Think about what has been going on down in the Riverina and out west. In March 2012, the Riverina, in Wagga Wagga for example, was devastated by the Murrumbidgee flooding. Then, just a few months later, it was threatened by a series of uncontrolled bushfires. Also, in November just last year farmers in that area experienced freak frosts. That followed the breaking of the decade-long drought, and now we are back into this drought situation again. So, floods, fires, droughts and frosts have all been experienced by one community down in the Wagga Wagga region. That is a good example of the challenges that one local government authority is having to deal with. So where is that council going to go to getting the advice they need on tackling this multitude of climate challenges? We need the Climate Change Authority for those reasons.


We can choose to proactively address climate change, or we can mop up afterwards. That response, which is really encapsulated in this bill to abolish the Climate Change Authority, means that Australia will actually miss out on a whole range of opportunities.


The mayor of Geelong, someone else who has been affected by the recent fires, said not long ago: 'We believe there is considerable scope for Geelong to use its manufacturing capability to share in the growing green technology market.' He said that before we heard the news about the car industry. They will be desperately seeking to capture and engage their manufacturing workforce in the innovation, research and development that will help build their economy for the future. He said at the time that, rather than job losses, there is the potential to expand jobs in the region as demand for green technology increases. So we have local governments and regional development authorities around the country trying to be innovative, trying to diversify their local economies and trying to deal with the real challenges of climate change. Then we have an authoritative research arm of the government being abolished by this legislation. It robs our mayors and business leaders of the advice they need to allow them to lead their communities with confidence. This probably is something that has not really had much attention paid to it.


The Climate Change Authority offers many inconvenient truths to our current government, such as this, which came from the draft report of its Targets and Progress Review: '…it is possible to sustain economic growth while reducing emissions.' That statement is a truth that repudiates the Prime Minister's ideological stance. This report is due to come out at the end of this month. 


As long as the Climate Change Authority exists, the government will not want to receive the report of the Targets and Progress Review, which the authority is legislated to produce and which we are awaiting with interest. It is easy to understand why the government is eager to abolish this organisation and prevent the report from seeing the light of day. That is quite a strong motivation in this abolition bill. The draft report suggests a number of areas where the government's climate policy will be found to be lacking. Much of that evidence is being reiterated in the Senate's inquiry into the direct action plan, which we have been undertaking for the last few months. It is very difficult to find anywhere in any of the submissions evidence that the direct action plan is going to deliver the targets that are being proposed.


The draft report recognises a clear global trend towards more ambitious climate action at the same time that this government has decided to claw back the climate change targets. I quote again from the draft report, which says:


… international action on climate change is strengthening, particularly in some of the world’s largest economies.


Ninety-nine countries, including Australia’s major trading partners and neighbours, and covering over 80 per cent of global emissions and over 90 per cent of the world’s economic output, have 2020 emissions reduction pledges. All of these countries are implementing policies to reduce emissions, including renewable energy targets, emissions trading schemes and vehicle emissions standards.


In particular, the world’s two largest emitters—China and the United States (jointly producing over a third of global emissions)—are stepping up their efforts to reduce emissions. Both countries have emissions reduction targets. China is investing heavily in renewable energy projects, closing inefficient coal power plants and trialling market mechanisms to reduce emissions. President Obama announced an ambitious plan for US action in June 2013, including new restrictions on emissions from coal-fired power plants, strengthened vehicle emission standards and renewable energy activities. These complement state-based market initiatives to reduce emissions.


Despite the trend towards increased climate action, the draft report of the Targets and Progress Review notes that more must be done here in Australia. The international community must increase its emissions reduction targets and Australia cannot step away from that obligation either.


The draft report's critique of the government's present stand gets more pointed. It argues that Australia's five per cent emissions reduction target should be increased for at least three good reasons. The report says:


First, the scale and pace of international action suggests that Australia should be pursuing a stronger target.


…   …   …


Second, 5 per cent is considered an inadequate first step if Australia is to play its part in limiting warming to below 2 degrees.


…   …   …


Third, the Authority considers that moving to a stronger target now could be accommodated at a relatively low cost to the economy, based on modelling of Australia’s economy and emissions outlook.


The draft report notes that since our five per cent target was initially set the efforts required to achieve this target have decreased significantly, so present efforts will guide us in the direction of an 11 per cent reduction by 2020. In light of that, the coalition's determination to retain the target at its five per cent level is paltry, to say the least.


The draft report suggests that we could be doing so much more without too much effort. Should the coalition fail to shut down the Climate Change Authority before the end of February they will have to contend with a Targets and Progress Review that will recommend that Australia's emissions reduction target be increased to either 15 per cent or 25 per cent. The government know that direct action alone will never be able to meet these targets—as does the Climate Change Authority, of course. This sets the government up for perhaps the biggest embarrassment of all, because they will have to acknowledge that Australia needs a carbon-pricing mechanism. There is going to have to be a market mechanism. Direct action, in and of itself, is not going to achieve the kinds of outcomes that this government is pursuing.


Seeing that the abolition of the Climate Change Authority stands to save the government a paltry $1.6 million annually, you really have to ask the question: what is the real saving being made by today's bill? Ordinary Australians might be forgiven for presuming that, in fact, this legislation is about saving face rather than about saving money.


So when you think that Labor actually established the Climate Change Authority to be an authority—an independent body—designed to sit outside of the strictures of party politics, you realise that that is the true reason the coalition are seeking its abolition. They know that as long as this authority exists, their medieval approach to climate policy will be embarrassed. By seeking to abolish the Climate Change Authority, the government is taking a crucial resource from every community in Australia simply to limit their own embarrassment.


But the Australian community itself has demonstrated that it understands how critical the Climate Change Authority will be for our future. It crowd funded $1 million in a little over a week. That was a herculean effort. It is a fundraising effort that now ensures the Climate Council's survival should this bill proceed. That does not make this debate irrelevant. On the contrary, it heightens the yawning chasm between the concerns and the hopes of the Australian people and the obstinacy that is the government's position at the moment.


Coalition members and senators have continually returned to the argument that they have a mandate to deconstruct Australia's Clean Energy Future. Twenty thousand donations to the Climate Commission in just one week show that the Australian people support climate action. It is alive and well in Australia. This is, according to the Climate Commission, actually the biggest crowd-funding campaign in Australia's history.


When we think now about the public polling that is going on we find that the Newspoll figures continually ask the questions about climate change. There are enough figures to refute the Prime Minister's claim that he is acting on popular support. The Australian people believe that we must take action on climate change. Older Australians believe we must take this action for generations in the future, for our farming communities, for our farming industries, for coastal communities, for the Great Barrier Reef and for all the natural resources that we have in our country. To ignore the reality of climate change is a folly that we should not allow this government to get away with.


Then there is more evidence that refutes the existence of the imaginary mandate that this government professes to have. If we go back to the exit polling conducted by the Climate Institute on the election day we find that Tony Abbott's views on carbon pricing and on climate change are:


… sharply at odds with the views of the electorate.


Again, I can quote from some additional exit polling which says:


National exit polling done on behalf of the Climate Institute showed that voters' primary concern was for the economy and jobs (31 per cent) …


I think voters everywhere would be very concerned by what has happened in the last week about jobs and the economy the polling continues:


… with climate change (5 per cent) and carbon tax (3 per cent) significantly lower. Even among Coalition voters only 3 per cent listed the carbon tax as a top issue.


So the coalition has an obstinate attitude to climate action and its opposition has been incessant for the past six years.



Hansard shows that 'carbon tax' is the most overused term by coalition members and senators, having been spoken more than 14,000 times in the last parliament between 2007 and 2014. Their strategy was to repeat something often enough for it to be believed. I feel that perhaps the only people who believe this are the coalition members themselves. The only Australians who are actually convinced by all of that repetition are those attempting to pass today's bill. This is a bill that does not deserve to be passed. It is not deserve the support of Labor and the opposition. We will not be supporting the bill.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (18:49):  I rise tonight to speak against the coalition's determination to hack away at another body that is vital to Australia's efforts in combating climate change: the Climate Change Authority. Last year, I spoke in this chamber about the government's determination to scrap the Clean Energy Finance Corporation—never mind that the CEFC makes the Australian government a four per cent profit, which is above the government's bond rate, or that it has leveraged $1.5 billion worth of private funding in a very short period of time. Never mind, also, that it has led to $2 billion worth of clean energy. 


Debate interrupted.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Order! Thank you, Senator Polley. It now being 6.50 pm, I call on consideration of government documents.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:52):  I rise tonight to highlight the work of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation and to implore the new government to continue to appropriately finance its important work. The mission of GAVI is to save children's lives and protect people's health by increasing access to immunisation in the world's poorest countries. Since 2000, GAVI has supported over 240 million additional children who might not otherwise have had access to vaccines and has prevented over four million future deaths.


Australia has played an important role in supporting the critical work of GAVI and saving lives, by significantly scaling up its contribution to the fund in recent years. The Australian government, under Labor, contributed $200 million in direct funding to GAVI over the 2011-13 period. The current 2014 contribution is $5 million, which is a part of the 20-year $250 million committed to the International Finance Facility for Immunisation by the former government. The previous Australian government had committed to grow Australia's assistance to more than $100 million a year by 2015-16. However, the new government has so far made no announcement about Australia's direct funding contribution to GAVI for the 2014-15 financial year and beyond.


Given the announcement on election eve that the coalition would reduce Australia's development assistance by $4½ billion, there is much less in the pot for future pledges. This is money to fund the vaccinations of the poorest children in the world, many in our Asian region. Late last year, the new government announced a reduction in funds to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Last year, the Australian contribution to the global fund was at the historic high of $100 million. Instead of increasing our contribution to the expected $125 million per year, the new government reduced it to half that—around $67 million per year. The cut is despite countries on our doorstep continuing to battle against the three pandemics. This approach should not be taken in the case of GAVI. The government should shield this vital organisation from its cuts. GAVI is consistently one of the most top-performing development organisations in the world. In July 2013 the UK government ranked GAVI as the best value for money for UK aid, while in March 2012 the Australian government ranked GAVI as the strongest performing multilateral aid organisation.


In 2012, I travelled to Myanmar with GAVI and saw firsthand the organisation's tremendous work for mothers and their children. In Nay Pyi Taw, I attended the GAVI and Myanmar Ministry of Health launch ceremony for the pentavalent and measles second dose vaccines. With one injection, the pentavalent vaccine protects children against five deadly but preventable diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B and meningitis. The second dose measles campaign is to target those children who missed out during the first vaccination program earlier this year.


The Ministry of Health and GAVI use public launches to highlight the benefits of vaccinations and gain significant promotion across the country. It was heartening at this launch to meet parents and their children who had travelled from the regions surrounding Nay Pyi Taw to get their children vaccinated. I found a six-month-old set of twins waiting for their vaccinations with their mother. She knew from the information provided by GAVI and the Myanmar Ministry of Health about the effectiveness of vaccinations. No doubt, she would have known people who had suffered illness and mortality from the diseases being vaccinated against that day. She was taking her young children to receive their vaccines. Yes, she was lining up in the middle of a paddock, and the vaccines were being administered in a poorly resourced facility. But she knew that, with this vaccination, the chance of her young children contracting measles, whooping cough or one of the other preventable diseases was almost totally removed, and that vaccinating her children would reduce the prevalence of these diseases in her community, not only protecting her children but hopefully preventing other children from contracting a disease.


This story highlights the need for Australia to continue to invest, through our overseas development assistance program, in health system strengthening across the developing world. It highlights the need for Australia to properly finance GAVI. The poorest of the poor in our region depend on its work for a chance to beat diseases unheard of in our country for decades. I implore the new government to continue to increase Australia's contributions to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation this year and each year into the future.
