",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:02):  I have a series of questions. I was just flagging those when we ran out of time during the last sitting debate on this particular bill. Firstly, can I ask the minister to explain why these amendments are necessary? My take on these amendments—and if you could confirm whether this is correct—is that they move decisions that were previously under disallowable instruments to a point where they are no longer disallowable. Is that a correct understanding?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-09-11,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (12:03):  In a nutshell, yes. The amendments will make the current trial sites legislatively consistent with the proposed Bundaberg and Hervey Bay trial site. We believe that this will give certainty to trial participants and local communities. In summary, these amendments, as you indicated, move the current content of the Social Security (Administration) (Trial of Cashless Welfare Arrangements) Determination 2018 into primary legislation, or, in uncontentious cases, such as authorising community bodies, into notifiable instruments. You are, in essence, correct.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:04):  Let's just be clear for the committee: that's to ensure that this chamber can no longer consider those measures as disallowable instruments in the way that, for example, during the last sitting we considered some of those issues for the current trial sites. That's what this is about. Then, when you look at community bodies as notifiable instruments—community bodies, so everybody knows, are very contentious in the trial sites that have community bodies, where members of their own community cannot find out who are the people making decisions over their lives, literally. At the moment, as I've articulated in this place, members of the communities cannot find out who the faceless people on these community bodies are and, secondly, whether they exist at all. In Kalgoorlie there isn't a community body, and it's yet to be seen who goes on the community body, if there is one, in the trial site that we are currently discussing. This is what this is about. To be honest it's because the Greens and I have been raising concerns about the way these trials are operating. The government has moved to stop that from occurring by taking these into the primary legislation, as the minister just articulated, which removes and reduces the transparency and accountability of this government on this highly contentious social policy. That's what these amendments are about. I confirm—and it will come as no surprise—that the Greens will not be supporting these amendments.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:06):  I want to make a few remarks to explain Labor's position on the government amendments—unless Senator Siewert has further questions around them?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:07):  I confirm to Senator McAllister that I have a series of questions around this particular bill generally. My first series of questions was just about this particular set of amendments.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,2,1
"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:07):  Then it might assist for me to put the opposition senators' view about this. We do not support these amendments. This is primarily because we do not support the expansion of the cashless debit card beyond the trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley. It is also because we are concerned that the changes could reduce parliamentary scrutiny of the trials, where certain changes to trial areas would be enabled through a notifiable rather than a disallowable instrument. The purpose of the trial is to allow scrutiny of the effectiveness of that trial. If presented separately, Labor would support powers for the secretary in relation to reducing the proportion of income that is loaded onto the card. That is something we would be prepared to consider, but while they are clustered together we cannot support the amendments as a whole. We are of the understanding that, in circumstances of technical malfunction or natural disaster, changes could already be made quickly by the minister through a legislative instrument. It is our expectation that the government has the numbers in relation to this amendment. We are not at this stage seeking for parts of it to be considered separately.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:08):  I'm seeking the guidance of the committee. As I flagged, I have a series of questions around the bill itself, not just relating to these amendments. We can either deal with them now or vote on the amendments and then come back to these questions. I'm in the committee's hands, Chair.



The CHAIR:  The question before the chair is that the amendments as moved by Senator Fifield be agreed to, then we're back in the hands of the committee as to how we proceed.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I therefore ask the minister, on the amendments, why specifically these amendments are now being moved, if it's not to reduce the ability of this place to look at the amendments and review amendments around these specific issues. Why are you doing it now when in the past you felt that the best way to proceed was to have them as disallowable instruments?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:19):  As I indicated, I'd like to ask the government a series of questions about the bill. In the bill, why does the secretary not have to satisfy themselves that the individual's inclusion in a trial would not pose a serious threat to their mental, physical or emotional wellbeing before the individual is subject to the card, which is different to the approaches in the other trial sites?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (12:20):  I want to check I am understanding Senator Siewert's question correctly. Senator Siewert, you were asking why the secretary doesn't have to satisfy himself that there isn't some adverse personal effect on an individual before they're subject to participation in the trial. Is that correct?




Senator Siewert:
  Yes.




Senator FIFIELD:
  The government's view would be that the starting point and assumption should not be, and isn't, that the trial and participation in it is to the detriment of an individual or that it restricts their human rights, so I think we're starting from a different point of embarkation, if you like.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:21):  Sorry. This is a provision that is in the other trial sites—to provide an exemption for someone from the card. Sorry if I framed that question poorly. Why is that not included in this trial site when it is in other trials?

Before the announcement on 21 September 2017 that Bundaberg and Hervey Bay would be the fourth CDC site, the department conducted over 110 meetings in Brisbane, Bundaberg, Childers, Hervey Bay, Howard, Maryborough and other areas via teleconference. This included five meetings with Commonwealth government agencies; 19 meetings with community members, including business leaders and church leaders; three meetings with the community reference group; two large community meetings with the public, including potential card recipients; 25 meetings with local government representatives; four meetings with peak bodies; 55 meetings with service providers, including Families and Children, Employment, Financial Capability and Indigenous; and three meetings with state government agencies. Community members who were unable to attend face-to-face meetings were invited to contact the department via the CDC hotline, email or the DSS Engage portal. The Engage portal was a website that was set up for people to submit a question, with the answer then made publicly available.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (12:39):  I have a couple of questions for the minister. The first is related to a statement that was made by Indue Ltd in their submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill. Indue wrote that Larry Anthony's tenure as a director of Indue concluded in October 2013. Indue does not have any current relationship with Larry Anthony or any company related to him except that Larry Anthony is a co-owner and founding director of SAS Consulting Group. As recently as September of last year, when an extension of the cashless welfare card was being proposed for the Goldfields region, SAS Consulting Group listed Indue Ltd as a major client and actively lobbied the government on their behalf.


Looking at SAS Consulting recently, it appears that Indue is no longer listed as a client under SAS profile on the Australian government registry of lobbyists. However, Larry Anthony, as most people in this place are aware, is the federal president of the National Party. At their federal council in August, the National Party referred to a policy committee resolution supporting the rollout nationally of the card for people under 35 on welfare and those on parenting payments. Also, we note that in here the National Party is, indeed, supporting the government's proposal currently before the Senate. Could the Minister please clarify why the Liberal-National government does not see it as a serious conflict of interest that the company it contracts to administer the cashless debit card was a major client of a consulting group co-owned and run by the federal president of the National Party, a party which is actively attempting to expand the card nationally?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (12:41):  I will make a couple of points. Obviously I do know who Mr Anthony is, but I have no knowledge of his professional engagements. What I can state very clearly is that the organisational National Party, along with the organisational Liberal Party, have responsibility for choosing parliamentary candidates. They do not determine the policy of the coalition government. It is the joint party room of the coalition government and the various other internal processes of the government that determine government policy.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (12:42):  I don't believe you touched on my question, which is in relation to a conflict of interest. My second part is: at any time did Indue advise the government that it was using SAS Consulting? And was the government aware at any time that Indue was using SAS consultants and that Mr Anthony is the director?

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (12:43):  I have asked you to clarify what was said at Senate estimates, because I'm asking directly why the government doesn't consider this to be a privilege matter. Secondly, I've asked whether Indue ever disclosed to the government it was using SAS consultants or whether the government was aware that Indue was using SAS consultants. If that was asked and directly responded to at Senate estimates you could supply me with that, but if it hasn't been directly answered. I am asking whether the Indue relationship with SAS consulting was advised to the government and whether the government knew of the relationship between Indue and SAS. They are simple yes/no questions.


My second question is relation to Indue's terms-and-conditions book, which I'm sure your department is aware of. Some of the submissions we received in the Senate inquiry imply that Indue imposes conditions on cardholders or applies settings on the card or deposit account products, but, as we know, Indue is not a decision-making body in respect of the functional design of the cashless debit card. All functional design decisions or decisions about particular individual limits are made by the Commonwealth government. If I'm not correct in that, I'd appreciate your, before I go on, just indicating whether I'm correct.



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator LINES:
  I'm correct, thank you. Yet, on evidence available publicly, looking at the Indue terms and conditions, there is nowhere in this document that indicates that the terms and conditions are imposed by the Commonwealth government. Indue at best confused its own card and business T&Cs and all non-CDCT transfer limitations, such as the waiting of 28 days for certain transfer payments, with the limits set by the Commonwealth directions.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (12:47):  I apologise if I haven't been clear enough. We agreed that the government sets the terms and conditions for how the cashless debit card operates, what the limits are and all those day-to-day events. What I've had a look at—which I'm happy to table, but I'm guessing the department is well aware of this—is Indue's debit card, its conditions and how it's used. There is no reference to the Commonwealth government. If the Commonwealth government is setting the terms and conditions, why isn't that spelled out in the conditions of use that Indue publish?

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (12:48):  We note the lacklustre effort from the minister in this regard, particularly around the consultation, where the best he could offer was taking on notice whom they had consulted with. The reality is that those of us who have spent time in that area—and I have, as the duty Labor senator for that area—have done proper consultation with the community, unlike those opposite. The government made the decision: 'This is what we are going to do. We are going to come in and impose this from on high.' The local member, Keith Pitt, the member for Hinkler, has been completely part of this. Senator Lines made a good point in regard to the National Party's outrageous behaviour. The federal president of the National Party has been lobbying for this, and Keith Pitt, the National Party member for Hinkler, has been pushing this in the local community.


Unlike the government, the opposition has spent the time to consult properly with the community. That includes a town hall forum I held with the federal Labor leader, Bill Shorten, where there was strong community opposition to this draconian proposal from those opposite. I have also met with the local mayors: the mayor of Hervey Bay, who was only recently elected, and the mayor of Bundaberg, Jack Dempsey, who was a former LNP minister. The response we got from those mayors has been interesting. The mayor of Hervey Bay, on the Fraser Coast, who is relatively new, has been vehemently opposed to this. He faced a by-election, which he contested and won, based on his strong opposition to this. He received an overwhelming vote. The mayor of Bundaberg—as I said, a former LNP minister in the previous Queensland government—was originally in favour of this proposal, but, due to the strong community opposition in Bundaberg, he has now switched his position. So the mayors of the two biggest towns that make up Hinkler are strongly opposed to the plan by this government. When the government say they consulted, they'd already made their decision and now they are trying to force this on the community. They've got no interest in what the best outcome is for the people in Hinkler. All they want to do is continue their ideological obsession. They're not going to do anything to boost the services that need to follow such a decision that they're making in this regard.


I've recently accompanied the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, and the shadow finance minister, Jim Chalmers, through Hervey Bay, Bundaberg and the surrounding communities. Whilst federal Labor have spent this year in Hinkler listening to these communities, the government have done nothing of the sort. They've sent a few bureaucrats, but they've actually sent no-one on the ground who can make decisions, no-one who can listen to those people and make decisions accordingly.


What's become clear is that there is no support for this proposal in the community. The fact that the local LNP mayor, who was a minister in the Newman government, has now come out and opposed it shows you that the community has turned against this government and, in particular, this proposal. All the government will do through what they're pursuing—and it's disappointing that apparently some of the crossbenchers have decided to sign up to this—is divide the community. That is all they're going to do, and they're very good at it. They've divided Australians all over the country, and they're going to divide the community of Hinkler as well. And they're not going to ensure that there will be any benefit to the people who will be impacted by this. So this is a terrible decision by this government. It's one that Labor will continue to highlight, and Labor will continue to work closely with the impacted communities.


The new shadow minister, Linda Burney, has agreed to travel there to ensure that we continue to listen to those local communities and that they get the representation they need. It's clear that they're not going to get the representation they deserve from their local member, Keith Pitt, or this government, which is completely arrogant and completely out of touch. This is another lacklustre representative effort from the minister responsible here, Senator Fifield.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (12:55):  This is not my second or first first speech—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Yet here we are!




Senator WATERS:
  Indeed. I just have a few questions—and, forgive me, I'm somewhat new to this area. I have just been in Bundaberg and had some fabulous consultation with the Say No to the Cashless Welfare Card Hervey Bay region people. They are dead against this card. They feel that it will increase stigma, it will reduce their autonomy and it won't help them pay their bills. It will make it harder for them to live their lives. It certainly doesn't empower them to make financial decisions about what they do with their own money. Is this just an ideological commitment from the government to tell people how to spend their money? There seems to be a disconnect there. I don't think the minister has even been to the region and asked these people what they think.


There was a Senate inquiry that didn't even get to the area. I managed to go and Senator Siewert managed to go. My predecessor, Senator Andrew Bartlett, managed to go, and I hear that a number of Labor senators have managed to go as well. When is the government going to send its minister to this region to actually listen to the community and hear that they don't want this draconian approach to them spending what are already limited funds?


I note that yesterday Senator Siewert introduced her bill to increase Newstart and youth allowance, because they are clearly already below the poverty line. Then you are cracking down further on people who are doing it tough and who are doing their best, and who don't need the patronising, dead hand of this painful Liberal government telling them what to do.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (13:00):  The claim is that the Indue card is just like everybody else's card—it's just like a normal debit card; it's just like the normal process.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (13:01):  The card operates in the same way in that there's no separate or additional infrastructure required for the merchant to operate the card. The card operates in an analogous way. Clearly, there are differences in the way it operates, which is the purpose of this discussion.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (13:01):  So, in fact, that puts the lie to the fact that this is just the same as using any other card. Previously it has not been stated that it is just at the merchant or when you're physically using it. The community has been told is just like anybody else's. That's not true, is it?

I understand that the department has been looking at this. One thing that has been suggested to me is that extra infrastructure has been put in. I'd like a clear outline of how that process now operates such that it is just like using a normal debit card.

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (13:11):  I'm advised that it's an additional $4 million. Sorry, let me just go through for you and let me just correct that number that I gave you. Funding for the Goldfields and Bundaberg and Hervey Bay trial areas was secured in the budget in 2017-18. The cost to establish the trial and operate for one year in Ceduna and the East Kimberley, as you probably already know, was $17.8 million, with about 2,200 people on the trial in those sites from 2016. The additional cost for the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay trial areas, as negotiations are still underway, can't be finalised or advised.

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (13:14):  I guess my question is going to the cost-benefit of even rolling this card out at all in the region. I've already noted in my consultations with the folk there—Kathryn Wilkes and Daniel Stafford in particular—that there is no support for this card and, in fact, they are crying out for money to be spent on funding services like homelessness and domestic violence shelters and education pathways and on creating jobs. So my question is: has the department or the minister, or anybody in charge of this, actually done that cost-benefit analysis of funding those support services? Surely they would reap far more social benefits, as QCOSS has pointed out. With the dubious benefits of the card so far, the evidence just isn't there to show that it works. In fact, there's the potential for social harm to increase. Why don't you just fund the services that we know work and help people. Surely doing at least a cost-benefit analysis of that is worthwhile. Is that on the cards? If so, can you tell me anything about it?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (13:15):  The view of the government is that you don't have to choose between the cashless card and support services. The government is committed to both. The first independent evaluation has shown that the card has a considerable positive impact in communities, including 48 per cent of drug-takers using fewer drugs, 41 per cent of drinkers drinking less and 48 per cent of gamblers gambling less. A recent media release from the mayor of Kalgoorlie, where the trial of the card began earlier this year, stated that all the indicators were positive.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (13:16):  When are you going to stop reiterating that, when, quite clearly, the ANAO report has shown that you do not have enough information to show there has been a reduction in social harm? As for Mayor Bowler, I pointed out very clearly during the last debate—I acknowledge that Minister Fifield was not in the chamber at the time—that WA Police have said that they cannot point to the cashless welfare card as being the body that's responsible for any reduction of antisocial activity in the Goldfields area, because their operation, Operation Fortitude I think it's called, was running at the time. So claims there has been a reduction in social harm are just not correct. The ANAO report has clearly pointed that out. For the record, people, please read the ANAO report, because it has shown that there is not the evidence to claim there has been a reduction in social harm. The statistics that were just quoted are cherry-picked from a very flawed analysis by Orima. Read the ANAO report and look at what they said about the data that was very conveniently not included in the analysis: the flawed approach to the survey of participants; the push-polling approach to the participants; and the fact that so many participants have said it's made their lives worse. In fact, when I was in Leonora the other day to discuss the storage of waste and uranium mining, which I'll talk about in the chamber at a later date, the issue of the card was raised with me there. A person who had previously been a supporter of the card is now on the card and, quite frankly—surprise, surprise—it's making their lives more difficult. They are unable to use it satisfactorily. So can we please not keep falsely claiming that this card is reducing social harm, because the evidence is not there to show that it is. At best, the evidence that the government uses is anecdotal. I can repeat many anecdotal examples that people have given directly to me. They have told me of the harm that it is causing them, the difficulty in using it and the many other concerns they have about the card, including being called 'druggies', being stigmatised, feeling humiliated and dealing with the difficulty of managing and using the card. So, please, don't keep repeating just what is handed to you by the government, which at best is basically just anecdotal points.

Our understanding is that the government has already paid $7.9 million to Indue. The government has also paid $1.6 million to ORIMA for their research report that has been referred to over the course of the debate. That has been heavily criticised, including by the Auditor-General, for providing essentially meaningless information about the success or otherwise of the program. We understand that the accrued cost of the cashless debit card trial up to 15 March this year is about $24 million for just two sites. Can you confirm that the cost of the trial across the two existing sites is well over $10,000 per person?

I would say this: this is a contract of significant value being let in the Goldfields and then there is a further one to be let in the Hervey Bay area. It goes to providing a service to government that many consider will be very intrusive and will certainly have significant impacts on the lives of individuals. There are serious questions being raised by the ANAO about the value for money that has been offered so far by the trials in the existing sites. I think there are real concerns about proceeding on the basis of such limited information. If the minister and, indeed, the government are in possession of information that would provide us with some detail about the kinds of costs associated with this—the value and the cost-effectiveness of what is being proposed—it would assist the Senate in considering the business before us. That is the basis of the previous series of questions asked by me.

Are you just going to keep using the commercial-in-confidence argument for everything when you don't want to tell us what something is costing? The trial has gone ahead. Why can't the government now tell us what their budget is for that area? Secondly, how can you tell us that this is now $2,000 a head when you don't know—and this is what I am taking from what you are saying—how much it's going to cost?

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:43):  Senator Storer's amendment goes to monitoring and evaluation. This has been a very significant issue in this debate so far, because you have already paid $1.6 million to a company called ORIMA Research, which provided an evaluation of the existing trial sites that a range of experts have essentially described as useless. The Auditor-General has said that the information was of such poor quality that it is not actually possible to say whether or not the trial was effective in any way. Their words, in particular, were:


… monitoring and evaluation was inadequate. As a consequence, it is difficult to conclude whether there had been a reduction in social harm and whether the card was a lower cost welfare quarantining approach.


Given that the evaluation process to date has been of such poor quality and has yielded so little information about whether this program is of any value whatsoever, what can you tell us about changes to the department's practice in terms of monitoring and evaluation that could provide any assurance at all that further monitoring and evaluation will produce anything of value?

Overall, there were appropriate arrangements and processes in place. However, the department does acknowledge the issues raised in the report and, where improvements can be made, the department has been making improvements to the trial and process over time and will continue to do so. These improvements will ensure the trial can continue to be effectively implemented and monitored. Senator Storer's amendments will require the government to conduct a review of any evaluation to ensure that the findings are accurate.

I asked you what had changed in the department following the Auditor-General's scathing review of the monitoring and evaluation program. Your answer indicated that you accepted the Auditor-General's remarks but, in any case, they just confirmed existing departmental practice and you were putting in place arrangements to ensure that monitoring and evaluation continued. That doesn't sound to me like any meaningful or material change to the way the department thinks about these kinds of tasks. My real question to you is in the context of the amendment before us. Senator Storer is asking for serious monitoring and evaluation, and that is an objective that I support not just in the context of this kind of program but in all social policy. My question to you is: what has been learnt from the failures of the $1.6 million ORIMA review—what has materially changed in the way the department will conduct future reviews of this program?

The department has also developed a monitoring strategy to improve visibility of how the cashless debit card is being implemented.

Therefore, at the end of the trial, because no adequate baseline data was collected, it was not possible to evaluate whether or not any changes to people's wellbeing had taken place as a consequence of your intervention. What you've told me is that you've got some better processes in place to gather information about cost. Okay; perhaps that is an improvement. But the core issue that we're trying to test here is whether or not an intervention of this kind makes people's lives better.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (13:51):  I want to go back to the baseline studies that are being undertaken for the Goldfields and the Hinkler region. The answer you gave me to the question was that they're going to be completed in early October. That's correct, isn't it?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (13:53):  Sorry: I was asking about the ongoing monitoring of the use of the card that you were articulating to Senator McAllister.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (13:54):  Well, I guess all departments monitor programs on an ongoing basis, but the manner in which that is reported and communicated publicly is ultimately a matter for the minister. I can't tell you how and when that will happen, but no doubt it will be something which is shared in the context of estimates, committees and other forums of this place. I can't tell you what will be a mechanism in addition to that which the minister may choose.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (13:55):  I'll indicate that the Greens are not supportive of this amendment, because we don't think anything can make this trial better. With all due respect to Senator Storer, I think he's been sold a pup. There is no evidence from the ANAO report that this process has reduced social harm. We cannot support causing more distress to more people in Hinkler and the Goldfields and continuing that distress in Ceduna and East Kimberly. I was about to use a pretty poor analogy, but I won't. You just can't make this nonsense better. We can't support this, because you can't make it better. We won't be supporting the amendments.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:56):  I will quickly place Labor's view on the record. We agree with Senator Storer that increased scrutiny is certainly needed. The significant flaws in the existing evaluation have been referred to on many occasions in this debate, and an improved evaluation would be very welcome. We will, therefore, support your amendment. But I also wish to place on record my scepticism that it will improve things a great deal. Already $1.6 million of public money has been spent on a failed evaluation. I am not certain that the minister is capable of conducting a successful one.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:02):  I have a series of questions. I was just flagging those when we ran out of time during the last sitting debate on this particular bill. Firstly, can I ask the minister to explain why these amendments are necessary? My take on these amendments—and if you could confirm whether this is correct—is that they move decisions that were previously under disallowable instruments to a point where they are no longer disallowable. Is that a correct understanding?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-09-11,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (12:03):  In a nutshell, yes. The amendments will make the current trial sites legislatively consistent with the proposed Bundaberg and Hervey Bay trial site. We believe that this will give certainty to trial participants and local communities. In summary, these amendments, as you indicated, move the current content of the Social Security (Administration) (Trial of Cashless Welfare Arrangements) Determination 2018 into primary legislation, or, in uncontentious cases, such as authorising community bodies, into notifiable instruments. You are, in essence, correct.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:04):  Let's just be clear for the committee: that's to ensure that this chamber can no longer consider those measures as disallowable instruments in the way that, for example, during the last sitting we considered some of those issues for the current trial sites. That's what this is about. Then, when you look at community bodies as notifiable instruments—community bodies, so everybody knows, are very contentious in the trial sites that have community bodies, where members of their own community cannot find out who are the people making decisions over their lives, literally. At the moment, as I've articulated in this place, members of the communities cannot find out who the faceless people on these community bodies are and, secondly, whether they exist at all. In Kalgoorlie there isn't a community body, and it's yet to be seen who goes on the community body, if there is one, in the trial site that we are currently discussing. This is what this is about. To be honest it's because the Greens and I have been raising concerns about the way these trials are operating. The government has moved to stop that from occurring by taking these into the primary legislation, as the minister just articulated, which removes and reduces the transparency and accountability of this government on this highly contentious social policy. That's what these amendments are about. I confirm—and it will come as no surprise—that the Greens will not be supporting these amendments.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:07):  I confirm to Senator McAllister that I have a series of questions around this particular bill generally. My first series of questions was just about this particular set of amendments.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:07):  Then it might assist for me to put the opposition senators' view about this. We do not support these amendments. This is primarily because we do not support the expansion of the cashless debit card beyond the trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley. It is also because we are concerned that the changes could reduce parliamentary scrutiny of the trials, where certain changes to trial areas would be enabled through a notifiable rather than a disallowable instrument. The purpose of the trial is to allow scrutiny of the effectiveness of that trial. If presented separately, Labor would support powers for the secretary in relation to reducing the proportion of income that is loaded onto the card. That is something we would be prepared to consider, but while they are clustered together we cannot support the amendments as a whole. We are of the understanding that, in circumstances of technical malfunction or natural disaster, changes could already be made quickly by the minister through a legislative instrument. It is our expectation that the government has the numbers in relation to this amendment. We are not at this stage seeking for parts of it to be considered separately.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:08):  I'm seeking the guidance of the committee. As I flagged, I have a series of questions around the bill itself, not just relating to these amendments. We can either deal with them now or vote on the amendments and then come back to these questions. I'm in the committee's hands, Chair.



The CHAIR:  The question before the chair is that the amendments as moved by Senator Fifield be agreed to, then we're back in the hands of the committee as to how we proceed.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I therefore ask the minister, on the amendments, why specifically these amendments are now being moved, if it's not to reduce the ability of this place to look at the amendments and review amendments around these specific issues. Why are you doing it now when in the past you felt that the best way to proceed was to have them as disallowable instruments?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:19):  As I indicated, I'd like to ask the government a series of questions about the bill. In the bill, why does the secretary not have to satisfy themselves that the individual's inclusion in a trial would not pose a serious threat to their mental, physical or emotional wellbeing before the individual is subject to the card, which is different to the approaches in the other trial sites?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (12:20):  I want to check I am understanding Senator Siewert's question correctly. Senator Siewert, you were asking why the secretary doesn't have to satisfy himself that there isn't some adverse personal effect on an individual before they're subject to participation in the trial. Is that correct?




Senator Siewert:
  Yes.




Senator FIFIELD:
  The government's view would be that the starting point and assumption should not be, and isn't, that the trial and participation in it is to the detriment of an individual or that it restricts their human rights, so I think we're starting from a different point of embarkation, if you like.

Senator SIEWERT

Going back to the trial focusing on those under 36 on the specific areas of income support: did the community—I'll use the term 'community consultations', though I think I've already articulated my concerns about some of the consultation processes—ask for the trial to be focused on those that are under 36 and on those specific areas of income support?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:29):  Thank you. Could you also outline how many of those that will be impacted by this—in other words, future participants in the trial—were actually consulted—not told and informed about it, because the inquiry heard from people that were likely to be affected by the trial that they were told what was going on but they weren't consulted. But that's, of course, the people that we spoke to during the hearing. What I'm interested in is how many people that are future participants were actually consulted about the trial.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (12:30):  I think we could ascertain the forums and the formats and those who attended those, who would have been informed and consulted with, but it would be a more difficult proposition to categorise and number those who hadn't been consulted with.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-11,"

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (12:31):  I can't say what may or may not be in a document when we have yet to ascertain if the document is there, but it might assist if I just go through what occurred between May 2017 and December 2017, when the Department of Social Services conducted over 188 meetings in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay areas. Before the announcement on 21 September 2017 that Bundaberg and Hervey Bay would be the fourth CDC site, the department conducted over 110 meetings in Brisbane, Bundaberg, Childers, Hervey Bay, Howard, Maryborough and other areas via teleconference. This included five meetings with Commonwealth government agencies; 19 meetings with community members, including business leaders and church leaders; three meetings with the community reference group; two large community meetings with the public, including potential card recipients; 25 meetings with local government representatives; four meetings with peak bodies; 55 meetings with service providers, including Families and Children, Employment, Financial Capability and Indigenous; and three meetings with state government agencies. Community members who were unable to attend face-to-face meetings were invited to contact the department via the CDC hotline, email or the DSS Engage portal. The Engage portal was a website that was set up for people to submit a question, with the answer then made publicly available.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (12:39):  I have a couple of questions for the minister. The first is related to a statement that was made by Indue Ltd in their submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill. Indue wrote that Larry Anthony's tenure as a director of Indue concluded in October 2013. Indue does not have any current relationship with Larry Anthony or any company related to him except that Larry Anthony is a co-owner and founding director of SAS Consulting Group. As recently as September of last year, when an extension of the cashless welfare card was being proposed for the Goldfields region, SAS Consulting Group listed Indue Ltd as a major client and actively lobbied the government on their behalf.


Looking at SAS Consulting recently, it appears that Indue is no longer listed as a client under SAS profile on the Australian government registry of lobbyists. However, Larry Anthony, as most people in this place are aware, is the federal president of the National Party. At their federal council in August, the National Party referred to a policy committee resolution supporting the rollout nationally of the card for people under 35 on welfare and those on parenting payments. Also, we note that in here the National Party is, indeed, supporting the government's proposal currently before the Senate. Could the Minister please clarify why the Liberal-National government does not see it as a serious conflict of interest that the company it contracts to administer the cashless debit card was a major client of a consulting group co-owned and run by the federal president of the National Party, a party which is actively attempting to expand the card nationally?

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-09-11,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (12:41):  I will make a couple of points. Obviously I do know who Mr Anthony is, but I have no knowledge of his professional engagements. What I can state very clearly is that the organisational National Party, along with the organisational Liberal Party, have responsibility for choosing parliamentary candidates. They do not determine the policy of the coalition government.

 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (12:42):  I don't believe you touched on my question, which is in relation to a conflict of interest. My second part is: at any time did Indue advise the government that it was using SAS Consulting?

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (12:43):  I have asked you to clarify what was said at Senate estimates, because I'm asking directly why the government doesn't consider this to be a privilege matter. Secondly, I've asked whether Indue ever disclosed to the government it was using SAS consultants or whether the government was aware that Indue was using SAS consultants. If that was asked and directly responded to at Senate estimates you could supply me with that, but if it hasn't been directly answered. I am asking whether the Indue relationship with SAS consulting was advised to the government and whether the government knew of the relationship between Indue and SAS. They are simple yes/no questions.


My second question is relation to Indue's terms-and-conditions book, which I'm sure your department is aware of. Some of the submissions we received in the Senate inquiry imply that Indue imposes conditions on cardholders or applies settings on the card or deposit account products, but, as we know, Indue is not a decision-making body in respect of the functional design of the cashless debit card. All functional design decisions or decisions about particular individual limits are made by the Commonwealth government. If I'm not correct in that, I'd appreciate your, before I go on, just indicating whether I'm correct.



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator LINES:
  I'm correct, thank you. Yet, on evidence available publicly, looking at the Indue terms and conditions, there is nowhere in this document that indicates that the terms and conditions are imposed by the Commonwealth government. Indue at best confused its own card and business T&Cs and all non-CDCT transfer limitations, such as the waiting of 28 days for certain transfer payments, with the limits set by the Commonwealth directions. My question to you is: can you please clarify why there is no reference to the department in Indue's terms and conditions? I'm happy to table this document if you so wish.

Senator LINES

We agreed that the government sets the terms and conditions for how the cashless debit card operates, what the limits are and all those day-to-day events. What I've had a look at—which I'm happy to table, but I'm guessing the department is well aware of this—is Indue's debit card, its conditions and how it's used. There is no reference to the Commonwealth government. If the Commonwealth government is setting the terms and conditions, why isn't that spelled out in the conditions of use that Indue publish?

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (12:48):  We note the lacklustre effort from the minister in this regard, particularly around the consultation, where the best he could offer was taking on notice whom they had consulted with. The reality is that those of us who have spent time in that area—and I have, as the duty Labor senator for that area—have done proper consultation with the community, unlike those opposite. The government made the decision: 'This is what we are going to do. We are going to come in and impose this from on high.' The local member, Keith Pitt, the member for Hinkler, has been completely part of this. Senator Lines made a good point in regard to the National Party's outrageous behaviour. The federal president of the National Party has been lobbying for this, and Keith Pitt, the National Party member for Hinkler, has been pushing this in the local community.


Unlike the government, the opposition has spent the time to consult properly with the community. That includes a town hall forum I held with the federal Labor leader, Bill Shorten, where there was strong community opposition to this draconian proposal from those opposite. I have also met with the local mayors: the mayor of Hervey Bay, who was only recently elected, and the mayor of Bundaberg, Jack Dempsey, who was a former LNP minister. The response we got from those mayors has been interesting. The mayor of Hervey Bay, on the Fraser Coast, who is relatively new, has been vehemently opposed to this. He faced a by-election, which he contested and won, based on his strong opposition to this. He received an overwhelming vote. The mayor of Bundaberg—as I said, a former LNP minister in the previous Queensland government—was originally in favour of this proposal, but, due to the strong community opposition in Bundaberg, he has now switched his position. So the mayors of the two biggest towns that make up Hinkler are strongly opposed to the plan by this government. When the government say they consulted, they'd already made their decision and now they are trying to force this on the community. They've got no interest in what the best outcome is for the people in Hinkler. All they want to do is continue their ideological obsession. They're not going to do anything to boost the services that need to follow such a decision that they're making in this regard.


I've recently accompanied the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, and the shadow finance minister, Jim Chalmers, through Hervey Bay, Bundaberg and the surrounding communities. Whilst federal Labor have spent this year in Hinkler listening to these communities, the government have done nothing of the sort. They've sent a few bureaucrats, but they've actually sent no-one on the ground who can make decisions, no-one who can listen to those people and make decisions accordingly.


What's become clear is that there is no support for this proposal in the community. The fact that the local LNP mayor, who was a minister in the Newman government, has now come out and opposed it shows you that the community has turned against this government and, in particular, this proposal. All the government will do through what they're pursuing—and it's disappointing that apparently some of the crossbenchers have decided to sign up to this—is divide the community. That is all they're going to do, and they're very good at it. They've divided Australians all over the country, and they're going to divide the community of Hinkler as well. And they're not going to ensure that there will be any benefit to the people who will be impacted by this. So this is a terrible decision by this government. It's one that Labor will continue to highlight, and Labor will continue to work closely with the impacted communities.


The new shadow minister, Linda Burney, has agreed to travel there to ensure that we continue to listen to those local communities and that they get the representation they need. It's clear that they're not going to get the representation they deserve from their local member, Keith Pitt, or this government, which is completely arrogant and completely out of touch. This is another lacklustre representative effort from the minister responsible here, Senator Fifield.

The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Yet here we are!




Senator WATERS:
  Indeed. I just have a few questions—and, forgive me, I'm somewhat new to this area. I have just been in Bundaberg and had some fabulous consultation with the Say No to the Cashless Welfare Card Hervey Bay region people. They are dead against this card. They feel that it will increase stigma, it will reduce their autonomy and it won't help them pay their bills. It will make it harder for them to live their lives. It certainly doesn't empower them to make financial decisions about what they do with their own money. Is this just an ideological commitment from the government to tell people how to spend their money? There seems to be a disconnect there. I don't think the minister has even been to the region and asked these people what they think.


There was a Senate inquiry that didn't even get to the area. I managed to go and Senator Siewert managed to go. My predecessor, Senator Andrew Bartlett, managed to go, and I hear that a number of Labor senators have managed to go as well. When is the government going to send its minister to this region to actually listen to the community and hear that they don't want this draconian approach to them spending what are already limited funds?


I note that yesterday Senator Siewert introduced her bill to increase Newstart and youth allowance, because they are clearly already below the poverty line. Then you are cracking down further on people who are doing it tough and who are doing their best, and who don't need the patronising, dead hand of this painful Liberal government telling them what to do.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (13:01):  The card operates in the same way in that there's no separate or additional infrastructure required for the merchant to operate the card.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (13:11):  This is still not my first speech. Minister, forgive me if we're going over some ground that we've already covered, but, just for clarity, can I ask: what is the estimated cost of expanding the card to the Hinkler region?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-09-11,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (13:11):  I'm advised that it's an additional $4 million. Sorry, let me just go through for you and let me just correct that number that I gave you. Funding for the Goldfields and Bundaberg and Hervey Bay trial areas was secured in the budget in 2017-18. The cost to establish the trial and operate for one year in Ceduna and the East Kimberley, as you probably already know, was $17.8 million, with about 2,200 people on the trial in those sites from 2016. The additional cost for the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay trial areas, as negotiations are still underway, can't be finalised or advised.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (13:13):  Okay, so I'm not to place too much attention on that. Be that as it may, am I correct that the figures that we do know are that about $2.6 million has been spent or is dedicated to be spent on support services out of that $17.8 million that was committed for Ceduna and the Goldfields, which is roughly a seventh of the money?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (13:14):  I guess my question is going to the cost-benefit of even rolling this card out at all in the region. I've already noted in my consultations with the folk there—Kathryn Wilkes and Daniel Stafford in particular—that there is no support for this card and, in fact, they are crying out for money to be spent on funding services like homelessness and domestic violence shelters and education pathways and on creating jobs. So my question is: has the department or the minister, or anybody in charge of this, actually done that cost-benefit analysis of funding those support services? Surely they would reap far more social benefits, as QCOSS has pointed out. With the dubious benefits of the card so far, the evidence just isn't there to show that it works. In fact, there's the potential for social harm to increase. Why don't you just fund the services that we know work and help people. Surely doing at least a cost-benefit analysis of that is worthwhile. Is that on the cards? If so, can you tell me anything about it?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-09-11,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (13:15):  The view of the government is that you don't have to choose between the cashless card and support services. The government is committed to both. The first independent evaluation has shown that the card has a considerable positive impact in communities, including 48 per cent of drug-takers using fewer drugs, 41 per cent of drinkers drinking less and 48 per cent of gamblers gambling less. A recent media release from the mayor of Kalgoorlie, where the trial of the card began earlier this year, stated that all the indicators were positive.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (13:16):  When are you going to stop reiterating that, when, quite clearly, the ANAO report has shown that you do not have enough information to show there has been a reduction in social harm? As for Mayor Bowler, I pointed out very clearly during the last debate—I acknowledge that Minister Fifield was not in the chamber at the time—that WA Police have said that they cannot point to the cashless welfare card as being the body that's responsible for any reduction of antisocial activity in the Goldfields area, because their operation, Operation Fortitude I think it's called, was running at the time. So claims there has been a reduction in social harm are just not correct. The ANAO report has clearly pointed that out. For the record, people, please read the ANAO report, because it has shown that there is not the evidence to claim there has been a reduction in social harm. The statistics that were just quoted are cherry-picked from a very flawed analysis by Orima. Read the ANAO report and look at what they said about the data that was very conveniently not included in the analysis: the flawed approach to the survey of participants; the push-polling approach to the participants; and the fact that so many participants have said it's made their lives worse. In fact, when I was in Leonora the other day to discuss the storage of waste and uranium mining, which I'll talk about in the chamber at a later date, the issue of the card was raised with me there. A person who had previously been a supporter of the card is now on the card and, quite frankly—surprise, surprise—it's making their lives more difficult. They are unable to use it satisfactorily. So can we please not keep falsely claiming that this card is reducing social harm, because the evidence is not there to show that it is. At best, the evidence that the government uses is anecdotal. I can repeat many anecdotal examples that people have given directly to me. They have told me of the harm that it is causing them, the difficulty in using it and the many other concerns they have about the card, including being called 'druggies', being stigmatised, feeling humiliated and dealing with the difficulty of managing and using the card. So, please, don't keep repeating just what is handed to you by the government, which at best is basically just anecdotal points.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (13:20):  I tried to clarify those figures with you before, but unfortunately you weren't able to, so I seek some more clarity on whether the quantum of increased funding for support services that you would intend for the Bundaberg and Hinkler region would reflect the community's desire for funding for the homeless, domestic violence shelters, education pathways and job creation for young people, or whether that's just lip service to cover the fact that you want to paternalistically tell people what to do with their money.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:23):  I want to follow on with additional questions around cost. Our understanding is that the government has already paid $7.9 million to Indue. The government has also paid $1.6 million to ORIMA for their research report that has been referred to over the course of the debate. That has been heavily criticised, including by the Auditor-General, for providing essentially meaningless information about the success or otherwise of the program. We understand that the accrued cost of the cashless debit card trial up to 15 March this year is about $24 million for just two sites. Can you confirm that the cost of the trial across the two existing sites is well over $10,000 per person?

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:34):  I will just make a final remark about this. I can see that you question why this information is being sought. I would say this: this is a contract of significant value being let in the Goldfields and then there is a further one to be let in the Hervey Bay area. It goes to providing a service to government that many consider will be very intrusive and will certainly have significant impacts on the lives of individuals. There are serious questions being raised by the ANAO about the value for money that has been offered so far by the trials in the existing sites. I think there are real concerns about proceeding on the basis of such limited information. If the minister and, indeed, the government are in possession of information that would provide us with some detail about the kinds of costs associated with this—the value and the cost-effectiveness of what is being proposed—it would assist the Senate in considering the business before us. That is the basis of the previous series of questions asked by me.

What is the government's budget now that the Goldfields has been proceeded with and has gone ahead? Are you just going to keep using the commercial-in-confidence argument for everything when you don't want to tell us what something is costing? The trial has gone ahead. Why can't the government now tell us what their budget is for that area? Secondly, how can you tell us that this is now $2,000 a head when you don't know—and this is what I am taking from what you are saying—how much it's going to cost?

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:43):  Senator Storer's amendment goes to monitoring and evaluation. This has been a very significant issue in this debate so far, because you have already paid $1.6 million to a company called ORIMA Research, which provided an evaluation of the existing trial sites that a range of experts have essentially described as useless. The Auditor-General has said that the information was of such poor quality that it is not actually possible to say whether or not the trial was effective in any way. Their words, in particular, were:


… monitoring and evaluation was inadequate. As a consequence, it is difficult to conclude whether there had been a reduction in social harm and whether the card was a lower cost welfare quarantining approach.


Given that the evaluation process to date has been of such poor quality and has yielded so little information about whether this program is of any value whatsoever, what can you tell us about changes to the department's practice in terms of monitoring and evaluation that could provide any assurance at all that further monitoring and evaluation will produce anything of value?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (13:44):  As I indicated before, the department agrees with the ANAO's recommendations and notes that all recommendations are either covered by existing departmental practice or included in the continuation of the trial. Overall, there were appropriate arrangements and processes in place. However, the department does acknowledge the issues raised in the report and, where improvements can be made, the department has been making improvements to the trial and process over time and will continue to do so. These improvements will ensure the trial can continue to be effectively implemented and monitored. Senator Storer's amendments will require the government to conduct a review of any evaluation to ensure that the findings are accurate. We welcome Senator Storer's amendment and will be supporting it.

If the Minister or the Secretary causes a review of the trial of the cashless welfare arrangements mentioned … to be conducted …


What's the definition of 'review'? Is it the evaluation that's currently being undertaken, or is it something different, and does that mean that the evaluation is evaluated again?

Senator FIFIELD

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:47):  Minister, can I go back to the answer you provided to me earlier? I asked you what had changed in the department following the Auditor-General's scathing review of the monitoring and evaluation program. Your answer indicated that you accepted the Auditor-General's remarks but, in any case, they just confirmed existing departmental practice and you were putting in place arrangements to ensure that monitoring and evaluation continued. That doesn't sound to me like any meaningful or material change to the way the department thinks about these kinds of tasks. My real question to you is in the context of the amendment before us. Senator Storer is asking for serious monitoring and evaluation, and that is an objective that I support not just in the context of this kind of program but in all social policy. My question to you is: what has been learnt from the failures of the $1.6 million ORIMA review—what has materially changed in the way the department will conduct future reviews of this program?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts) (13:48):  The department has updated how it undertakes data monitoring and evaluation, including with the creation and appointment of the chief evaluator within the department. In order to build on the findings of the first evaluation report, the government has committed funding towards a second evaluation of the cashless debit card trial to further assess the ongoing effectiveness. The department has also developed a monitoring strategy to improve visibility of how the cashless debit card is being implemented. The strategy uses cashless debit card data collected by the department, the card provider and the Department of Human Services to ensure that the program is operating as intended, identifying potential issues and allaying concerns regarding the card.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:49):  Minister, the concerns that were articulated by the Auditor-General were essentially this: no baseline data was collected about participants' behaviours. Therefore, at the end of the trial, because no adequate baseline data was collected, it was not possible to evaluate whether or not any changes to people's wellbeing had taken place as a consequence of your intervention. What you've told me is that you've got some better processes in place to gather information about cost. Okay; perhaps that is an improvement. But the core issue that we're trying to test here is whether or not an intervention of this kind makes people's lives better. What is the department doing, in this second evaluation that it has now commissioned, to make sure that that can be meaningfully evaluated? And, incidentally, you mentioned a commitment of funding. What funding has been committed to the second evaluation?

Senator McALLISTER

The significant flaws in the existing evaluation have been referred to on many occasions in this debate, and an improved evaluation would be very welcome. We will, therefore, support your amendment. But I also wish to place on record my scepticism that it will improve things a great deal. Already $1.6 million of public money has been spent on a failed evaluation. I am not certain that the minister is capable of conducting a successful one.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and the Public Service (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Chisholm today relating to the Morrison Government.


Now that I look at the words I've just said, I think I'm being extremely generous to Senator Fifield in describing his response to Senator Chisholm as an answer because this is the question that several government ministers have now found impossible to answer over the course of this week and, in fact, over the last couple of weeks, ever since they deposed, knifed, killed off—however you want to put it—former Prime Minister Mr Turnbull. More than two weeks have now passed since Senator Cormann, Senator Fifield, Senator Cash and a number of other government frontbenchers knifed former Prime Minister Turnbull. Over two weeks have passed since then and not one of them has yet been able to explain to the Australian people or to this chamber why they took the actions they did. 



Senator Reynolds interjecting—




Senator WATT:
  I can hear Senator Reynolds over there. She at least had the decency to stick by former Prime Minister Turnbull, and a number of her colleagues did as well, but not one of the ministers whom we've asked these questions of has yet been able to give an answer as to why they thought it was so important for the government—or for the country, more importantly—that former Prime Minister Turnbull be killed off.


Senator Cormann has laboured through a number of answers over the course of this week, regaling us with stories about how the Westminster conventions work. I can assure him that most of us, having come to the Senate, have a little bit of an idea about that and we don't need a civics lesson from Senator Cormann. Senator Fifield took the same measures today, referring to Westminster conventions and how the Liberal Party works, and proceeded to explain to Senator McKenzie how the coalition works and how the National Party get no say in who the Liberal Party leader will be. 


The reason he did that was that Senator McKenzie on Q&A last night made the embarrassing admission that she had absolutely no idea why former Prime Minister Turnbull was knifed by the Liberal leader. We have not one government minister here able to explain why Mr Turnbull was knifed. The Deputy Leader of the National Party has no idea why Mr Turnbull was knifed. Is it any wonder that the Australian public are scratching their heads, struggling to understand why this government took the measure it did of killing off yet another Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, whom they all regarded as a massive disappointment but whom none disliked or hated in the same way they do former Prime Minister Abbott.


There's only one person, in fact, in this entire debate within the government who has carried himself with any decency, and that's the leader of the government in the House of Representatives, Mr Pyne. I'm sure members opposite will agree with my characterisation of Mr Pyne as a man of decency. Mr Pyne has at least had the good grace to admit that the question as to why so many government ministers decided it was important to kill off Mr Turnbull is a good question, and he has encouraged people to ask that question of those who took the knife to Mr Turnbull, which is exactly what we have been doing over the course of this week. Probably the best answer I've seen so far, or attempted answer that I've seen so far, from a government minister for why they had to kill off Mr Turnbull was from the new Prime Minister himself, Mr Morrison. This morning he was in the media trying to explain to people, 'We've been very good at the what but people want to know the why.' 




Senator Keneally:
  They do. They do want to know why.




Senator WATT:
  I don't know about you, Senator Keneally, but I had to read that statement several times to come even close to understanding what on earth he was going on about: the why, the why, the why. Clearly, Mr Morrison himself still doesn't know why he's the Prime Minister. He doesn't know why he's in government. He doesn't know why this government is still in government. They don't have any idea about what they want to achieve. What this means is that this is a government that is completely lost. They are hopelessly divided, they are leaking on each other day in, day out. Worse than that, they are lost about what they actually want to achieve for the Australian public. And who loses out of that? It's the Australian public, on the whole. 



Australians, for too long under this government, have been suffering from wages that aren't growing, from job insecurity that is growing and from the fact that everything they have to spend money on keeps going up but their wages aren't keeping pace with that either. Their health care is falling in quality, their schools aren't getting the funding that they need and their power prices keep going up under a government that can't get an energy policy. One of these days this government is going to have to explain why they knifed Malcolm Turnbull— (Timeexpired)

Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:10):  I do appreciate Senator Watt's efforts in being a history teacher to us all, trying to rake over the coals of history rather than looking forward. I thought he was getting there towards the end of his contribution, when he started talking about issues that actually do matter to the people of Australia—the people of Queensland, the people of Far North Queensland, that he purports to represent—but instead we spent the entire time on a series of questions talking about the inside of politics, the things that they think matter to people, because they've read it in the paper or they've watched it on SkyNews. They watched Credlin one Wednesday night, as I know Senator Keneally does, and they think that is what the real world is interested in—no. I have to give Senator Watt credit: he was getting there towards the end, talking about things like power prices, education and being able to ensure that Australians have jobs to go to so they can actually pay their bills, pay their power bills, pay their mortgages and send their kids to school. But, instead, as I say, the focus wasn't on that. There was a question that Senator Watt posed in his contribution just then—




Senator Watt:
  Why?




Senator DUNIAM:
  and it was: 'Who's the biggest loser out of this?' I want to put it back on Senator Watt. The opposition—an opposition which is sent down here to try and hold the government to account—spent the entire time asking questions about things that don't matter to real people, the people out there—




Senator Carol Brown:
  They want to know.




Senator DUNIAM:
  I'll take that interjection from Senator Brown. They want to know. Well, come out door knocking with me then, Senator Brown. Let's go. Let's take Senator Singh and we'll go doorknocking and we will see what people want to know about. They don't care about what happens down here. They want us to get on with our jobs and actually do things that improve their futures. The point I want to come to is: what is important? As was pointed out not only by Senator Fifield but by a number of other ministers that provided answers in response to a very similar question—




Senator Watt:
  Why?




Senator DUNIAM:
  I think Senator Watt should change his name to Senator Why. He keeps saying it, and I think it's probably more fitting—




Senator Watt:
  How?




Senator DUNIAM:
  Senator How, yes, true. We should look at the things that actually do matter—the achievements of this government. I'd love Senator Watt to get up and take note one day of all the good things that this government has been doing—for instance, the million jobs that have been created in this country since this government came to office in 2013. Why does he not—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Cormann:
  On a point of order: we're very tolerant on this side of the chamber, but there is persistent interjection, which you should be calling the opposition senators to order on.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Minister. I remind senators that senators do have the right to be heard in silence. Please allow Senator Duniam to continue without interjection.




Senator DUNIAM:
  I will try not to incite interjection. I'll go through some of the things that were referred to in question time today in response to what we, this side of the chamber—the government—think are important as opposed to insider political games, and as opposed to filling time slots on SkyNews to try and add to the political intrigue, which is what so many opposite do. As I said, a million jobs have been created since 2013. That's more than 1,000 jobs per day. That's something I know that people want to know about. When I go doorknocking, as I did in Braddon, and as I did during the state election campaign, that's what people were talking about. They weren't talking about insider politics in Canberra. That wasn't of interest to them. 


Although, if we are going to talk about insider politics, which is what the tone of the questions was about—and I know Senator Fifield made reference to this in his answer to Senator Chisholm's question—there was a bit of a history lesson in return, which I'm sure Senator Watt appreciated, about how collective decisions are made under the Westminster system. It is like the decision that was made in Tasmania over the weekend with regard to the Labor Senate ticket, which sadly saw Senator Singh relegated to the fourth position on the ticket again. If you want to start talking about this, we can go into what's going on in the Labor Party in Tasmania. We can talk about how Senator Singh, the most popular senator in Tasmania when it comes to the Labor side of politics, has been relegated to the fourth position, if you want to go over history.


As I said, I'd rather talk about the achievements of this government, including reducing the tax burden on the Australian people, which is a great achievement for small to medium businesses and is something that those opposite weren't too keen on at all. They thought, as I've said previously in this place, that taxpayers' money is better off in the pockets of government, so that they can spend it how they see fit: 'The government knows better than you, ladies and gentlemen of Australia! Let's rip it out of your hands and bring it down to Canberra, and we'll determine how it's spent.' That's something we reject. As has been reported on widely, this government has championed lowering taxes for small to medium businesses and indeed for individual Australian households. They know what is best. This government is listening, and we will do what is best for them, and that doesn't include playing political games—or as Senator Cormann said, political shenanigans—in Canberra. (Timeexpired)

"Keneally, Sen Kristina",ALP,2018-09-11,"




Senator KENEALLY
 (New South Wales) (15:15):  I also wish to take note of answers to questions asked of Minister Fifield, specifically the question of why Malcolm Turnbull is no longer the Prime Minister and why Scott Morrison is the 30th Prime Minister of Australia. Why? We are here today in this chamber, we were here yesterday and they were in the House yesterday and today, and no-one can answer this question. This is a question that remains unanswered. We heard last night on Q&A the Deputy Leader of the National Party, a minister in this Morrison government, Senator McKenzie, saying that she didn't know why the Liberal Party had changed their leaders. We've heard Christopher Pyne pose in public, on television—including even on SkyNews, about which Senator Duniam seems so concerned as to whether it has enough people available to fill its interview slots. Christopher Pyne, on his own show on SkyNews—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Keneally, I need to remind you to refer to those in the other place by their correct titles.




Senator KENEALLY:
  Thank you. Senator Duniam might observe that Mr Pyne, in the House of Representatives, the member for Sturt, observes on SkyNews that it's a very good question, why Scott Morrison is the Prime Minister, why Malcolm Turnbull is not the Prime Minister, and a question that has not been answered by those who have caused the insurrection and the instability within the Liberal Party. How does the foreign minister, Minister Marise Payne, explain to her counterpart in the United States, the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, why Malcolm Turnbull is no longer Prime Minister? How does she, in that first phone conversation, explain her position and what has happened to the former foreign minister, Julie Bishop? How does she explain that? Australia has got to explain to all its partners around the world why Scott Morrison is now the Prime Minister and why Malcolm Turnbull has been dumped by his own party.


It was incredibly interesting listening to Senator Duniam attempt, in his five minutes, to get to a list of achievements of this coalition government. Over the five-minute period he did manage to list two: job creation and reducing the tax burden. Let's take those in turn. When it comes to job creation, I would have thought that it did not need to be explained to the supposedly free market oriented Liberal Party that government does not create jobs—that is not what government does—and that the tax burden on ordinary Australians would be less under Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, and Labor's plan, and that the coalition walked into this Senate and voted against a greater tax cut for low- and middle-income people. This coalition voted against Labor's plan for those people.


So, it was interesting to listen to Senator Duniam attempt to get to some achievements of the coalition government under the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, because he didn't want to list too many, did he? If he lists too many achievements under Malcolm Turnbull's government, it makes Malcolm Turnbull sound like a good Prime Minister, which raises the question: why did they get rid of him? This is the problem the Liberal Party now has: how do they go about trying to own the supposed achievements of the Turnbull government yet maintain that Malcolm Turnbull needed to be dumped as Prime Minister? The reality is that they can't.


If you are going to seize the Prime Ministership of this great country, if you are going to put yourself forward as the leader, if you are going to do, as Scott Morrison says he has done, take charge—well, you'd better have a really good answer for the parliament and for the people of Australia about why you did it. If you don't have that, then how can people know why they should vote for you? Why would people decide to vote for a Prime Minister or a political party that can't even explain what they are doing occupying the office? 


I just want to end on this point: Shaun Carney of the HeraldSun wrote:


In our latest coup, Morrison and his ministers have gone another way: they just refuse to say. To hear ""ScoMo"" tell it in parliament yesterday, he got there as if by magic.


It's not magic; it's dark arts. It's the dark arts of the internal division of the Liberal Party, and the people of Australia are the ones who are losing out under this miserable coalition government.

Senator DEAN SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:20):  I, like other coalition senators, think it's time for Labor senators in this place to move on. What we heard about in question time today was very 24 August 2018. What people want to hear about and know about is: what are the plans for this government and what are the risks of the alternative government? I wish I was on the frontbench, because I will tell you why Malcolm Turnbull is not the Prime Minister. It's because some coalition people want the coalition to win the next election and beat Bill Shorten. That is the reason. That is the single reason. There's only one group of people in the whole country who care about the fact that Scott Morrison is the leader now, and that is the Labor Party, because, for the very first time in a while, the comfort zone that they were beginning to experience is evaporating. You know that you are about to have an electoral contest. You know that. You weren't going to have an electoral contest with Malcolm Turnbull. You were getting comfortable. You were getting ready for government. Only under Scott Morrison is Labor beginning to worry that the next election will be a very, very real contest.


Why do I want Scott Morrison as the leader of the Liberal Party? Because he will beat Bill Shorten. And why don't I want Bill Shorten to be the leader of the country? Because he'll impose higher taxes. He will slow down economic growth. Senator Keneally says: 'Oh! The coalition senators can't name any achievements.' I'll name 21 of them. This is a powerful insight into how Senator Keneally thinks. She thinks the coalition government's achievements are owned by one person. They're not owned by one person; they're owned by the coalition government. 



Senator Keneally interjecting—




Senator DEAN SMITH:
  Senator Keneally, when you were the Premier of New South Wales, were the achievements of your government only your achievements? Were they not the achievements of your colleagues? It's a powerful insight into how Senator Keneally thinks. Watch this space, ladies and gentlemen. Watch this space.


The 21 reasons are: a stronger economy; more jobs; less welfare dependency; income tax relief; smaller tax cuts; instant asset write-offs; less red tape; more affordable energy; fixing the budget; record infrastructure spending; tackling union unlawfulness, and we'll come back to this in a moment; secure borders; fighting terror; a stronger Defence Force; more affordable child care; better health care; more school funding; supporting seniors; welfare to work; and lifesaving medicines. These are the achievements of the coalition government and the achievements of every cabinet minister and minister responsible for having delivered on those for the last five years. They're not the achievements of one man—not Tony Abbott alone, not Malcolm Turnbull alone, not Scott Morrison alone when he was the Treasurer—but the achievements of an entire government over five years. 


It's only Labor that is worried about the new leader of the Liberal Party and the new leader of the coalition government. People should be very, very alert to the risks that a Labor government would present to this country. It's interesting that, in the last week, Labor could have talked about a number of things. They could have talked about the economy. Senator Duniam is absolutely correct in this. They could have talked about what they were willing to do or would be willing to do in government to tackle trade union unlawfulness—or, put less politely, trade union bullying. These are not accusations that coalition senators make against the trade union movement or against Labor senators, but accusations, comments or observations that are made by court judges themselves.


I'm not someone who wants to spend another moment talking about accusations of bullying in this parliament, because what Australians absolutely hate is hypocrisy. Everyone's performance, everyone's personal conduct in this place, without exception, can always be improved upon. The best way to do that is not to approach it with— (Timeexpired)

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:25):  What we saw in the chamber today in question time—more than two weeks on from the change in the leadership when they tore down the previous Prime Minister—was that they still can't answer a very, very simple question, and that is: why do we have a new Prime Minister? Why do the Australian people have to put up with an illegitimate Prime Minister, someone they didn't vote for? The reason those opposite can't answer that question is: they've all got different reasons as to why it happened, so they can't actually agree as to what the reason was.


There are basically four different motivations from those opposite for why they tore down Malcolm Turnbull and foisted upon us and installed an illegitimate Prime Minister in Scott Morrison. Let's explore those four reasons. There are basically four groups. We know them quite well.


First there are the anyone-but-Turnbulls. We know those ones; there's former Prime Minister Abbott, and in this chamber they're represented by Senator Abetz. They would basically vote for anyone but Malcolm Turnbull. If the alternative to Malcolm Turnbull was Mickey Mouse, they'd vote for Mickey Mouse—or for a muppet, I should say, given how they've described it. We know their motivation, because basically their careers or their ministerial careers ended on the day that Malcolm Turnbull became Prime Minister all those years ago. So that's their motivation.


Then we have those who run with them, who are basically on the extreme right of the Liberal Party. They just can't stand anything that Malcolm Turnbull, the former Prime Minister, supposedly stood for. So they were never ever going to cop him, and they have used every opportunity they've had to undermine the government. So they're the second group, basically.


Then the third group were the Dutton backers. They are probably the saddest group of all, because they, at some stage, must have thought that Peter Dutton, the minister, would make a good Prime Minister. That's actually quite scary. It probably says a fair bit about Malcolm Turnbull and how useless he was as a Prime Minister that there was a group opposite, the third group, who thought that Peter Dutton, as Prime Minister, would do a better job.


Then there's the fourth group, the Turnbull supporters, who obviously stuck with Malcolm Turnbull until the end. We know that there was some toing and froing from the Senate leader, Senator Cormann, in that regard. At the end of the day he wasn't part of that group. But there were others in this chamber and in the other place who stuck loyally to the former Prime Minister.


If you think about those four groups, they've all got such different motivations. Up through the middle came the current Prime Minister—the current, illegitimate Prime Minister in Scott Morrison. But none of them can actually agree as to how or why he got there. That's the fundamental problem that they have. That's why they can't actually answer this question as to why we have a new Prime Minister.


The Australian public deserve so much better. You need to be honest with them. You need to actually say why we got rid of the former Prime Minister. Explain the reasons why. Be up-front and honest with the Australian people. They deserve better than what you mob are giving them at the moment. What we know—and this goes to those four groups I talked about and to the dysfunction of the Liberal Party—is that, no matter what the issue is, they are completely dysfunctional. We also saw today that the coalition government is dysfunctional as well. Senator McKenzie, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, was unable to provide any clarity on TV on Q&A last night or in this chamber today. So you've got the Liberals, who can't answer the question about why we have this illegitimate Prime Minister. You've got the Nationals, who aren't providing any support to them. And the Australian public are, subsequently, being treated like mushrooms.


What we know with the coalition and the Liberal Party is that they are completely divided. They're split when it comes to leadership, they're split when it comes to personality and they're split when it comes to policy. We know that they have been focused on their own internal divisions for more than two years now. The Australian people democratically elected the Prime Minister just over two years ago. Yet they've disposed of him and they provide no justification and no explanation to the Australian people. The Australian people deserve so much better than what the Liberal Party has dished up in the last two weeks since they disposed of the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull.


When it comes to the illegitimate Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, we know what his record is. We know he stands for cuts to health and education. We know that he opposed a banking royal commission 26 times. We know he supports tax cuts for big banks and big business. That is a continuation of what the Turnbull government stood for. That's all we're seeing when it comes to the new Prime Minister, Scott Morrison.

read


as


follows—



The Commonwealth Places and Services (Facial Recognition) Bill 2018 ('theBill') seeks to require that individuals:


attending public places throughout a territory or Commonwealth place,


attending Centrelink offices anywhere in the nation, or 


whilst swearing allegiance to Australia in citizenship ceremonies, 


must not do so wearing a full face covering.


Full or near-full face-coverings have never been part of Australian culture, nor should they be. 


The controversy over full face coverings has emerged due to the various forms of facial veils worn by migrants, particularly from parts of the Middle East.


The burqa, or burka - in particular - is a full facial covering that by design is meant to be confronting to the observer. 


A slightly lesser version, the niqab, allows the eyes to be visible but nothing else.


A leading flashpoint on this debate about the burqa and niqab has been the Arab Republic of Egypt – a nation with a predominantly Muslim population. MP Amna Nosseir, professor of comparative jurisprudence at Al-Azhar University and member of Egypt's Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, backed a ban on face-coverings, saying the veils are not required by Islam and indeed argued it had Jewish, not Islamic, origins on the Arabian Peninsula prior to the emergence of Islam. On that note, the niqab is a cultural, not religious, tradition once worn by women of various beliefs in the Ottoman empire. Its use was most common within harems of concubines, sometimes guarded by eunuchs, but nonetheless seen as the right of elites – not the poor – to wear. The original utility of the burqa was for desert lands, particularly keeping out dust-storms.


Nossier argued that Quran passages contradict its use and she advocated that the Quran called for modest clothing and covered hair, not facial covering. In 2009 an imam from Al-Azhar issued a fatwa against wearing a full facial covering. Cairo University has banned academic staff wearing the niqab in classrooms, a ban that was subsequently upheld in court. During the October 2015 elections, women were required to remove the veil to be identified at polling stations.


In early May 2010, I expressed on my WeeklyDoseofCommonSense blog website that the burqa has no place in modern Australia. A king tide of political correctness rose up, complete with the froth of confected outrage carried on the winds of left-wing hypocrisy. 


I have remained consistent on this front, ever since – and now, other nations have adopted the position I expressed over 8 years ago.


France banned the burqa from 11 April 2011.


Belgium's ban came into effect after France's in 2011, although it had started the debate beforehand. 


It is important to note that Belgium and France's bans withstood court challenges thanks to a 2014 European Court of Human Rights ruling that upheld them, saying they do not breach human rights. The Court ruled, for instance, that Belgium had a right to regulate

Since 2013, parts of the Catalonia region in Spain have bans on burqas and niqab.


A limited ban was imposed on the burqa in the Netherlands in 2015, but it was expanded earlier this year. The burqa and niqab are now banned in schools, hospitals, on public transport and within government buildings. 


Chancellor Angela Merkel said on 6 December 2016 that the wearing of full faced veils should be prohibited in Germany 'wherever it is legally possible'. In 2017 Germany banned wearing the full face covering whilst driving. 


Bulgaria, Latvia and parts of Switzerland banned the burqa in public places in 2016. Estonia is considering following suit, as did Austria in 2017. 


The independent-thinking and culturally proud Canadian province of Quebec banned people with a covered face from delivering or receiving a public service in October 2017. Exemptions are available on case-by-case bases. The status of this law is unclear as it is stayed pending a court challenge, which President Trudeau has declined to participate in from a federal level.


Denmark, part of the often hailed socialist paradise states of Scandinavia, legislated a ban on wearing the niqab or burqa from 1 August this year. Norway banned the burqa in nurseries, schools and universities earlier this year. I note that bill passed by 91 votes to 8. 


Northern and Western African nations Chad, Cameroon, Congo-Brazzaville and Niger have also banned the burqa in some or all of their territories, largely on national security grounds. Suicide bombings have occurred in some of those countries by fully veiled individuals.


Full facial coverings make a mockery of our intelligence and national security apparatus. Our policing and national security arrangements rely to an increasing extent on closed-circuit television, body-worn cameras, facial recognition and identity-matching technology. Yet those wearing a facial covering can escape detection using that technology. An individual wearing a balaclava in public places, a Centrelink office or at a citizenship ceremony would immediately attract suspicion as to their criminal intent, but not if they are wearing other types of facial coverings.


Members of the judiciary have started to insist that full face coverings be removed in Court. Victorian Supreme Court Justice Beale ordered a woman to remove her niqab while attending her husband's trial, allegedly a first in a Victorian court.


In modern Australia, we can not support the propagation of such ancient, demeaning attitudes towards women as the imposition of a burqa or niqab. 


Indeed, one recalls a speech in the other place in late 2012 by Australia's first female prime minister concerning misogyny that received worldwide attention.


There are no greater examples of misogyny than the burqa and niqab.


It is inexplicable to think that women's advocates have been successful in supporting women's right to breastfeed their children in public – say, at a restaurant – but sitting at the next table, a woman has to eat very carefully handing food under her face covering lest her face or any other part of her body or attire be seen. 


In 2006 the former head of Tourism Australia, Mr Scott Morrison, launched an ad campaign which was banned in the United Kingdom for a short time, and caused a media storm. The 'So, Where the Bloody Hell Are you?' campaign featured the bikini clad Lara Bingle encouraging the world to visit our wonderful, free country. Incidentally, then Minister Fran Bailey said the campaign added $4.2 billion to the industry's bottom line after 12 months, thanks in part to the free publicity of the British ban. Yet for this brash campaign Minister Bailey dismissed Mr Morrison from his well-paid job, but then chair of Tourism Australia, Mr Tim Fischer, later said ""Scott deserves full credit for the 'So, Where the Bloody Hell Are You?' campaign. It took some courage to run that campaign and he saw it through."" 


Here is another opportunity to show courage and see it through. 


It is hard to believe that the same Australia that advertised its desirability to the world through a woman in a bikini, under a Prime Minister who conceived the campaign, would also allow the propagation of a teaching that women must be fully covered lest a man think inappropriately about her. One wonders, indeed, how men demanding full facial and body coverings cope in modern Australia, with so few women covered as their culture allows. 


One young Afghan-born migrant resident in Victoria, in fact, crumbled under the house of cards of misogyny, when he swam between the flags at Surfers Paradise and spent two hours grabbing women aged between 15 and 24 years on their bottoms, breasts and in three cases their vaginas. He pleaded guilty, ultimately, to nine sexual assaults and three common assaults. The offending only stopped when three women asked a lifeguard to notify the police. He was sentenced in April 2017 as a juvenile, to two years' probation with no conviction recorded.


Just let that sink in.


It is the proponents of the burqa and niqab who are out of step with modern Australia, not us.


Indeed, the only remaining ground upon which some seek to wear the burqa or niqab – or compel their wives and daughters wear them – is as a symbol of defiance to 'colonial' or incumbent 'infidel' powers. These, too, are attitudes unwelcome in our own country.


Among other rationales for this legislation, it can be argued that it will strengthen the hand of moderates within migrant communities against radicals and fundamentalists opposed to Australian democratic principles and freedom. I have had them approach me in Adelaide, telling me they agree with my views on facial veils. They are concerned about aggressive radicals in their midst, and hope their moderate views will prevail.


The modern day impetus for the burqa and niqab arises from the unfortunate 1979 Iranian revolution. There are plenty of historical pictures of Iranian women living without any facial coverings whatsoever prior to the revolution. The fundamentalists behind the overthrow of the Shah inspired, particularly, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to adopt similar regressive traditions. It is an ideology and cultural-political practice that has since spread by aggressive propagation throughout the Middle East, Asia, Africa and now the West – and most glaringly at the hands of the Taliban in Afghanistan.


How remarkable it is that Australian soldiers and their families that fought for the Afghan people's freedom from the radical Taliban, should now be expected to welcome in Australian society one of the key marketing mechanisms of the Taliban – the burqa.


Indeed, the Afghan story runs long in Australian society, giving its name to the 'Ghan' train line. Yet those cameleers and their families, despite holding the same religious beliefs, did not bring, insist upon or impose a burqa in Australia. Surely with similar desert and dusty conditions, the original Afghan migrants would have readily deployed the burqa in Australian conditions. They didn't. 


The Conservative Party's view is that 21st century migrants must do exactly as most 19th and 20th century migrants did - assimilate into Australian culture and participate in our social and economic life. As such, their prospects of employment and acceptance into Australian culture are enhanced by Australians being able to see their faces and interact with them socially. 


I have been critical for many years of these face coverings which are exclusively worn by women at the behest of men. 


The structure of this bill addresses Commonwealth places, Commonwealth services and citizenship ceremonies.


When attending public places in a territory – including all of the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory and other territories – persons must do so with their face uncovered. 


Face coverings will also need to be removed in the six state capital city airports and Coolangatta airport as 'Commonwealth Places' under the CommonwealthPlaces(ApplicationofLaws)Regulation2014. For tourists, this would be addressed via travel advisories, no different to the circumstances in other countries with similar bans and, indeed, no different to the advice our government gives to citizens visiting Saudi Arabia as to how they need to behave to avoid jeopardy under that kingdom's criminal laws.


If the wearer enters Commonwealth public places with a full face covering, a first offence attracts 1 penalty unit ($210, until 1 July 2020), followed by 5 penalty units for a second offence and for the defiance of third and subsequent offences, 10 penalty units or 1 month's imprisonment.


We are guided by examples from overseas where full face coverings have been banned in public places. These bans have occurred in democratic nations similarly concerned about the social acceptability and amenity of full face coverings in modern society. 


So as not to be open to unintended consequences, defences are provided if a full face covering is required for:


the lawful pursuit of an occupation – say, welding, advertising wearing a promotional costume or working with toxic chemicals


participating in lawful entertainment, recreation or sport – say, in a fencing event, performing as a football team mascot or bee-keeping


a genuine artistic purpose – for instance, a theatre performance 


protection from physical harm – say, wearing bandages after a serious facial injury or surgery, and


any other purpose not foreseen that can be resolved swiftly by regulation.


A related offence is created to ensure that responsibility for such offending by minors is sheeted home to the parents or other guardians who are compelling them to do so.


We have also been cautious to ensure that 'public place' is tightly defined so as not to impede the free practice of worship or marriage ceremonies. It is also our clear intention that private residences are not considered public places for the purposes of these amendments to the Commonwealth Criminal Code.


The attendance at citizenship ceremonies is arguably the highest form of affirmation of the significance of becoming, and being, an Australian. In some instances it means, by implication, the automatic or compulsory forfeiture of citizenship in another country. Of course we know from the extensive exposition of section 44 of our Constitution in this place of late that dual citizenship can arise after attaining Australian citizenship. Yet the swearing of an oath or affirmation of allegiance to Australia may be the most solemn statement a migrant makes in their life aside from their wedding vows. As such, it should be respected for the solemn and symbolic occasion that it is. For a person to wear the flag of fundamentalism, a symbol of oppression of women, from another country in the form of a burqa or niqab, is at best a slap in the face to Australia. At worst it is a cynical act of defiance, a connivance to attain all of the benefits of Australian citizenship without any allegiance to our nation. How can an observer detect the sincerity, or mockery, in the person swearing such an oath with their face covered? As I said, the other solemn swearing of an oath is in marriage, and in Australian tradition, the veil over the bride is lifted by that point in the ceremony so the beneficiary of the vow can detect its sincerity.


We affirm the solemnity of the citizenship ceremony and believe that all who partake in it should do likewise – with faces uncovered.


In relation to the receipt of social security services, there are likely many instances where a Centrelink office is not situated on Commonwealth land but is a place where a Commonwealth service is delivered. More specifically, attendance at Centrelink is essential to begin receiving the generous social security benefits that a significant cohort of migrants have desired in coming here. The Australian taxpayer is giving money to individuals for their welfare, and it is the least that we can ask that the recipient – be they a citizen, permanent resident or otherwise – respect our laws and culture by removing their face covering when doing so. It is also remarkable that nobody can enter a bank wearing a motorcycle helmet covering their face, but can enter a Centrelink office wearing a face covering. It is also important to be certain that the recipient is the intended recipient – something difficult to verify while the face remains covered. 


Indeed, the requirement to remove the facial covering in a Centrelink office in a State might be the moment of reprieve that subjugated women get. With modern concerns about protecting women from domestic violence and children from abuse, it may be liberating for the women and the staff they engage with to make face contact. Human conversation and empathy is partly verbal, and partly reading facial expression. Without it, identifying a woman or child in need might be missed.


This Bill is about equality for women. We hear in this place many claiming to uphold the rights and equality of women, and for them this Bill is a clear, unambiguous test. They will either side with cultures and ideologies other than Australia's, or with Australian culture and women who deserve to be seen, and heard.

A minister that's not even going to be there when the motion is moved in the last two days of this week. What signal does this send the Japanese government?

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:17):  It's taken only a few weeks for the new Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, to show not once, not twice, but repeatedly that he doesn't care about the wellbeing or welfare of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex Australians. Since becoming Prime Minister, Scott Morrison has stated that he wants to govern for all Australians. He's told us that he's on our side. But, sadly, that doesn't seem to include LGBTIQ Australians. There have been several opportunities for the Prime Minister to stand in solidarity with LGBTIQ people, but instead he has supported the attacks on our communities and on LGBTIQ people, particularly young people.


Let's start with his reaction to an article that was in TheDailyTelegraph. It was a fearmongering article about a program that exists to support young trans and gender-diverse kids. But, typically of the Tele, it ignored the facts in favour of click bait. It was, frankly, a load of hogwash. The article quoted an unqualified so-called 'gender expert' with links to the Australian Christian Lobby who had been an office-bearer of Fred Nile's Christian Democratic Party. This so-called expert was happy enough to label support for trans kids as 'dangerous' but failed to mention the existing guidelines that outline appropriate care for trans kids. These guidelines are extensive and they outline that all treatment provided has to be in the best interests—and is in the best interests—of the child. It's proportional. It's administered with consent and ongoing support. This treatment is given to a tiny proportion of children, all of whom are trans and gender diverse, and this support for trans kids often saves lives.


This unqualified 'expert' who was quoted in TheDailyTelegraph insinuated that providing support to transgender kids is harmful and dangerous. But the reality is that not providing support is very harmful and very dangerous. This article was widely condemned, as it should have been, yet our newly appointed Prime Minister decided to share the article on Facebook with the words:


We do not need 'gender whisperers' in our schools. Let kids be kids.


Unbelievable!


Firstly, memo to the Prime Minister: some kids are trans, some kids are gay, lesbian and bisexual and some kids are questioning their gender identity or their sexuality, and these kids need to be allowed to be the kids they are and they need to be supported by their families, communities, schools and representatives in parliament. Secondly, does anyone really believe that kids can be 'whispered' into changing their gender? I've met lots of trans kids and lots of trans adults who were once trans kids and, indeed, we had a delegation of trans kids and their families in the parliament two years ago, hosted by the Parliamentary Friendship Group for LGBTIQ Australians, and every parliamentarian who met them was incredibly impressed by them. Being trans is not something that a child takes on lightly. It's not a choice. It's who they are. Unlike most people who are born cisgender, where their gender identity matches their biology, that's not the case for trans kids. Most of them struggle with this because our society struggles with it. They need love and acceptance. They need support to help them to be proud of who they are, to help them love themselves for who they are.


In contrast, imagine being a young trans kid or gender-diverse kid and seeing your Prime Minister talk about you in that way? LGBTIQ young people experience worse mental health outcomes than heterosexual and cisgender young people and it's because of behaviour like this from our so-called leaders. I wonder if the Prime Minister knows some of the statistics about LGBTIQ people—that 16 per cent of LGBTIQ young people aged 16 to 27 have attempted suicide in the last 12 months or that almost one in two trans young people have attempted suicide in their lifetime. Compare that to the 2.4 per cent of young people in the general population who have. I'd like the Prime Minister to think about that—that young trans kids are 20 times more likely to attempt suicide. The Prime Minister's language and attacks on LGBTIQ people are totally unacceptable and harmful. A Prime Minister should serve for all of us, not just those of us who are cisgender or heterosexual.


This is just one of the examples of the attacks against LGBTIQ Australians that are being supported by the Prime Minister. Scott Morrison has barely settled into the job, yet he's made every effort to demonise LGBTIQ people. He has done so much damage in such a short time. Last week, he refused to condemn dangerous LGBTIQ conversion attempts and the ideology that drives them, saying it wasn't an issue for him. I'm so pleased that this Senate has just passed a motion condemning those attempts and calling upon this government to work with the states and territories to ban sexual orientation and gender identity conversion efforts. He said this wasn't an issue for him after survivors of conversion attempts and sexual orientation change efforts sent an open letter to the Prime Minister and the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, calling for a multipartisan crackdown on these dangerous, harmful practices.


It's important to note that attempts to change gender identity and sexual orientation are widely condemned. In 2015, there was a report from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights which included so-called conversion therapy in its list of practices categorised as torture and ill-treatment—yet the Prime Minister says it's not a matter for him.


The UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Amnesty International and a number of religious and community leaders have called for the criminalisation of these practices, so for the Prime Minister to dismiss this as an issue that's not for him is an absolute disregard of duty. The survivors' statement that was presented to the Prime Minister draws attention to the fact that these practices are still occurring here today in Australia. It points out that the conversion movement extends further than formalised so-called therapeutic practices, with gender and sexual orientation change efforts pervading an unknown proportion of religious organisations, faith based organisations, schools and the counselling industry. This statement calls for Australian elected reps to work actively towards curtailing the movement by pursuing strategies that seek to identify and counteract its influence through a combination of legislation, regulation, investment and community education. That's what our Prime Minister needs to embrace if he is going to support LGBTIQ young people and people in general, rather than decrying them.


The statement that was presented to him outlined the awful impacts that these practices have on survivors, and I quote where it says that survivors of the ex-gay, ex-trans conversion therapy movement and sexual orientation change efforts:


… have endured and survived a system which dehumanised and shamed them, despite their sense of deep devotion and connection to their faith community


I've had the privilege of meeting some of these survivors. Their stories are harrowing, but it's important that they're heard.


All LGBTIQ people should be able to practice faith without pressure to change or to suppress their gender identity or their sexual orientation. There's so much that can be done—that should be done—to ensure that LGBTIQ people are all equal, safe, supported and thriving, and if the PM needs some ideas about where to start, he can just give me a call. All Australians need to feel that the Prime Minister of this country has their back.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Defence) (16:27):  I too rise to speak to this motion brought forward by Senator Siewert on behalf of the Greens.


Senator Siewert, I'd have to say, is somebody that I have worked with collaboratively in the past. One of the positive things about this place is work on issues of common interest. The Community Affairs Committee did an inquiry into rural health, and there was actually very constructive work done. Often, this is something that the public, who only see question time, don't see. But most of the work in this place can be constructive.


The comment in this motion, though, I take largely as a political comment, because it talks about attacks. And we've just had Senator Rice saying 'demonise'. I have to say that I don't see Prime Minister Morrison demonising or attacking anyone. The thing that I see being attacked here is the very nature of Australia's democracy. For a democracy to work, you have to accept that there will be a plurality of views—that people can have different views. Those views should be respected and people should be able to speak to those views without being hounded or labelled by other people.


This issue is very near and dear to Senator Rice; I accept that, and I respect her right to state her position. But what I don't accept is the increasing tendency of people, when they hear a view that they don't agree with, to shout down that view or seek to silence or shame somebody for sharing it.


I know that we can have respectful debates. A year or so ago I was asked to chair a Senate select committee looking at the issue of religious freedoms, should the nation legislate for same-sex marriage. I'm pleased to report that we had a wide range of stakeholders who came to give evidence to that committee. The tone that we set, as a committee, meant that people were able to put their views succinctly and respectfully, and argue their case without being labelled and without being put down by anybody else in the debate.


So it is possible. But what we see, increasingly, is that when somebody who speaks against a view that is popular or a view that is current—particularly, I'd have to say, on the progressive or left side of our community—those who disagree with that seek to silence them, either by labelling them as 'haters', or, in this case, as somebody who has demonised or attacked. Sometimes, literally, it's a case of shouting down the pure volume we see on university campuses sometimes, where speakers are literally shouted down, through to physical obstruction—in some cases violence—or even attempting to use the institutions of state to silence the dissent of somebody who has a different view. We've seen in the recent past people like Archbishop Porteous, who in a very respectful manner put forward the Catholic Church's position on the definition of marriage and yet was hauled before a tribunal.


We see, even this last week, reports about a faith based organisation where the CEO, during the debate around same-sex marriage, wrote to employees saying what the position of the organisation was and encouraging people to support the traditional definition of marriage. They made it very clear that every individual should be supported, respected and valued for who they are, and yet that organisation has been taken before a tribunal in Queensland. Thankfully, the charge of discrimination has been dropped, but there is still a matter outlying in terms of general discrimination that they are facing. Yet executives of large corporations who supported the approach to say their employees should support a redefinition of marriage to the extent of wearing particular jewellery or other items weren't held to account in any way for disrespecting the rights of those employees who have a different view. There is a real double standard at work here. It's a problem. It's a problem for our democracy. The more people say, 'You don't have a right to express your view,' the more they are shouted down and the more they are labelled, particularly in an era of social media where people can go online—whichever particular platform they choose to use—and it reinforces their views.


We have seen many studies looking at what they call the 'echo chamber effect' where people's biases, prejudices or points of view are reinforced to the extent that they almost find it hard to conceive that anybody of goodwill, intellect or moral character could hold a position which is contrary to theirs. That is a bad outcome for our democracy, because our democracy requires that people who have a dissenting view are allowed to put forward that view, and particularly that the power of the state is not used or co-opted to suppress that dissenting view. To take it to its logical extension, you see totalitarian states where the government suppresses dissenting views. You've only got to look back to last century—Stalin who murdered some 30 million of his own people, Mao some 45 million and Pol Pot—to see the authoritarian approaches used to suppress dissent amongst tens of millions of people by those who felt that they could override the rights of those people who had a differing view. It is really important for Australia to say: 'What kind of nation do we want to be?' If we don't want to even get on the path to being like one of those autocracies where there is no allowance for dissent, every individual citizen and every organ of the government needs to allow for people to express different views, without shouting them down or labelling them.


In the case of the Prime Minister, we have a very clear indication of what he believes, because he articulated this just recently in his speech at Albury. He reinforced the fact that he believes in the value of individuals, of all individuals. He reinforced his belief in the value of family and the love and the support that they can provide as a framework, and the importance of supporting that wherever possible; the value of community; the value of housing and health care being affordable and accessible to all. He emphasised his belief in the importance of a stable job and good pay, and that explains why this government has put so much priority on the creation of new jobs, because it is the best possible form of welfare that lifts people out of poverty and gives them a hope for the future. That's why, since 2013, over a million jobs have been created, the majority of which are full time. But, for people who distrust employment figures, the other way to look at it is that we have now reached the lowest level of working-age people on welfare in 25 years. It demonstrates that, no matter which way you move the figures, people are moving off welfare and into work, and that includes, just last year alone, 95,500 young people, the majority of whom have moved into full-time work, and that is the largest amount in 30 years. 


Mr Morrison also highlighted his belief in freedoms—the freedom of faith, the freedom of speech, the freedom of association—which are fundamental to the working of a plural democracy such as Australia. He talked about his belief in the fair go; equal opportunity, not just mandating equal outcomes; lower taxes; the fact that we got rid of the carbon tax; lowering personal income tax; reducing tax for small businesses so that they have the opportunity to employ more people, which is what has been happening and which is why we've seen that increase of over a million new jobs. He has talked about his belief in the security of Australia, which is why we have committed to increasing it to two per cent of GDP and why we have committed to a paradigm shift where we are seeing defence industry as a fundamental input to our capability. We are creating thousands of new jobs through the investment we are making in new defence capability. We are creating opportunities—in fact, just last week in South Australia, in partnership with the Marshall government, we launched a $203 million program to create 20,000 new traineeships and apprenticeships. 


The Prime Minister has highlighted his belief in health and education and the fact that we are making record payments, despite the rhetoric of those opposite, who reference against the benchmark of a promise that was made by Prime Minister Rudd, just before he was defeated, to an unfunded, unrealistic amount. They keep referencing that. The reality is this government has made payments every year that have increased the amount that is being paid to record amounts in both health and education. Finally, the Prime Minister said it was important to love not only our immediate family but all Australians.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (16:37):  I'm delighted to support this MPI this afternoon, because our Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, is no friend of Australia's LGBTI community. They've reached out to me to tell me about their concerns about Scott Morrison's appointment as Prime Minister, and I share their concerns. I will give you some of the reasons why the community is so appalled by his appointment. He defended and praised Israel Folau when he said that gay people were going to hell. Our Prime Minister said that he had shown a lot of strength of character. Our Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, was a vocal opponent of marriage equality. He was one of the drivers of the divisive postal survey, and he did this as a way to try to obstruct this nation's path to marriage equality. He campaigned actively for the no case and voted no during the postal survey. To add insult to injury, he supported amendments to the bill to allow for discrimination against LGBTI people within the Marriage Act. Our Prime Minister then went on to abstain from the vote, ignoring the will of the Australian people and, indeed, the will of the people within his own electorate. He was one of a handful of people to abstain from this vote, and he was joined by a handful of other MPs, including Andrew Hastie, Tony Abbott and Kevin Andrews. It is of no surprise to me that it is this same group of conservative MPs who were part of the push to replace Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister. 


Let's be clear: this homophobic, anti-gay agenda is core to a key grouping within the coalition and motivated them to roll Malcolm Turnbull. So we are legitimate in the concerns that we have regarding the influence of these hard-right Liberal and National MPs inside the Morrison government. But we in Labor and the LGBTI community will not be complacent. We know we've achieved marriage equality, but we know that the growing conservative control in the Liberal Party means we could see the reversal of rights that we have fought so long and hard for.


It is of no surprise to me that, to continue this agenda, Prime Minister Morrison has voiced his concern about 'gender whispering' in our schools. I saw Mr Morrison trying to defend these statements, but I would like to tell it as Evie said it. Evie said:


I'm Evie, I'm 13, and I'm a transgender kid, and this is what I want to say to the Prime Minister … There are thousands of kids in Australia that are gender diverse. We don't deserve to be disrespected like that through tweets from our Prime Minister.


We know that Prime Minister Morrison has said Australian schools don't need gender whisperers. Australian schools don't have gender whisperers. What we have are school communities and teachers that need to reach out to students of all backgrounds to support them in their needs, be they having a disability, be they having a learning issue, be they gender diverse or be they lesbian or gay. It's simply not good enough to fail to support inclusive environments for our nation's children, and that is the signal that Scott Morrison is sending. Frankly, it's akin to when Senator Hanson tried to argue that autistic children should not be in the same classrooms as other children. It is simply divisive and is marginalising young people and students in our schools. Evie went on to explain that she:


… I went to a Christian school where I had to pretend to be a boy and spend weeks in conversion therapy.


She said:


We get one childhood and mine was stolen from me by attitudes like this.


It's all very well for Prime Minister Morrison to talk about his love for all Australians whatever background they come from, but that's code for saying, 'Love the sinner but not the sin.' We know that that is what Scott Morrison means when he says these things. He does not support LGBTI Australians in having self-determination and inclusion in our community. Young LGBTI Australians face disadvantage that is greater than what their adult counterparts face, because of the addition of their youth. They have a lack of their own economic autonomy, they can't vote and they are not represented in policymaking in this nation. Research has shown that they endure discrimination, social exclusion and socioeconomic and cultural disadvantages. They're overrepresented in our homelessness population. They're more likely to experience homelessness due to poor mental health; poor physical health; substance abuse; physical, sexual and emotional abuse; being placed in state care or family violence.


I tell you that the reason these things happen to young LGBTI people is not that there is anything intrinsically wrong with being gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex; the reason these conditions are prevalent among young LGBTI people is the exclusion that they experience from the likes of our Prime Minister and other discrimination from people in the community. It is why the step that we took forward in relation to marriage equality in this nation was so important. But it shows that it is not enough, because this government has within it those that are determined to continue to propagate discrimination and exclusion of the LGBTI community. We know that their lack of visibility furthers their vulnerability. We know that 61 per cent of LGBTIQ youth have stated that they experience abuse because of their sexuality or gender, that 18 per cent have reported physical abuse and that they're more than five times as likely to commit suicide.


The Prime Minister's statements such as 'gender whisperer' reinforce transphobic rhetoric. Transgender people in our nation are more than 11 times as likely to commit suicide. This is a classic populist and divisive move by our Prime Minister when this government's numbers are down in the polls. He is seeking to ignite hate-fuelled anger and bigotry, which he helped incite during the marriage equality plebiscite. It is a despicable move by this Prime Minister, who has frequently victimised LGBTIQ children in this country, using them as a political football to rouse the conservative base, all because his rabble of a government is on the nose in this nation.


Labor has not forgotten the children who were harassed on their way to school by anti-Safe-Schools protesters—LGBTI children harassed at the school gates and shamed simply for being who they are. We have not forgotten gay mums and dads who endured campaigns that attempted to discredit the value of our families during the postal survey. And we have not forgotten the harm inflicted on the LGBTI community of this country by this divisive Prime Minister and this divisive government. The Prime Minister might want to wash his hands of issues like gay conversion therapy and anti-LGBTI schooling in schools, and he should be ashamed of himself.

"Faruqi, Sen Mehreen",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator FARUQI
 (New South Wales) (16:47):  The Greens have brought this motion on the attacks against young LGBTIQ Australians supported by Prime Minister Scott Morrison as a matter of public importance because it is a matter of public importance. We have long known Mr Scott Morrison's views on LGBTIQ rights. His record on voting against marriage equality and campaigning against the Safe Schools antibullying program is well known. What concerns me even more deeply, though, is that now Prime Minister Scott Morrison holds the highest political office in this country and has since worked to legitimise a narrative of hate and fresh attacks on some of the most vulnerable people in our community. This is not okay. This is not about silencing or stopping dissenting views at all. This is about stopping discrimination, stopping hate and stopping harm.


I must say, I am amazed at the gall of Senator Fawcett, who claims freedom of speech as an excuse for attacking and harming young LGBTIQ people in Australia. Within a week of taking office we were reminded that the man who is now Australia's Prime Minister will not denounce the dangerous, discredited and very, very harmful practice of so-called gay conversion therapy—a practice that the United Nations has officially described as a torture and has recognised as an international human rights issue. This practice, of course, can take many forms, including forced counselling, prayers and even exorcisms. Imagine that you are a young person already trapped in an unsupportive environment and then you are forced into this so-called therapy, which essentially says to young people: 'You are broken. You need some fixing up. There's something fundamentally wrong about you that must be cured.' This is so dangerous, it is so despicable and it should be rejected in every way, shape and form.


A Fairfax Media investigation earlier this year revealed that about 10 religious ministries that are dedicated to changing people's sexual orientation and gender identity still operate in Australia and are part of an informal network of churches and counsellors here and overseas. These groups may have changed their names and their profiles, but their harmful practices still remain exactly the same. It sickens me to the core that we have a Prime Minister who not only has refused to denounce this practice but has, instead, chosen to say that this isn't an issue for him. Well, Prime Minister, this is an issue for a vast majority of Australians. This is an issue for young Australians who live in this country, and it should be an issue for you.


What the Prime Minister actually needs to do is legislate a ban on these extremely harmful practices, but we all know that he won't do this. On top of that, the comments from the Prime Minister will only serve to embolden people who promote this heinous practice. Let this sink in: we also now have a Prime Minister who tweets bizarre phrases like 'gender whisperers' when referring to counsellors who advise schools on how to work with children who may need support, such as trans children, and how to make sure that they are treated like any other child in that school. One has to step back and think: what century are we living in? The human toll of these words must be considered. These are real people being harmed by the perpetuation of this BS language like 'gender whisperer' that the Prime Minister is using.


The sole aim of articles like the one in TheDailyTelegraph which was promoted by Mr Morrison is to target young LGBTIQ Australians. The aim is to directly challenge these young people, to challenge their sense of identity, to go after them while knowing full well that many of them are some of the most vulnerable in our society. They are already targeted, already bullied and already isolated, so much so that young LGBTIQ Australians are at least three times more likely to have attempted suicide as their heterosexual peers. It was only last year the Trans Pathways survey found a staggering 48 per cent of young trans people had attempted suicide, compared with 2.4 per cent of young people in the general population, and that 80 per cent had actually self-harmed.


Let's also not forget that the plebiscite on marriage equality—or, as it has been more accurately described, the 'plebi-shite'—opened the door to hateful, divisive and ultimately very harmful campaigns against LGBTIQ people in our community. As the postal survey was conducted, I remember reading with dismay of the alarm raised by mental health organisations as they struggled to cope with the dramatic spike in clients accessing support services. This is Australia in the 21st century. When the private matter of one's sex, sexuality, gender or gender identity becomes public debate, distress is natural. LGBTIQ people are already at a far greater risk of a range of mental health problems and a high risk of self-harm due to the daily discrimination, stigma and prejudice that they face.


We know the agenda of people like Prime Minister Scott Morrison is to make some Australians feel less worthy, less significant and less important and to pick and choose which Australians get which human rights. That's not on. That's not okay. We will not stand for this. The Greens and I will always stand up for LGBTIQ Australians and their right to be who they are and to live a life free from discrimination.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2018-09-11,"



Senator DEAN SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:53):  I am a man of mixed emotions this afternoon because I think we can do better. There is no doubt that, as the weeks and the months proceed to Christmas and the first half of next year when we will be confronted with a general election, all of the optimism and all that was great in the Australian Senate and, indeed, the House of Representatives that we all witnessed and some of us participated in, Senator Rice, at the end of last year could be lost.


I've only been in the Australian Senate for six years. Others have been here for a much longer period of time, and others in our parliament for shorter periods of time. But I think that the universal view, even for those who disagreed with marriage equality and the success of the private senator's bill that we shaped, was that it was a moment where our parliamentary democracy worked well. Indeed, it's probably one of the very few moments when our parliamentary democracy received so much attention.


We witnessed a Senate committee process that worked well. Senator Fawcett chaired that, and he has reflected on that. We saw a parliamentary debate that was robust and, at times, a bit unpleasant for someone like myself. We saw an unamended bill leave this place and go to the House of Representatives, and we saw many, many members of the House of Representatives do a number of things. Some of them reflected the views of their electorates—many of them reflected the views of their electorates and the outcome of the postal survey, and they voted yes. Some of them—men, as they were—also demonstrated great courage and said, 'On this issue, my conscience says I cannot support it, and I'm going to vote against it.' And then some people abstained. Whether or not people should or shouldn't have abstained after having supported a postal survey is still a very open question, and one that I am not completely reconciled to.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator DEAN SMITH:
  Indeed, Senator Polley, some people in this Senate chamber exercised their conscience on various amendments. But we saw a triumph of parliament over politics and we saw a triumph of community over cynicism, and I think it was a moment that we could all be very proud of.


By coincidence, today, 11 September, marks the day that the postal survey form itself—the ballot—was first revealed.



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator DEAN SMITH:
  Thank you, Senator Hume, for being in the chamber, and Senator Reynolds. For those of us who genuinely care about LGBTIQ Australians, who care about our brothers and sisters and who care about the confusion that our parents and grandparents must endure, I think their ask of us would be to avoid the politics on this—to avoid the politics! I don't doubt for one moment everyone's right to bring motions to this Senate, but let me be very clear—



Senator Rice interjecting—




Senator DEAN SMITH:
  Senator Rice, let me be very clear: the government's position was enunciated by Senator Fifield a few moments ago in the Senate chamber. You heard it as well as I did.




Senator McKim:
  We heard what the Prime Minister said!




Senator DEAN SMITH:
  You heard it as well as I did. I argue that the best way to protect the growing pains, the challenges, of LGBTIQ Australians—and I was one of them; I was a young person and am now a middle-aged LGBTIQ Australian—is to deal responsibly with these sorts of issues and to avoid the temptation to play politics. This is because there is a consensus on the issue of conversion therapy in our country. Greg Hunt has made his position very clear as the Commonwealth Minister for Health. And the alternative minister for health, Catherine King, has made her position clear.




Senator Rice:
  The Prime Minister needs to speak out on it! Talk to your Prime Minister!




Senator DEAN SMITH:
  Let's be very clear about this. Let's be very clear about what the Prime Minister has and has not said, because it's not right to argue or even to present the idea that because people are people of faith—and even of strong faith—it automatically means that they are against LGBTIQ Australians. It's just not true.




Senator Rice:
  That's not what I said!




Senator DEAN SMITH:
  We know that, Senator Rice, because the yes people—the yes campaign, the marriage equality people—talked about, identified and highlighted the fact that Christian Australians, and I count myself as a Christian Australian, can be very sympathetic and do have a willingness and an interest in making sure that the personal journey of young LGBTIQ people in our country is as painless as it can possibly be. It will never be painless: we know that.


Surely, what we should be doing as parliamentarians is talking about and concentrating on those things that unite us and that give us a common sense of purpose so that Senator Rice, Senator Pratt, Senator Smith and Senator Wong can walk out of this place as a united voice for the concerns of LGBTIQ Australians. I want our national leaders to be the best that they can be in understanding the importance of these issues. I absolutely do. As a modest coalition backbench senator, I will continue to be a strong, sensible voice for these issues when they are raised in the government. Our country has come a long way and if we are to learn anything from the events of last year surely it is that we can rise above the temptation.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator DEAN SMITH:
  Well, the conduct of my party is probably my responsibility, first and foremost. I like to think that I, with Senator Hume and others, have made my party the best it can possibly be. That doesn't mean it doesn't disappoint me and other Liberals in the community, but many of us are doing the best we can possibly do, sometimes in very challenging circumstances.


I think it's worth sharing with the Senate what it was that Mr Morrison, the Prime Minister now, the Treasurer then, said in the House of Representatives when the House was debating the marriage bill. I think this is very instructive. I'll let Mr Morrison's words speak for themselves, and people are free to find this quote for themselves. On Monday, 4 December of last year, Mr Morrison made his contribution to the Marriage Amendment Definition of Religious Freedoms Bill of 2017:


As Christians we do not lay claim to perfection or moral precedence; in fact it is the opposite: conscious of our own frailties and vanities, of our human condition, Christians should be more conscious of the same in those around us. That is why faith encourages social responsibility, the bedrock of faith in action.


What was important about the marriage debate last year was that we were part of a very significant and important social reform. I have argued privately in the last few days that if the postal survey were to be held again perhaps we should have two. We should have a postal survey 12 months after the passage of the bill and ask people who voted no if they have changed their minds. I think we know the answer to that. We got a very good outcome in the postal survey. If the postal survey were to be conducted again, we would get a better outcome. I'm opposed to the postal survey as a matter of principle—everyone knows that—but you know what I'm trying to say.


What's important here is that we have to accept the fact that even in our own parties—even in our own parties, Senator Dodson—there would be people with different points of view. I would rather someone be honest about their hesitation, honest about their concerns, if they have them, than hide them or pretend to be the person they're not. And we lost the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, because, to my mind, he pretended to be the person he was not.


These are important issues and the record is very clear. We have just seen in this Senate chamber a very clear enunciation of what the government's position is. It's worth reading it into the Senate Hansard. Senator Fifield made this contribution only a few moments ago:


The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 provides protection from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status in areas of public life. Conversion therapies aim to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, and there is no scientific or medical evidence to support their use.


That is the government's position. Senator Fifield continued:


This issue is one for states and territories—


That is a constitutional reality—


to monitor and take appropriate action.


And I am someone who agrees they should take appropriate action. He continues:


For example, the Victorian Health Complaints Commissioner can investigate unregistered doctors and health service providers making unethical representations—including conversion therapists. Queensland and Western Australia are also considering whether law reform is needed to outlaw this therapy.


I argue that very few people in this country believe that conversion therapy is right, good or necessary.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:03):  I rise to speak on the MPI, because the Prime Minister has been in his job for barely more than a fortnight and yet he has already managed to demonstrate his lack of understanding and complete disregard for Australia's LGBTI community. As Senator Pratt rightly said, Prime Minister Morrison is certainly no friend of the LGBTI community, which means he is also not a friend of the value of equality. His claim on Twitter that Australian schools don't need gender whisperers may be the type of remark that Americans have come to expect from their leader, but Australians deserve better from their Prime Minister. Counsellor and gender expert Dr Elizabeth Riley points out that the Prime Minister's comments last week have completely missed the point. She says that letting kids be kids is exactly what they are doing. Ensuring that no Australian child faces exclusion or judgement for their identity is essentially to let children be themselves. Helping teachers to understand how to support students who are struggling with identity is part of this.


Sadly this attitude is hardly shocking coming from this particular Prime Minister, who, just two years ago, sought to claim that people with strong religious views are subject to the same degree of bigotry as members of the LGBTI community. Seriously! The Prime Minister's track record towards the LGBTI community speaks for itself. He has supported claims made by Israel Folau—that is, that God's plan for gay people is hell. He does not support the Safe Schools antibullying program. And when the plebiscite returned a resounding yes vote, his response was to try and turn this victory for the LGBTI community, and indeed the entire Australian community, into a starting point for legislation on religious freedom. These are not the actions of a friend to all Australians—nor for equality for all Australians. This shows we have a divisive Prime Minister, and he should know better.


At the same time as this Prime Minister attacks the Australian LGBTI community, a country not so far from us, within our region, has taken major steps towards embracing theirs. I want to share this for the Prime Minister so that he learns something about the changing nature of our region and how his comments matter. I want to take this opportunity to highlight the historic ruling by the Supreme Court of India. In a landmark ruling, Supreme Court of India has delivered a unanimous verdict that section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was unconstitutional. This 157-year-old archaic law, which criminalised consensual sexual acts between adults of the same sex, was ruled a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Indian constitution. The announcement of the verdict drew a roar of cheers across India, a testament to the people's joy. Up to eight per cent of India's population, some 104 million people, is estimated to be part of the LGBTI community. Each of them has cause to celebrate the steps that this represents because it sends a message of hope, a message of hope that our Prime Minister needs to listen to. Before, this law enabled police to arrest people for the mere allegation of intending to engage in homosexual acts. Under section 377, hijra people—or transgender people—were persecuted and neglected, and outreach organisations seeking to help those suffering with HIV/AIDS were punished for abetting crimes. But because of last week's hard-fought verdict, the process of healing can begin. The road to this point has been so long and difficult. The 1990s saw rights groups begin their campaign to repeal section 377, and that went on from 2001 to 2009 and right up until today.


I want to share the quotes that were spoken in the written judgements to really set the occasion alight. To quote Lord Alfred Douglas:


… the Love that dare not speak its name.


Leonard Cohen:


From the ashes of the gay,


democracy is coming …


William Shakespeare:


What's in a name?


That which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet.


Johann Wolfgang von Goethe:


I am what I am, so take me as I am.


These were in the written judgements from the Indian Supreme Court, and Chief Justice Dipak Misra labelled the criminalisation of same-sex relations as 'irrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary'. Justice Indu Malhotra said:


History owes an apology to the members of this community and their families … for the ignominy and ostracism that they have suffered through the centuries.


These were the words spoken when the five judges on the bench of India's Supreme Court upheld the right to equality, dignity and freedom of expression for all, irrespective of a person's sexual orientation. It was indeed a historic judgement and something that this parliament and our new Prime Minister need to recognise, because the struggle continued when this ruling was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. Two years ago the Supreme Court decided to revisit that ruling, resulting in last week's historic ruling. The verdict has been hailed by many as a bright dawn for personal liberty. It begins a new era of equality for the millions of people who make up India's LGBTI community. Families, of course, can now breathe a sigh of relief that their loved ones no longer risk being branded as criminals for being who they are. 


It is my hope that this extends to other parts of the Indo-Pacific region, where we will hopefully see other laws change. This is something in which Australia could partner. Australia could partner with India in supporting its efforts to ensure that the same human rights of equality and of freedom of expression are spread throughout the Indo-Pacific region. We know what happened only a week ago in one of the South-East Asian states when Malaysia publicly caned two women for being lesbians. Same-sex relations are now legal in only eight out of 18 of those states. None of them recognise same-sex unions. 


As Chief Justice Misra said:


Social exclusion, identity seclusion and isolation from the social mainstream are still the stark realities faced by individuals today, and it is only when each and every individual is liberated from the shackles of such bondage … that we can call ourselves a truly free society.


I ask our Prime Minister to recognise the words of this Chief Justice and see how they fit with him and the comments that he has made in recent times in relation to our nation and the value of equality and the fair go that we rightly expect, respect and hope for all of our citizens. The only way we can achieve that for all of our citizens is if we don't accept the derogatory language that we have heard from our Prime Minister and if we act as a proper example to show that we stand for equality for all.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (17:12):  We heard what our Prime Minister thinks about conversion therapy when he abjectly failed to utterly condemn conversion therapy, as he should have. We know that he believes there are what he calls 'gender whisperers' in our schools. Other senators have spoken about those things. I only have a couple of minutes this afternoon, so I want to tell the Senate about my stepson and very good friend, Jasper Lees—a man that I love very much. Jasper is a transman. He was born as a man but in a woman's body. I want to say to our Prime Minister: please, can you just think about that for a minute. Think about how that would feel.


Jasper had two choices. One choice was to reject who he really was, to live a lie for the rest of his life; the other choice was to embrace who he truly is and to live as the man that he actually is. I'm so proud of him that that was the choice he made. I can say to our Prime Minister that when he made that decision—a decision that made me so proud of him and was the embodiment of courage, bravery and self-awareness—a transformation came over Jasper. And he is, as I speak today, someone whom I admire very much. 


I want to place on the record, though, that in most states in our country transgender people cannot change their gender on their birth certificate unless they have surgery to remove their reproductive organs. And when the letters arrive for Jasper, who still lives with his mum and me today, with his old name, Mara, on them, I see his face—when he gets these letters from government departments and government agencies—because they're not actually addressed to him; they're addressed to somebody else. But he can't change his gender on his birth certificate unless he has surgery to rip out the female reproductive organs that remain in his body.


Now, it's to the Tasmanian government's credit that they've indicated that they want to change the law in Tasmania, something for which the Greens have been campaigning for a very long time. But the reason I shared the story about Jasper with the Senate today is to remind us all, and hopefully remind the Prime Minister, that trans people are human beings. They have all the same frailties and strengths as all the rest of us and they should be treated equally to the rest of the population.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-09-11,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (17:21):  I rise to speak on the Imported Food Control Amendment Bill 2017.


In February 2015, dozens of people contracted hepatitis A after eating frozen berries made by the Nanna's and Creative Gourmet brands. I'm sure we all remember that. I'm sure we remember the impact that had across the country, on both the people affected—distressingly affected with hepatitis A—and in the worry, concern and fear of people right across the country who were concerned that those frozen berries they had in the freezer were going to make them sick.


We went through that and, of course, there was a recall of those berries. The recall in response to that outbreak was a strong demonstration of our food recall mechanisms. But it also called into question Australia's food inspection regime, which is set out in the Imported Food Control Act. The process in looking at this has been quite long, and I'll come back to that later. But the community has been calling for confidence to be restored and for changes to be made to make sure that what happened in February 2015 doesn't happen again.


There are large numbers of high-risk foods that come through our borders every day: cheese, beef, fresh and frozen fruit and seafood of all kinds. But it's the right of every citizen to assume that our government, including our biosecurity and food safety bodies, are doing their best to protect them from sickness and injury. This is the very basis of good government.


So the Greens support the amendments made in this bill. We agree with the introduction of a requirement for importers to prove, with a certification scheme, that effective food safety controls are in place for instances where we know that the border-testing regime isn't sufficient. And we agree with the much more stringent and risk-based holding order options for the minister on types, classes and source destinations of different products. This will ensure, as the explanatory memorandum says, that:


… the Australian Government has the power to control the spread of foodborne illness and communicable diseases (such as hepatitis or listeriosis).


And we, as the Greens, cautiously support the use of foreign food regulatory schemes for approving products. However, we urge the minister to be particularly careful with their application. Often, parallel certification or regulatory approval is actually a cover for applying the weakest version of regulations across multiple jurisdictions, and we need to ensure that both our biosecurity and our food safety are second to none around the world so that we can continue to protect our clean, green reputation and so that people can continue to eat not just imported food but, even more significantly for our Australian economy, Australian food with confidence.


The Greens are supporting this bill, but we have got a question. The question that we want to ask tonight is: why has it taken us so long to arrive at the second reading debate for this bill here in the Senate? This bill was first introduced in June last year. So it has been sitting on the books for 15 months and counting. That was 15 months for something that is, as I said, the essence of good governance: people knowing that the food that they eat is safe. You've got to wonder: why has it taken so long? Maybe it's that the government has had other priorities. Maybe the government has been so focused on looking inwards and focusing on itself that it hasn't been able to do the work of getting bills through parliament! Maybe the government has been focused on internal power plays, on throwing out what seemed to be, in the eyes of the community, a perfectly good Prime Minister to replace him with another Prime Minister—and we still don't know why—rather than being focused on doing the basics of good governance and on the things that the people of Australia actually think are important: the things that affect their everyday life, like whether those frozen berries in their freezer are going to be safe for them to eat. We have to ask ourselves: why has it taken so long? What has the government been focused on?


It's not because of lack of time. Just three weeks ago we saw that everyone in the lower house decided to call it a day just on midday because they had some leadership tensions to sort out. And, at the tail end of last year, we had the cancellation of an entire week of the House of Representatives just so that we could ensure that the member for New England was there to support a confidence motion.


Speaking of the member for New England: in between the introduction of this bill some 15 months ago and now, he has moved from being the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, to being the minister for infrastructure and regional development, to the backbench, to being an ordinary citizen, Mr Joyce, to then being on the backbench. And now he's our drought envoy, whatever that means. I think most Australians are actually still very confused about what that means. That's how long it has taken to get this bill to being debated here tonight.


How can good governance work in a situation like this? Quite frankly, it can't. And the evidence today is that it doesn't. This bill should have been dealt with last year, and it's only by a stroke of luck that we haven't had another crisis like the hepatitis A crisis of February 2015. It's an absolute abrogation of good governance. That it has taken 3½ years to get us to this stage really shows where the priorities of this government are.


So, to summarise—because I don't want to spend too much time holding up the passage of this important bit of legislation, given how long it has taken to get here—we, the Greens, will be supporting this bill. It has some good measures, and it has gone through what appears to be a robust consultation process. I'm pleased to be able to commend it to the Senate.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2018-09-11,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (17:28):  I thank senators for their contributions to this piece of legislation, the Imported Food Control Amendment Bill 2017. As has been, I think, well explained during the debate, this bill modernises Australia's approach to food safety, associated particularly with imported food, adapting to changes in how food is traded around the globe while carefully balancing the risks associated with food safety. Practical measures to strengthen the management of imported food safety being introduced with the bill will increase importers' accountability for food safety, increase importers' sourcing of safe food, improve the monitoring and management of new and emerging food safety risks and improve incident response. To address concerns for particular types of food where at-border testing alone isn't sufficient to ensure safety, the bill will introduce a requirement for importers to have documentary evidence to demonstrate that effective food safety controls are in place throughout the supply chain to ensure food is safe for human consumption. Although there has been some hyperbole around the imported berries incident that occurred in 2015, it's worth noting that both of those importers did have quality assurance systems in place for the importation of those products.


Responsiveness to food safety incidents will be improved by allowing earlier intervention where there are reasonable grounds to believe that food may pose a serious risk to human health or if the food safety issue is unconfirmed or where there is no reliable test that can be applied to detect the food safety hazard. To ensure a proportionate response, particular characteristics of food can be targeted. This will avoid unnecessary holding of unaffected food.


The bill provides for recognition of a foreign country's food safety regulatory system based on equivalence with Australia's food safety regulatory system. That is important. Australia is recognised as having a very good food safety regulatory system. It's one of the attributes that is recognised in our export markets, and it's something that we need to ensure we protect the reputation of. Food imported from a country assessed as having an equivalent food safety regulatory system to Australia's may be subject to reduced or minimal at-border food inspections, except where there is evidence of noncompliance or food safety risk. This will reduce border intervention for food importers. Additionally, this will ensure border intervention activities are not aimed unnecessarily at safe food.


The bill provides a modern compliance framework with new and improved tools to enable more effective and efficient targeting of non-compliant food and importer behaviour. These tools also provide greater flexibility and more opportunity to encourage non-compliant food importers to become compliant. This is achieved through the introduction of a range of penalties that can be applied proportionately and consistently, based on the level of risk posed by the offence committed.


Overall, the bill will strengthen Australia's imported food safety management system, enabling Australians to continue to enjoy a wide range of quality and safe food from around the world. It will ensure that Australia's food importers will be able to continue to source high-quality ingredients to produce world-class food—highly sought after both in Australia and around the world—and support Australia's role as a good global citizen by improving Australia's ability to work proactively with trading partners in ensuring food safety across the globe. I commend the bill to the Senate.

 (New South Wales) (17:33):  by leave—I move items (1) to (17) on sheet 8193, revised, together:


(4) Schedule 1, item 23, page 14 (line 11), omit ""or (2)"".

I also oppose schedule 1 in the following terms:


(1) Schedule 1, item 23, page 12 (line 24) to page 13 (line 3), subsection 8(2), to be opposed.


(2) Schedule 1, item 23, page 13 (lines 10 to 14), subsection 8(4), to be opposed.

(7) Schedule 1, item 23, page 17 (lines 1 to 16), subsection 9(7), to be opposed.


These are amendments to the Imported Food Control Amendment Bill 2017. Items (1) to (8) oppose new strict liability criminal offences punishable by fines of up to $12,600 for importing food that is substandard, poses a risk to human health, is incorrectly labelled or is not approved by way of a food control certificate. Item (15) removes strict liability from a criminal offence of failing to comply with a notice to provide information or documents. Item (16) removes strict liability from a criminal offence of failing to keep records.


Australians want food importers to be responsible and irresponsible food importers to be punished. My amendments ensure this because there will continue to be criminal offences involving intentional or reckless importing of food that is substandard, poses a risk to human health, is incorrectly labelled or is not approved by way of a food control certificate. And there will be new criminal offences for intentionally or recklessly failing to comply with a notice to provide information or documents and for intentionally or recklessly failing to keep and produce records. 


Penalties under a number of these offences include up to 10 years imprisonment and a fine of $126,000. But my amendments to remove strict liability from criminal offences will also ensure that food importers who intend no harm and who are not reckless about a risk of harm are not considered to be criminals. This will help encourage responsible food importers to service Australia, to put downward pressure on food prices for Australians and to expand the range of food available. Food importers who intend no harm and who are not reckless about a risk of harm still face penalties if they nonetheless import substandard food, but, under my amendments, these would be civil rather than criminal penalties. And under my amendments, in items (9) to (12), these civil penalties will be capped at a $12,600 fine rather than a $25,200 fine. Strict liability in criminal offences is not a liberal principle that should be allowed. It is contrary to the general basic principles of liberalism and it should not be in legislation brought into this place by a liberal government. 


I turn now to the issue of self-incrimination. A provision in the bill establishing a power to require a record to be produced abrogates the principle against self-incrimination through the insertion of an explicit provision stating that a person is not excused from the requirement on the grounds that the 'record might tend to incriminate the person'. Also inserted is the provision stating that the record is not admissible against the individual in criminal proceedings except in criminal proceedings regarding provisions to provide informational documents and provisions regarding the provision of false or misleading information. However, this insertion provides the individual with no protection regarding civil proceedings. My final amendment, item (17), rectifies this by adding a reference to 'civil proceedings' to the reference of 'criminal proceedings'. 


The privilege against self-incrimination should be protected because it would hurt us all to know that at any time we could be forced to provide the rope that we will be hanged by. The privilege against self-incrimination can be protected while ensuring that food imports are safe and irresponsible food importers are punished. Any food importer who refuses to provide a document on the grounds that it will tend to incriminate will still be subject to conviction based on other evidence. Food from that importer that poses a risk will be held or destroyed, regardless of whether the importer provides a particular document, and the government will have the discretion to withhold permissions to import for a food importer who refuses to provide documents. 


I commend my amendments to the Senate.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (17:39):  Labor will not be supporting Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments to the Imported Food Control Amendment Bill 2017. The bill before the Senate is seeking to strengthen the current system, to provide more flexible and targeted ways to prevent and respond to food safety risks, to better protect the health of consumers. Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments seek to omit the term 'strict liability' and to reduce penalty units in the current bill. Labor does not support these amendments and believes that those who undertake the proper procedures for the importation of food products will better protect the health of Australian consumers, and those who commit offences should face tougher penalties.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (17:39):  The Greens also will not be supporting Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments. In fact, with regard to the change from strict liability I think that Senator Leyonhjelm is rather misguided if he feels that he needs to do that in order to protect people who intend to do no harm. He only needs to read the BillsDigest that states:


In a criminal law offence the proof of fault is usually a basic requirement. However, offences of strict liability remove the fault (mental) element that would otherwise apply, but the offence will not criminalise honest errors and a person cannot be held liable if he, or she, had an honest and reasonable belief that they were complying with relevant obligations.


Like Senator Leyonhjelm, we don't want to see the punishment of reasonable and honest mistakes, or people who intended no harm, or weren't being reckless, and this will not happen. You don't need to remove strict liability in order for that to happen. But, in contrast, if Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments were adopted then there is a big risk that there would be the unintended consequence of people who were intentionally contravening or disregarding our import laws potentially getting through. His amendments appear to downgrade the illegal importation of potentially high-risk foodstuffs by changing it from a strict liability charge to a civil penalty one. I'm not sure what evidence he has that this wouldn't lead to a mass evasion of our imported food inspection scheme, as it seems to us that the risks of doing this are, indeed, very high.

The government's investment in research in this year's budget is absolutely essential: $5.3 million over four years for the development of technology solutions to support people living with dementia—and that is most welcome. But there was no new investment in dementia in last year's budget. Quite frankly, $5.3 million over four years is inadequate. 


Dementia is one of the greatest health and social challenges facing Australia and, indeed, the rest of the world. This is not a future issue. There are over 425,000 Australians living with dementia here, and the number is climbing. By the time the sun rises tomorrow, 250 people will join the population with dementia. With the prevalence of dementia in Australia projected to reach 1.1 million by 2056, there will be no-one who won't be touched by this disease. Dementia is everyone's issue. We cannot afford to ignore it or walk past it. 


If the Turnbull government were truly serious about dementia, they would make dementia a national priority. They would also address the home care package waiting list crisis. More than 108,000 older Australians are waiting for home care, including around 88,000 Australians with high-level needs, many of whom are also living with dementia. 


In contrast, I'm extremely proud to be part of the Bill Shorten team that has outlined its intention to make Australia a world leader in the way we care for people living with dementia and the people who love them. Today, I moved a motion for Dementia Awareness Month 2018. The motion urges all levels of government to take action to raise awareness of dementia so that people living with dementia remain included, accepted and connected with their own community. 


As the shadow assistant minister for ageing, I have spent more than five years working and campaigning to make Australia a better place to live with dementia. I have been truly inspired by the people I have met. I have sat with them and listened to their stories. They are inspiring and very courageous. I have also witnessed negative attitudes towards people living with dementia. Awareness and attitudes are improving, but, sadly, the diagnosis of dementia still goes hand in hand with stigma, social isolation and exclusion. This has got to change. We are all affected by dementia, whether it's by a loved one, a friend or a neighbour. We must all do more to encourage the community to better understand dementia so that people living with dementia feel less isolated and alone. 


I encourage the people listening tonight and in this chamber to become a Dementia Friend. It's more than just wearing a badge; it's about turning the awareness campaign into action. It can be as simple as sharing knowledge amongst your workmates, having a conversation with your family and friends, making your workplace or local sporting club more dementia-friendly or checking in on a neighbour who might have become withdrawn. Becoming a Dementia Friend takes very little time, and you should visit the website www.dementiafriendly.org.au. I encourage you all to become members.
