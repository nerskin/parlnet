Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:31):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. Building infrastructure for the long term can be truly transformative for an economy. It can deliver productivity gains that create jobs and make us a better country.


Labor has a proud record in this area. After the stagnant years of the Howard government, it was Labor that turned infrastructure investment around. Current levels of government infrastructure investment have not been so significant since the 1980s. From 2008-09 up to the last financial year, the Nation Building Program expended a record $36 billion, with a strong focus on the nation's roads, rail and intermodal terminals. We are now ranked No. 1 in the OECD for infrastructure investment as a proportion of the economy, after languishing in the rankings during the Howard years.


Much of the government spending on economic infrastructure is framed by the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act. This bill relates to the majority of federal infrastructure spending on road, rail and intermodal projects. Under Labor, around $6 billion per year flowed through this act to fund land transport projects. The bill as proposed does not represent ambitious change. It is more a pedestrian rearrangement and updating of certain aspects of the existing act.


Labor support continued funding for the Roads to Recovery program beyond mid-2014, but we expect that this program will be subject to rigorous audits to ensure value for money and indeed that this funding adds to existing roads funding rather than displaces funding already available at the local level.


It is important to note that Labor allocated funding for the Roads to Recovery program for five years in the 2013 budget. This funding totalled $1.75 billion. Despite this fact, the coalition has tried to wage a ham-fisted scare campaign about a threat to Roads to Recovery because Labor wants to make this bill better. Labor fully backed Roads to Recovery, without freezing the indexation of financial assistance grants or otherwise stripping the local governments of much-needed funds.


Senators should be aware that this bill passed the other place on 24 March. A Senate committee reported on this bill at the same time. Despite the claimed urgency to extend the Roads to Recovery program, this bill has not come before the Senate once since then—not at all. Of claimed urgency, it passed the House of Representatives in March but has not turned up till today. It has languished for 155 days. This delay is of the government's own choosing. Frankly, the only threat to Roads to Recovery is the coalition.


Let us not forget about the indexation freeze to financial assistance grants to councils, announced in this year's budget, which will continue every year as far as the eye can see. It will effectively wipe out the entire size of the $350 million per annum of the Roads to Recovery budget. So what Mr Tony Abbott gives with one hand he is taking away with the other. He promises increases in one place but takes more than that away in another place.


Local government is justifiably up in arms about this savage and, not surprisingly, unflagged cut. It was not mentioned before the election. But this cut will impact most on regional and rural councils—the very councils with the highest road maintenance burden. And where are our National Party colleagues? The lapdogs, the doormats—they are at it again. They are going to come into this chamber and once again going to vote to disadvantage regional, rural and country voters. They are a sad and sorry reflection of what was once a great party that actually argued for its own constituents. They talk big back home but then they come into the big red and green chambers and just roll over on their backs and let the Liberal Party tickle their tummies. With cut after cut after cut, whether it is to roads, broadband networks, health, or, more importantly, education for rural kids, they roll over on their backs and let the Liberals tickle their tummies. And what is more distressing is that the government appears even to be successful in tickling the tummies of a few of the crossbench senators. That is what is really disturbing about this debate today.




Senator McKenzie:
  I find the 'tickling the tummies' very disturbing!



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Conroy has the call.




Senator CONROY:
  Then one should object to it when it is done to one! So much for the Nationals and the coalition wanting to help the bush. It is another important regional issue, another example of the National Party rolling over and failing to stand up for the people they say they represent.


Other changes the government is seeking in this bill include renaming the act to take out the phrase 'nation-building', adding new types of eligible projects and funding recipients and repealing some spent acts. Labor is concerned that the renaming of the program could incur additional costs—for instance, in terms of signage. Why do you want to now have a new name and get all these new signs made just out of your own political vanity? 'We want to call it a new name, spend taxpayer's dollars and change all of the signs just so we can have our name on it rather than the original name.' We hope the assurance that the minister has given is that this will not be the case, but we will be watching. If new signs start popping up and taxpayers have their money wasted simply for the government's vanity and ego, we will be holding them to account. 


Who can possibly object to the term 'nation building'? What is the problem? Why do you need to go down such a pathetic, puerile, juvenile path? The coalition, though, I suspect is most likely worried about the term 'nation building', because it has always been associated with Labor. We are proud of that fact. Labor has a long, proud tradition of building this nation and its infrastructure and we will continue to do so into the future. Nation building is what Labor does—a vision in the long-term interest of our country instead of the short-term political interests which we see so much of from this new government.


Labor will be seeking to amend this bill in two important respects. Firstly, Labor will move to strengthen governance around project selection by elevating the role of Infrastructure Australia in advising on project benefits. Prior to approving individual projects under the act, the minister must have regard to the identified priorities and plans set by Infrastructure Australia and any advice it produces relating to the type of project being considered for funding. So, we do not want to give this to the National Party, the party of regional rorts programs, the party that enjoys nothing more than reaching into taxpayers' pockets and spreading largesse in the form of pork-barrel grants to its mates around the country. Further—and I note this with some irony—for projects with a value of $100 million or more, the minister must obtain an evaluation of the project to Infrastructure Australia. 


We have heard an awful lot from this government over the last few months—and it is especially poignant today—why we have got to have cost-benefit analyses. We have just spent millions of dollars paying Minister Turnbull's mates to do a shonky cost-benefit analysis so we can pretend that we have done one when we have already made the decisions. The minister wrote to the company and directed them as to what they were building in a broadband network before the outcome of the cost-benefit analysis. But, goodness me, what good luck we had: the analysis confirmed exactly what the minister told the company to do six months ago. 


I do not even know why the government should be afraid of this particular amendment. Just hire Henry Ergas to do the cost-benefit analysis of these projects, and I am sure you will still get as many National Party pork barrels rolling out of this building as you ever had. Just pay Henry Ergas and you will get the outcome that the minister has predetermined. 


This amendment makes the logical link to Infrastructure Australia's role to provide advice on infrastructure and national priorities and the minister's role to decide how to allocate scarce Commonwealth funds. Who could be opposed to that except a bunch of National Party pork barrellers, which the Liberal Party, when they tickle them in the tummy, agree to all the other atrocities to attack the living standard of ordinary regional and rural Australians but will give the MP a little bit of cash to splash around electorates so that it can pretend it is really representing their interests?


The government have sought to avoid this sensible amendment by proposing and claiming they want to put it in the Infrastructure Australia Act. Oh my goodness! They have actually said that that is where it should go. Make no mistake, Senators: the Land Transport Infrastructure Act is the sole enabling act that governs the terms under which the infrastructure minister can authorise expenditure of Commonwealth funds on roads and rail projects. There is not a more appropriate place to put this amendment. Do not be fooled by the government saying, 'No, no, we'll put it in a different act.' No other act does this—certainly not the Infrastructure Australia Act. That has an entirely different purpose. The Infrastructure Australia Act establishes a body of experts that provide advice to government on infrastructure policy and projects.


IA looks at best practice project procurement. It looks at what the nation lacks and suggests what it needs. It flags future needs. It assesses project value and flags emerging issues in the sector. It has a primarily strategic focus.


However, it is the national land transport act that authorises payment of billions of dollars a year to the states for actual projects such as the East West Link. As some of you would know I live in Victoria and I am very familiar with the East West Link. The importance of this amending legislation and the key reason this government does not want to support it is very simple. Do not listen to what this government has to say. Follow the money, as they say in the classics. The money trail out of this building on East West Link stage 2 is to Victoria.


At Senate estimates, we heard that Infrastructure Australia has classified this project in Victoria as 'not ready to proceed'. It is no surprise to a Victorian who follows this, because this is a project where the Victorian government have decided where they are going to dig a road tunnel. They have decided: 'That spot right there is where we are going to start digging this tunnel.' You might then ask: if a tunnel is being dug, where is it going to come up? Where are you planning on bringing this tunnel up? The truth is that the Victorian government have not made a decision about where they are going to bring the tunnel up. They have started digging a tunnel and they do not know where it is going to come up. 


Yet the federal government, for all their rhetoric of 'must have a cost-benefit analysis, must do this,' is giving $1½ billion, from recollection, to the Victorian government for a road project involving a tunnel, but they have not even decided where that tunnel will come up. So, despite independent advice, the government said it would hand over this $1.5 billion to help out the drowning Victorian government—I think my speech notes say 'struggling', but let me assure you it is not struggling; this Victorian government is drowning. A New South Wales man wrote that!


It is drowning—$1.5 billion for one end of a tunnel will not save the Napthine government. The sum of $1.5 billion is being handed over for a project that Infrastructure Australia says is not ready to proceed. Common sense would say to most Victorians that it is not ready to proceed because they do not know where they are going to bring the tunnel up. But they have now given this money and the work will not even start until Christmas next year. On what basis do you give $1.5 billion for a project which is deemed not ready to proceed and in respect of which they do not know where it will finish, 18 months in advance? There is a very real reason the government will not accept this amendment and there is a very real reason why this chamber should insist on this amendment.


Of the handful of new projects over $100 million in value announced by this government in its budget of largely broken promises, we found out at estimates that no projects—none; not one, not two, but a big round zero—have been properly assessed by Infrastructure Australia prior to funding. That is yet another broken coalition promise. They made a big thing of this before the election; they said: 'For any project over $100 million, we have to have a cost-benefit analysis done by Infrastructure Australia.' So you take their feet, you put them to the fire, and you say, 'Okay—now's the time to implement your policy; let's support this amendment.' Oh, no! As usual, this government treats infrastructure as nothing more than a pork-barrel re-election fund to parade around the country, claiming it is building for the future.


So you can understand how important strengthening governance is for this bill. For projects that are funded, this amendment will require the minister to publish details of the projects and include Infrastructure Australia's prior evaluation.


Infrastructure Australia has not even been able to assess East West Link stage 2 because the Victorian government has not given them more than one page of information on this proposal, described as high-level. It had to be bloody high to get away with just one page for $1.5 billion! That is not high level; that is up-in-space level!


So, overall, this amendment is vital. It strengthens governance—precisely what every major stakeholder in the infrastructure sector has called for in the current Productivity Commission inquiry into public infrastructure. These major stakeholders include the Business Council of Australia— (Time expired)

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2014-08-27,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (09:52):  Mr President, I begin by noting that this is not my first speech—you have got to wait until this afternoon for that!



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Rice.




Senator RICE:
  I rise to speak in support of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, subject to some very important amendments. This legislation in itself is a series of amendments to the existing Commonwealth transport funding legislation. The further amendments which the Greens are proposing will include adding the criteria of transport integration and sustainability into the overall assessment of what projects get funded; legislating for funding to be provided for heavy vehicle safety and productivity measures; and, importantly, where funding for a project exceeds $50 million, requiring scrutiny by Infrastructure Australia and having transparency about the results of that scrutiny.


I am pleased to see that the legislation is neutral about the form of transport infrastructure being funded so that, as well as funding for roads, it makes provision for funding for rail, and for intermodal projects infrastructure, where freight gets transferred from road to rail and vice versa. This is refreshing, given the Prime Minister's irrational objection to federal funding of urban rail projects.


The Greens are also neutral about the form of transport infrastructure that should be funded. We are guided by overriding objectives of providing safe, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable and convenient transport that is accessible to all. What this means is that we support road projects that help provide safe, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable and convenient transport that is accessible to all. We also support passenger and freight rail and other transport projects which meet these criteria.


This legislation wraps up funding programs that I know well from my time in local government: the Roads to Recovery program, which has been talked about so much over the last week; black spot programs; and the nation-building program. These programs have funded essential local road-building and maintenance programs—absolutely critical infrastructure.


I note, however, that this legislation has been considered at the same time as local government is reeling from savage budget cuts to local government road funding. Here we are setting up a framework for land transport funding in the context of the government's $1 billion cut to Commonwealth Financial Assistance Grants. Regional councillors across the country have expressed their loud opposition to these cuts that will result in a decline in service delivery as well as road maintenance throughout the local government sector. The Municipal Association of Victoria president Bill McArthur has said that: 


Commonwealth financial assistance grants are a core revenue stream for local government. The grants provide up to 27 per cent of rural councils' total funding so rural communities will suffer a massive impact. 


The Greens are appalled at these budget cuts. They hit just the kinds of transport infrastructure that need to be supported. 


We should be funding upgrades of unsafe local roads across rural and regional areas; upgrading roads in outer suburbs that are carrying 10 times as much traffic as they were designed for; and upgrading alternative roads or creating bypasses so that heavy vehicles do not have to go straight down the main street of regional cities or rumble down residential streets. We should be funding the repair and proper maintenance of bridges. I remember well when I was a Maribyrnong councillor and mayor talking to my rural colleagues about bridges. In Maribyrnong I think we had five; rural shires had 40 or more and a much smaller rate base to fund them from. 


I road my bike through regional Victoria on my way to Canberra and we travelled along a range of country roads from the most delightful narrow country lanes and regional city streets to a 12-kilometre stint along the Hume. By the end of the trip, I had three distinct road funding programs that I thought were a priority. The one that was particularly relevant to today's debate was sealed shoulders on any country road that carried any significant amount of traffic, particularly truck traffic. This will enable not just safe cycling conditions but easier passing, particularly of slow-moving trucks by other vehicles. 


My last job before standing for election was as a strategic transport planner in the outer Melbourne municipality of Hume. People know me well as an advocate for the public transport that we need, particularly in our outer suburbs, but I was a great roads advocate in Hume too. My focus for the 18 months in that job was the development of the Hume Integrated Land Use and Transport Strategy. The key aims of this strategy were to advocate for the duplication of roads that used to be country roads: Somerton, Sunbury, Mickleham and Craigieburn roads, which are now carrying huge amounts of traffic both passenger and freight traffic. 


Local government cannot afford to duplicate these roads and, with the limited amount of state government funding that is being allocated, VicRoads told us they had a backlog of arterial road duplication projects so that it was likely to be decades before all these roads were duplicated. 


On my home turf, the Greens and I are long-term supporters of the Westgate truck bypass, which would get trucks off residential streets in Yarraville and Footscray. This is a very cost-effective land transport infrastructure investment plus effective freight-rail transport to and from the port connected with the intermodal transport hubs in the outer suburbs would allow up to half of the containerised freight going to and from the Port of Melbourne to go by rail, freeing up lots of room on the overloaded Westgate Freeway. If we invested in decent public transport across the outer suburbs, rail and bus, then we really would be on our way to solving traffic congestion. 


This type of road and public transport investment scores very highly on the criteria of helping to provide safe, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable and convenient transport that is accessible to all. This is where the money needs to be spent, not on massively expensive, polluting freeways and motorways in Melbourne and Sydney, which are not cost-effective, will not solve congestion problems. Spending billions of dollars on these city tollways takes money away from where it needs to be spent: on local roads, country roads, public transport and freight-rail projects. 


The critical thing, which is so blindingly obvious, is that infrastructure costs money. It is an investment so, just as obviously, it is critically important to make sure the money is spent in the most effective way. To make sure this happens, it is essential that there is good process, transparent process and evidence based decision-making. The tighter the money is, the more important it is. If we are serious about efficiency in government, then we have to make sure that we are not splashing money around on massively expensive transport projects that do diddly squat towards creating safe, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable and convenient transport that is accessible to all.


Having strong, evidence based decision making that involves assessing infrastructure projects against these criteria is critical. That is why the Greens have been supporters of Infrastructure Australia, which was set up to do just that—to pull evidence together to enable objective assessment of transport projects rather than transport infrastructure priorities being determined by their location with relation to marginal electorates or by other perceived short-term political benefits. That is why, in this bill, we want to ensure that the funding of any project is considered in the light of Infrastructure Australia's infrastructure priority lists and infrastructure plans, and that any projects over $50 million are scrutinised by Infrastructure Australia. This $50 million benchmark was recommendation 2.3 of the Productivity Commission report into public infrastructure, which was undertaken this year. They stated:


All governments should commit to subjecting all public infrastructure investment proposals above $50 million to rigorous cost-benefit analyses that are publicly released …


This legislation provides a perfect opportunity to put this recommendation into legislation. We also think that, regardless of the size of the project, if Infrastructure Australia have anything relevant to say about a project their views should be taken into account. For the vast majority of small projects, such as roadside rest stops and black spot projects, Infrastructure Australia would not have anything to say, so taking their views into account would be an easy thing to do. But it may be that the black spot being considered is on a road that is a feeder road to a proposed Infrastructure Australia priority project, and knowing this will be very relevant in deciding whether or not that black spot gets funded. 


Rigorous and transparent assessment of transport projects is fundamental good governance and standard practice throughout the world. It is what the community expects of us. This sort of assessment would stop the situation of slashing vital support to regional councils while at the same time committing $3½ billion to the WestConnex private tollway in Sydney and $3 billion for the East West Link in Melbourne. These are massively polluting tollway projects that will not improve congestion but will boost the profits of private developers. In both cases the business cases have not been released despite requests through the Senate and from the community. There has been no transparency, no full cost-benefit analysis, despite Tony Abbott promising before the election that all projects worth more than $100 million would receive this scrutiny.


In contrast to the $6½ billion promised for these massively expensive, massively polluting tollway projects, the government has committed less than a third of that to the Roads to Recovery program in the 2014 budget. When it comes to infrastructure and road spending, this government is all rhetoric. It is the road projects, freight projects and public transport projects covered by this legislation that should be getting priority and funding, instead of billions being provided to the private sector for the WestConnex and East West Link tollways.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-08-27,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:03):  I am pleased to support the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. The bill does a number of things, the first of which is that it renames the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009. It gives it the more appropriate name of the National Land Transport Act 2014, thereby removing the link between the name of the act and the name of the land transport infrastructure funding program. This means that the act will not need to be amended if the name of the land transport infrastructure funding program changes. It is the most sensible name for the act and it keeps it above politics. It will also streamline and enhance the operation of the act to benefit states and territories.


By and large, this act is important because it enables a continuation of the wonderful Roads to Recovery program after 30 June 2014. I want to spend little time on this, because, if I may proudly say, I was the minister who introduced into this chamber the original act that provided for Roads to Recovery. It is a wonderful program that gives federal money to local governments to allow them to do road work that otherwise would not be possible. There has been some hesitation in recent years about the constitutionality of funding going directly from the Commonwealth to local governments, but clearly that is addressed by this new bill. Local authorities right around Australia, particularly in rural and regional Australia, have a major influence on which roads are constructed; they know what local people need and they are the best equipped to plan and then build roads in their local communities.


This Roads to Recovery program introduced by the Howard government gave local authorities that additional funding that they had sadly lacked prior to that time and enabled them to build thousands and thousands of kilometres of roads that were absolutely necessary, particularly in rural and regional Australia. I remember a few years after the program was introduced that for much of regional Queensland there was no funding at all for state roads from the then Labor state government. With the approval of the federal government, councils were putting their Roads to Recovery money towards states roads to enable those linkages between small country towns and bigger ones; and it was well received.


As a Queensland senator, Mr Deputy President, you will excuse me if I talk only about Queensland. I must say that both the current federal government and the current Queensland government—Campbell Newman's Liberal-National Party government—are doing such wonderful work on road improvements that I get a bit annoyed with them, because, not matter where you drive in Queensland these days, you will find road works in progress. That, of course, means lanes cut off or detours or speed restrictions, and, for someone who travels the roads as widely as I do, that does become a source of annoyance. But I console myself by understanding these roadworks will benefit all Queenslanders and all Australians in the years ahead.


A great deal of work is being done on the Bruce Highway, and I give full credit to a number of federal and state politicians who have been campaigning for its upgrade for many years: George Christensen, Ewen Jones and Warren Entsch have done a wonderful job in advocating for money for that work. I live in a place called Ayr and my office is in Townsville about 100 kilometres to the north and I drive to work on the occasions I am in the North. I am delighted to see work on the southern approaches to Townsville that were promised by Labor for years—each budget we would have an announcement from Labor that they were going to fix the Van Tassel Street intersection to include a bypass. They kept talking about it a year after year but, as was typical with the Labor government, it never happened—indeed, I think in the last budget they actually withdrew it. That work is now happening and it will provide a four-lane entrance from the south into the burgeoning city of Townsville; it will certainly help anyone using that road, including in a selfish way myself.


All the way throughout Queensland, or all along the Bruce Highway, roadworks are occurring. All credit goes to Campbell Newman and his government for that road work and to the federal government for the funding they have provided to the Queensland government for that road work to be done. It is not just the Bruce Highway or the main highways. During the last few months, I have driven in many of the back roads, the secondary roads of Queensland, and have seen that work is happening in all of them. Congratulations to Warren Truss, Campbell Newman and all those responsible for the enormous amount of road work that is happening. 


As well as dealing with the Roads to Recovery program—I want to come back to that briefly—this bill will also unify the schemes for funding National Land Transport Network projects in part 3 of the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act and the off-network projects in part 6 of that act. Furthermore, the bill will also enlarge the scope of power to fund research, investigations, studies and analysis, first by expanding the types of organisations that can be funded to include partnerships and non-corporate Commonwealth entities in certain circumstances, and second by allowing funding for the additional purpose of researching and investigating projects funded or submitted for consideration for funding under the act. The bill also repeals three spent pieces of legislation in this general field. It is again part of the coalition government's program to tidy up the books, so to speak, to reduce the red tape and get rid of legislation that is no longer relevant. 


The Labor Party in this bill have proposed eight pages of amendments to provide for a separate section on this program. It is a program that is already provided for in legislation. So the Labor Party are—or at least they were last time we were talking about this; I am hopeful that perhaps they have had a rethink about this—proposing these amendments to provide a separate section in this bill for something that has already been dealt with in the other legislation. We agree that it is a very important program to which the Labor Party were averting. In fact we have committed more funding to that program than the current opposition did when it was in government. But the amendments proposed by Labor simply duplicate provisions in the existing legislation. 


When Mr Albanese was the minister, he established the program, but to ensure the program could receive funding under the legislation, all Mr Albanese needed to do was to amend the definition of a road in this act, which is exactly what he did. In 2008 he introduced the AusLink (National Land Transport) Amendment Bill to add to the definition of road in section 4 of the act. He knew then that it was not necessary to include it in a full separate section. He and his party should understand that it was not necessary then, back in 2008, and neither is it necessary now. 


The coalition government is committed to a number of other programs that are not provided separate status in the legislation—that is, the Labor Party want to particularly go to one area, but there are other programs that are not provided with separate pieces of legislation and they do not need to be. If the heavy vehicle program were to be included then, for consistency, those programs should also be included, potentially adding up to 40 pages of unnecessary duplication to this very simple bill.


We are, as I mentioned, committed to reducing red tape, not creating it, and the new programs that we are talking about include the Bridges Renewal Program—a wonderful program that will help many communities get the bridges they need and repair some pretty rickety, narrow bridges that are a safety concern at present. Again, all credit to the minister, Mr Truss, for the introduction of that new Bridges Renewal Program. There are also the managed motorways program, another regional roads program and the national highway program. None of these are specifically referred to in legislation, but the Labor Party, for some reason, wanted one element of those programs to be the subject of some eight additional pages of legislation. So I would hope that the Labor Party have had a rethink about that. I hope that the Greens and the other crossbench senators understand that that is not necessary. It is just useless padding, and it does complicate what is a very simple bill, the main purpose of which is to ensure that the Roads to Recovery program continues beyond 30 June 2014.


Councils will be anxiously watching this debate and this bill. As I understand it, payments were to cease because the Labor Party's program concluded on 30 June 2014. There has not been any tangible impact of the failure to pass this bill to date, but if it is not passed immediately it will throw into jeopardy the payments that continue to go to local councils or local government authorities for the Roads to Recovery program.


Again, I repeat that this is a program initiated by the Howard government, and I say to any senator: if you are ever visiting a local authority anywhere in Australia and you are at a loss to know what to talk about, just mention Roads to Recovery and you will get an instant response from all councillors, CEOs and council staff on just what a wonderful program it has been. It has really saved the day for many communities who were doing it tough and could not, through their rate base or financial assistance grants funding, gather together the money to do these essential road projects, and this Roads to Recovery program gave them that opportunity and that ability to properly service their communities. That has been great for those communities, great for Australians and, indeed, great for the competitiveness and competency of Australia as a nation. The work on those local roads has really built our productivity and helped people, and it deserves support.


I urge all senators to support this bill in its original form. It is a simple bill. It is there to extend the Roads to Recovery program. I would guess that every senator in this chamber is keen to see that program continue to be funded. Let us get on and do that. If you want to have lots of talk about other programs, then let us do it in the appropriate red legislation at some other time, but it is certainly not necessary now. Let us keep the bill simple. Let us get the money flowing and let councils know that they have the certainty of that continued funding under the Roads to Recovery program.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:19):  I, too, rise to speak on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. For those opposite, spending money on infrastructure is not a means to improving productivity, and it does not appear to be a means to improving the whole economy for the benefit of all Australians. It does, however, appear to be a means through which they can pork barrel their own marginal electorates, as they did through the rorted Howard era Regional Partnerships Program.


The Labor Party is a party that believes in infrastructure. It is a party that knows that developing infrastructure will improve outcomes for all Australians. Therefore, it needs to be developed according to need. Only the Labor Party understands that building infrastructure requires vision and an understanding that the needs of the entire Australian community need to be served, not just a marginal electorate that those opposite, as I said, would like to pork barrel in.


It is the Labor Party that realises that modern, efficient, well-placed infrastructure built in accordance with expert advice is what will drive Australia's prosperity into the future. And it is the Labor Party that understands that infrastructure includes ports, freight rail, light rail, airports, communication infrastructure, bridges and much more—not just more and more roads. That is why the former Labor government oversaw a radical transformation in the way that the Commonwealth approaches infrastructure.


 Compared to the last full year of the former Howard government, 2006-07, annual infrastructure spending in real terms was up 59 per cent by 2011-12. Infrastructure spending across the economy rose to record levels. In terms of spending on infrastructure as a proportion of GDP Australia rose from 20th to first in 2012 in the OECD.


We created Infrastructure Australia to research and rank proposed infrastructure projects based on their potential to add to economic productivity.    We rebuilt or upgraded 7,500 kilometres of road and 4,000 kilometres of railway lines. We delivered the National Ports Strategy and the National Freight Strategy.


Total annual private and public investment in our nation's roads, ports, railways, energy generators, water supply facilities and telecommunication networks hit a record $58.5 billion in 2011-12, equivalent to four per cent of GDP, the biggest share of national income since 1986-87. 


We lifted funding for infrastructure from $132 per Australian to $225. Total public and private sector infrastructure spending over federal Labor's first five years in office was almost $250 billion—almost 70 per cent greater in real terms than the $150 billion spent during the last five years of the former Howard government. As the figures I just quoted show, it is Labor that believes in infrastructure.


I spoke in this place earlier this year about the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill. Labor created Infrastructure Australia to research Australia's future infrastructure needs and impartially assess projects. Unfortunately, the version of the Infrastructure Australia bill that was passed in the House sought to destroy Infrastructure Australia's ability to plan for the future, assess the value of proposed projects, publish information without the minister's consent and would have even prevented Infrastructure Australia from doing research on whole areas of infrastructure needs like public transport or how to protect infrastructure from the effects of climate change.


In short, those opposite wanted to prevent Infrastructure from assessing their pork-barrelling projects or to provide frank and fearless advice on the country's future infrastructure needs. I do not believe that those opposite are serious about infrastructure at all. If they were, they would have given this bill a higher priority in this place.


This bill continues the funding for the Roads to Recovery program, which expired on 30 June, 2014. The program is made ongoing, indefinitely, rather than having a set expiry date in the act.


 Senator Macdonald mentioned the need to pass this legislation today. If the government were able to manage the proceedings of the chamber properly, they could have had the legislation passed before the funding expired.


Unfortunately, though, I do not think those opposite really have a clue about how to act when in government and that is pretty obvious from the many faux pas we have evidenced in the media since the change of government. I will not digress, because I would take up all my time just discussing those faux pas.


Other changes in this bill see the distinction between national projects, network and off-network projects eliminated and all are retitled as 'investment projects'. Transport research funding criteria are widened to include research into funded projects.


This bill also makes partnerships and non-corporate Commonwealth entities eligible to apply for research funding. The bill would also repeal the following three spent Land Transport Infrastructure Acts: the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988, which has been superseded; the Roads to Recovery Act 2000, which has no outstanding claims against it; and the Railway Standardization (New South Wales and Victoria) Agreement Act 1958. Loans under this act were repaid in June 2013 and this act therefore has no further effect.


The opposition has no issue with removing from the statute books spent and redundant legislation. We do, however, have issues with pork barrelling. We know that the current government likes to take credit for things that it has not done. We can see that from the minister's second reading speech in the other place. In that speech the minister mentioned almost a dozen major projects that were announced and funded by the federal Labor government, including: $6.7 billion to upgrade the Bruce Highway; $5.6 billion to finish the duplication of the Pacific Highway; $1 billion to continue the Gateway Motorway North upgrade in Brisbane; $686 million to finish the Gateway WA Project in Perth; $615 million to build the Swan Valley Bypass on the Perth to Darwin Highway; $500 million for the upgrade of South Road in Adelaide; $405 million for the F3 to M2 Link project in Sydney. One that is particularly important to me is the $400 million to continue the Midland Highway upgrade in Tasmania; Labor in fact committed $500 million and so the current government thinks it can do it for $100 million less. We also allocated $300 million to finalise plans, engineering design and environmental assessments for the Melbourne to Brisbane Inland Rail project and we also allocated $1.8 billion to the WestConnex project in Sydney, subject to conditions including a proper business case.


The current government has a nasty history of taking credit for the work of others, and the Australian people are waking up to the government's insincerity and their deceit. In Tasmania, they re-announced our entire nation-building package, albeit belatedly, including the same funding for the freight rail revitalisation, for the Brooker Highway and for the Huon Highway. There is only one difference: that is the Midland Highway, for which they have announced a $100 million cut. It is unbelievable that the Liberal senators from Tasmania can stand up and say that they care about infrastructure for Tasmania, when they have ripped $100 million from the Midlands Highway upgrade. They need to explain to the people of Tasmania why they did not fight harder for that funding, as does the member for Lyons in the other place. They need to explain why they have not fought harder for funding for Tasmania.


Labor will be looking to move amendments to this bill. We realise the importance that infrastructure projects be assessed to see whether they meet the nation's needs—not the political needs of the current government. The opposition's first amendment is to improve governance arrangements around project selection. Many stakeholders in the infrastructure debate have called for greater transparency and accountability over how the Commonwealth chooses to spend its infrastructure funds. The Australian people deserve transparency in the expenditure of between $3 and $6 billion per annum—much of that spending is channelled via this act.


When this bill faced the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, Labor senators had additional comments and flagged amendments. The opposition's amendments would see that, prior to approving individual projects under the act, the minister must have regard to the identified priorities and plans set by Infrastructure Australia and any advice it produces relating to the type of project being considered for funding. Further, for projects with a value of $100 million or more, the minister must obtain an evaluation of the project from Infrastructure Australia. This evaluation will include a cost-benefit analysis from Infrastructure Australia and an Infrastructure Australia view on the priority of the project against its identified national priorities. For projects that are funded, the minister will be required to publish details of the project and include Infrastructure Australia's evaluation and cost-benefit outcome. Overall, this strengthened governance is precisely what all major stakeholders in the infrastructure sector have been calling for in the current Productivity Commission inquiry into public infrastructure, and in the recent Senate inquiry into Infrastructure Australia. Allowing Infrastructure Australia to assess these projects will help to prevent the pork-barrelling we have seen under previous Liberal-National governments. This means that, if they do choose to approve projects that are unworthy, the Australian people will be able to see where and what the government is funding for their own political gain. 


The opposition's second amendment is to formalise the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity program as a program under the act. The Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity program is an Australian initiative established under the act in 2009 to improve safety and productivity outcomes of heavy vehicle operations across Australia. This program is the first dedicated Commonwealth program of its kind and aims to reduce driver fatigue. Unfortunately, too many Australian truck drivers die on Australian roads. The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development told the Senate inquiry into this bill that:


… during the 12 months to September 2011, 230 people died from 204 fatal crashes involving heavy vehicles or buses and there is significant evidence linking such accidents with fatigue.


This program funded rest stops along highways to provide more options for drivers to take a break. The first two rounds of the HVSPP provided $70 million in the period 2008-09 to 2011-12. In the 2012 and 2013 budgets, Labor provided a further $250 million to extend the program. This additional funding in 2013-14 brought total spending on the program to $320 million and added a further 58 projects to the 236 projects already delivered, including over 140 new or upgraded rest areas and 46 new or upgraded parking and decoupling bays.


Round 3 projects included funding the states and territories in six categories: rest area projects which improve the provision of heavy vehicle rest areas on key interstate routes; parking and decoupling bay projects which provide heavy vehicle parking and decoupling areas and facilities in outer urban and regional areas; technology trial projects which include trial technologies to improve heavy vehicle safety and/or productivity; road enhancement projects which enhance the capacity and/or safety of roads, including bridges, to allow access by high productivity vehicles to more of the road network; demonstration projects which facilitate innovation to improve heavy vehicle safety and productivity projects; and livestock transport industry projects which improve heavy vehicle safety and productivity for specific livestock transport operations. I urge those opposite and the crossbench members to pass these amendments to make roads safer for truck drivers and for the general public.


While I am summing up my contribution to this debate, I would like to say that one of the pettiest aspects of this bill is that it renames the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act to remove the words 'Nation Building'. Those opposite are so concerned about the positive legacy of the Labor government in infrastructure that they want to rename the act to wipe away Labor's connection with it. How petty can they be? The shadow minister, Mr Albanese, has sought assurances in writing from the new minister that there will be no additional cost to taxpayers because of this change of name and the minister has given that assurance. It will be interesting to see how they deal with changing all the letterheads, all the signs and everything else at no extra cost. All we can hope is that they will not choose to put the signs with the new program name in Liberal-National Party colours, as they did with the AusLink program. I really hope they will not stoop to such a petty, disgusting waste of taxpayers resources—again—to try to make themselves look good. 


Labor has shown time and time again that we are the party of infrastructure. I have listed the various projects we undertook and funded. I urge the Senate to pass the opposition's amendments to this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-08-27,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (10:34):  I thank Senator Bilyk and others for their contributions. I was taken by the latter part of Senator Bilyk's contribution, when she said that we were trying to take away the 'positive legacy'—I think those were her words—of the former Labor government in infrastructure. I think we are seeing that legacy being played out in today's front-page stories about the NBN and the way Labor handled that infrastructure project. Infrastructure development under the former government was a joke. It was done on the back of a beer coaster on VIP flights, it was done without cost-benefit analysis and it cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars extra—because the former Labor government simply did not do the work. 


We take a very different approach to infrastructure and the bill we are debating today is part of that. The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is part of our plan to fix the mess we have inherited and to deliver on the things we said we would deliver on. We said we would stop the boats, we said we would get rid of unnecessary and toxic taxes like the carbon tax, we said we would get the budget under control and we said we would build the roads of the 21st century—and that is what this bill is about. It is about rolling that out. It is extraordinary that the Labor Party are doing all they can to frustrate a roads agenda, an agenda of building infrastructure for the 21st century. It is extraordinary that a party that designed the NBN on the back of a beer coaster, costing taxpayers tens of billions of dollars extra, now seeks to frustrate a government seeking to deliver infrastructure properly. That is what this is about.


Infrastructure is key to Australia's competitiveness. Our future depends on it. Better infrastructure underpins vital services, such as transport and logistics. Inefficient infrastructure networks are one of the key reasons Australia's productivity has declined. Inefficient infrastructure networks are also a key driver of the cost-of-living pressures affecting Australians. The government is committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century and the changes in the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill will help us to achieve this goal. Our ability to deliver more appropriate, efficient and effective infrastructure will significantly influence Australia's future growth and maximise our competitiveness. 


The government is working with state and territory governments to deliver nationally significant infrastructure projects to maximise our productivity and improve living standards for all Australians. We are also working, where possible, in partnership with the private sector to maximise private capital investment in infrastructure projects. This collaboration between the Australian government, the states and territories and the private sector will enable the efficient and successful delivery of the infrastructure that Australia expects, that industry needs and that our communities deserve.


This bill, which amends the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009, is necessary to facilitate our ambitious land transport infrastructure agenda. We are committed to delivering the infrastructure of the 21st century. This bill continues the vitally important $2.1 billion Roads to Recovery program, which funds and supports local governments to carry out upgrades and maintenance on local roads. 


We are committed to the Roads to Recovery program, which was established under the Howard government. It is through our commitment that we have allocated $2.1 billion over the next five years of the program, including a doubling of funding next financial year to every local government in Australia. The purpose of the additional funding to the program is to assist in addressing the backlog of local road maintenance across the country. Chief Executive of the New South Wales Livestock and Bulk Carriers Association, Andrew Higginson, was quoted by the ABC as stating that the delay in providing certainty about this funding could have significant flow-on effects for businesses. He said:


It makes it impossible for people to actually go out and build the roads we want, even when the money is allocated.


You might have a local industry who could benefit greatly from an improved road and if that fund is not flowing through the local council, it could put that industry, or that particular producer, out of business.


A month delay, two month delay—the compounding effects of that can be disastrous for any industry.


The amendments proposed by Labor and the Greens, which the government deems unacceptable, include wanting to enshrine the name of the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program in the act. These projects are already funded under the act and budgeted for, and including a new separate part is nothing more than unnecessary duplication. Labor and the Greens also want to further complicate things by inappropriately creating an additional role for Infrastructure Australia in this bill. This act has nothing to do with the administrative arrangements of Infrastructure Australia, and so this amendment makes no sense whatsoever.


The coalition government is committed to reducing red tape, as has been evidenced by our red tape repeal days, as well as our commitment to cut $1 billion in red tape every year. This bill works to assist our deregulation agenda by repealing three spent land transport infrastructure acts. The government understands just how important road safety is for all Australians and how important this funding is to local road improvement programs and to our economy. Both the Labor Party and the Greens refused to support this bill in the other place, but they were unable to point to a single aspect of the bill that was unacceptable. This is nothing more than deliberate obstructionism.


The primary intent of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is to continue vital funding to programs such as the Roads to Recovery program—something that the former minister for infrastructure, Mr Albanese, failed to provide for when he was the minister. The expiration date was left by Labor at 30 June 2014, leaving local councils with no certainty whatsoever. The Labor Party and the Greens need to stop playing political games and support the passage of this very simple legislation. If Labor and the Greens were serious about delivering for councils and reducing the amount of red tape interference, they would simply pass this bill unamended.


As the chair of the ACT Consultative Panel for the Black Spot Programme, I am very keen to see this bill pass as it also continues funding to this vitally important program. The Black Spot Program provides funding to address road sites that are high-risk areas for serious crashes. It is a key part of the commitment to reduce crashes on Australian roads, save lives and reduce road trauma by funding measures such as traffic signals, roundabouts and increased signage at dangerous locations to reduce the risk of crashes. These programs are incredibly effective, saving the community many times the cost of the relatively minor road improvements that are implemented. An evaluation by the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics recently estimated that the program reduces casualty crashes at treated sites by 30 per cent.


I was pleased last month to be able to announce that the ACT would receive $1.1 million to upgrade and fix a number of dangerous black spots in our community. Here in the ACT additional funding of $452,000 has been made to install traffic signals at Jerrabomberra Avenue, Captain Cook Crescent and Sturt Avenue in order to fix a dangerous intersection, address a proven history of crashes and prevent the loss of life. Here in the ACT we are taking pre-emptive action through the Black Spot Program to upgrade signage at the intersection of Coulter Drive and John Cleland Crescent in Florey. We are installing animal fencing, additional reflectors and an upgrade to signage on the Tuggeranong Parkway, from Lady Denman Drive to Cotter Road Ramp East. And we are installing a high-angle approach for left-hand turns out of Well Station Road, as well as the upgrade of existing traffic signals at the intersection of Gungahlin Drive and Well Station Road in Mitchell. All of these measures are being put in place through the Black Spot Program to reduce crashes, to prevent road trauma, to save lives and to improve road safety. 


I was pleased to see that the 2014 budget allocated an additional $1.6 million to the ACT for the Black Spot Program. I will continue to engage widely with the ACT community to investigate potential locations that could be fixed under the Black Spot Program in order to maximise its effectiveness and potential here in my community. Nationally, the government's commitment also provides an additional $200 million over two years for this program. This totals a record $500 million to the Black Spot Program allocated by the coalition in the 2014 budget.


Importantly—and this has been touched on by Senator Bilyk—this bill also renames the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 to the National Land Transport Act 2014, removing the link between the name of the act and the name of the land transport infrastructure funding program. We should not be politicising the name of the Infrastructure Investment Programme from within the act. This change keeps the name of the act above politics. It also means that we will not need to amend the act should the name of the land transport infrastructure funding program change.


The bill also aims to streamline and enhance the operation of the act, which will directly benefit the states and territories and the Commonwealth. A new requirement is being implemented that the states and territories will notify the minister as soon as possible after the sale or disposal of land that was acquired using Australian government funding. By doing so, we will ensure a timely response to land sales and disposals from both the states and the territories and the Australian government. This will mean that the proceeds of the sale or disposal can then be allocated to new infrastructure projects. 


This bill also introduces a new type of project that can receive funding. Under the bill, projects that involve research, investigations, studies or analysis of investment or black spot projects, previously funded Off-Network Projects and works funded under the Roads to Recovery program will be eligible for funding. Additionally, to help inform advice to government, this funding will also be able to be used for analysis of projects submitted for consideration for funding as investment or black spot projects.


Lastly, the bill adds two types of eligible funding recipients to the act. Partnerships have been added as eligible for funding, the purpose of which is to simplify funding arrangements for firms without a body corporate structure. Non-corporate Commonwealth entities whose functions include research relating to land transport research operations will also now be able to receive funding under these changes.


The bill ensures that local governments get their $2.1 billion in Roads to Recovery funding, providing certainty into the future. It ensures that we remain consistent with our red-tape reduction agenda and it also works to support a number of other measures, such as the Black Spot Program. 


Labor and the Greens need to do the right thing by their electorates and their communities and pass this bill. As a government we will continue to stand up for local communities, we will continue to build the infrastructure of the 21st century and we will continue to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster. I strongly support the passage of this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-08-27,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (10:45):  I am absolutely delighted to support this bill, the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, and I urge all senators to agree to the passage of the bill without amendment and without further delay. It would have come into this chamber in the last sitting fortnight of the previous session of parliament had there not been a very strong indication that it was not going to pass at that time. I hope, over the last five weeks, there was the opportunity for reflection by senators on all sides and for speaking to their constituents, particularly those in rural and regional areas of Australia. They, like me, would have been lobbied very strongly by local governments around Australia to pass this bill without delay.


As has been said previously, the actual funding for the Roads to Recovery program notionally expired on 30 June 2014, so at the moment there is a cloud and some uncertainty over the continuation of that program. I will not go to discussions of the changing of the name, because it was canvassed earlier in this place. What I do want to do is affirm the commitment of our Prime Minister, Mr Abbott; he has made the very strong statement that he wants to be known as 'the infrastructure Prime Minister'. All of those strategies and policies are being put into place to give effect to that commitment. The last thing this place needs and the last thing the Australian community, and road users in particular, need is to see that frustrated and thwarted if it is being done just for cheap, political purposes. This issue is far too important to be tied up in that sort of nonsense.


Through the Infrastructure Investment Program, over the coming six-year period the government is committing some $35½ billion to road and rail projects across Australia. Others have spelt them out. I want to focus on two of them—that is, the $686 million to finish the Gateway WA project around Perth Airport and the $615 million committed to build the Swan Valley bypass on the Perth to Darwin highway. 


In recent days I have travelled up to Darwin and back to Perth; out to the airport again to travel to Esperance and then back to Perth; and then again within a few hours back to the airport to travel to Canberra. On each of those occasions I have had the opportunity to see the wonderful work that is being undertaken in the development of the Gateway WA project. It also emphasises, as we all know, that Western Australia is the powerhouse of the Australian economy. We know that the use of airports and the frequency of air travel underpin and speak to the enormous activity being undertaken.


Whilst it certainly is frustrating the movement of traffic, I wish to place on the record the tremendous accord that I have with, and my congratulations to, those responsible for giving effect to these engineering projects. How they are able to coordinate continually the movement of road traffic, vehicular traffic and heavy transport traffic to those air hubs and logistics hubs around our airports whilst at the same time undertaking this massive work, I think, deserves enormous credit. Those who have been in Perth recently may have travelled on the new, upgraded Great Eastern Highway into the city. Again, whilst it inconvenienced us, the fact that they were able to get on and get that work done and still allow those roads to remain open was tremendous. So I congratulate the government on its continuing efforts. I understand from Comcare drivers—in whose currency of knowledge I have enormous faith—that it will be towards the end of 2015 that we will see that finished.


The second project to which I referred is the Swan Valley bypass on the Perth to Darwin highway. Of course, there is no longer coastal shipping activity from Fremantle or Cockburn Sound going north for a lot of general cargo. There is, naturally, for completion of the major offshore gas projects at Gorgon and Wheatstone; but, unfortunately, coastal trade is no longer available for general cargo so it all now goes on roads. We in WA and those who have visited have all been grossly inconvenienced by the movement of enormously heavy vehicles carrying the components they do that will continue to drive the economy of Australia by supporting projects to the north and up to Darwin. It speaks volumes about the need for the Swan Valley bypass and, indeed, we just cannot get that work completed too quickly.


I turn to Roads to Recovery. Nobody should underestimate the value of this project, commenced under the Howard government and continued in the years of the Rudd and Gillard governments. What we are trying to do here—this is central to this bill that is before us today—is to guarantee continued funding to local governments so they can get on with their work. My colleagues earlier—perhaps Senator Rice, also Senator MacDonald and I think Senator Bilyk—referred to the value that local governments place on the Roads to Recovery funding. More to the point, it is locked in years in advance. By committing $2.1 billion over five years, the government has doubled funding for next financial year to every council in Australia. I think that is a recognition by the government of the value of this funding. 


Why is this funding arrangement so valuable? Because every council in Australia will tell you that when Commonwealth funding is assured they can then add their own locally sourced funds—and state-sourced funds, if they have them. Every dollar is driven further, is utilised better, in terms of the effectiveness and the efficiency of the projects being funded. For example, if they are undertaking roadworks they can ensure that, by mobilising and not having to demobilise and start again, they can lay more tar and improve roads and shoulders, and they can provide the quality of roads that the community expects. We know, because of geographic circumstances, weather situations and pressure of use of roads, there are different challenges in different areas of Australia. There is no better project or funding in the view of local governments around Australia, supported by the federal government of the day, than the Roads to Recovery program. But it is at risk at the moment. I absolutely implore senators who have any interest—and I know we all do—in the future of our road networks to pass this bill without delay. 


Mention has been made of black spot funding, and it is my understanding that the bill introduces a new type of project that can receive funding under part 4 of the act—Transport Development and Innovation Projects. These are projects, as the Deputy Prime Minister has said, that involve research, investigations, studies or analyses of investment relating to and including black spot projects—and how successful has the black spot concept been around Australia. So it will then be the case that those sorts of projects previously funded off network, funded under the Roads to Recovery program, will be eligible for part 4 funding. This amendment will enhance the management of projects and the Infrastructure Investment Program. Again, that is what we want to see in this country—we want to see maximum value for taxpayers' money in developing projects of value to the Australian community.


I cannot emphasise enough that we in this place and the media all too often make the comment that it is the government's money. Governments of themselves have no money. The money that they accumulate is accrued from taxpayers, company profits and interest on investments. Governments do not have money. Therefore it is incumbent on us as legislators to ensure that money is spent as wisely and as prudently and as frugally as it can be for the purposes for which it is allocated. We need to honour our commitment to Australian taxpayers—whether they pay through direct income taxes, taxes through GST, company profits or however else they are sourced—that we will spend their money as effectively as we possibly can.


As an aside, those young people looking down would have no idea that one of the effects of this bill will be the repeal of the Railway Standardisation (New South Wales and Victoria) Agreement Act 1958. I suspect that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, may not have been around when that was implemented. As we all know, we had the unusual circumstance up and down the east coast of Australia that the gauge of the railways in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria were all different. I recall one of the gauges being 5' 3"", the standard gauge is 4' 8½"" and the narrow gauge is 3'6"". How ridiculous must it have been for somebody to board the 5' 3"" gauge train in Brisbane, get as far as the border, unload themselves, their goods, their family and whatever else and get onto the 4' 8½"", and then travel through New South Wales on the standard gauge only to repeat the whole exercise in Albury-Wodonga. In our own state of Western Australia, we had, and still do in many instances, the narrow gauge—the 3' 6"". This bill repeals that particular agreement act of 1958, because the last loan repayments to the federal government were received in June 2013. So the loan has been repaid, and there is no longer any need for that element of legislation to be in place.


I understand from Senator Bilyk's contribution and that of Senator Rice that there will be amendments moved. The first one relates to the concept of a role for Infrastructure Australia in assessment. This is not what this bill is about. The issue associated with Infrastructure Australia casting its slide rule over projects and auditing them for the purposes of ascertaining effectiveness and allocating priority et cetera is worthy but it is not the subject of this bill. There is no case for holding up passage of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill because of an element that is totally and utterly irrelevant. So let us not to be confused about that element: it is not before the chamber, and it is not part of this exercise. It simply adds to the confusion and delays the inevitable—we hope—passage of this bill. The claim has been made that Labor and the Greens want to complicate the arrangements and inappropriately create an additional role for Infrastructure Australia in this bill when, as I have just said, the act has nothing to do with the administrative arrangements. It makes no sense. It adds to red tape. It is relevant in other legislation but not relevant in this legislation, and it therefore should be dealt with in other fora—and not dealt with in this one.


Other amendments to this particular legislation have been proposed in the other place by the honourable Anthony Albanese—amendments which, again, the government does not accept—to enshrine the name of the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program into the act. Again, these matters are dealt with in different jurisdictions and therefore it is not necessary for them to be introduced into this bill.


In my concluding comments, I say this: the central component of Roads to Recovery is critical to all Australians. For those involved in local government, it underpins their roads programs—their roads maintenance and roads development programs. And—as I am sure my two colleagues, Senator Fawcett and Senator Johnston, would agree, both coming from states with large road networks—those programs are absolutely critical to ongoing maintenance, and to the ongoing efficiency and effectiveness of the overall spend on roads in those local governments. So I urge all senators in this place to put to one side those sorts of activities that may have been amusing or distracting but may, in fact, have taken us away from the essential elements of this bill. It is simple: it requires passage. I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that every local government around this country is watching and waiting, and hoping that common sense prevails and that the bill is passed.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (11:02):  I also rise to speak on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. I say to Senator Back, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, not only are the Labor Party amendments needed but also that they are critical to ensuring that we get the best spend for infrastructure in Australia—through those amendments. Because, simply, this government cannot be trusted to spend the money where it is actually needed, and I will talk about that further through my contribution.


For those following this debate, it might seem hard to understand what, exactly, we are debating. In the other place, the minister claimed that this bill was about 'delivering the government's ambitious land transport infrastructure agenda'. This statement just highlights this government's complete lack of vision when it comes to investing in crucial nation-building infrastructure. This bill seeks to change the name of the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 to the Land Transport Act 2014, and it also eliminates some out-of-date provisions in the existing legislation. I would not say that this constitutes 'delivering', nor that it can be considered 'ambitious'. The other thing that this bill seeks to do is extend funding for the Roads to Recovery program. This formalises the Labor government's decision in the 2013 budget to continue the existing Roads to Recovery program beyond 30 June of this year—that is a $350 million program which expired on June 30 because of this government's incompetence and inability to manage their own legislative agenda.


Labor will be seeking to make two amendments to this bill. The first Labor amendment will require consultation with Infrastructure Australia before projects are approved, and will provide greater transparency around the decision-making. There has been much debate in this place on the need for transparency in relation to infrastructure spending. Many stakeholders in the infrastructure debate have called for greater transparency and accountability around decisions on how the Commonwealth government spends its infrastructure funds. In response to the views of stakeholders, Labor's first amendment requires the minister to seek the views of the government's infrastructure expert adviser, Infrastructure Australia, before approving funds for a project. Labor's amendment will also require a full evaluation by Infrastructure Australia of any project above $100 million in value. Finally, this amendment would require that, in approving funds for a project, the minister must make public not only Infrastructure Australia's findings on the priority of the project but also its evaluation of cost-benefit. Those opposite should be supportive of the Labor amendments, given that only four days before the election Mr Abbott said that no infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million would be funded without a published cost-benefit analysis. We already know that that commitment has been broken, along with a lot of other commitments and promises that have been broken by this government.


The second Labor amendment would formalise the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program as a program under the act. The Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program is an initiative taken under the former Labor government. The program targets infrastructure around heavy vehicle driver fatigue, and funds rest stops along highways to provide more options for drivers to take a break. In its current form, this bill—like all of this government's infrastructure policy—is just spin. The change of the name, with the removal of the term 'nation-building' from the statute books, seems little more than an attempt to remove any hint of the former Labor government from the infrastructure debate; any hint of the work that the former Labor government did on infrastructure; and any hint of the investment that the former Labor government made into nation-building infrastructure for Australia.


I can understand why those opposite might seek to do that. For a government with no real vision for infrastructure investment, the Labor Party's record on investment would be intimidating. I have had a number of representations from local councils concerned about future funding for Roads to Recovery. This concern is a result of scaremongering by those opposite. Labor does, and always has, supported the Roads to Recovery program. The simple truth of the situation, as set out in the 2013-14 Commonwealth budget papers, is that the Labor government extended Roads to Recovery funding across the forward estimates. Labor allocated $1.75 billion in the 2013-14 budget for the next five years of the program; it is already budgeted for the next five years. However, the first quarterly payment for this financial year, which is due to be paid to councils next month, is in limbo because the government would not agree to the sensible amendments proposed by Labor that would have increased transparency in major infrastructure investments. That is why the member for Grayndler, Anthony Albanese, yesterday sought to introduce a private member's bill in the other place that would amend existing legislation to extend Roads to Recovery. Yesterday Mr Albanese sought to bring on debate on his private member's bill and give councils the certainty they want by extending this program. However, the Abbott government opposed even debating the legislation. They shut down a move by Mr Albanese on his private member's bill. They would not even allow debate on his bill.


Not only has the incompetency of those opposite prevented the Roads to Recovery program being extended before it expired on 30 June 2014; now their sheer stubbornness has seen them reject Labor's attempt to sort this issue out. Labor understands how critical investment in infrastructure such as roads and rail is for the economic development of this country. Labor understands how critical it is to make the right investment in the right infrastructure projects. That is why Labor doubled the roads budget to $46.5 billion and upgraded 7½ thousand kilometres of road, lifted local government road grants by 20 per cent, invested $3.4 billion in rail freight network over six years, rebuilt more than a third of the rail network—that is 4,000 kilometres of track—and committed more investment in urban rail infrastructure than all predecessors. Labor understands the importance of these nation-building projects, and has invested in our vision for the country.


In my home state of Tasmania people know how important investment in critical infrastructure is for economic development. Unfortunately, those opposite have failed the people of Tasmania and have tried to fool them by reannouncing infrastructure projects in the budget. They reannounced our entire nation-building package, including the same funding for the freight rail revitalisation, for the Brooker Highway and for the Huon Highway. In fact, the only new thing in the budget for Tasmanian infrastructure was a cut—a cut of $100 million to the funding of the Midland Highway. Labor had committed $500 million over 10 years for this critical project, and now there is only $400 million. This is something that Minister Truss is apparently proud of, as he highlighted this project in his second reading speech on the bill we are debating here today. I might say that Senator Abetz also seems very proud of the fact that there was a cut of $100 million from the Midland Highway.




Senator Bilyk:
  That is disgraceful!




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  That is exactly right, Senator Bilyk. It is disgraceful. And that is from the government of our self-appointed infrastructure Prime Minister. Labor has a strong record of investment in crucial infrastructure projects, and Labor's record contrasts starkly with that of those opposite. Since coming to government those opposite have spoken of a grand vision for infrastructure, but it appears to be no more than a mirage. Not only have they failed to deliver funding for the Roads to Recovery program, but they have also cut $1 billion from the Commonwealth road funding to local councils. Councils all over the country will receive a real cut in real terms this year because of the government's short-sighted decision to freeze annual indexation of the financial assistance grants. These cuts to financial assistance grants will leave local councils with less money to maintain roads as well as delivering local community service.




Senator Williams:
  That is not true.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  It is absolutely true, Senator Williams. You have obviously not been getting your mail from your local councils.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Seselja
):  Order! Senator Brown, I will get you to address the chair, and I will ask Senator Williams not to interject.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  He does it all the time.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I cannot comment on what he does all the time. I am just asking him not to interject now.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Thank you for your protection from Senator Williams!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am very happy to help.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  These actions are in line with the legacy of Mr Howard's 12 years in government. The Howard government left its mark on Australia's investment in infrastructure with the largest infrastructure deficit in this nation's history. The Howard government hardly spent anything on infrastructure. It did not spend it for the economic development of this nation. Under the Howard government, 90 per cent of roads funding in my home state of Tasmania went to two electorates, both held by Liberal Party members. It seems this is a lesson the Abbott government has taken to heart. Since coming to office this government has taken a new approach to infrastructure funding, which could best be described as slashing, cutting, reannouncing and pork barrelling. Those opposite, led by Mr Abbott and Mr Truss, have travelled around the country shamelessly reannouncing Labor projects such as the Gateway Upgrade North in Brisbane and the Bruce and Pacific Highway upgrades, claiming them as coalition projects. They have done the same with Labor's inland rail project, claiming it as a coalition project. They have also scrapped billions in Labor funding for critical transport infrastructure projects such as the Perth public transport system, Brisbane's Cross River Rail project, the Melbourne Metro and Adelaide's Tonsley Park public transport project. Mr Abbott has committed to Melbourne's East West Link and Sydney's WestConnex project. However, this has been done without cost-benefit analysis—in defiance, as I mentioned earlier, of his own election promise. Those opposite obviously do not understand how transformative investment in crucial infrastructure is for our nation's cities, for our regional areas and for our economic development.


Those opposite, led by Mr Abbott, appear to think that infrastructure funding is about buying votes in marginal electorates rather than making critical nation-building investments. In fact, we have already seen the start of this type of pork-barrelling from them in Mr Abbott's budget. An analysis of the budget's infrastructure spending by Fairfax media found that coalition electorates are favoured for new money by a ratio of three to one. In comparison, the analysis found that the majority of projects which lost federal funding after the 2013 election were in non-Liberal electorates.


It is clear that the government are already ignoring the professional and independent advice of Infrastructure Australia, and it will only get worse if this bill passes. In a Sydney Morning Herald article on 12 June, Monash University professor of transport Graham Currie said:


The question is whether they—


the government—


want to be a professional government or they want to pork barrel, and whether we'll forge the idea of trying to be professional about how we manage resources or just do it on a political basis.


He then went on to say:


I don't think that's how a country should be run.


This bill makes the answer to Professor Currie's question clear.


Stopping this type of politically motivated behaviour was one of the purposes of establishing the independent advisory body of Infrastructure Australia, which Labor has fought to protect. That is why, to respond to the questions posed or statements made by senators opposite about Infrastructure Australia, we have put forward this amendment. It is quite clear that this amendment is needed so that Infrastructure Australia's expert advice is sought, the way it should be. It is an independent body. It makes transparent decisions. We need to have it there. This is why we are putting forward this amendment to this bill.


Critical national-building projects are currently under construction right across Australia because of the investment in infrastructure made by the former Labor government. Across the states and territories, and particularly in my home state of Tasmania, vital infrastructure projects initiated by the former Labor government are providing jobs and boosting the economy.


This bill does little more than eliminate the term 'nation building' from the statute books as part of Mr Abbott's agenda of rebadging Labor government programs. It is clear that those opposite have no real vision for transport infrastructure in Australia. I ask the Senate to support the amendment that will be put forward by our shadow minister today.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2014-08-27,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (11:17):  I hope Senator Brown stays in the chamber because I need to refer to some of the things she said. Senator Brown is correct that the government plans to freeze the financial assistance grants, FAGs, for three years. That is correct. I hope Senator Brown realises that we have a budget problem, a mess we inherited from that lot over there that Senator Brown is part of.


In 2015-16 the Roads to Recovery program will be doubled for local governments. Here is the point: FAGs can be spent on anything. When a council receives a grant, they can put pavers down on a footpath. They can put parks in. But we want to fix our roads. I do not know if Senator Brown has ever driven on a dirt road, but I do every week of my life. Here is the point we are making: we want to fix our roads because the exports we produce need to get to the waterfront. For that, we need some decent roads. I hope Senator Brown stays to hear more of what I have to say, but I do not think she is going to. There is more money for local government because of the doubling of the Roads to Recovery program. That was a National Party initiative under former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson.


While I am referring to senators opposite, I will say that I was surprised that Senator Conroy stayed this morning. I thought he would be too embarrassed to show his face after the release of the coalition's cost-benefit analysis of the National Broadband Network. That is the cost-benefit analysis that Senator Conroy and then Prime Minister Rudd refused to undertake because they knew they would be laughed out of the country if they did. The National Broadband Network is the biggest spending program in our nation's history and no cost-benefit analysis was done. We tried in opposition to get one, but people such as the former member for New England, Tony Windsor, did not want to have the cost-benefit analysis done either. It was a multibillion-dollar program that was devised on the back of a coaster—a coaster, mind you.


Senator Conroy must be close to releasing his own book. We have the Wayne Maxwell Swan book from the former Treasurer. Most of the rest of the Labor hierarchy have pointed the finger at each other about the six-year debacle when they were in government. There is no mateship in the trenches there! I look forward to Senator Conroy's book. What is it going to be called—'A roller-coaster in government' or 'Coming on a coaster near you'? Why didn't they do a cost-benefit analysis when they brought in the NBN? It is because they were afraid of the truth.


The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill amends the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009. Among other changes, this legislation will allow the Roads to Recovery program to be funded. In the other place, Labor and the Greens opposed the legislation. They opposed the very legislation that has brought so much finance and road improvement to local governments right around our nation. They opposed it. I hope it is not the same with this bill in front of the new Senate where Labor and the Greens, thankfully, do not control the numbers.


In November 2000, the Howard government announced a four-year road funding package worth $1.6 billion, of which $1.2 billion was spent on the Roads to Recovery program. The legislation was introduced by the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon. John Anderson. It was a Nationals initiative.


The new coalition government faced a $47 billion budget deficit for the 2013-14 financial year just past, $123 billion of projected deficits to 2016-17 and a $1 billion interest bill every month on Labor's debt. For those listening on radio, $1 billion rolls off the tongue pretty quickly. But let me give you an example. Senator Abetz gave an example recently in response to a question in question time on the difference between one million and one billion. One million seconds equates to 11½ days—that is not long—but one billion seconds equates to 31.7 years. So when we talk about billions we are talking about huge amounts of money.


Infrastructure spending does not stop under this legislation. There is a $50 billion investment from this government to deliver vital transport infrastructure across Australia for the 21st century. There is $2.5 billion for the Roads to Recovery program to support the maintenance and upgrade of local roads. I live out on one of those local roads—it is a dirt road—and I know the cost to council of maintaining let alone improving those roads, with their corrugations and potholes. That is especially the case after a dry spell, when the dust has been blowing, when the rain falls and there is erosion washing away the sides of the road. There are additional payments of $350 million to councils during the 2015-16 financial year. I put that on top of the FAGs freeze in the principal for three years, but a doubling of the Roads to Recovery money so we can fix our roads. We said we would be a government of infrastructure building, and that is exactly what is happening here.


There will be $565 million provided through the ongoing Black Spot Program. That includes an extra $100 million in both the 2015-16 and 2016-17 financial years. The $300 million Bridges Renewal Program will commence in 2014-15. This program will repair bridges. Mr Acting Deputy President Seselja, go out to regional New South Wales and have a look at the old wooden bridges that have been there for decades. You will see they are narrow and dangerous and need replacing. There will be $200 million over next five years for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program for road enhancements, rest areas and technology trials—especially the rest areas. I have discussed with Senator Sterle, who is a former truckie, how we need more rest areas, so that when the truckies have to take their break, according to their work diary, there is somewhere they can park their rig so they can get off the road safely—hopefully where it is quiet—and have a rest. There is a $314 million investment in 300 projects in local communities through our Community Development Grants Program, which is designed to deliver the coalition's election commitments and some residue projects from the previous government.


The $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund aims to promote economic development through investment in infrastructure projects at a local level. This is important. The program will help communities with lower than average socioeconomic circumstances and higher than average unemployment by improving local facilities, creating jobs and building needed infrastructure. There is $100 million to fill in black spots in the mobile phone network. It is all right in the cities and the large country towns, where there is a mobile phone network, but there are many areas across regional Australia that need towers to get the signal out there. There are plenty of examples around where I live—for example, Copeton Dam, which is visited by 100,000 people a year for water skiing, camping or whatever, has virtually no mobile signal. 


The Australian Local government Association says:


… Roads to Recovery (R2R) program has become an essential element in local government's ability to maintain and upgrade the local roads network. It is an outstanding example of a partnership between the national and local governments and of providing direct funding to local communities.


So why did the Labor Party oppose this bill in the other place? Why is it demanding changes now? It is because Labor wants an additional eight pages of amendments to provide for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. But this program is already provided for under legislation. It is already there. This government is committed to a number of other programs that are not provided separate status in legislation. If the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program with its eight pages of bureaucratic red tape is included, so must be the others, such as the Bridges Renewal Program and the Regional Roads Program. If the Labor Party's amendments were agreed to, funding to this program would be held up because the guidelines under which applicants were applying would be inconsistent with the legislation. We do not want things held up.


This government will require all Commonwealth funded projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis by Infrastructure Australia to ensure the best use of available taxpayers' money. The cut-off point is $100 million. It was not there for the NBN. We will also require Infrastructure Australia to publish justification for all its project recommendations. Infrastructure Australia is getting on with the job without it having to be in legislation. There was a provision in the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 to enable the $100 million threshold to be determined by a disallowable instrument, but the amendments moved by the opposition and ultimately accepted by the Senate on that legislation removed that provision. We will now seek to put the $100 million threshold in the Infrastructure Australia legislation, where it belongs.


A couple of weeks ago I was in the seat of Richmond, in the northern corner of New South Wales, adjoining Queensland, having a look at some of the coalition funded projects, such as the CCTV at Byron Bay. I was quite amazed to be informed of the amount of antisocial behaviour and crime on the streets of Byron Bay. It is a real concern. I also looked at the planned upgrade of Kennedy Drive at Tweed Heads. It is a pretty ordinary bit of bitumen, I can assure you, and it is good to see that $3.3 million will be spent to rebuild that stretch of bitumen. In Richmond, Tweed Shire Council received $6.11 million and Byron Shire $2.65 million under this program, between 2009-10 and 2013-14. I spoke with representatives of both councils. They are concerned that the Roads to Recovery program funding is being held up by the local federal member Justine Elliott and her Labor colleagues for no good reason other than to play politics. They should step back and let it go through.


In the Hunter region of New South Wales, Upper Hunter Shire has received $4.3 million, Singleton Council $2.73 million, Muswellbrook Shire $2.04 million, Cessnock city council $3.82 million and Maitland city council $2.84 million. I received a letter from the Hunter council which expressed fears about the future of the program. Mayor of Upper Hunter Shire, Councillor Michael Johnsen, says it is critical that the program continue, a view he feels would be held by every council in the Hunter region of New South Wales. Councils in the Hunter know the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon, voted to stop it, but Labor cannot come up with a plausible reason for having done so. Why did they vote against this in the House?


Over the past five years councils in New England were allocated over $30 million in Roads to Recovery funding. I appeal to the cross benches to stop listening to Labor lies. Mr Albanese has apparently told you that unless the heavy vehicle programme is actually named in the legislation it will not continue. That is absolute rubbish and is wrong. Ask yourself why Mr Albanese did not find it necessary to make significant amendments when he created the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program while in government. All he did was change the definition of a 'road' in legislation, because that is all that was needed to establish the program. So ask yourself, cross benchers, why is he now proposing three pages of amendments just on the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program?


This is a very simple bill. Its primary purpose is to extend the Roads to Recovery program, change the name of the act, and tidy up aspects of the act, which is consistent with the government's red tape reduction agenda. I have long ago given up trying to understand the Greens. It seems they are a leaderless lot on this very issue. The New South Wales Greens want the federal Greens to support the fuel excise increase, but the federal Greens have had several positions. Senator Milne was obviously rolled in the party room on that one. What I cannot understand is that the fuel excise increase is actually a tax on carbon, yet the Greens oppose it after fighting to retain the carbon tax in this place a couple of weeks ago. How do you work that one out? The fuel excise increase should be supported because all of the money will go to road funding, yet here they are again opposing a good program.


So I say again to the crossbenchers that there are no hidden surprises, no gotcha moments and no hidden clauses with this bill. Don't worry about Mr Albanese's propaganda. Let this go through. I am sure that if you do not let it go through your local government will tell you what they think, if you block this. Ask them to show you some of the projects Roads to Recovery has funded. Talk to the local governments in your states and hear the success stories of the Roads to Recovery program. Ask them if they looking forward to the doubling of the funding in 2015-16. Of course they are. Every council in Australia is. Then tell them that Labor does not want them to have that funding. That is the real issue blocking this. The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill should be supported so that money can start rolling out now.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (11:32):  I look forward to making my contribution to this debate today on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. Senators in this place should have road safety foremost in their minds, not only for our transport operators but for every single Australian who uses our roads. There are a lot of issues I want to clear up. Firstly, it is no secret that Labor does support the general purpose of the bill. We have no argument with that as it was our legislation and our work in 2009 that created this bill.


The Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program should be legislated. I heard Senator Williams going on about not listening to Labor lies, and saying to the crossbenchers, 'Why didn't Minister Albanese legislate it?' I will go further into why Labor believes the amendment should be passed and why we should legislate the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program.


There are a couple of points about heavy vehicle road safety that I want to touch on. The Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program is another element in the armoury we have to help drive down road deaths and injury. There should absolutely be no argument in this chamber or in the other place about doing whatever we can to reduce road deaths, trauma and injury. This program sits alongside spending on our national network, including record spending on duplicating the Bruce and Pacific highways, which, once again, was initiated by the former Labor government.


Heavy vehicle safety is also being addressed by the new Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which is sometimes referred to as the 'safe rates remuneration tribunal', which, no-one will be surprised to hear, I am going to have a bit to say about later. I am also going to have a fair dinkum crack at those on the other side who want to take this away from the road transport industry and thus diminish road safety for other road users in Australia. I will say more on that later. The tribunal was established by the former Labor government. It commenced operations in July 2012. The object of the act is to promote safety and fairness in the road transport industry. I do not see what is hard about that. In fact, I will tell you what is hard about it: it is a disgrace to this nation that it has taken so long to get through. But it is here now for the time being, and that mob over there are going to do everything they can to try to water it down.


The tribunal's role in this area primarily relates to addressing the relationship between remuneration and safety in the industry by, amongst other things, ensuring that road transport drivers do not have remuneration related incentives to work in an unsafe manner—and, my God, they are out there and they are alive. Also, it removes remuneration related incentives, pressures and practices that contribute to unsafe work practices. I challenge any senator who wants to debate this with me publicly to bring it on, because I will tell you that you are on the wrong ground if you think you are going to put up an argument with me that counters what we are saying about road safety and linking road safety to overloading, break and fatigue management, speeding, and illicit use of drugs. But the offer is there to any one of you. Bring it on. But you will not. You do not have the guts to do it.


The coalition government flagged its intention to eliminate this tribunal, even before its first partial order came into effect, on 1 May this year. They have commissioned an inquiry into the tribunal before it has had a chance to prove its worth as an additional tool to deliver road safety. In describing the tribunal as red tape, the government prefers ideology over finding new ways to save lives on the road.


While I am on a roll discussing the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, back in June this year Mr Jamie Briggs, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, was addressing an Australian Livestock Transport Association conference in Adelaide. I am quoting from ATN magazine, which is a pretty good magazine, too. It says here:


Briggs told the ALRTA conference the Coalition has ""always been very uncomfortable"" with the tribunal and then added: ""I think you can see the direction the government is intending to take.""


""We think over-regulation of your industry doesn’t help your outcomes. It just adds cost, it doesn’t improve safety. It just means your businesses are harder to operate.""


What a load of bunk! Why didn't he just come straight out and say, 'We will give you every opportunity in the trucking industry to screw around drivers' wages, break every fatigue law, speed, overload and turn a blind eye to illicit drugs.'


Let me just clarify this: I do not think one member of the Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association would agree with that statement I just made, but these are words coming from a politician from South Australia. I just want everyone to know his working history. It is a travesty when you get members of parliament who have had absolutely no life experiences and they pertain to be experts in the road transport industry. It really does give me the screaming abdabs.


But I have got to tell you Mr Briggs's work history. He was born in 1977—great, tremendous, no dramas. His employment before coming to parliament was as an employment relations adviser for Business South Australia—whoopee! Then he went on to become a research assistant to the Hon. RI Lucas MLC for a year, then he was adviser to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon. Kevin Andrews MP, for a year and then he was senior adviser to then Prime Minister, the Hon. JW Howard—




Senator Gallacher:
  He was up to his neck in Work Choices!




Senator STERLE:
  and as my mate and colleague Senator Gallacher said, he was up to his neck in Work Choices—for three years. The man has never had a real job. He has never had dirt under his fingernails and would not know what it is like to get out there and actually have to change a tyre at two o'clock in the morning when it is pouring down with rain; but he is an expert in road transport and road safety! What an absolute disgrace. Anyway, I will have a bit more to say about that later.


We will get back to the bill. I just want to quote, while we are talking about road safety, some words of wisdom from the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. What they said, in terms of the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program under the act, is:


Heavy vehicles are involved in many serious accidents across Australia annually—during the 12 months to September 2011, 230 people died from 204 fatal crashes involving heavy vehicles or buses and there is significant evidence linking such accidents with fatigue. Drivers are also required to comply with heavy vehicle driver fatigue-related legislation which ensures that regular and effective rest breaks are taken during long journeys.


Senator Gallacher and I know that, as we put in a lot of hard work in our former lives as transport workers and also as senior officials with the Transport Workers Union in the transport industry. This is not news to us two; we have been living and breathing it for the last 30-odd years of our lives. It may be news to a few on the other side, particularly those who have never had a real job in their lives but pertain to be experts in the road transport industry.


It also goes on to say:


The size of the heavy vehicle road freight task was 503 billion tonne kilometres in 2008, according to the National Transport Commission (NTC), and this is expected to reach 1,540 billion tonne kilometres by 2050. NTC argues that “improved productivity is the key to reducing the effect of the growing freight task on road safety, the environment and the amenity of our communities”.


They are words of wisdom. I could have told them that. There are no dramas; they only had to ask. But let us go back to what we did and the fears that Labor has in terms of the amendments not being picked up and not being legislated.


You see, in the round 3 criteria—which was under the Labor government—we said that projects that reduce accidents by targeting driver fatigue are of extreme importance. I want to share some examples of round 3 projects that we did do under Labor. Senator Johnston, let us go to your state and my state. Let us talk about WA, shall we? I can tell you, I know all these areas, as you probably do too. If I get it wrong, I am sure you may assist me. I also know that you will agree and I know that you will do everything that you would see fit to make sure that our roads are safe for all road users.


The government contributed $1.5 million to upgrading the Great Northern Highway road train assembly area in Wubin. You could spend another $1.5 million on that before you got it up to scratch, but at least that has been started under a Labor government. And $850,000 was spent in upgrading five rest areas on the Great Northern Highway north of Wubin. Let me tell you, that is only a drop in the ocean. I was in the Kimberley last week. I do that regularly; I am a regular visitor to the Kimberley and have been since 1980. I have to tell you, it is hard for the road train operators to get into a parking bay at this time of the year. Everything up there is big; they are either over width or have three trailers. But you have the grey nomads in there, who will not spend a dime in town but will go and park in a truck bay and camp there for a couple of days. We could do with a hell of a lot more truck bays up here.


But at least there were five of them done at $850,000 under the previous Labor government. The layover bays on the Great Northern Highway between Port Hedland and Newman were done. That is only one project. You should see the other fine work that was delivered under a Labor government in Port Hedland, which I had an opportunity to look at last Tuesday. There was an upgrade to the existing rest area on SLK 526 on the Eyre Highway and a number of other initiatives.


The wording is the problem that we have with the government at the moment on this bill, because—as I have said—our criteria said that projects that reduce accidents by targeting driver fatigue are our cause. But under the Liberals' round 4 criteria, they have changed the wording to:



…


improve the safety environment for heavy vehicles.



What the hell does that mean? This is the fear we have and I want to share this with the chamber. I heard Senator Williams going on to the backbenches, saying, 'Do not be fooled by Labor,' and all that sort of stuff.


The truth of the matter is—and I am not going to be a shrinking violet on this; I have made this very, very clear—I do not trust the other side of the chamber when it comes to weaselling out of road safety programs. I absolutely do not trust the ministers to uphold what they should be upholding in terms of delivering road safety. We have seen that with some fellow who has never had a real job in his life but who claims to be an expert in road transport. He tells people he will water down road safety—he sees it as red tape. But I also do not trust Minister Truss to stick by his commitment to road safety, unless it is legislated in this chamber. 


I want to send a message out to Senator Muir. I have had the opportunity to speak to Senator Muir. I am privileged to have had the opportunity to speak with Senator Muir's chief of staff, who, like me and Senator Gallacher, is an ex-truckie and actually gets the importance of road safety. This may not come up again. Senator Muir has six years in this building at this stage; he may get another six years—I hope he does. But, Senator Muir, you have to understand that you may not have the opportunity to correct the ship. Along with other crossbench senators, this is now the time to support Labor's amendments, as I know the Greens will. I want the Palmer United Party to understand this. Why should the minister have the final say? We should trust the parliament; we should not trust individual ministers with road safety. 


Here is another reason why—and I am going to make this very, very clear: one of the major pushes for the abolition of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal has come from none other than Coles, the supermarket. Surprise, surprise, Coles have got a problem. Coles do not want transport operators to be safe. Coles have problems because our drivers have to have fatigue management breaks. Coles have problems—they will not say it, but why else would they want to kill off the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal?—because truckies have to be paid properly. If truckies are paid properly, truckies will not have the incentive to speed, to break speed limits to make a dollar or, even worse, just to meet their basic commitments in fuel payments, insurance payments, truck payments, maintenance and tyres. Coles have a problem with the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal because it also takes away the incentive for truck drivers to seek to use illicit drugs. I did not say Coles were supporting or promoting illicit drugs, but why in hell would a major user of transport have a problem with truck drivers being remunerated properly? Why would they have a problem with truck drivers carting legal limits, legal loads? Why would they have a problem with other road users making sure that they are absolutely protected due to our truckies being protected when they are paid properly and they are rested? I rest my case. I do not see the reason for this. 


There is this bulldust about red tape. Call it what you like, but when my kids and my wife are out on the road I want the truck coming towards them to be driven by a truck driver who is remunerated properly, who is carting legal load limits, who is not using illicit drugs and who does not have to speed or shortcut on repairs, maintenance and tyres. You can call it what you like—I do not care what you call it—but to hide behind red tape is an insult to the transport industry and an insult to the road safety industry. Every person in this chamber and in the other place should condemn the ridiculous statements made by people who have no idea but who are getting paid a nice little wage because they are a parliamentary secretary or an Assistant Treasurer. It really irks me. 


If Mr Briggs has a problem, I welcome the opportunity to tour the country with Mr Briggs. There is the offer, if he is listening. Let's debate it. He and I can get into a debate, but we are not going to hide behind the apron strings of Coles, behind the apron strings of major transport companies who do not want to pay their drivers properly or behind the apron strings of other users. Debate me, but debate me with community people. You name the place, Mr Briggs, and you name the time—I will be there debating with you. You put forward your case and I will put forward my case as to why we should have a Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, why we should make sure that every Australian has an opportunity to go to work or to go visiting or whatever and know that Australia's truckies are rested properly and paid properly and that the use of illicit drugs is stamped out. There is the challenge.


We have heard a number of statements about how great the government is and, yes, we all support these things and we all want to work together, but we have to put it in context. If all sides of the chamber—the crossbenchers, the Greens, Labor and the Liberal-National coalition—agree, what do they have to fear about letting the parliament be the judge? What is there to fear about amending this piece of legislation by taking this decision out of the hands of the minister? We have seen other examples. Minister Truss may have some problem with this, but I also remember in 2004-05—I was not a senator in 2004—that there was a fair bit of pork-barrelling going on. The Australian National Audit Office found 17 shocking examples of pork-barrelling. I am not saying that that was all involving Minister Truss; other ministers were in that portfolio before him. But Minister Truss picked up the last six or eight months in the portfolio. This is the sad part. If it is not controlled by the parliament and it is the hands of one minister, it could be twisted, it could be moved aside, and certain elements could be de-prioritised. When I see the wording of the coalition's round 4 criteria state in brackets that they want to improve the safety environment for heavy vehicles, that does not give me any comfort at all.


I say to all those out there listening: put on the hat of your parents or your brothers or sisters. My son is a truckie. He is out there every night on the North West Coastal Highway or the Brand Highway or the Great Northern Highway. I know that he works for a reputable firm. He works for Western Australia's largest transport company, where the truck drivers are paid on their fatigue management book. They cannot diddle their hours. They also have cameras in the cabs and they have GPS. If they—the largest transport company in Western Australia, which is privately owned—do not have grief with paying their truck drivers properly, if they do not have grief with making their truck drivers have fatigue management breaks and telling their clients, 'If you want us to provide your transport services, these are the laws and regulations that you must work in,' why the hell are the likes of Coles, ably abetted by junior ministers who have no idea, pushing to get rid of or water down Australia's road safety legislation? We will not be supporting the bill.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2014-08-27,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (11:52):  I congratulate Senator Janet Rice on taking over the transport portfolio, and I look forward to working with her in this area. She has set out the Greens' very clear case on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. I reiterate the Greens' support for Roads to Recovery and black spot funding to improve safety and access on our roads. Some of my work in the portfolio of local government crosses over into this area. When I was in the New South Wales parliament, I saw how important road maintenance and road safety issues are to local government. It is an area of politics where some very important work is undertaken. 


Constitutional recognition of local government is relevant to this discussion. Constitutional recognition is needed for many reasons, but one reason is to ensure that funding for local roads continues to flow. I again put on the record how disappointing it is that the issue of constitutional recognition of local government seems to have fallen off the political agenda of this government; it did appear when they were in opposition that they were not really committed to it. It is something that we need to continue to raise. If you want surety of roads funding for local government, it is most definitely relevant.


Over the past few months since the introduction of this bill, the coalition government—particularly the National Party, I have noticed—have been running some ugly politics, trying to accuse the Greens and Labor of undermining road safety because we would not simply wave the legislation through. That really is low, insulting and cheap politics. We have just heard Senator Glenn Sterle set out very clearly how important it is to have safety on our roads and how relevant this issue is not only for truck drivers but for all road users. For any members who did not hear all of the senator's speech, I would recommend it, because he set out the need for good rest breaks and decent pay for truck drivers and how important it is to stamp out illicit drug use. These are critical issues that serve as a real reminder of why we need decent regulations. This government is trying to run down these regulations, which then becomes a real safety issue. So if we are talking about safety, those factors also need to be taken into consideration. 


While we are talking about road safety and local councils, it is also relevant to remember what happened in the government's first budget brought down in May this year. There we saw $1 billion ripped out of local government funding. Regional councillors and communities from many country areas have contacted me about this. They are really concerned about the way the government is handling local councils. Often within those messages there were comments about what this would mean for road safety, for road maintenance and for jobs in those country areas. Often the area with the biggest job allocation in local councils is road maintenance. That has been spelled out to me time and time again. The Municipal Association of Victoria have estimated that regional and rural communities could be hardest hit by the cuts. Again, Senator Rice pointed this out very clearly in her contribution. The President of the Municipal Association of Victoria, Bill McArthur, stated:


Commonwealth financial assistance grants are a core revenue stream for local government. The grants provide up to 27 per cent of rural councils’ total funding so rural communities will suffer a massive impact.


The local government associations of Queensland and South Australia have also detailed how regional and rural councils will be hit hard by this massive budget cut. The President of the Australian Local Government Association really nailed the impact on local roads in regional and rural areas, when she said:


These grants are used to maintain a great range of infrastructure including local roads, bridges …


There you have the importance of that government money for roads and bridges—$1 billion of that now ripped out—identified by these peak organisations that bring together our local councils and shires.


When we come to the debate about transport, the role of councils and the money that they are losing are very relevant issues. While the government is slashing vital support to regional councils, it is delivering billions of dollars to private motorway projects that will not improve congestion but will boost the profits of private developers. This is very relevant to this debate. It is essential that the money flows for road upgrades where they are needed because of safety issues. Meanwhile, we have a much greater flow of money into the hands of private motorway developers—clearly a section of the business community that is very close to the Nationals and the Liberals at both federal and state levels. The Abbott government have announced $3.5 billion in funding to the WestConnex, a private tollway in Sydney. They have done that despite the New South Wales government—their own Liberal-National colleagues at the state level—refusing to release the business case. The government are handing over that money while the community cannot find the details of who is going to benefit or whether there is any benefit at all.


Questioning in Senate estimates exposed the lack of confidence Infrastructure Australia has in the WestConnex project. This is largely because details and costs have been kept hidden. This is becoming a real theme with the development of urban motorways in this country. So it is not surprising that the Cross City Tunnel and the Lane Cove Tunnel, two big urban motorway projects in Sydney, have gone belly-up and into receivership. There have been similar problems with Brisbane tollways as well. So the evidence is in that there is a major problem with how these business cases play out. What do we see here? We do not see the government being transparent, being open with the public about the problems they are confronting. Even if they go ahead with their motorways, how are they going to make them work financially? You would have to assume that the reason they are being secretive is that they cannot argue the case. 


I have set out the amount of money, coming in at $3.5 billion, for WestConnex. The secretive way they are handling the business case is a repeat of what happened with the east-west tollway in Melbourne. The federal Liberal-National government has committed $3 billion. What do we see? Another project with a secret business case and another project that has been rejected by the local community. I very much congratulate the communities around the proposed WestConnex project and the proposed east-west tollway for getting out there and informing people about the reality of what these projects will do to their communities. They are letting people know how these projects will create more congestion and more pollution and how these sorts of motorways often divide communities—sometimes you cannot even cross the road in your own area anymore.


There you have it—$6.5 billion in total for private tollway projects that are completely lacking in transparency. That is very relevant to this debate. When we are talking about the need for money for roads, we need to look at what the government is doing across the board in this area and to explore why they are being so secretive and who is benefiting from allocations out of the transport budget. The government has committed less than a third of that $6.5 billion to the Roads to Recovery program in the 2014 budget. Roads to Recovery comes in at $2.1 billion—money that we have always said is needed and should be allocated. As other senators have said, however, there need to be standards and we need to get it right.


When it comes to infrastructure and roads spending, this government is full of rhetoric about how it is going to benefit the majority of people, but in reality they are delivering it in a way that works for the big motorway developers. The government accuses the Greens of opposing road safety while at the same time it prioritises billions for the private sector through projects like WestConnex and the east-west tollway. What the Liberals and Nationals need to realise is that people are cottoning on to that. The government might try to slag us off by saying we are not interested in safety and they might sprout those words for their media grabs, but that is insulting. Saying that a person does not dare about the lives and safety of others is, I think, one of the worst things you can say about someone. But I am finding that the community can see through the government's media grabs. They can see that it is just a cheap way for the Liberals and Nationals to try to deflect criticism and divert attention away from the very important analysis the Greens bring to this debate about where the money is being spent and why these urban motorways continue to be pushed by government—when the evidence is in that they represent a failed model. They represent a failed model from the perspective of delivering transport solutions and they are certainly a failed model from the perspective of business success. 


If this government were serious about improving productivity and safety, it would take off its blinkers when it comes to infrastructure investment and take public transport seriously. People often say, 'You bang on about public transport, Lee, but seriously people want to get in their cars.' Of course we know that people want to get in their cars. You need trucks. In a country the size of Australia, trucks will always be part of the transport mix. But the key way to reduce congestion on our roads is by having better public transport. That is how we can get traffic on our roads to move more efficiently—by giving more people access to reliable, fast, safe public transport. If they have that access, they will use it. Then the people who need to use our roads will be able to do so with less congestion. 


We need good quality safe roads to connect our communities, and that particularly applies—and I will emphasise this again because the continual distortion of the Greens position gets a bit tiresome—in our regional and rural areas. But decades of bias towards roads funding has created bottlenecks in our economy. We are far from world's best practice when it comes to freight and passenger transport. We are back in the 20th century. I was doing some work on the South Coast of New South Wales, along the Princess Highway. It is one of those areas where there have been huge upgrades—in parts, not in all parts. Many of those upgrades have been done for safety reasons, although not just for safety. But there have been huge upgrades with lots of flyovers. In one place, I was able to look down on both the railway line and parts of the motorway. The contrast was extraordinary. You could see a one-line rail track which I doubt has been significantly upgraded in a hundred years—seriously, any upgrades would have been minimal. In stark contrast, you could see this incredibly fancy motorway that has had all the kinks straightened out and is now a very fast road for users. That speaks volumes about how governments—and I am talking about successive governments here, Labor as well as Liberal-National—have approached transport infrastructure.


We need to ensure that rail and bus services keep up with the demand in our cities. I am giving emphasis to the cities because clearly that is where there is considerable congestion, but these services need to be addressed in our regional areas as well. We need to continue to invest in our regional rail network and freight lines to build on the incredible transport legacy created by our forebears. They had vision and they put in the hard work. I often use the extensive rail network that spans our country and I often address community groups who are very passionate about our rail lines. 


Sometimes you wonder whether it had been up to the governments of today to come forward with a transport plan they would have had the vision of our forebears to put in such an extensive rail network. Our forebears knew that what they were building then was for the future; it was not just short term, with a couple of rail lines linking up a few communities. They had that vision, and that is what we as a society need to return to today. The planners, the engineers and the public officials who delivered such a comprehensive national rail system had the common sense, vision and understanding of the importance of public transport when it came to connecting our cities with our regions and our regions across this huge land. 


The pattern of investment in roads at the expense of rail in recent years has shifted the balance. We now see huge problems across the country, with gaps in the rail network, the dangerous growth of B-double and B-triple trucks on our roads and the ailing public transport system in our major cities. There is not the vision or the coordination needed for safe roads and also for roads that will help boost the productivity of this nation while, at the same time, being a wonderful transport system that allows grandparents to pick up their children in the next suburb after preschool, people to catch public transport to do some volunteer work, students to go to a university a couple of suburbs away and people to get to work efficiently. All this should be fundamental to how a government approaches transport policies, not just one that looks at 'How do we do some favours for some mates?' who happen to be big motorway developers. 


The government has refused to spend a dollar on new rail projects. We heard the Prime Minister say those extraordinary words: 'rail is a matter for the states'. How he has really belittled public transport! The proposed legislation makes it clear that land transport is an infrastructure issue that needs to involve all levels of government—federal, state and local. It provides a framework within which the federal government can fund particularly road projects. There is absolutely no reason why such a framework could not be established for important public transport projects. When the minister comes in, he will clearly be dealing with the details of the legislation, but it will also be very relevant to hear from the minister why such a framework—the minister will have the opportunity to set this out—could not be established for important public transport projects. The very name of the bill, 'land transport', would suggest that the funding allocated through this legislation would go beyond roads and perhaps into rail. Unfortunately, we know that is not the case. This is why, when I read the title and then the details of the bill, I felt that it was actually another one of those situations where the title of a bill is being used in such a way as to be misleading. 


So, yes, the Greens will support this bill because the Roads to Recovery funding is important to ensure road safety, but it will be contingent on two amendments. My colleague Senator Janet Rice, who has carriage of this legislation, has set this work out very clearly. We believe it is entirely reasonable to hold this government to its election promise, which was: 


To ensure more rigorous and transparent assessments of taxpayer-funded projects—


These are the words of the government—and they went on:


we will require all infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis.


So what could be the problem here? Surely those amendments should pass. We will support amendments to that effect to ensure the government are held to their word. In fact, we will move for the lower threshold of $50 million to ensure even greater transparency in terms of the allocation of public funding. 


Additionally, we will support amendments to enshrine in legislation guidelines relating to the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. However, as we believe this program should be focused on truck driver safety, we will move to prioritise projects that improve the safety environment for heavy vehicles rather than projects that are purely focused on improving the productivity of road freight. The primary goal of government when it comes to road freight infrastructure should be to make sure that truck drivers are safe—this should be the starting point: truck drivers are safe—and then we can have safe roads. You cannot do one without the other, and this is where I become very disturbed with how the government plays out this issue. We are talking about the lives of people—people with families, people who are on the roads with such a huge responsibility driving the big trucks that we regularly pass. They should be able to go home to their families, and everybody they pass should equally always know that the roads are safe. 


One of the best ways to ensure that our roads are safe and our productivity is enhanced is by starting the transition to freight on rail. This is not about taking work away from truck drivers; it is about increasing the productivity of our nation. We can all benefit from safe roads, greater productivity and a transport system that works effectively for all.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (12:12):  I also rise to speak in this debate on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. Can I add to Senator Rhiannon's comments that I do not think she will get an answer from the minister—but it is worth holding out for that, in any event. This government does not want to engage in debate. Quite clearly, in this instance, they have been cruel and particularly unfair. They said that they would be an infrastructure government, but they did not tell the Australian people that it would be done on the back of the lowest and middle-income earners, with savage cuts and higher taxes. They did not say that they would do it by re-announcing all of Labor's infrastructure projects. 


To be fair to the Treasurer—something he is not used to—he does not think this is an unfair budget. In his mind, poor people do not drive cars anyway. He could take the ice bucket challenge, but I think this challenge would be better. I would like him to stand on the M1, with a billboard that has his photo on it—he could also maybe do this on the M5 in peak hour traffic in Sydney or on the Gateway Motorway or the M1 in Brisbane—and tell those hardworking people that they do not need to worry because they do not drive cars anyway. I would ask him to try that challenge and see how he fares. It might be easier to do the bucket of cold water, and that could wake him up to the fact that he is so wrong about these issues. 


The bill amends Labor's Nation Building Program legislation. Labor's Nation Building Program saved the country from the worst of the GFC but, in particular, it did this: it modernised Australia's land transport infrastructure. The government is now determined to tear it up and in its place put only pain and incompetence. This government is really two halves: on one side, they are cruel, mean and heartless, determined to inflict pain on the lowest income earners in the community; on the other side, they are simply incompetent, bumbling around like clowns, a three-ring circus, falling over their own words and tripping themselves up on a budget of broken promises. When you put them together, they make a whole of incompetence and cruel cuts.


Let us look at the incompetence in the budget strategy. First it was a 'budget crisis'. Senator Williams—in this debate—changed the words again; he did not use the words 'budget crisis'. So the government are not clear about what it is. Then it was an emergency. Then it was a problem. But, when 97 per cent of the budget had already passed, they said, 'No problem at all; nothing to see here.' Then, all of a sudden, Mr Barnaby Joyce shot out of the gate and said hospitals and schools would close down if the budget were not passed. Everybody on that side forgot to tell him; again, they forgot to give him the script so that he would get it right! They belatedly wheeled consultants and party hacks into the cabinet room to tell them to tone it down: 'Tone it down. Don't get people excited about your budget crisis,' or your budget emergency or your budget problem, whichever it might be. I am not sure if they got around to discussing it in the party room yesterday. It would have been hard to get a word in, with Senator Macdonald's tirade against Mr Tony Abbott. But I digress, and this is a serious issue. But I wanted to make sure we understood the frame of this debate, where the coalition are at with this debate and, more importantly, how incompetent they are when it comes to reform or following through on reform.


Much of the debate on this bill has centred on the fact that everyone here, I think, believes that we need to continue to improve our roads to have good infrastructure and that that should continue. I think the coalition started out with that premise but lost their way, through being either mean or incompetent—take your pick. The bill relates to roads, rail and intermodal funding by the Commonwealth, and the minister's second reading speech mentioned a dozen major projects that were announced and funded by the previous, federal Labor government. They included the $6.7 billion to upgrade the Bruce Highway—I will say that again: $6.7 billion to upgrade the Bruce Highway—one of the important links across Queensland; $5.6 billion to finish the duplication of the Pacific Highway, which is absolutely necessary; and $1 billion to continue the Gateway Motorway North upgrade in Brisbane. All those projects are about supporting Queensland, Queensland jobs and Queensland infrastructure. In one sense, it is pleasing to see that the coalition did not rip the heart out of that when they got into government; they just re-announced our programs.


What worries me most of all is whether the government will pick up the cost of changing the name of this funding program from the Nation Building Program. The opposition have sought an assurance from Mr Truss that additional Commonwealth expenditure will not be incurred as a result of the name change.


But one of the most difficult issues, and I think Senator Rhiannon picked up on this earlier, is whether, if the government continue with all those funding commitments—including finishing the Gateway WA project in Perth, which I know you, Acting Deputy President Sterle, would be interested in finalising, as well as the $615 million to build the Swan Valley bypass on the Perth to Darwin highway—it is going to be a case of, 'We'll continue this funding but we're going to have to drag money away from somewhere else,' such as the Federal Assistance Grants to local councils and other areas. So is it true that they are going to provide this funding, ultimately?


The government deem it necessary to extend Roads to Recovery. This is, as we know, a very popular program when you go out and talk to local councils; they find it fits their bill. This is a program that Labor funded out to 2018—a total of $1.75 billion fully funded in Labor's budget. The coalition say they support the program. However, if you look at their savage cuts to Financial Assistance Grants in the 2014 budget, the total cut being nearly $1 billion over four years, they appear to have taken with one hand and allowed the remainder to be there. So it is of no comfort to local councils in Queensland. In six years, the indexation freeze on these grants will overwhelm the $350 million allocation made under Roads to Recovery, making support for local government roads a complete mockery. That is where we have ended up with this coalition. 'Tricky and mean' is all you can say about them when it comes to the way they have structured their budget for roads.


On the other hand, if you look at Labor's record—Senator Williams tried to decry what we have done—we doubled the budget to $46.5 billion, upgraded 7,500 kilometres of roads and lifted local government roads grants by 20 per cent. So we have put our bona fides on the table. The local councils out there recognise the hard work that Mr Albanese, from the other place, did as roads minister. They still talk about him reasonably fondly for the work that he did in those regions. He remains committed to assisting local councils to improve their roads and infrastructure.


Let us compare that with the coalition's position. The coalition has committed to the Melbourne East West Link and Sydney's WestConnex projects without cost-benefit analyses in defiance of its own election promises; has shamelessly, as I have said, re-announced Labor's projects, such as the Gateway North in Brisbane and the Bruce and Pacific highway upgrades, claiming they are coalition projects; and has tried to welsh on $500 million on roads spending in WA for the Great Northern Highway and the North West Coastal Highway. They backflipped, and I suspect it was a backflip with half pike. We could give some of the credit for that spending to Senator Sterle, but I think Mr Albanese can take the credit for pushing very hard to secure that backflip with half pike from the coalition. All of this points to the coalition being very tricky and mean when it comes to roads and infrastructure funding.


There are two amendments that we want to make to this bill. I know Senator Sterle has a very deep interest in one, which is the heavy vehicle program. The first amendment seeks to formalise an initiative taken under the former Labor government, a program targeting infrastructure around heavy vehicle driver fatigue and productivity. This program is about ensuring that there are properly funded rest stops along highways to provide more options for drivers to take their break. This highly popular program has funded many initiatives across rural and regional Australia. I ask Senator Williams to support this amendment. If he has an ounce of rural or regional blood in his veins, he will support a program that supports regional truck drivers. I doubt he will, but I will make the bold assertion that he should.


Infrastructure Australia also needs transparency. This government shrouds itself in secrecy. It loves the dark. That is about all you can say about it. It does not want any light on or transparency about what it does. I did not think that I would find a lack of transparency here in road infrastructure. I knew I could find it in the Attorney-General's portfolio and in border command and border protection. They are up-front about it, at least—they simply said, 'I am not going to tell you at all. We will keep it to ourselves. You can go and figure it out yourself.' At least they were up-front about it. At least they told us. I do not agree with their secrecy, I believe that they should have transparency and openness, but in this case who would have thought that you would have secrecy surrounding road infrastructure? But secrecy has found its way in.


Labor wants to ensure that there is full and transparent scrutiny of major project spending. It happened under Labor; why can it not happen under the coalition? They do not want it to. It makes you suspicious instantly, quite frankly. Many stakeholders in the infrastructure debate have called for greater transparency and accountability in how the Commonwealth spends its funds in infrastructure. It makes sense, because people want to have confidence that these billions of dollars being spent on roads are being spent wisely on the areas that require them and in the order that they should be.


Transparency and accountability are anathema to this coalition government. I think they do not like the words. If you were playing word games with them, they would never make those two words no matter how many letters they had to support them. In this instance, this government should take on board this recommendation. This will ensure proper scrutiny before projects are approved. It is about ensuring that we ask the minister to seek the views of the government's expert adviser on infrastructure, Infrastructure Australia. It makes sense. If you are going to spend in this area, why would you not get the expert's evaluation? I think the coalition will not support this amendment, because they love the black. They do not want to have transparency and accountability.


The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill enables the continuation of the Roads to Recovery program after 30 June 2014. It seeks to unify the scheme for funding national land transport network projects. It also seeks to enlarge the scope of the power to fund research, investigation, studies and analysis. Ultimately, the policy area by the coalition is not new—and I think that is the main point we should note in this debate. They have not come up with any new policy position in this debate. They have done what I said they did when I started—they have simply renamed it and exaggerated the impression of a major shift for the media's consumption. They bang the tambourine drum, as you say, but ultimately it is the same tune. Nothing has changed—except the areas I highlighted where I think they are being tricky and mean, and are seeking to rip funding out from this area. Why they hate local councils so much, I am not sure. In opposition, the coalition would praise local councils. They would talk to them continuously. But now when you travel around rural and regional Australia, local councils are feeling like they have been short-changed by the coalition—I think Senator Williams, particularly, has an affinity with rural Australia. I think the coalition have done themselves a huge disservice in this debate, particularly around roads. When you understand that councils rely significantly on this funding stream to ensure that local communities can be well supported with roads, it really makes you reconsider the coalition's position on this—and appeal to local councils to reconsider their position, which has been to support this program under the now coalition government.



One of the areas I would like to go to briefly is that, whilst Labor was rebuilding the road infrastructure network, we also, through Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, rebuilt many roads and other infrastructure out in the community. Like Senator Rhiannon, I would also like some assurances from the coalition that, as part of the way forward, they will not also—as they have done with Roads to Recovery and with the federal grants to local councils—short-change local councils on NDRRA spending. We are a country which suffers from floods. We are a country which has cyclones. These events decimate local areas, particularly roads and infrastructure. and they need to be rebuilt; rebuilt quickly and rebuilt well. When Labor was in government, we did just that. I worked with the Attorney-General and I worked with Mr Albanese, to do just that. What I worry about—and the government could put this beyond doubt—is whether the coalition will continue that hard work to make sure that they do not push the cost onto councils like they have done under FAGs.

As alluded to by Senator Ludwig, the bill seeks to amend the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act in the following areas: continued funding for the Roads to Recovery program, which expired on 30 June 2014—the program will be made ongoing indefinitely, rather than having a set expiry date in the act; the minister will acquire an ongoing power to determine a Roads to Recovery list which is not a disallowable instrument; the distinction between the national network and the off-road projects will be eliminated, and all will be retitled as investment projects; transport research funding criteria will be widened to include research into front-end projects; partnerships and non-corporate Commonwealth entities will be made eligible to apply for research funding; the act will be renamed and 'nation building' references will be taken out; and some spent acts will be repealed.


What does all this mean? We have councils that are saying, 'Roads to Recovery funding needs to come through or we are going to stop important, urgent works', and 'we may have to lay people off'. What this is really all about, in my humble view, is that we have a new government—which in earlier contributions has been labelled 'tricky', 'mean', and 'lacking clarity and transparency'.


If we take, for example, the minister requiring an ongoing power to determine a Roads to Recovery list: previously, the situation was that Infrastructure Australia would have had an open and full consultation. There would have been a complete and transparent economic evaluation of the project. It would have been ranked in the national scheme of projects; it would have had a priority, clear and transparent for all to see. And the nation would have been built to a better and higher standard. But they are not doing that. They are determining what gets funding. They are not doing a clear and transparent economic precis of the requirement for a project, the cost-benefit analysis, what it is going to bring to the nation, or to the economy—they are simply going to do it politically. And there is plenty of evidence of that going on around the country.


Importantly for the coalition, they had to take 'nation building' out of it—because they are not building the nation; they are building where they want to build. They are not building in a coherent, cohesive manner, in accordance with the nation's priorities; they are doing it in accordance with their—dare I say it—electoral priorities. The simple fact that they are taking all funding of rail out of the equation is a very clear indicator that they are not looking at the nation as a whole, or at its needs as a whole.


What I really wanted to do, Mr Acting Deputy President, is go to yours and my—very heartfelt—clear area of some expertise. I think it is really important to have on the record that heavy vehicles are involved in many serious accidents across this country annually; in fact, almost daily. During the 12 months to September 2011—and these are old figures—230 people died from 204 fatal crashes involving heavy vehicles or buses. There is significant evidence linking such accidents with fatigue. Drivers are required to comply with heavy vehicle driver fatigue related legislation which ensures that regular and effective rest breaks are taken during long journeys. According to the National Transport Commission, the size of the heavy vehicle road transport freight task in 2008 was 503 billion tonne-kilometres. This is expected to reach 1,540 billion tonne-kilometres by 2050.


If there is not a clearer indication that we need nation building in our roads, then I do not know where you would look for more compelling evidence. And we have not even talked about the passenger vehicles. We have not talked about the commuters and the millions and millions—probably billions—of kilometres that are done by the travelling public. The whole purpose of investing in our infrastructure is to make the economy work, but it has to work in a safe way. Along with the Hon. Darren Chester, I co-convened the Parliamentary Friends of Road Safety, and there is no clearer indication of the need for investment in rest areas, technology trial projects, parking bays and road enhancement projects than a quick look at the road toll.


Interestingly enough, we have had a very, very successful period—particularly in South Australia, I might say, and a great credit to some very influential and important people like Sir Eric Neal, Roger Cook and the like, who have been involved for many years in reducing the road toll. But we know that there will be improvements in vehicles and, importantly, that there will be improvements in roads. Let us hope that this government does not fall for pork barrelling and make those improvements in roads away from where they can best meet needs—where they can deliver the best result in terms of safety and economic benefit to this nation. We know that these things happen, and they happen with due planning and process. We know very clearly that you cannot portray economic benefit and improvement in safety as red tape, as some in this government are attempting to portray it, like the Hon. Jamie Briggs: 'We'll get rid of red tape; that'll save us.' But it will not save anybody if you get rid of the absolute prudent requirement to plan tasks carefully, to follow them in accordance with the appropriate safeguards, thereby affording every road user the ability to get up and down the road safely, not just the truck drivers but other people. We have had some awful examples in very recent times in Adelaide, such as a continual stretch of road that seems to attract significant road safety catastrophes, with a number of people being killed in recent times.


I note in that debate that the Hon. James Briggs was immediately out there saying: 'We'll spend some money on that; we'll be out there. Whatever you need, we can do something there.' But I do not think that is how the government should run. The government should run on the basis of proper evaluation through the auspices of Infrastructure Australia or the department, do a proper cost-benefit analysis and get the matter addressed that way, not wait for a burning issue and then throw a pot of money at that in an ad hoc matter. We had a nation-building strategy. They are even seeking to remove the name 'nation building'. They do not even like the fact that it had 'nation building' under it. Why that is so offensive to them, I am not sure. But it will not be sufficient for this economy to function effectively and for people to get their right to safe roads—it will not be fair dinkum, if you like—for a government to lack transparency, to put things in the dark. It is very clear that there needs to be investments in rural Australia, and it is very clear that if you live in rural Australia you do not have the many large centres that they have in the city. The argument could be that unless we can weight a bit of funding to regional Australia then all the money will be spent in and around the cities, where the masses of population are, and you can probably do a better business case analysis.


I am not sure that any Australian government has ever been guilty of that. We have built where the need has been demonstrated. If it has been a safety criterion, where there has been a stretch of road that has not been sealed or a stretch of road that has had soft shoulders and has not been upgraded, then all governments have invested that way. So I have the view that getting rid of Infrastructure Australia—getting rid of the independent economic analysis, the measuring of the effect on the productivity of the country and the awareness of safety—is a very retrograde step. And I am not sure—in fact, I will be as blunt as Senator Sterle: I have no confidence that the Hon. James Briggs is a person with enough experience to make some of the judgements he may be called upon to make on a daily basis. Let us hope his department is sufficiently skilled, qualified and able to give him good advice and is able to make sure that that advice sticks, because if we are in the hands of the Hon. James Briggs in terms of economic benefit in the road infrastructure network and in safety in the road infrastructure network, then I would have some concerns. I would think that he may well be taking on a job that is a little beyond him. That is why he should endorse and accept a structure like Infrastructure Australia that does the cost-benefit analysis, does the research, is contestable and stands up on its own. It can be put out there, you can pull it to pieces, you can argue the toss, but experts have come up with a robust model that will, in my view, deliver the right outcome for this nation.


The Hon. Anthony Albanese has been very clear and straightforward on all of this. He saw his task as the transport minister to build infrastructure for the nation. He did not rule in anything and he did not rule out anything. He got the advice, set up the institutions and took action where the evidence was clear and unequivocal to put in place the best thing for the nation. And this government has had to come in and say, 'That doesn't quite suit our priorities.' Our priorities may be different, and I suppose that is fair enough, but you should be able to point to the logic of your argument, the fairness of your argument, the transparency of the argument, the wholeness of it. The first thing this government did was rule out investment in rail. I am sure the founding fathers would have thought that was a bit strange, because I think their first thought was that rail was the way to go. I am no open advocate of—

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:31):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. Building infrastructure for the long term can be truly transformative for an economy. It can deliver productivity gains that create jobs and make us a better country.


Labor has a proud record in this area. After the stagnant years of the Howard government, it was Labor that turned infrastructure investment around. Current levels of government infrastructure investment have not been so significant since the 1980s. From 2008-09 up to the last financial year, the Nation Building Program expended a record $36 billion, with a strong focus on the nation's roads, rail and intermodal terminals. We are now ranked No. 1 in the OECD for infrastructure investment as a proportion of the economy, after languishing in the rankings during the Howard years.


Much of the government spending on economic infrastructure is framed by the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act. This bill relates to the majority of federal infrastructure spending on road, rail and intermodal projects. Under Labor, around $6 billion per year flowed through this act to fund land transport projects. The bill as proposed does not represent ambitious change. It is more a pedestrian rearrangement and updating of certain aspects of the existing act.


Labor support continued funding for the Roads to Recovery program beyond mid-2014, but we expect that this program will be subject to rigorous audits to ensure value for money and indeed that this funding adds to existing roads funding rather than displaces funding already available at the local level.


It is important to note that Labor allocated funding for the Roads to Recovery program for five years in the 2013 budget. This funding totalled $1.75 billion. Despite this fact, the coalition has tried to wage a ham-fisted scare campaign about a threat to Roads to Recovery because Labor wants to make this bill better. Labor fully backed Roads to Recovery, without freezing the indexation of financial assistance grants or otherwise stripping the local governments of much-needed funds.


Senators should be aware that this bill passed the other place on 24 March. A Senate committee reported on this bill at the same time. Despite the claimed urgency to extend the Roads to Recovery program, this bill has not come before the Senate once since then—not at all. Of claimed urgency, it passed the House of Representatives in March but has not turned up till today. It has languished for 155 days. This delay is of the government's own choosing. Frankly, the only threat to Roads to Recovery is the coalition.


Let us not forget about the indexation freeze to financial assistance grants to councils, announced in this year's budget, which will continue every year as far as the eye can see. It will effectively wipe out the entire size of the $350 million per annum of the Roads to Recovery budget. So what Mr Tony Abbott gives with one hand he is taking away with the other. He promises increases in one place but takes more than that away in another place.


Local government is justifiably up in arms about this savage and, not surprisingly, unflagged cut. It was not mentioned before the election. But this cut will impact most on regional and rural councils—the very councils with the highest road maintenance burden. And where are our National Party colleagues? The lapdogs, the doormats—they are at it again. They are going to come into this chamber and once again going to vote to disadvantage regional, rural and country voters. They are a sad and sorry reflection of what was once a great party that actually argued for its own constituents. They talk big back home but then they come into the big red and green chambers and just roll over on their backs and let the Liberal Party tickle their tummies. With cut after cut after cut, whether it is to roads, broadband networks, health, or, more importantly, education for rural kids, they roll over on their backs and let the Liberals tickle their tummies. And what is more distressing is that the government appears even to be successful in tickling the tummies of a few of the crossbench senators. That is what is really disturbing about this debate today.




Senator McKenzie:
  I find the 'tickling the tummies' very disturbing!



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Conroy has the call.




Senator CONROY:
  Then one should object to it when it is done to one! So much for the Nationals and the coalition wanting to help the bush. It is another important regional issue, another example of the National Party rolling over and failing to stand up for the people they say they represent.


Other changes the government is seeking in this bill include renaming the act to take out the phrase 'nation-building', adding new types of eligible projects and funding recipients and repealing some spent acts. Labor is concerned that the renaming of the program could incur additional costs—for instance, in terms of signage. Why do you want to now have a new name and get all these new signs made just out of your own political vanity? 'We want to call it a new name, spend taxpayer's dollars and change all of the signs just so we can have our name on it rather than the original name.' We hope the assurance that the minister has given is that this will not be the case, but we will be watching. If new signs start popping up and taxpayers have their money wasted simply for the government's vanity and ego, we will be holding them to account. 


Who can possibly object to the term 'nation building'? What is the problem? Why do you need to go down such a pathetic, puerile, juvenile path? The coalition, though, I suspect is most likely worried about the term 'nation building', because it has always been associated with Labor. We are proud of that fact. Labor has a long, proud tradition of building this nation and its infrastructure and we will continue to do so into the future. Nation building is what Labor does—a vision in the long-term interest of our country instead of the short-term political interests which we see so much of from this new government.


Labor will be seeking to amend this bill in two important respects. Firstly, Labor will move to strengthen governance around project selection by elevating the role of Infrastructure Australia in advising on project benefits. Prior to approving individual projects under the act, the minister must have regard to the identified priorities and plans set by Infrastructure Australia and any advice it produces relating to the type of project being considered for funding. So, we do not want to give this to the National Party, the party of regional rorts programs, the party that enjoys nothing more than reaching into taxpayers' pockets and spreading largesse in the form of pork-barrel grants to its mates around the country. Further—and I note this with some irony—for projects with a value of $100 million or more, the minister must obtain an evaluation of the project to Infrastructure Australia. 


We have heard an awful lot from this government over the last few months—and it is especially poignant today—why we have got to have cost-benefit analyses. We have just spent millions of dollars paying Minister Turnbull's mates to do a shonky cost-benefit analysis so we can pretend that we have done one when we have already made the decisions. The minister wrote to the company and directed them as to what they were building in a broadband network before the outcome of the cost-benefit analysis. But, goodness me, what good luck we had: the analysis confirmed exactly what the minister told the company to do six months ago. 


I do not even know why the government should be afraid of this particular amendment. Just hire Henry Ergas to do the cost-benefit analysis of these projects, and I am sure you will still get as many National Party pork barrels rolling out of this building as you ever had. Just pay Henry Ergas and you will get the outcome that the minister has predetermined. 


This amendment makes the logical link to Infrastructure Australia's role to provide advice on infrastructure and national priorities and the minister's role to decide how to allocate scarce Commonwealth funds. Who could be opposed to that except a bunch of National Party pork barrellers, which the Liberal Party, when they tickle them in the tummy, agree to all the other atrocities to attack the living standard of ordinary regional and rural Australians but will give the MP a little bit of cash to splash around electorates so that it can pretend it is really representing their interests?


The government have sought to avoid this sensible amendment by proposing and claiming they want to put it in the Infrastructure Australia Act. Oh my goodness! They have actually said that that is where it should go. Make no mistake, Senators: the Land Transport Infrastructure Act is the sole enabling act that governs the terms under which the infrastructure minister can authorise expenditure of Commonwealth funds on roads and rail projects. There is not a more appropriate place to put this amendment. Do not be fooled by the government saying, 'No, no, we'll put it in a different act.' No other act does this—certainly not the Infrastructure Australia Act. That has an entirely different purpose. The Infrastructure Australia Act establishes a body of experts that provide advice to government on infrastructure policy and projects.


IA looks at best practice project procurement. It looks at what the nation lacks and suggests what it needs. It flags future needs. It assesses project value and flags emerging issues in the sector. It has a primarily strategic focus.


However, it is the national land transport act that authorises payment of billions of dollars a year to the states for actual projects such as the East West Link. As some of you would know I live in Victoria and I am very familiar with the East West Link. The importance of this amending legislation and the key reason this government does not want to support it is very simple. Do not listen to what this government has to say. Follow the money, as they say in the classics. The money trail out of this building on East West Link stage 2 is to Victoria.


At Senate estimates, we heard that Infrastructure Australia has classified this project in Victoria as 'not ready to proceed'. It is no surprise to a Victorian who follows this, because this is a project where the Victorian government have decided where they are going to dig a road tunnel. They have decided: 'That spot right there is where we are going to start digging this tunnel.' You might then ask: if a tunnel is being dug, where is it going to come up? Where are you planning on bringing this tunnel up? The truth is that the Victorian government have not made a decision about where they are going to bring the tunnel up. They have started digging a tunnel and they do not know where it is going to come up. 


Yet the federal government, for all their rhetoric of 'must have a cost-benefit analysis, must do this,' is giving $1½ billion, from recollection, to the Victorian government for a road project involving a tunnel, but they have not even decided where that tunnel will come up. So, despite independent advice, the government said it would hand over this $1.5 billion to help out the drowning Victorian government—I think my speech notes say 'struggling', but let me assure you it is not struggling; this Victorian government is drowning. A New South Wales man wrote that!


It is drowning—$1.5 billion for one end of a tunnel will not save the Napthine government. The sum of $1.5 billion is being handed over for a project that Infrastructure Australia says is not ready to proceed. Common sense would say to most Victorians that it is not ready to proceed because they do not know where they are going to bring the tunnel up. But they have now given this money and the work will not even start until Christmas next year. On what basis do you give $1.5 billion for a project which is deemed not ready to proceed and in respect of which they do not know where it will finish, 18 months in advance? There is a very real reason the government will not accept this amendment and there is a very real reason why this chamber should insist on this amendment.


Of the handful of new projects over $100 million in value announced by this government in its budget of largely broken promises, we found out at estimates that no projects—none; not one, not two, but a big round zero—have been properly assessed by Infrastructure Australia prior to funding. That is yet another broken coalition promise. They made a big thing of this before the election; they said: 'For any project over $100 million, we have to have a cost-benefit analysis done by Infrastructure Australia.' So you take their feet, you put them to the fire, and you say, 'Okay—now's the time to implement your policy; let's support this amendment.' Oh, no! As usual, this government treats infrastructure as nothing more than a pork-barrel re-election fund to parade around the country, claiming it is building for the future.


So you can understand how important strengthening governance is for this bill. For projects that are funded, this amendment will require the minister to publish details of the projects and include Infrastructure Australia's prior evaluation.


Infrastructure Australia has not even been able to assess East West Link stage 2 because the Victorian government has not given them more than one page of information on this proposal, described as high-level. It had to be bloody high to get away with just one page for $1.5 billion! That is not high level; that is up-in-space level!


So, overall, this amendment is vital. It strengthens governance—precisely what every major stakeholder in the infrastructure sector has called for in the current Productivity Commission inquiry into public infrastructure. These major stakeholders include the Business Council of Australia— (Time expired)

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2014-08-27,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (09:52):  Mr President, I begin by noting that this is not my first speech—you have got to wait until this afternoon for that!



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Rice.




Senator RICE:
  I rise to speak in support of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, subject to some very important amendments. This legislation in itself is a series of amendments to the existing Commonwealth transport funding legislation. The further amendments which the Greens are proposing will include adding the criteria of transport integration and sustainability into the overall assessment of what projects get funded; legislating for funding to be provided for heavy vehicle safety and productivity measures; and, importantly, where funding for a project exceeds $50 million, requiring scrutiny by Infrastructure Australia and having transparency about the results of that scrutiny.


I am pleased to see that the legislation is neutral about the form of transport infrastructure being funded so that, as well as funding for roads, it makes provision for funding for rail, and for intermodal projects infrastructure, where freight gets transferred from road to rail and vice versa. This is refreshing, given the Prime Minister's irrational objection to federal funding of urban rail projects.


The Greens are also neutral about the form of transport infrastructure that should be funded. We are guided by overriding objectives of providing safe, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable and convenient transport that is accessible to all. What this means is that we support road projects that help provide safe, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable and convenient transport that is accessible to all. We also support passenger and freight rail and other transport projects which meet these criteria.


This legislation wraps up funding programs that I know well from my time in local government: the Roads to Recovery program, which has been talked about so much over the last week; black spot programs; and the nation-building program. These programs have funded essential local road-building and maintenance programs—absolutely critical infrastructure.


I note, however, that this legislation has been considered at the same time as local government is reeling from savage budget cuts to local government road funding. Here we are setting up a framework for land transport funding in the context of the government's $1 billion cut to Commonwealth Financial Assistance Grants. Regional councillors across the country have expressed their loud opposition to these cuts that will result in a decline in service delivery as well as road maintenance throughout the local government sector. The Municipal Association of Victoria president Bill McArthur has said that: 


Commonwealth financial assistance grants are a core revenue stream for local government. The grants provide up to 27 per cent of rural councils' total funding so rural communities will suffer a massive impact. 


The Greens are appalled at these budget cuts. They hit just the kinds of transport infrastructure that need to be supported. 


We should be funding upgrades of unsafe local roads across rural and regional areas; upgrading roads in outer suburbs that are carrying 10 times as much traffic as they were designed for; and upgrading alternative roads or creating bypasses so that heavy vehicles do not have to go straight down the main street of regional cities or rumble down residential streets. We should be funding the repair and proper maintenance of bridges. I remember well when I was a Maribyrnong councillor and mayor talking to my rural colleagues about bridges. In Maribyrnong I think we had five; rural shires had 40 or more and a much smaller rate base to fund them from. 


I road my bike through regional Victoria on my way to Canberra and we travelled along a range of country roads from the most delightful narrow country lanes and regional city streets to a 12-kilometre stint along the Hume. By the end of the trip, I had three distinct road funding programs that I thought were a priority. The one that was particularly relevant to today's debate was sealed shoulders on any country road that carried any significant amount of traffic, particularly truck traffic. This will enable not just safe cycling conditions but easier passing, particularly of slow-moving trucks by other vehicles. 


My last job before standing for election was as a strategic transport planner in the outer Melbourne municipality of Hume. People know me well as an advocate for the public transport that we need, particularly in our outer suburbs, but I was a great roads advocate in Hume too. My focus for the 18 months in that job was the development of the Hume Integrated Land Use and Transport Strategy. The key aims of this strategy were to advocate for the duplication of roads that used to be country roads: Somerton, Sunbury, Mickleham and Craigieburn roads, which are now carrying huge amounts of traffic both passenger and freight traffic. 


Local government cannot afford to duplicate these roads and, with the limited amount of state government funding that is being allocated, VicRoads told us they had a backlog of arterial road duplication projects so that it was likely to be decades before all these roads were duplicated. 


On my home turf, the Greens and I are long-term supporters of the Westgate truck bypass, which would get trucks off residential streets in Yarraville and Footscray. This is a very cost-effective land transport infrastructure investment plus effective freight-rail transport to and from the port connected with the intermodal transport hubs in the outer suburbs would allow up to half of the containerised freight going to and from the Port of Melbourne to go by rail, freeing up lots of room on the overloaded Westgate Freeway. If we invested in decent public transport across the outer suburbs, rail and bus, then we really would be on our way to solving traffic congestion. 


This type of road and public transport investment scores very highly on the criteria of helping to provide safe, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable and convenient transport that is accessible to all. This is where the money needs to be spent, not on massively expensive, polluting freeways and motorways in Melbourne and Sydney, which are not cost-effective, will not solve congestion problems. Spending billions of dollars on these city tollways takes money away from where it needs to be spent: on local roads, country roads, public transport and freight-rail projects. 


The critical thing, which is so blindingly obvious, is that infrastructure costs money. It is an investment so, just as obviously, it is critically important to make sure the money is spent in the most effective way. To make sure this happens, it is essential that there is good process, transparent process and evidence based decision-making. The tighter the money is, the more important it is. If we are serious about efficiency in government, then we have to make sure that we are not splashing money around on massively expensive transport projects that do diddly squat towards creating safe, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable and convenient transport that is accessible to all.


Having strong, evidence based decision making that involves assessing infrastructure projects against these criteria is critical. That is why the Greens have been supporters of Infrastructure Australia, which was set up to do just that—to pull evidence together to enable objective assessment of transport projects rather than transport infrastructure priorities being determined by their location with relation to marginal electorates or by other perceived short-term political benefits. That is why, in this bill, we want to ensure that the funding of any project is considered in the light of Infrastructure Australia's infrastructure priority lists and infrastructure plans, and that any projects over $50 million are scrutinised by Infrastructure Australia. This $50 million benchmark was recommendation 2.3 of the Productivity Commission report into public infrastructure, which was undertaken this year. They stated:


All governments should commit to subjecting all public infrastructure investment proposals above $50 million to rigorous cost-benefit analyses that are publicly released …


This legislation provides a perfect opportunity to put this recommendation into legislation. We also think that, regardless of the size of the project, if Infrastructure Australia have anything relevant to say about a project their views should be taken into account. For the vast majority of small projects, such as roadside rest stops and black spot projects, Infrastructure Australia would not have anything to say, so taking their views into account would be an easy thing to do. But it may be that the black spot being considered is on a road that is a feeder road to a proposed Infrastructure Australia priority project, and knowing this will be very relevant in deciding whether or not that black spot gets funded. 


Rigorous and transparent assessment of transport projects is fundamental good governance and standard practice throughout the world. It is what the community expects of us. This sort of assessment would stop the situation of slashing vital support to regional councils while at the same time committing $3½ billion to the WestConnex private tollway in Sydney and $3 billion for the East West Link in Melbourne. These are massively polluting tollway projects that will not improve congestion but will boost the profits of private developers. In both cases the business cases have not been released despite requests through the Senate and from the community. There has been no transparency, no full cost-benefit analysis, despite Tony Abbott promising before the election that all projects worth more than $100 million would receive this scrutiny.


In contrast to the $6½ billion promised for these massively expensive, massively polluting tollway projects, the government has committed less than a third of that to the Roads to Recovery program in the 2014 budget. When it comes to infrastructure and road spending, this government is all rhetoric. It is the road projects, freight projects and public transport projects covered by this legislation that should be getting priority and funding, instead of billions being provided to the private sector for the WestConnex and East West Link tollways.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-08-27,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:03):  I am pleased to support the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. The bill does a number of things, the first of which is that it renames the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009. It gives it the more appropriate name of the National Land Transport Act 2014, thereby removing the link between the name of the act and the name of the land transport infrastructure funding program. This means that the act will not need to be amended if the name of the land transport infrastructure funding program changes. It is the most sensible name for the act and it keeps it above politics. It will also streamline and enhance the operation of the act to benefit states and territories.


By and large, this act is important because it enables a continuation of the wonderful Roads to Recovery program after 30 June 2014. I want to spend little time on this, because, if I may proudly say, I was the minister who introduced into this chamber the original act that provided for Roads to Recovery. It is a wonderful program that gives federal money to local governments to allow them to do road work that otherwise would not be possible. There has been some hesitation in recent years about the constitutionality of funding going directly from the Commonwealth to local governments, but clearly that is addressed by this new bill. Local authorities right around Australia, particularly in rural and regional Australia, have a major influence on which roads are constructed; they know what local people need and they are the best equipped to plan and then build roads in their local communities.


This Roads to Recovery program introduced by the Howard government gave local authorities that additional funding that they had sadly lacked prior to that time and enabled them to build thousands and thousands of kilometres of roads that were absolutely necessary, particularly in rural and regional Australia. I remember a few years after the program was introduced that for much of regional Queensland there was no funding at all for state roads from the then Labor state government. With the approval of the federal government, councils were putting their Roads to Recovery money towards states roads to enable those linkages between small country towns and bigger ones; and it was well received.


As a Queensland senator, Mr Deputy President, you will excuse me if I talk only about Queensland. I must say that both the current federal government and the current Queensland government—Campbell Newman's Liberal-National Party government—are doing such wonderful work on road improvements that I get a bit annoyed with them, because, not matter where you drive in Queensland these days, you will find road works in progress. That, of course, means lanes cut off or detours or speed restrictions, and, for someone who travels the roads as widely as I do, that does become a source of annoyance. But I console myself by understanding these roadworks will benefit all Queenslanders and all Australians in the years ahead.


A great deal of work is being done on the Bruce Highway, and I give full credit to a number of federal and state politicians who have been campaigning for its upgrade for many years: George Christensen, Ewen Jones and Warren Entsch have done a wonderful job in advocating for money for that work. I live in a place called Ayr and my office is in Townsville about 100 kilometres to the north and I drive to work on the occasions I am in the North. I am delighted to see work on the southern approaches to Townsville that were promised by Labor for years—each budget we would have an announcement from Labor that they were going to fix the Van Tassel Street intersection to include a bypass. They kept talking about it a year after year but, as was typical with the Labor government, it never happened—indeed, I think in the last budget they actually withdrew it. That work is now happening and it will provide a four-lane entrance from the south into the burgeoning city of Townsville; it will certainly help anyone using that road, including in a selfish way myself.


All the way throughout Queensland, or all along the Bruce Highway, roadworks are occurring. All credit goes to Campbell Newman and his government for that road work and to the federal government for the funding they have provided to the Queensland government for that road work to be done. It is not just the Bruce Highway or the main highways. During the last few months, I have driven in many of the back roads, the secondary roads of Queensland, and have seen that work is happening in all of them. Congratulations to Warren Truss, Campbell Newman and all those responsible for the enormous amount of road work that is happening. 


As well as dealing with the Roads to Recovery program—I want to come back to that briefly—this bill will also unify the schemes for funding National Land Transport Network projects in part 3 of the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act and the off-network projects in part 6 of that act. Furthermore, the bill will also enlarge the scope of power to fund research, investigations, studies and analysis, first by expanding the types of organisations that can be funded to include partnerships and non-corporate Commonwealth entities in certain circumstances, and second by allowing funding for the additional purpose of researching and investigating projects funded or submitted for consideration for funding under the act. The bill also repeals three spent pieces of legislation in this general field. It is again part of the coalition government's program to tidy up the books, so to speak, to reduce the red tape and get rid of legislation that is no longer relevant. 


The Labor Party in this bill have proposed eight pages of amendments to provide for a separate section on this program. It is a program that is already provided for in legislation. So the Labor Party are—or at least they were last time we were talking about this; I am hopeful that perhaps they have had a rethink about this—proposing these amendments to provide a separate section in this bill for something that has already been dealt with in the other legislation. We agree that it is a very important program to which the Labor Party were averting. In fact we have committed more funding to that program than the current opposition did when it was in government. But the amendments proposed by Labor simply duplicate provisions in the existing legislation. 


When Mr Albanese was the minister, he established the program, but to ensure the program could receive funding under the legislation, all Mr Albanese needed to do was to amend the definition of a road in this act, which is exactly what he did. In 2008 he introduced the AusLink (National Land Transport) Amendment Bill to add to the definition of road in section 4 of the act. He knew then that it was not necessary to include it in a full separate section. He and his party should understand that it was not necessary then, back in 2008, and neither is it necessary now. 


The coalition government is committed to a number of other programs that are not provided separate status in the legislation—that is, the Labor Party want to particularly go to one area, but there are other programs that are not provided with separate pieces of legislation and they do not need to be. If the heavy vehicle program were to be included then, for consistency, those programs should also be included, potentially adding up to 40 pages of unnecessary duplication to this very simple bill.


We are, as I mentioned, committed to reducing red tape, not creating it, and the new programs that we are talking about include the Bridges Renewal Program—a wonderful program that will help many communities get the bridges they need and repair some pretty rickety, narrow bridges that are a safety concern at present. Again, all credit to the minister, Mr Truss, for the introduction of that new Bridges Renewal Program. There are also the managed motorways program, another regional roads program and the national highway program. None of these are specifically referred to in legislation, but the Labor Party, for some reason, wanted one element of those programs to be the subject of some eight additional pages of legislation. So I would hope that the Labor Party have had a rethink about that. I hope that the Greens and the other crossbench senators understand that that is not necessary. It is just useless padding, and it does complicate what is a very simple bill, the main purpose of which is to ensure that the Roads to Recovery program continues beyond 30 June 2014.


Councils will be anxiously watching this debate and this bill. As I understand it, payments were to cease because the Labor Party's program concluded on 30 June 2014. There has not been any tangible impact of the failure to pass this bill to date, but if it is not passed immediately it will throw into jeopardy the payments that continue to go to local councils or local government authorities for the Roads to Recovery program.


Again, I repeat that this is a program initiated by the Howard government, and I say to any senator: if you are ever visiting a local authority anywhere in Australia and you are at a loss to know what to talk about, just mention Roads to Recovery and you will get an instant response from all councillors, CEOs and council staff on just what a wonderful program it has been. It has really saved the day for many communities who were doing it tough and could not, through their rate base or financial assistance grants funding, gather together the money to do these essential road projects, and this Roads to Recovery program gave them that opportunity and that ability to properly service their communities. That has been great for those communities, great for Australians and, indeed, great for the competitiveness and competency of Australia as a nation. The work on those local roads has really built our productivity and helped people, and it deserves support.


I urge all senators to support this bill in its original form. It is a simple bill. It is there to extend the Roads to Recovery program. I would guess that every senator in this chamber is keen to see that program continue to be funded. Let us get on and do that. If you want to have lots of talk about other programs, then let us do it in the appropriate red legislation at some other time, but it is certainly not necessary now. Let us keep the bill simple. Let us get the money flowing and let councils know that they have the certainty of that continued funding under the Roads to Recovery program.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:19):  I, too, rise to speak on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. For those opposite, spending money on infrastructure is not a means to improving productivity, and it does not appear to be a means to improving the whole economy for the benefit of all Australians. It does, however, appear to be a means through which they can pork barrel their own marginal electorates, as they did through the rorted Howard era Regional Partnerships Program.


The Labor Party is a party that believes in infrastructure. It is a party that knows that developing infrastructure will improve outcomes for all Australians. Therefore, it needs to be developed according to need. Only the Labor Party understands that building infrastructure requires vision and an understanding that the needs of the entire Australian community need to be served, not just a marginal electorate that those opposite, as I said, would like to pork barrel in.


It is the Labor Party that realises that modern, efficient, well-placed infrastructure built in accordance with expert advice is what will drive Australia's prosperity into the future. And it is the Labor Party that understands that infrastructure includes ports, freight rail, light rail, airports, communication infrastructure, bridges and much more—not just more and more roads. That is why the former Labor government oversaw a radical transformation in the way that the Commonwealth approaches infrastructure.


 Compared to the last full year of the former Howard government, 2006-07, annual infrastructure spending in real terms was up 59 per cent by 2011-12. Infrastructure spending across the economy rose to record levels. In terms of spending on infrastructure as a proportion of GDP Australia rose from 20th to first in 2012 in the OECD.


We created Infrastructure Australia to research and rank proposed infrastructure projects based on their potential to add to economic productivity.    We rebuilt or upgraded 7,500 kilometres of road and 4,000 kilometres of railway lines. We delivered the National Ports Strategy and the National Freight Strategy.


Total annual private and public investment in our nation's roads, ports, railways, energy generators, water supply facilities and telecommunication networks hit a record $58.5 billion in 2011-12, equivalent to four per cent of GDP, the biggest share of national income since 1986-87. 


We lifted funding for infrastructure from $132 per Australian to $225. Total public and private sector infrastructure spending over federal Labor's first five years in office was almost $250 billion—almost 70 per cent greater in real terms than the $150 billion spent during the last five years of the former Howard government. As the figures I just quoted show, it is Labor that believes in infrastructure.


I spoke in this place earlier this year about the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill. Labor created Infrastructure Australia to research Australia's future infrastructure needs and impartially assess projects. Unfortunately, the version of the Infrastructure Australia bill that was passed in the House sought to destroy Infrastructure Australia's ability to plan for the future, assess the value of proposed projects, publish information without the minister's consent and would have even prevented Infrastructure Australia from doing research on whole areas of infrastructure needs like public transport or how to protect infrastructure from the effects of climate change.


In short, those opposite wanted to prevent Infrastructure from assessing their pork-barrelling projects or to provide frank and fearless advice on the country's future infrastructure needs. I do not believe that those opposite are serious about infrastructure at all. If they were, they would have given this bill a higher priority in this place.


This bill continues the funding for the Roads to Recovery program, which expired on 30 June, 2014. The program is made ongoing, indefinitely, rather than having a set expiry date in the act.


 Senator Macdonald mentioned the need to pass this legislation today. If the government were able to manage the proceedings of the chamber properly, they could have had the legislation passed before the funding expired.


Unfortunately, though, I do not think those opposite really have a clue about how to act when in government and that is pretty obvious from the many faux pas we have evidenced in the media since the change of government. I will not digress, because I would take up all my time just discussing those faux pas.


Other changes in this bill see the distinction between national projects, network and off-network projects eliminated and all are retitled as 'investment projects'. Transport research funding criteria are widened to include research into funded projects.


This bill also makes partnerships and non-corporate Commonwealth entities eligible to apply for research funding. The bill would also repeal the following three spent Land Transport Infrastructure Acts: the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988, which has been superseded; the Roads to Recovery Act 2000, which has no outstanding claims against it; and the Railway Standardization (New South Wales and Victoria) Agreement Act 1958. Loans under this act were repaid in June 2013 and this act therefore has no further effect.


The opposition has no issue with removing from the statute books spent and redundant legislation. We do, however, have issues with pork barrelling. We know that the current government likes to take credit for things that it has not done. We can see that from the minister's second reading speech in the other place. In that speech the minister mentioned almost a dozen major projects that were announced and funded by the federal Labor government, including: $6.7 billion to upgrade the Bruce Highway; $5.6 billion to finish the duplication of the Pacific Highway; $1 billion to continue the Gateway Motorway North upgrade in Brisbane; $686 million to finish the Gateway WA Project in Perth; $615 million to build the Swan Valley Bypass on the Perth to Darwin Highway; $500 million for the upgrade of South Road in Adelaide; $405 million for the F3 to M2 Link project in Sydney. One that is particularly important to me is the $400 million to continue the Midland Highway upgrade in Tasmania; Labor in fact committed $500 million and so the current government thinks it can do it for $100 million less. We also allocated $300 million to finalise plans, engineering design and environmental assessments for the Melbourne to Brisbane Inland Rail project and we also allocated $1.8 billion to the WestConnex project in Sydney, subject to conditions including a proper business case.


The current government has a nasty history of taking credit for the work of others, and the Australian people are waking up to the government's insincerity and their deceit. In Tasmania, they re-announced our entire nation-building package, albeit belatedly, including the same funding for the freight rail revitalisation, for the Brooker Highway and for the Huon Highway. There is only one difference: that is the Midland Highway, for which they have announced a $100 million cut. It is unbelievable that the Liberal senators from Tasmania can stand up and say that they care about infrastructure for Tasmania, when they have ripped $100 million from the Midlands Highway upgrade. They need to explain to the people of Tasmania why they did not fight harder for that funding, as does the member for Lyons in the other place. They need to explain why they have not fought harder for funding for Tasmania.


Labor will be looking to move amendments to this bill. We realise the importance that infrastructure projects be assessed to see whether they meet the nation's needs—not the political needs of the current government. The opposition's first amendment is to improve governance arrangements around project selection. Many stakeholders in the infrastructure debate have called for greater transparency and accountability over how the Commonwealth chooses to spend its infrastructure funds. The Australian people deserve transparency in the expenditure of between $3 and $6 billion per annum—much of that spending is channelled via this act.


When this bill faced the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, Labor senators had additional comments and flagged amendments. The opposition's amendments would see that, prior to approving individual projects under the act, the minister must have regard to the identified priorities and plans set by Infrastructure Australia and any advice it produces relating to the type of project being considered for funding. Further, for projects with a value of $100 million or more, the minister must obtain an evaluation of the project from Infrastructure Australia. This evaluation will include a cost-benefit analysis from Infrastructure Australia and an Infrastructure Australia view on the priority of the project against its identified national priorities. For projects that are funded, the minister will be required to publish details of the project and include Infrastructure Australia's evaluation and cost-benefit outcome. Overall, this strengthened governance is precisely what all major stakeholders in the infrastructure sector have been calling for in the current Productivity Commission inquiry into public infrastructure, and in the recent Senate inquiry into Infrastructure Australia. Allowing Infrastructure Australia to assess these projects will help to prevent the pork-barrelling we have seen under previous Liberal-National governments. This means that, if they do choose to approve projects that are unworthy, the Australian people will be able to see where and what the government is funding for their own political gain. 


The opposition's second amendment is to formalise the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity program as a program under the act. The Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity program is an Australian initiative established under the act in 2009 to improve safety and productivity outcomes of heavy vehicle operations across Australia. This program is the first dedicated Commonwealth program of its kind and aims to reduce driver fatigue. Unfortunately, too many Australian truck drivers die on Australian roads. The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development told the Senate inquiry into this bill that:


… during the 12 months to September 2011, 230 people died from 204 fatal crashes involving heavy vehicles or buses and there is significant evidence linking such accidents with fatigue.


This program funded rest stops along highways to provide more options for drivers to take a break. The first two rounds of the HVSPP provided $70 million in the period 2008-09 to 2011-12. In the 2012 and 2013 budgets, Labor provided a further $250 million to extend the program. This additional funding in 2013-14 brought total spending on the program to $320 million and added a further 58 projects to the 236 projects already delivered, including over 140 new or upgraded rest areas and 46 new or upgraded parking and decoupling bays.


Round 3 projects included funding the states and territories in six categories: rest area projects which improve the provision of heavy vehicle rest areas on key interstate routes; parking and decoupling bay projects which provide heavy vehicle parking and decoupling areas and facilities in outer urban and regional areas; technology trial projects which include trial technologies to improve heavy vehicle safety and/or productivity; road enhancement projects which enhance the capacity and/or safety of roads, including bridges, to allow access by high productivity vehicles to more of the road network; demonstration projects which facilitate innovation to improve heavy vehicle safety and productivity projects; and livestock transport industry projects which improve heavy vehicle safety and productivity for specific livestock transport operations. I urge those opposite and the crossbench members to pass these amendments to make roads safer for truck drivers and for the general public.


While I am summing up my contribution to this debate, I would like to say that one of the pettiest aspects of this bill is that it renames the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act to remove the words 'Nation Building'. Those opposite are so concerned about the positive legacy of the Labor government in infrastructure that they want to rename the act to wipe away Labor's connection with it. How petty can they be? The shadow minister, Mr Albanese, has sought assurances in writing from the new minister that there will be no additional cost to taxpayers because of this change of name and the minister has given that assurance. It will be interesting to see how they deal with changing all the letterheads, all the signs and everything else at no extra cost. All we can hope is that they will not choose to put the signs with the new program name in Liberal-National Party colours, as they did with the AusLink program. I really hope they will not stoop to such a petty, disgusting waste of taxpayers resources—again—to try to make themselves look good. 


Labor has shown time and time again that we are the party of infrastructure. I have listed the various projects we undertook and funded. I urge the Senate to pass the opposition's amendments to this bill.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-08-27,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (10:34):  I thank Senator Bilyk and others for their contributions. I was taken by the latter part of Senator Bilyk's contribution, when she said that we were trying to take away the 'positive legacy'—I think those were her words—of the former Labor government in infrastructure. I think we are seeing that legacy being played out in today's front-page stories about the NBN and the way Labor handled that infrastructure project. Infrastructure development under the former government was a joke. It was done on the back of a beer coaster on VIP flights, it was done without cost-benefit analysis and it cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars extra—because the former Labor government simply did not do the work. 


We take a very different approach to infrastructure and the bill we are debating today is part of that. The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is part of our plan to fix the mess we have inherited and to deliver on the things we said we would deliver on. We said we would stop the boats, we said we would get rid of unnecessary and toxic taxes like the carbon tax, we said we would get the budget under control and we said we would build the roads of the 21st century—and that is what this bill is about. It is about rolling that out. It is extraordinary that the Labor Party are doing all they can to frustrate a roads agenda, an agenda of building infrastructure for the 21st century. It is extraordinary that a party that designed the NBN on the back of a beer coaster, costing taxpayers tens of billions of dollars extra, now seeks to frustrate a government seeking to deliver infrastructure properly. That is what this is about.


Infrastructure is key to Australia's competitiveness. Our future depends on it. Better infrastructure underpins vital services, such as transport and logistics. Inefficient infrastructure networks are one of the key reasons Australia's productivity has declined. Inefficient infrastructure networks are also a key driver of the cost-of-living pressures affecting Australians. The government is committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century and the changes in the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill will help us to achieve this goal. Our ability to deliver more appropriate, efficient and effective infrastructure will significantly influence Australia's future growth and maximise our competitiveness. 


The government is working with state and territory governments to deliver nationally significant infrastructure projects to maximise our productivity and improve living standards for all Australians. We are also working, where possible, in partnership with the private sector to maximise private capital investment in infrastructure projects. This collaboration between the Australian government, the states and territories and the private sector will enable the efficient and successful delivery of the infrastructure that Australia expects, that industry needs and that our communities deserve.


This bill, which amends the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009, is necessary to facilitate our ambitious land transport infrastructure agenda. We are committed to delivering the infrastructure of the 21st century. This bill continues the vitally important $2.1 billion Roads to Recovery program, which funds and supports local governments to carry out upgrades and maintenance on local roads. 


We are committed to the Roads to Recovery program, which was established under the Howard government. It is through our commitment that we have allocated $2.1 billion over the next five years of the program, including a doubling of funding next financial year to every local government in Australia. The purpose of the additional funding to the program is to assist in addressing the backlog of local road maintenance across the country. Chief Executive of the New South Wales Livestock and Bulk Carriers Association, Andrew Higginson, was quoted by the ABC as stating that the delay in providing certainty about this funding could have significant flow-on effects for businesses. He said:


It makes it impossible for people to actually go out and build the roads we want, even when the money is allocated.


You might have a local industry who could benefit greatly from an improved road and if that fund is not flowing through the local council, it could put that industry, or that particular producer, out of business.


A month delay, two month delay—the compounding effects of that can be disastrous for any industry.


The amendments proposed by Labor and the Greens, which the government deems unacceptable, include wanting to enshrine the name of the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program in the act. These projects are already funded under the act and budgeted for, and including a new separate part is nothing more than unnecessary duplication. Labor and the Greens also want to further complicate things by inappropriately creating an additional role for Infrastructure Australia in this bill. This act has nothing to do with the administrative arrangements of Infrastructure Australia, and so this amendment makes no sense whatsoever.


The coalition government is committed to reducing red tape, as has been evidenced by our red tape repeal days, as well as our commitment to cut $1 billion in red tape every year. This bill works to assist our deregulation agenda by repealing three spent land transport infrastructure acts. The government understands just how important road safety is for all Australians and how important this funding is to local road improvement programs and to our economy. Both the Labor Party and the Greens refused to support this bill in the other place, but they were unable to point to a single aspect of the bill that was unacceptable. This is nothing more than deliberate obstructionism.


The primary intent of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is to continue vital funding to programs such as the Roads to Recovery program—something that the former minister for infrastructure, Mr Albanese, failed to provide for when he was the minister. The expiration date was left by Labor at 30 June 2014, leaving local councils with no certainty whatsoever. The Labor Party and the Greens need to stop playing political games and support the passage of this very simple legislation. If Labor and the Greens were serious about delivering for councils and reducing the amount of red tape interference, they would simply pass this bill unamended.


As the chair of the ACT Consultative Panel for the Black Spot Programme, I am very keen to see this bill pass as it also continues funding to this vitally important program. The Black Spot Program provides funding to address road sites that are high-risk areas for serious crashes. It is a key part of the commitment to reduce crashes on Australian roads, save lives and reduce road trauma by funding measures such as traffic signals, roundabouts and increased signage at dangerous locations to reduce the risk of crashes. These programs are incredibly effective, saving the community many times the cost of the relatively minor road improvements that are implemented. An evaluation by the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics recently estimated that the program reduces casualty crashes at treated sites by 30 per cent.


I was pleased last month to be able to announce that the ACT would receive $1.1 million to upgrade and fix a number of dangerous black spots in our community. Here in the ACT additional funding of $452,000 has been made to install traffic signals at Jerrabomberra Avenue, Captain Cook Crescent and Sturt Avenue in order to fix a dangerous intersection, address a proven history of crashes and prevent the loss of life. Here in the ACT we are taking pre-emptive action through the Black Spot Program to upgrade signage at the intersection of Coulter Drive and John Cleland Crescent in Florey. We are installing animal fencing, additional reflectors and an upgrade to signage on the Tuggeranong Parkway, from Lady Denman Drive to Cotter Road Ramp East. And we are installing a high-angle approach for left-hand turns out of Well Station Road, as well as the upgrade of existing traffic signals at the intersection of Gungahlin Drive and Well Station Road in Mitchell. All of these measures are being put in place through the Black Spot Program to reduce crashes, to prevent road trauma, to save lives and to improve road safety. 


I was pleased to see that the 2014 budget allocated an additional $1.6 million to the ACT for the Black Spot Program. I will continue to engage widely with the ACT community to investigate potential locations that could be fixed under the Black Spot Program in order to maximise its effectiveness and potential here in my community. Nationally, the government's commitment also provides an additional $200 million over two years for this program. This totals a record $500 million to the Black Spot Program allocated by the coalition in the 2014 budget.


Importantly—and this has been touched on by Senator Bilyk—this bill also renames the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 to the National Land Transport Act 2014, removing the link between the name of the act and the name of the land transport infrastructure funding program. We should not be politicising the name of the Infrastructure Investment Programme from within the act. This change keeps the name of the act above politics. It also means that we will not need to amend the act should the name of the land transport infrastructure funding program change.


The bill also aims to streamline and enhance the operation of the act, which will directly benefit the states and territories and the Commonwealth. A new requirement is being implemented that the states and territories will notify the minister as soon as possible after the sale or disposal of land that was acquired using Australian government funding. By doing so, we will ensure a timely response to land sales and disposals from both the states and the territories and the Australian government. This will mean that the proceeds of the sale or disposal can then be allocated to new infrastructure projects. 


This bill also introduces a new type of project that can receive funding. Under the bill, projects that involve research, investigations, studies or analysis of investment or black spot projects, previously funded Off-Network Projects and works funded under the Roads to Recovery program will be eligible for funding. Additionally, to help inform advice to government, this funding will also be able to be used for analysis of projects submitted for consideration for funding as investment or black spot projects.


Lastly, the bill adds two types of eligible funding recipients to the act. Partnerships have been added as eligible for funding, the purpose of which is to simplify funding arrangements for firms without a body corporate structure. Non-corporate Commonwealth entities whose functions include research relating to land transport research operations will also now be able to receive funding under these changes.


The bill ensures that local governments get their $2.1 billion in Roads to Recovery funding, providing certainty into the future. It ensures that we remain consistent with our red-tape reduction agenda and it also works to support a number of other measures, such as the Black Spot Program. 


Labor and the Greens need to do the right thing by their electorates and their communities and pass this bill. As a government we will continue to stand up for local communities, we will continue to build the infrastructure of the 21st century and we will continue to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster. I strongly support the passage of this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,2
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-08-27,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (10:45):  I am absolutely delighted to support this bill, the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, and I urge all senators to agree to the passage of the bill without amendment and without further delay. It would have come into this chamber in the last sitting fortnight of the previous session of parliament had there not been a very strong indication that it was not going to pass at that time. I hope, over the last five weeks, there was the opportunity for reflection by senators on all sides and for speaking to their constituents, particularly those in rural and regional areas of Australia. They, like me, would have been lobbied very strongly by local governments around Australia to pass this bill without delay.


As has been said previously, the actual funding for the Roads to Recovery program notionally expired on 30 June 2014, so at the moment there is a cloud and some uncertainty over the continuation of that program. I will not go to discussions of the changing of the name, because it was canvassed earlier in this place. What I do want to do is affirm the commitment of our Prime Minister, Mr Abbott; he has made the very strong statement that he wants to be known as 'the infrastructure Prime Minister'. All of those strategies and policies are being put into place to give effect to that commitment. The last thing this place needs and the last thing the Australian community, and road users in particular, need is to see that frustrated and thwarted if it is being done just for cheap, political purposes. This issue is far too important to be tied up in that sort of nonsense.


Through the Infrastructure Investment Program, over the coming six-year period the government is committing some $35½ billion to road and rail projects across Australia. Others have spelt them out. I want to focus on two of them—that is, the $686 million to finish the Gateway WA project around Perth Airport and the $615 million committed to build the Swan Valley bypass on the Perth to Darwin highway. 


In recent days I have travelled up to Darwin and back to Perth; out to the airport again to travel to Esperance and then back to Perth; and then again within a few hours back to the airport to travel to Canberra. On each of those occasions I have had the opportunity to see the wonderful work that is being undertaken in the development of the Gateway WA project. It also emphasises, as we all know, that Western Australia is the powerhouse of the Australian economy. We know that the use of airports and the frequency of air travel underpin and speak to the enormous activity being undertaken.


Whilst it certainly is frustrating the movement of traffic, I wish to place on the record the tremendous accord that I have with, and my congratulations to, those responsible for giving effect to these engineering projects. How they are able to coordinate continually the movement of road traffic, vehicular traffic and heavy transport traffic to those air hubs and logistics hubs around our airports whilst at the same time undertaking this massive work, I think, deserves enormous credit. Those who have been in Perth recently may have travelled on the new, upgraded Great Eastern Highway into the city. Again, whilst it inconvenienced us, the fact that they were able to get on and get that work done and still allow those roads to remain open was tremendous. So I congratulate the government on its continuing efforts. I understand from Comcare drivers—in whose currency of knowledge I have enormous faith—that it will be towards the end of 2015 that we will see that finished.


The second project to which I referred is the Swan Valley bypass on the Perth to Darwin highway. Of course, there is no longer coastal shipping activity from Fremantle or Cockburn Sound going north for a lot of general cargo. There is, naturally, for completion of the major offshore gas projects at Gorgon and Wheatstone; but, unfortunately, coastal trade is no longer available for general cargo so it all now goes on roads. We in WA and those who have visited have all been grossly inconvenienced by the movement of enormously heavy vehicles carrying the components they do that will continue to drive the economy of Australia by supporting projects to the north and up to Darwin. It speaks volumes about the need for the Swan Valley bypass and, indeed, we just cannot get that work completed too quickly.


I turn to Roads to Recovery. Nobody should underestimate the value of this project, commenced under the Howard government and continued in the years of the Rudd and Gillard governments. What we are trying to do here—this is central to this bill that is before us today—is to guarantee continued funding to local governments so they can get on with their work. My colleagues earlier—perhaps Senator Rice, also Senator MacDonald and I think Senator Bilyk—referred to the value that local governments place on the Roads to Recovery funding. More to the point, it is locked in years in advance. By committing $2.1 billion over five years, the government has doubled funding for next financial year to every council in Australia. I think that is a recognition by the government of the value of this funding. 


Why is this funding arrangement so valuable? Because every council in Australia will tell you that when Commonwealth funding is assured they can then add their own locally sourced funds—and state-sourced funds, if they have them. Every dollar is driven further, is utilised better, in terms of the effectiveness and the efficiency of the projects being funded. For example, if they are undertaking roadworks they can ensure that, by mobilising and not having to demobilise and start again, they can lay more tar and improve roads and shoulders, and they can provide the quality of roads that the community expects. We know, because of geographic circumstances, weather situations and pressure of use of roads, there are different challenges in different areas of Australia. There is no better project or funding in the view of local governments around Australia, supported by the federal government of the day, than the Roads to Recovery program. But it is at risk at the moment. I absolutely implore senators who have any interest—and I know we all do—in the future of our road networks to pass this bill without delay. 


Mention has been made of black spot funding, and it is my understanding that the bill introduces a new type of project that can receive funding under part 4 of the act—Transport Development and Innovation Projects. These are projects, as the Deputy Prime Minister has said, that involve research, investigations, studies or analyses of investment relating to and including black spot projects—and how successful has the black spot concept been around Australia. So it will then be the case that those sorts of projects previously funded off network, funded under the Roads to Recovery program, will be eligible for part 4 funding. This amendment will enhance the management of projects and the Infrastructure Investment Program. Again, that is what we want to see in this country—we want to see maximum value for taxpayers' money in developing projects of value to the Australian community.


I cannot emphasise enough that we in this place and the media all too often make the comment that it is the government's money. Governments of themselves have no money. The money that they accumulate is accrued from taxpayers, company profits and interest on investments. Governments do not have money. Therefore it is incumbent on us as legislators to ensure that money is spent as wisely and as prudently and as frugally as it can be for the purposes for which it is allocated. We need to honour our commitment to Australian taxpayers—whether they pay through direct income taxes, taxes through GST, company profits or however else they are sourced—that we will spend their money as effectively as we possibly can.


As an aside, those young people looking down would have no idea that one of the effects of this bill will be the repeal of the Railway Standardisation (New South Wales and Victoria) Agreement Act 1958. I suspect that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, may not have been around when that was implemented. As we all know, we had the unusual circumstance up and down the east coast of Australia that the gauge of the railways in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria were all different. I recall one of the gauges being 5' 3"", the standard gauge is 4' 8½"" and the narrow gauge is 3'6"". How ridiculous must it have been for somebody to board the 5' 3"" gauge train in Brisbane, get as far as the border, unload themselves, their goods, their family and whatever else and get onto the 4' 8½"", and then travel through New South Wales on the standard gauge only to repeat the whole exercise in Albury-Wodonga. In our own state of Western Australia, we had, and still do in many instances, the narrow gauge—the 3' 6"". This bill repeals that particular agreement act of 1958, because the last loan repayments to the federal government were received in June 2013. So the loan has been repaid, and there is no longer any need for that element of legislation to be in place.


I understand from Senator Bilyk's contribution and that of Senator Rice that there will be amendments moved. The first one relates to the concept of a role for Infrastructure Australia in assessment. This is not what this bill is about. The issue associated with Infrastructure Australia casting its slide rule over projects and auditing them for the purposes of ascertaining effectiveness and allocating priority et cetera is worthy but it is not the subject of this bill. There is no case for holding up passage of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill because of an element that is totally and utterly irrelevant. So let us not to be confused about that element: it is not before the chamber, and it is not part of this exercise. It simply adds to the confusion and delays the inevitable—we hope—passage of this bill. The claim has been made that Labor and the Greens want to complicate the arrangements and inappropriately create an additional role for Infrastructure Australia in this bill when, as I have just said, the act has nothing to do with the administrative arrangements. It makes no sense. It adds to red tape. It is relevant in other legislation but not relevant in this legislation, and it therefore should be dealt with in other fora—and not dealt with in this one.


Other amendments to this particular legislation have been proposed in the other place by the honourable Anthony Albanese—amendments which, again, the government does not accept—to enshrine the name of the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program into the act. Again, these matters are dealt with in different jurisdictions and therefore it is not necessary for them to be introduced into this bill.


In my concluding comments, I say this: the central component of Roads to Recovery is critical to all Australians. For those involved in local government, it underpins their roads programs—their roads maintenance and roads development programs. And—as I am sure my two colleagues, Senator Fawcett and Senator Johnston, would agree, both coming from states with large road networks—those programs are absolutely critical to ongoing maintenance, and to the ongoing efficiency and effectiveness of the overall spend on roads in those local governments. So I urge all senators in this place to put to one side those sorts of activities that may have been amusing or distracting but may, in fact, have taken us away from the essential elements of this bill. It is simple: it requires passage. I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that every local government around this country is watching and waiting, and hoping that common sense prevails and that the bill is passed.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Thank you, Senator Back.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,2
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (11:02):  I also rise to speak on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. I say to Senator Back, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, not only are the Labor Party amendments needed but also that they are critical to ensuring that we get the best spend for infrastructure in Australia—through those amendments. Because, simply, this government cannot be trusted to spend the money where it is actually needed, and I will talk about that further through my contribution.


For those following this debate, it might seem hard to understand what, exactly, we are debating. In the other place, the minister claimed that this bill was about 'delivering the government's ambitious land transport infrastructure agenda'. This statement just highlights this government's complete lack of vision when it comes to investing in crucial nation-building infrastructure. This bill seeks to change the name of the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 to the Land Transport Act 2014, and it also eliminates some out-of-date provisions in the existing legislation. I would not say that this constitutes 'delivering', nor that it can be considered 'ambitious'. The other thing that this bill seeks to do is extend funding for the Roads to Recovery program. This formalises the Labor government's decision in the 2013 budget to continue the existing Roads to Recovery program beyond 30 June of this year—that is a $350 million program which expired on June 30 because of this government's incompetence and inability to manage their own legislative agenda.


Labor will be seeking to make two amendments to this bill. The first Labor amendment will require consultation with Infrastructure Australia before projects are approved, and will provide greater transparency around the decision-making. There has been much debate in this place on the need for transparency in relation to infrastructure spending. Many stakeholders in the infrastructure debate have called for greater transparency and accountability around decisions on how the Commonwealth government spends its infrastructure funds. In response to the views of stakeholders, Labor's first amendment requires the minister to seek the views of the government's infrastructure expert adviser, Infrastructure Australia, before approving funds for a project. Labor's amendment will also require a full evaluation by Infrastructure Australia of any project above $100 million in value. Finally, this amendment would require that, in approving funds for a project, the minister must make public not only Infrastructure Australia's findings on the priority of the project but also its evaluation of cost-benefit. Those opposite should be supportive of the Labor amendments, given that only four days before the election Mr Abbott said that no infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million would be funded without a published cost-benefit analysis. We already know that that commitment has been broken, along with a lot of other commitments and promises that have been broken by this government.


The second Labor amendment would formalise the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program as a program under the act. The Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program is an initiative taken under the former Labor government. The program targets infrastructure around heavy vehicle driver fatigue, and funds rest stops along highways to provide more options for drivers to take a break. In its current form, this bill—like all of this government's infrastructure policy—is just spin. The change of the name, with the removal of the term 'nation-building' from the statute books, seems little more than an attempt to remove any hint of the former Labor government from the infrastructure debate; any hint of the work that the former Labor government did on infrastructure; and any hint of the investment that the former Labor government made into nation-building infrastructure for Australia.


I can understand why those opposite might seek to do that. For a government with no real vision for infrastructure investment, the Labor Party's record on investment would be intimidating. I have had a number of representations from local councils concerned about future funding for Roads to Recovery. This concern is a result of scaremongering by those opposite. Labor does, and always has, supported the Roads to Recovery program. The simple truth of the situation, as set out in the 2013-14 Commonwealth budget papers, is that the Labor government extended Roads to Recovery funding across the forward estimates. Labor allocated $1.75 billion in the 2013-14 budget for the next five years of the program; it is already budgeted for the next five years. However, the first quarterly payment for this financial year, which is due to be paid to councils next month, is in limbo because the government would not agree to the sensible amendments proposed by Labor that would have increased transparency in major infrastructure investments. That is why the member for Grayndler, Anthony Albanese, yesterday sought to introduce a private member's bill in the other place that would amend existing legislation to extend Roads to Recovery. Yesterday Mr Albanese sought to bring on debate on his private member's bill and give councils the certainty they want by extending this program. However, the Abbott government opposed even debating the legislation. They shut down a move by Mr Albanese on his private member's bill. They would not even allow debate on his bill.


Not only has the incompetency of those opposite prevented the Roads to Recovery program being extended before it expired on 30 June 2014; now their sheer stubbornness has seen them reject Labor's attempt to sort this issue out. Labor understands how critical investment in infrastructure such as roads and rail is for the economic development of this country. Labor understands how critical it is to make the right investment in the right infrastructure projects. That is why Labor doubled the roads budget to $46.5 billion and upgraded 7½ thousand kilometres of road, lifted local government road grants by 20 per cent, invested $3.4 billion in rail freight network over six years, rebuilt more than a third of the rail network—that is 4,000 kilometres of track—and committed more investment in urban rail infrastructure than all predecessors. Labor understands the importance of these nation-building projects, and has invested in our vision for the country.


In my home state of Tasmania people know how important investment in critical infrastructure is for economic development. Unfortunately, those opposite have failed the people of Tasmania and have tried to fool them by reannouncing infrastructure projects in the budget. They reannounced our entire nation-building package, including the same funding for the freight rail revitalisation, for the Brooker Highway and for the Huon Highway. In fact, the only new thing in the budget for Tasmanian infrastructure was a cut—a cut of $100 million to the funding of the Midland Highway. Labor had committed $500 million over 10 years for this critical project, and now there is only $400 million. This is something that Minister Truss is apparently proud of, as he highlighted this project in his second reading speech on the bill we are debating here today. I might say that Senator Abetz also seems very proud of the fact that there was a cut of $100 million from the Midland Highway.




Senator Bilyk:
  That is disgraceful!




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  That is exactly right, Senator Bilyk. It is disgraceful. And that is from the government of our self-appointed infrastructure Prime Minister. Labor has a strong record of investment in crucial infrastructure projects, and Labor's record contrasts starkly with that of those opposite. Since coming to government those opposite have spoken of a grand vision for infrastructure, but it appears to be no more than a mirage. Not only have they failed to deliver funding for the Roads to Recovery program, but they have also cut $1 billion from the Commonwealth road funding to local councils. Councils all over the country will receive a real cut in real terms this year because of the government's short-sighted decision to freeze annual indexation of the financial assistance grants. These cuts to financial assistance grants will leave local councils with less money to maintain roads as well as delivering local community service.




Senator Williams:
  That is not true.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  It is absolutely true, Senator Williams. You have obviously not been getting your mail from your local councils.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Seselja
):  Order! Senator Brown, I will get you to address the chair, and I will ask Senator Williams not to interject.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  He does it all the time.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I cannot comment on what he does all the time. I am just asking him not to interject now.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Thank you for your protection from Senator Williams!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am very happy to help.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  These actions are in line with the legacy of Mr Howard's 12 years in government. The Howard government left its mark on Australia's investment in infrastructure with the largest infrastructure deficit in this nation's history. The Howard government hardly spent anything on infrastructure. It did not spend it for the economic development of this nation. Under the Howard government, 90 per cent of roads funding in my home state of Tasmania went to two electorates, both held by Liberal Party members. It seems this is a lesson the Abbott government has taken to heart. Since coming to office this government has taken a new approach to infrastructure funding, which could best be described as slashing, cutting, reannouncing and pork barrelling. Those opposite, led by Mr Abbott and Mr Truss, have travelled around the country shamelessly reannouncing Labor projects such as the Gateway Upgrade North in Brisbane and the Bruce and Pacific Highway upgrades, claiming them as coalition projects. They have done the same with Labor's inland rail project, claiming it as a coalition project. They have also scrapped billions in Labor funding for critical transport infrastructure projects such as the Perth public transport system, Brisbane's Cross River Rail project, the Melbourne Metro and Adelaide's Tonsley Park public transport project. Mr Abbott has committed to Melbourne's East West Link and Sydney's WestConnex project. However, this has been done without cost-benefit analysis—in defiance, as I mentioned earlier, of his own election promise. Those opposite obviously do not understand how transformative investment in crucial infrastructure is for our nation's cities, for our regional areas and for our economic development.


Those opposite, led by Mr Abbott, appear to think that infrastructure funding is about buying votes in marginal electorates rather than making critical nation-building investments. In fact, we have already seen the start of this type of pork-barrelling from them in Mr Abbott's budget. An analysis of the budget's infrastructure spending by Fairfax media found that coalition electorates are favoured for new money by a ratio of three to one. In comparison, the analysis found that the majority of projects which lost federal funding after the 2013 election were in non-Liberal electorates.


It is clear that the government are already ignoring the professional and independent advice of Infrastructure Australia, and it will only get worse if this bill passes. In a Sydney Morning Herald article on 12 June, Monash University professor of transport Graham Currie said:


The question is whether they—


the government—


want to be a professional government or they want to pork barrel, and whether we'll forge the idea of trying to be professional about how we manage resources or just do it on a political basis.


He then went on to say:


I don't think that's how a country should be run.


This bill makes the answer to Professor Currie's question clear.


Stopping this type of politically motivated behaviour was one of the purposes of establishing the independent advisory body of Infrastructure Australia, which Labor has fought to protect. That is why, to respond to the questions posed or statements made by senators opposite about Infrastructure Australia, we have put forward this amendment. It is quite clear that this amendment is needed so that Infrastructure Australia's expert advice is sought, the way it should be. It is an independent body. It makes transparent decisions. We need to have it there. This is why we are putting forward this amendment to this bill.


Critical national-building projects are currently under construction right across Australia because of the investment in infrastructure made by the former Labor government. Across the states and territories, and particularly in my home state of Tasmania, vital infrastructure projects initiated by the former Labor government are providing jobs and boosting the economy.


This bill does little more than eliminate the term 'nation building' from the statute books as part of Mr Abbott's agenda of rebadging Labor government programs. It is clear that those opposite have no real vision for transport infrastructure in Australia. I ask the Senate to support the amendment that will be put forward by our shadow minister today.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2014-08-27,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (11:17):  I hope Senator Brown stays in the chamber because I need to refer to some of the things she said. Senator Brown is correct that the government plans to freeze the financial assistance grants, FAGs, for three years. That is correct. I hope Senator Brown realises that we have a budget problem, a mess we inherited from that lot over there that Senator Brown is part of.


In 2015-16 the Roads to Recovery program will be doubled for local governments. Here is the point: FAGs can be spent on anything. When a council receives a grant, they can put pavers down on a footpath. They can put parks in. But we want to fix our roads. I do not know if Senator Brown has ever driven on a dirt road, but I do every week of my life. Here is the point we are making: we want to fix our roads because the exports we produce need to get to the waterfront. For that, we need some decent roads. I hope Senator Brown stays to hear more of what I have to say, but I do not think she is going to. There is more money for local government because of the doubling of the Roads to Recovery program. That was a National Party initiative under former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson.


While I am referring to senators opposite, I will say that I was surprised that Senator Conroy stayed this morning. I thought he would be too embarrassed to show his face after the release of the coalition's cost-benefit analysis of the National Broadband Network. That is the cost-benefit analysis that Senator Conroy and then Prime Minister Rudd refused to undertake because they knew they would be laughed out of the country if they did. The National Broadband Network is the biggest spending program in our nation's history and no cost-benefit analysis was done. We tried in opposition to get one, but people such as the former member for New England, Tony Windsor, did not want to have the cost-benefit analysis done either. It was a multibillion-dollar program that was devised on the back of a coaster—a coaster, mind you.


Senator Conroy must be close to releasing his own book. We have the Wayne Maxwell Swan book from the former Treasurer. Most of the rest of the Labor hierarchy have pointed the finger at each other about the six-year debacle when they were in government. There is no mateship in the trenches there! I look forward to Senator Conroy's book. What is it going to be called—'A roller-coaster in government' or 'Coming on a coaster near you'? Why didn't they do a cost-benefit analysis when they brought in the NBN? It is because they were afraid of the truth.


The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill amends the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009. Among other changes, this legislation will allow the Roads to Recovery program to be funded. In the other place, Labor and the Greens opposed the legislation. They opposed the very legislation that has brought so much finance and road improvement to local governments right around our nation. They opposed it. I hope it is not the same with this bill in front of the new Senate where Labor and the Greens, thankfully, do not control the numbers.


In November 2000, the Howard government announced a four-year road funding package worth $1.6 billion, of which $1.2 billion was spent on the Roads to Recovery program. The legislation was introduced by the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon. John Anderson. It was a Nationals initiative.


The new coalition government faced a $47 billion budget deficit for the 2013-14 financial year just past, $123 billion of projected deficits to 2016-17 and a $1 billion interest bill every month on Labor's debt. For those listening on radio, $1 billion rolls off the tongue pretty quickly. But let me give you an example. Senator Abetz gave an example recently in response to a question in question time on the difference between one million and one billion. One million seconds equates to 11½ days—that is not long—but one billion seconds equates to 31.7 years. So when we talk about billions we are talking about huge amounts of money.


Infrastructure spending does not stop under this legislation. There is a $50 billion investment from this government to deliver vital transport infrastructure across Australia for the 21st century. There is $2.5 billion for the Roads to Recovery program to support the maintenance and upgrade of local roads. I live out on one of those local roads—it is a dirt road—and I know the cost to council of maintaining let alone improving those roads, with their corrugations and potholes. That is especially the case after a dry spell, when the dust has been blowing, when the rain falls and there is erosion washing away the sides of the road. There are additional payments of $350 million to councils during the 2015-16 financial year. I put that on top of the FAGs freeze in the principal for three years, but a doubling of the Roads to Recovery money so we can fix our roads. We said we would be a government of infrastructure building, and that is exactly what is happening here.


There will be $565 million provided through the ongoing Black Spot Program. That includes an extra $100 million in both the 2015-16 and 2016-17 financial years. The $300 million Bridges Renewal Program will commence in 2014-15. This program will repair bridges. Mr Acting Deputy President Seselja, go out to regional New South Wales and have a look at the old wooden bridges that have been there for decades. You will see they are narrow and dangerous and need replacing. There will be $200 million over next five years for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program for road enhancements, rest areas and technology trials—especially the rest areas. I have discussed with Senator Sterle, who is a former truckie, how we need more rest areas, so that when the truckies have to take their break, according to their work diary, there is somewhere they can park their rig so they can get off the road safely—hopefully where it is quiet—and have a rest. There is a $314 million investment in 300 projects in local communities through our Community Development Grants Program, which is designed to deliver the coalition's election commitments and some residue projects from the previous government.


The $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund aims to promote economic development through investment in infrastructure projects at a local level. This is important. The program will help communities with lower than average socioeconomic circumstances and higher than average unemployment by improving local facilities, creating jobs and building needed infrastructure. There is $100 million to fill in black spots in the mobile phone network. It is all right in the cities and the large country towns, where there is a mobile phone network, but there are many areas across regional Australia that need towers to get the signal out there. There are plenty of examples around where I live—for example, Copeton Dam, which is visited by 100,000 people a year for water skiing, camping or whatever, has virtually no mobile signal. 


The Australian Local government Association says:


… Roads to Recovery (R2R) program has become an essential element in local government's ability to maintain and upgrade the local roads network. It is an outstanding example of a partnership between the national and local governments and of providing direct funding to local communities.


So why did the Labor Party oppose this bill in the other place? Why is it demanding changes now? It is because Labor wants an additional eight pages of amendments to provide for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. But this program is already provided for under legislation. It is already there. This government is committed to a number of other programs that are not provided separate status in legislation. If the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program with its eight pages of bureaucratic red tape is included, so must be the others, such as the Bridges Renewal Program and the Regional Roads Program. If the Labor Party's amendments were agreed to, funding to this program would be held up because the guidelines under which applicants were applying would be inconsistent with the legislation. We do not want things held up.


This government will require all Commonwealth funded projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis by Infrastructure Australia to ensure the best use of available taxpayers' money. The cut-off point is $100 million. It was not there for the NBN. We will also require Infrastructure Australia to publish justification for all its project recommendations. Infrastructure Australia is getting on with the job without it having to be in legislation. There was a provision in the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 to enable the $100 million threshold to be determined by a disallowable instrument, but the amendments moved by the opposition and ultimately accepted by the Senate on that legislation removed that provision. We will now seek to put the $100 million threshold in the Infrastructure Australia legislation, where it belongs.


A couple of weeks ago I was in the seat of Richmond, in the northern corner of New South Wales, adjoining Queensland, having a look at some of the coalition funded projects, such as the CCTV at Byron Bay. I was quite amazed to be informed of the amount of antisocial behaviour and crime on the streets of Byron Bay. It is a real concern. I also looked at the planned upgrade of Kennedy Drive at Tweed Heads. It is a pretty ordinary bit of bitumen, I can assure you, and it is good to see that $3.3 million will be spent to rebuild that stretch of bitumen. In Richmond, Tweed Shire Council received $6.11 million and Byron Shire $2.65 million under this program, between 2009-10 and 2013-14. I spoke with representatives of both councils. They are concerned that the Roads to Recovery program funding is being held up by the local federal member Justine Elliott and her Labor colleagues for no good reason other than to play politics. They should step back and let it go through.


In the Hunter region of New South Wales, Upper Hunter Shire has received $4.3 million, Singleton Council $2.73 million, Muswellbrook Shire $2.04 million, Cessnock city council $3.82 million and Maitland city council $2.84 million. I received a letter from the Hunter council which expressed fears about the future of the program. Mayor of Upper Hunter Shire, Councillor Michael Johnsen, says it is critical that the program continue, a view he feels would be held by every council in the Hunter region of New South Wales. Councils in the Hunter know the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon, voted to stop it, but Labor cannot come up with a plausible reason for having done so. Why did they vote against this in the House?


Over the past five years councils in New England were allocated over $30 million in Roads to Recovery funding. I appeal to the cross benches to stop listening to Labor lies. Mr Albanese has apparently told you that unless the heavy vehicle programme is actually named in the legislation it will not continue. That is absolute rubbish and is wrong. Ask yourself why Mr Albanese did not find it necessary to make significant amendments when he created the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program while in government. All he did was change the definition of a 'road' in legislation, because that is all that was needed to establish the program. So ask yourself, cross benchers, why is he now proposing three pages of amendments just on the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program?


This is a very simple bill. Its primary purpose is to extend the Roads to Recovery program, change the name of the act, and tidy up aspects of the act, which is consistent with the government's red tape reduction agenda. I have long ago given up trying to understand the Greens. It seems they are a leaderless lot on this very issue. The New South Wales Greens want the federal Greens to support the fuel excise increase, but the federal Greens have had several positions. Senator Milne was obviously rolled in the party room on that one. What I cannot understand is that the fuel excise increase is actually a tax on carbon, yet the Greens oppose it after fighting to retain the carbon tax in this place a couple of weeks ago. How do you work that one out? The fuel excise increase should be supported because all of the money will go to road funding, yet here they are again opposing a good program.


So I say again to the crossbenchers that there are no hidden surprises, no gotcha moments and no hidden clauses with this bill. Don't worry about Mr Albanese's propaganda. Let this go through. I am sure that if you do not let it go through your local government will tell you what they think, if you block this. Ask them to show you some of the projects Roads to Recovery has funded. Talk to the local governments in your states and hear the success stories of the Roads to Recovery program. Ask them if they looking forward to the doubling of the funding in 2015-16. Of course they are. Every council in Australia is. Then tell them that Labor does not want them to have that funding. That is the real issue blocking this. The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill should be supported so that money can start rolling out now.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (11:32):  I look forward to making my contribution to this debate today on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. Senators in this place should have road safety foremost in their minds, not only for our transport operators but for every single Australian who uses our roads. There are a lot of issues I want to clear up. Firstly, it is no secret that Labor does support the general purpose of the bill. We have no argument with that as it was our legislation and our work in 2009 that created this bill.


The Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program should be legislated. I heard Senator Williams going on about not listening to Labor lies, and saying to the crossbenchers, 'Why didn't Minister Albanese legislate it?' I will go further into why Labor believes the amendment should be passed and why we should legislate the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program.


There are a couple of points about heavy vehicle road safety that I want to touch on. The Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program is another element in the armoury we have to help drive down road deaths and injury. There should absolutely be no argument in this chamber or in the other place about doing whatever we can to reduce road deaths, trauma and injury. This program sits alongside spending on our national network, including record spending on duplicating the Bruce and Pacific highways, which, once again, was initiated by the former Labor government.


Heavy vehicle safety is also being addressed by the new Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which is sometimes referred to as the 'safe rates remuneration tribunal', which, no-one will be surprised to hear, I am going to have a bit to say about later. I am also going to have a fair dinkum crack at those on the other side who want to take this away from the road transport industry and thus diminish road safety for other road users in Australia. I will say more on that later. The tribunal was established by the former Labor government. It commenced operations in July 2012. The object of the act is to promote safety and fairness in the road transport industry. I do not see what is hard about that. In fact, I will tell you what is hard about it: it is a disgrace to this nation that it has taken so long to get through. But it is here now for the time being, and that mob over there are going to do everything they can to try to water it down.


The tribunal's role in this area primarily relates to addressing the relationship between remuneration and safety in the industry by, amongst other things, ensuring that road transport drivers do not have remuneration related incentives to work in an unsafe manner—and, my God, they are out there and they are alive. Also, it removes remuneration related incentives, pressures and practices that contribute to unsafe work practices. I challenge any senator who wants to debate this with me publicly to bring it on, because I will tell you that you are on the wrong ground if you think you are going to put up an argument with me that counters what we are saying about road safety and linking road safety to overloading, break and fatigue management, speeding, and illicit use of drugs. But the offer is there to any one of you. Bring it on. But you will not. You do not have the guts to do it.


The coalition government flagged its intention to eliminate this tribunal, even before its first partial order came into effect, on 1 May this year. They have commissioned an inquiry into the tribunal before it has had a chance to prove its worth as an additional tool to deliver road safety. In describing the tribunal as red tape, the government prefers ideology over finding new ways to save lives on the road.


While I am on a roll discussing the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, back in June this year Mr Jamie Briggs, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, was addressing an Australian Livestock Transport Association conference in Adelaide. I am quoting from ATN magazine, which is a pretty good magazine, too. It says here:


Briggs told the ALRTA conference the Coalition has ""always been very uncomfortable"" with the tribunal and then added: ""I think you can see the direction the government is intending to take.""


""We think over-regulation of your industry doesn’t help your outcomes. It just adds cost, it doesn’t improve safety. It just means your businesses are harder to operate.""


What a load of bunk! Why didn't he just come straight out and say, 'We will give you every opportunity in the trucking industry to screw around drivers' wages, break every fatigue law, speed, overload and turn a blind eye to illicit drugs.'


Let me just clarify this: I do not think one member of the Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association would agree with that statement I just made, but these are words coming from a politician from South Australia. I just want everyone to know his working history. It is a travesty when you get members of parliament who have had absolutely no life experiences and they pertain to be experts in the road transport industry. It really does give me the screaming abdabs.


But I have got to tell you Mr Briggs's work history. He was born in 1977—great, tremendous, no dramas. His employment before coming to parliament was as an employment relations adviser for Business South Australia—whoopee! Then he went on to become a research assistant to the Hon. RI Lucas MLC for a year, then he was adviser to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon. Kevin Andrews MP, for a year and then he was senior adviser to then Prime Minister, the Hon. JW Howard—




Senator Gallacher:
  He was up to his neck in Work Choices!




Senator STERLE:
  and as my mate and colleague Senator Gallacher said, he was up to his neck in Work Choices—for three years. The man has never had a real job. He has never had dirt under his fingernails and would not know what it is like to get out there and actually have to change a tyre at two o'clock in the morning when it is pouring down with rain; but he is an expert in road transport and road safety! What an absolute disgrace. Anyway, I will have a bit more to say about that later.


We will get back to the bill. I just want to quote, while we are talking about road safety, some words of wisdom from the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. What they said, in terms of the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program under the act, is:


Heavy vehicles are involved in many serious accidents across Australia annually—during the 12 months to September 2011, 230 people died from 204 fatal crashes involving heavy vehicles or buses and there is significant evidence linking such accidents with fatigue. Drivers are also required to comply with heavy vehicle driver fatigue-related legislation which ensures that regular and effective rest breaks are taken during long journeys.


Senator Gallacher and I know that, as we put in a lot of hard work in our former lives as transport workers and also as senior officials with the Transport Workers Union in the transport industry. This is not news to us two; we have been living and breathing it for the last 30-odd years of our lives. It may be news to a few on the other side, particularly those who have never had a real job in their lives but pertain to be experts in the road transport industry.


It also goes on to say:


The size of the heavy vehicle road freight task was 503 billion tonne kilometres in 2008, according to the National Transport Commission (NTC), and this is expected to reach 1,540 billion tonne kilometres by 2050. NTC argues that “improved productivity is the key to reducing the effect of the growing freight task on road safety, the environment and the amenity of our communities”.


They are words of wisdom. I could have told them that. There are no dramas; they only had to ask. But let us go back to what we did and the fears that Labor has in terms of the amendments not being picked up and not being legislated.


You see, in the round 3 criteria—which was under the Labor government—we said that projects that reduce accidents by targeting driver fatigue are of extreme importance. I want to share some examples of round 3 projects that we did do under Labor. Senator Johnston, let us go to your state and my state. Let us talk about WA, shall we? I can tell you, I know all these areas, as you probably do too. If I get it wrong, I am sure you may assist me. I also know that you will agree and I know that you will do everything that you would see fit to make sure that our roads are safe for all road users.


The government contributed $1.5 million to upgrading the Great Northern Highway road train assembly area in Wubin. You could spend another $1.5 million on that before you got it up to scratch, but at least that has been started under a Labor government. And $850,000 was spent in upgrading five rest areas on the Great Northern Highway north of Wubin. Let me tell you, that is only a drop in the ocean. I was in the Kimberley last week. I do that regularly; I am a regular visitor to the Kimberley and have been since 1980. I have to tell you, it is hard for the road train operators to get into a parking bay at this time of the year. Everything up there is big; they are either over width or have three trailers. But you have the grey nomads in there, who will not spend a dime in town but will go and park in a truck bay and camp there for a couple of days. We could do with a hell of a lot more truck bays up here.


But at least there were five of them done at $850,000 under the previous Labor government. The layover bays on the Great Northern Highway between Port Hedland and Newman were done. That is only one project. You should see the other fine work that was delivered under a Labor government in Port Hedland, which I had an opportunity to look at last Tuesday. There was an upgrade to the existing rest area on SLK 526 on the Eyre Highway and a number of other initiatives.


The wording is the problem that we have with the government at the moment on this bill, because—as I have said—our criteria said that projects that reduce accidents by targeting driver fatigue are our cause. But under the Liberals' round 4 criteria, they have changed the wording to:



…


improve the safety environment for heavy vehicles.



What the hell does that mean? This is the fear we have and I want to share this with the chamber. I heard Senator Williams going on to the backbenches, saying, 'Do not be fooled by Labor,' and all that sort of stuff.


The truth of the matter is—and I am not going to be a shrinking violet on this; I have made this very, very clear—I do not trust the other side of the chamber when it comes to weaselling out of road safety programs. I absolutely do not trust the ministers to uphold what they should be upholding in terms of delivering road safety. We have seen that with some fellow who has never had a real job in his life but who claims to be an expert in road transport. He tells people he will water down road safety—he sees it as red tape. But I also do not trust Minister Truss to stick by his commitment to road safety, unless it is legislated in this chamber. 


I want to send a message out to Senator Muir. I have had the opportunity to speak to Senator Muir. I am privileged to have had the opportunity to speak with Senator Muir's chief of staff, who, like me and Senator Gallacher, is an ex-truckie and actually gets the importance of road safety. This may not come up again. Senator Muir has six years in this building at this stage; he may get another six years—I hope he does. But, Senator Muir, you have to understand that you may not have the opportunity to correct the ship. Along with other crossbench senators, this is now the time to support Labor's amendments, as I know the Greens will. I want the Palmer United Party to understand this. Why should the minister have the final say? We should trust the parliament; we should not trust individual ministers with road safety. 


Here is another reason why—and I am going to make this very, very clear: one of the major pushes for the abolition of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal has come from none other than Coles, the supermarket. Surprise, surprise, Coles have got a problem. Coles do not want transport operators to be safe. Coles have problems because our drivers have to have fatigue management breaks. Coles have problems—they will not say it, but why else would they want to kill off the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal?—because truckies have to be paid properly. If truckies are paid properly, truckies will not have the incentive to speed, to break speed limits to make a dollar or, even worse, just to meet their basic commitments in fuel payments, insurance payments, truck payments, maintenance and tyres. Coles have a problem with the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal because it also takes away the incentive for truck drivers to seek to use illicit drugs. I did not say Coles were supporting or promoting illicit drugs, but why in hell would a major user of transport have a problem with truck drivers being remunerated properly? Why would they have a problem with truck drivers carting legal limits, legal loads? Why would they have a problem with other road users making sure that they are absolutely protected due to our truckies being protected when they are paid properly and they are rested? I rest my case. I do not see the reason for this. 


There is this bulldust about red tape. Call it what you like, but when my kids and my wife are out on the road I want the truck coming towards them to be driven by a truck driver who is remunerated properly, who is carting legal load limits, who is not using illicit drugs and who does not have to speed or shortcut on repairs, maintenance and tyres. You can call it what you like—I do not care what you call it—but to hide behind red tape is an insult to the transport industry and an insult to the road safety industry. Every person in this chamber and in the other place should condemn the ridiculous statements made by people who have no idea but who are getting paid a nice little wage because they are a parliamentary secretary or an Assistant Treasurer. It really irks me. 


If Mr Briggs has a problem, I welcome the opportunity to tour the country with Mr Briggs. There is the offer, if he is listening. Let's debate it. He and I can get into a debate, but we are not going to hide behind the apron strings of Coles, behind the apron strings of major transport companies who do not want to pay their drivers properly or behind the apron strings of other users. Debate me, but debate me with community people. You name the place, Mr Briggs, and you name the time—I will be there debating with you. You put forward your case and I will put forward my case as to why we should have a Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, why we should make sure that every Australian has an opportunity to go to work or to go visiting or whatever and know that Australia's truckies are rested properly and paid properly and that the use of illicit drugs is stamped out. There is the challenge.


We have heard a number of statements about how great the government is and, yes, we all support these things and we all want to work together, but we have to put it in context. If all sides of the chamber—the crossbenchers, the Greens, Labor and the Liberal-National coalition—agree, what do they have to fear about letting the parliament be the judge? What is there to fear about amending this piece of legislation by taking this decision out of the hands of the minister? We have seen other examples. Minister Truss may have some problem with this, but I also remember in 2004-05—I was not a senator in 2004—that there was a fair bit of pork-barrelling going on. The Australian National Audit Office found 17 shocking examples of pork-barrelling. I am not saying that that was all involving Minister Truss; other ministers were in that portfolio before him. But Minister Truss picked up the last six or eight months in the portfolio. This is the sad part. If it is not controlled by the parliament and it is the hands of one minister, it could be twisted, it could be moved aside, and certain elements could be de-prioritised. When I see the wording of the coalition's round 4 criteria state in brackets that they want to improve the safety environment for heavy vehicles, that does not give me any comfort at all.


I say to all those out there listening: put on the hat of your parents or your brothers or sisters. My son is a truckie. He is out there every night on the North West Coastal Highway or the Brand Highway or the Great Northern Highway. I know that he works for a reputable firm. He works for Western Australia's largest transport company, where the truck drivers are paid on their fatigue management book. They cannot diddle their hours. They also have cameras in the cabs and they have GPS. If they—the largest transport company in Western Australia, which is privately owned—do not have grief with paying their truck drivers properly, if they do not have grief with making their truck drivers have fatigue management breaks and telling their clients, 'If you want us to provide your transport services, these are the laws and regulations that you must work in,' why the hell are the likes of Coles, ably abetted by junior ministers who have no idea, pushing to get rid of or water down Australia's road safety legislation? We will not be supporting the bill.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2014-08-27,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (11:52):  I congratulate Senator Janet Rice on taking over the transport portfolio, and I look forward to working with her in this area. She has set out the Greens' very clear case on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. I reiterate the Greens' support for Roads to Recovery and black spot funding to improve safety and access on our roads. Some of my work in the portfolio of local government crosses over into this area. When I was in the New South Wales parliament, I saw how important road maintenance and road safety issues are to local government. It is an area of politics where some very important work is undertaken. 


Constitutional recognition of local government is relevant to this discussion. Constitutional recognition is needed for many reasons, but one reason is to ensure that funding for local roads continues to flow. I again put on the record how disappointing it is that the issue of constitutional recognition of local government seems to have fallen off the political agenda of this government; it did appear when they were in opposition that they were not really committed to it. It is something that we need to continue to raise. If you want surety of roads funding for local government, it is most definitely relevant.


Over the past few months since the introduction of this bill, the coalition government—particularly the National Party, I have noticed—have been running some ugly politics, trying to accuse the Greens and Labor of undermining road safety because we would not simply wave the legislation through. That really is low, insulting and cheap politics. We have just heard Senator Glenn Sterle set out very clearly how important it is to have safety on our roads and how relevant this issue is not only for truck drivers but for all road users. For any members who did not hear all of the senator's speech, I would recommend it, because he set out the need for good rest breaks and decent pay for truck drivers and how important it is to stamp out illicit drug use. These are critical issues that serve as a real reminder of why we need decent regulations. This government is trying to run down these regulations, which then becomes a real safety issue. So if we are talking about safety, those factors also need to be taken into consideration. 


While we are talking about road safety and local councils, it is also relevant to remember what happened in the government's first budget brought down in May this year. There we saw $1 billion ripped out of local government funding. Regional councillors and communities from many country areas have contacted me about this. They are really concerned about the way the government is handling local councils. Often within those messages there were comments about what this would mean for road safety, for road maintenance and for jobs in those country areas. Often the area with the biggest job allocation in local councils is road maintenance. That has been spelled out to me time and time again. The Municipal Association of Victoria have estimated that regional and rural communities could be hardest hit by the cuts. Again, Senator Rice pointed this out very clearly in her contribution. The President of the Municipal Association of Victoria, Bill McArthur, stated:


Commonwealth financial assistance grants are a core revenue stream for local government. The grants provide up to 27 per cent of rural councils’ total funding so rural communities will suffer a massive impact.


The local government associations of Queensland and South Australia have also detailed how regional and rural councils will be hit hard by this massive budget cut. The President of the Australian Local Government Association really nailed the impact on local roads in regional and rural areas, when she said:


These grants are used to maintain a great range of infrastructure including local roads, bridges …


There you have the importance of that government money for roads and bridges—$1 billion of that now ripped out—identified by these peak organisations that bring together our local councils and shires.


When we come to the debate about transport, the role of councils and the money that they are losing are very relevant issues. While the government is slashing vital support to regional councils, it is delivering billions of dollars to private motorway projects that will not improve congestion but will boost the profits of private developers. This is very relevant to this debate. It is essential that the money flows for road upgrades where they are needed because of safety issues. Meanwhile, we have a much greater flow of money into the hands of private motorway developers—clearly a section of the business community that is very close to the Nationals and the Liberals at both federal and state levels. The Abbott government have announced $3.5 billion in funding to the WestConnex, a private tollway in Sydney. They have done that despite the New South Wales government—their own Liberal-National colleagues at the state level—refusing to release the business case. The government are handing over that money while the community cannot find the details of who is going to benefit or whether there is any benefit at all.


Questioning in Senate estimates exposed the lack of confidence Infrastructure Australia has in the WestConnex project. This is largely because details and costs have been kept hidden. This is becoming a real theme with the development of urban motorways in this country. So it is not surprising that the Cross City Tunnel and the Lane Cove Tunnel, two big urban motorway projects in Sydney, have gone belly-up and into receivership. There have been similar problems with Brisbane tollways as well. So the evidence is in that there is a major problem with how these business cases play out. What do we see here? We do not see the government being transparent, being open with the public about the problems they are confronting. Even if they go ahead with their motorways, how are they going to make them work financially? You would have to assume that the reason they are being secretive is that they cannot argue the case. 


I have set out the amount of money, coming in at $3.5 billion, for WestConnex. The secretive way they are handling the business case is a repeat of what happened with the east-west tollway in Melbourne. The federal Liberal-National government has committed $3 billion. What do we see? Another project with a secret business case and another project that has been rejected by the local community. I very much congratulate the communities around the proposed WestConnex project and the proposed east-west tollway for getting out there and informing people about the reality of what these projects will do to their communities. They are letting people know how these projects will create more congestion and more pollution and how these sorts of motorways often divide communities—sometimes you cannot even cross the road in your own area anymore.


There you have it—$6.5 billion in total for private tollway projects that are completely lacking in transparency. That is very relevant to this debate. When we are talking about the need for money for roads, we need to look at what the government is doing across the board in this area and to explore why they are being so secretive and who is benefiting from allocations out of the transport budget. The government has committed less than a third of that $6.5 billion to the Roads to Recovery program in the 2014 budget. Roads to Recovery comes in at $2.1 billion—money that we have always said is needed and should be allocated. As other senators have said, however, there need to be standards and we need to get it right.


When it comes to infrastructure and roads spending, this government is full of rhetoric about how it is going to benefit the majority of people, but in reality they are delivering it in a way that works for the big motorway developers. The government accuses the Greens of opposing road safety while at the same time it prioritises billions for the private sector through projects like WestConnex and the east-west tollway. What the Liberals and Nationals need to realise is that people are cottoning on to that. The government might try to slag us off by saying we are not interested in safety and they might sprout those words for their media grabs, but that is insulting. Saying that a person does not dare about the lives and safety of others is, I think, one of the worst things you can say about someone. But I am finding that the community can see through the government's media grabs. They can see that it is just a cheap way for the Liberals and Nationals to try to deflect criticism and divert attention away from the very important analysis the Greens bring to this debate about where the money is being spent and why these urban motorways continue to be pushed by government—when the evidence is in that they represent a failed model. They represent a failed model from the perspective of delivering transport solutions and they are certainly a failed model from the perspective of business success. 


If this government were serious about improving productivity and safety, it would take off its blinkers when it comes to infrastructure investment and take public transport seriously. People often say, 'You bang on about public transport, Lee, but seriously people want to get in their cars.' Of course we know that people want to get in their cars. You need trucks. In a country the size of Australia, trucks will always be part of the transport mix. But the key way to reduce congestion on our roads is by having better public transport. That is how we can get traffic on our roads to move more efficiently—by giving more people access to reliable, fast, safe public transport. If they have that access, they will use it. Then the people who need to use our roads will be able to do so with less congestion. 


We need good quality safe roads to connect our communities, and that particularly applies—and I will emphasise this again because the continual distortion of the Greens position gets a bit tiresome—in our regional and rural areas. But decades of bias towards roads funding has created bottlenecks in our economy. We are far from world's best practice when it comes to freight and passenger transport. We are back in the 20th century. I was doing some work on the South Coast of New South Wales, along the Princess Highway. It is one of those areas where there have been huge upgrades—in parts, not in all parts. Many of those upgrades have been done for safety reasons, although not just for safety. But there have been huge upgrades with lots of flyovers. In one place, I was able to look down on both the railway line and parts of the motorway. The contrast was extraordinary. You could see a one-line rail track which I doubt has been significantly upgraded in a hundred years—seriously, any upgrades would have been minimal. In stark contrast, you could see this incredibly fancy motorway that has had all the kinks straightened out and is now a very fast road for users. That speaks volumes about how governments—and I am talking about successive governments here, Labor as well as Liberal-National—have approached transport infrastructure.


We need to ensure that rail and bus services keep up with the demand in our cities. I am giving emphasis to the cities because clearly that is where there is considerable congestion, but these services need to be addressed in our regional areas as well. We need to continue to invest in our regional rail network and freight lines to build on the incredible transport legacy created by our forebears. They had vision and they put in the hard work. I often use the extensive rail network that spans our country and I often address community groups who are very passionate about our rail lines. 


Sometimes you wonder whether it had been up to the governments of today to come forward with a transport plan they would have had the vision of our forebears to put in such an extensive rail network. Our forebears knew that what they were building then was for the future; it was not just short term, with a couple of rail lines linking up a few communities. They had that vision, and that is what we as a society need to return to today. The planners, the engineers and the public officials who delivered such a comprehensive national rail system had the common sense, vision and understanding of the importance of public transport when it came to connecting our cities with our regions and our regions across this huge land. 


The pattern of investment in roads at the expense of rail in recent years has shifted the balance. We now see huge problems across the country, with gaps in the rail network, the dangerous growth of B-double and B-triple trucks on our roads and the ailing public transport system in our major cities. There is not the vision or the coordination needed for safe roads and also for roads that will help boost the productivity of this nation while, at the same time, being a wonderful transport system that allows grandparents to pick up their children in the next suburb after preschool, people to catch public transport to do some volunteer work, students to go to a university a couple of suburbs away and people to get to work efficiently. All this should be fundamental to how a government approaches transport policies, not just one that looks at 'How do we do some favours for some mates?' who happen to be big motorway developers. 


The government has refused to spend a dollar on new rail projects. We heard the Prime Minister say those extraordinary words: 'rail is a matter for the states'. How he has really belittled public transport! The proposed legislation makes it clear that land transport is an infrastructure issue that needs to involve all levels of government—federal, state and local. It provides a framework within which the federal government can fund particularly road projects. There is absolutely no reason why such a framework could not be established for important public transport projects. When the minister comes in, he will clearly be dealing with the details of the legislation, but it will also be very relevant to hear from the minister why such a framework—the minister will have the opportunity to set this out—could not be established for important public transport projects. The very name of the bill, 'land transport', would suggest that the funding allocated through this legislation would go beyond roads and perhaps into rail. Unfortunately, we know that is not the case. This is why, when I read the title and then the details of the bill, I felt that it was actually another one of those situations where the title of a bill is being used in such a way as to be misleading. 


So, yes, the Greens will support this bill because the Roads to Recovery funding is important to ensure road safety, but it will be contingent on two amendments. My colleague Senator Janet Rice, who has carriage of this legislation, has set this work out very clearly. We believe it is entirely reasonable to hold this government to its election promise, which was: 


To ensure more rigorous and transparent assessments of taxpayer-funded projects—


These are the words of the government—and they went on:


we will require all infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis.


So what could be the problem here? Surely those amendments should pass. We will support amendments to that effect to ensure the government are held to their word. In fact, we will move for the lower threshold of $50 million to ensure even greater transparency in terms of the allocation of public funding. 


Additionally, we will support amendments to enshrine in legislation guidelines relating to the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. However, as we believe this program should be focused on truck driver safety, we will move to prioritise projects that improve the safety environment for heavy vehicles rather than projects that are purely focused on improving the productivity of road freight. The primary goal of government when it comes to road freight infrastructure should be to make sure that truck drivers are safe—this should be the starting point: truck drivers are safe—and then we can have safe roads. You cannot do one without the other, and this is where I become very disturbed with how the government plays out this issue. We are talking about the lives of people—people with families, people who are on the roads with such a huge responsibility driving the big trucks that we regularly pass. They should be able to go home to their families, and everybody they pass should equally always know that the roads are safe. 


One of the best ways to ensure that our roads are safe and our productivity is enhanced is by starting the transition to freight on rail. This is not about taking work away from truck drivers; it is about increasing the productivity of our nation. We can all benefit from safe roads, greater productivity and a transport system that works effectively for all.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (12:12):  I also rise to speak in this debate on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. Can I add to Senator Rhiannon's comments that I do not think she will get an answer from the minister—but it is worth holding out for that, in any event. This government does not want to engage in debate. Quite clearly, in this instance, they have been cruel and particularly unfair. They said that they would be an infrastructure government, but they did not tell the Australian people that it would be done on the back of the lowest and middle-income earners, with savage cuts and higher taxes. They did not say that they would do it by re-announcing all of Labor's infrastructure projects. 


To be fair to the Treasurer—something he is not used to—he does not think this is an unfair budget. In his mind, poor people do not drive cars anyway. He could take the ice bucket challenge, but I think this challenge would be better. I would like him to stand on the M1, with a billboard that has his photo on it—he could also maybe do this on the M5 in peak hour traffic in Sydney or on the Gateway Motorway or the M1 in Brisbane—and tell those hardworking people that they do not need to worry because they do not drive cars anyway. I would ask him to try that challenge and see how he fares. It might be easier to do the bucket of cold water, and that could wake him up to the fact that he is so wrong about these issues. 


The bill amends Labor's Nation Building Program legislation. Labor's Nation Building Program saved the country from the worst of the GFC but, in particular, it did this: it modernised Australia's land transport infrastructure. The government is now determined to tear it up and in its place put only pain and incompetence. This government is really two halves: on one side, they are cruel, mean and heartless, determined to inflict pain on the lowest income earners in the community; on the other side, they are simply incompetent, bumbling around like clowns, a three-ring circus, falling over their own words and tripping themselves up on a budget of broken promises. When you put them together, they make a whole of incompetence and cruel cuts.


Let us look at the incompetence in the budget strategy. First it was a 'budget crisis'. Senator Williams—in this debate—changed the words again; he did not use the words 'budget crisis'. So the government are not clear about what it is. Then it was an emergency. Then it was a problem. But, when 97 per cent of the budget had already passed, they said, 'No problem at all; nothing to see here.' Then, all of a sudden, Mr Barnaby Joyce shot out of the gate and said hospitals and schools would close down if the budget were not passed. Everybody on that side forgot to tell him; again, they forgot to give him the script so that he would get it right! They belatedly wheeled consultants and party hacks into the cabinet room to tell them to tone it down: 'Tone it down. Don't get people excited about your budget crisis,' or your budget emergency or your budget problem, whichever it might be. I am not sure if they got around to discussing it in the party room yesterday. It would have been hard to get a word in, with Senator Macdonald's tirade against Mr Tony Abbott. But I digress, and this is a serious issue. But I wanted to make sure we understood the frame of this debate, where the coalition are at with this debate and, more importantly, how incompetent they are when it comes to reform or following through on reform.


Much of the debate on this bill has centred on the fact that everyone here, I think, believes that we need to continue to improve our roads to have good infrastructure and that that should continue. I think the coalition started out with that premise but lost their way, through being either mean or incompetent—take your pick. The bill relates to roads, rail and intermodal funding by the Commonwealth, and the minister's second reading speech mentioned a dozen major projects that were announced and funded by the previous, federal Labor government. They included the $6.7 billion to upgrade the Bruce Highway—I will say that again: $6.7 billion to upgrade the Bruce Highway—one of the important links across Queensland; $5.6 billion to finish the duplication of the Pacific Highway, which is absolutely necessary; and $1 billion to continue the Gateway Motorway North upgrade in Brisbane. All those projects are about supporting Queensland, Queensland jobs and Queensland infrastructure. In one sense, it is pleasing to see that the coalition did not rip the heart out of that when they got into government; they just re-announced our programs.


What worries me most of all is whether the government will pick up the cost of changing the name of this funding program from the Nation Building Program. The opposition have sought an assurance from Mr Truss that additional Commonwealth expenditure will not be incurred as a result of the name change.


But one of the most difficult issues, and I think Senator Rhiannon picked up on this earlier, is whether, if the government continue with all those funding commitments—including finishing the Gateway WA project in Perth, which I know you, Acting Deputy President Sterle, would be interested in finalising, as well as the $615 million to build the Swan Valley bypass on the Perth to Darwin highway—it is going to be a case of, 'We'll continue this funding but we're going to have to drag money away from somewhere else,' such as the Federal Assistance Grants to local councils and other areas. So is it true that they are going to provide this funding, ultimately?


The government deem it necessary to extend Roads to Recovery. This is, as we know, a very popular program when you go out and talk to local councils; they find it fits their bill. This is a program that Labor funded out to 2018—a total of $1.75 billion fully funded in Labor's budget. The coalition say they support the program. However, if you look at their savage cuts to Financial Assistance Grants in the 2014 budget, the total cut being nearly $1 billion over four years, they appear to have taken with one hand and allowed the remainder to be there. So it is of no comfort to local councils in Queensland. In six years, the indexation freeze on these grants will overwhelm the $350 million allocation made under Roads to Recovery, making support for local government roads a complete mockery. That is where we have ended up with this coalition. 'Tricky and mean' is all you can say about them when it comes to the way they have structured their budget for roads.


On the other hand, if you look at Labor's record—Senator Williams tried to decry what we have done—we doubled the budget to $46.5 billion, upgraded 7,500 kilometres of roads and lifted local government roads grants by 20 per cent. So we have put our bona fides on the table. The local councils out there recognise the hard work that Mr Albanese, from the other place, did as roads minister. They still talk about him reasonably fondly for the work that he did in those regions. He remains committed to assisting local councils to improve their roads and infrastructure.


Let us compare that with the coalition's position. The coalition has committed to the Melbourne East West Link and Sydney's WestConnex projects without cost-benefit analyses in defiance of its own election promises; has shamelessly, as I have said, re-announced Labor's projects, such as the Gateway North in Brisbane and the Bruce and Pacific highway upgrades, claiming they are coalition projects; and has tried to welsh on $500 million on roads spending in WA for the Great Northern Highway and the North West Coastal Highway. They backflipped, and I suspect it was a backflip with half pike. We could give some of the credit for that spending to Senator Sterle, but I think Mr Albanese can take the credit for pushing very hard to secure that backflip with half pike from the coalition. All of this points to the coalition being very tricky and mean when it comes to roads and infrastructure funding.


There are two amendments that we want to make to this bill. I know Senator Sterle has a very deep interest in one, which is the heavy vehicle program. The first amendment seeks to formalise an initiative taken under the former Labor government, a program targeting infrastructure around heavy vehicle driver fatigue and productivity. This program is about ensuring that there are properly funded rest stops along highways to provide more options for drivers to take their break. This highly popular program has funded many initiatives across rural and regional Australia. I ask Senator Williams to support this amendment. If he has an ounce of rural or regional blood in his veins, he will support a program that supports regional truck drivers. I doubt he will, but I will make the bold assertion that he should.


Infrastructure Australia also needs transparency. This government shrouds itself in secrecy. It loves the dark. That is about all you can say about it. It does not want any light on or transparency about what it does. I did not think that I would find a lack of transparency here in road infrastructure. I knew I could find it in the Attorney-General's portfolio and in border command and border protection. They are up-front about it, at least—they simply said, 'I am not going to tell you at all. We will keep it to ourselves. You can go and figure it out yourself.' At least they were up-front about it. At least they told us. I do not agree with their secrecy, I believe that they should have transparency and openness, but in this case who would have thought that you would have secrecy surrounding road infrastructure? But secrecy has found its way in.


Labor wants to ensure that there is full and transparent scrutiny of major project spending. It happened under Labor; why can it not happen under the coalition? They do not want it to. It makes you suspicious instantly, quite frankly. Many stakeholders in the infrastructure debate have called for greater transparency and accountability in how the Commonwealth spends its funds in infrastructure. It makes sense, because people want to have confidence that these billions of dollars being spent on roads are being spent wisely on the areas that require them and in the order that they should be.


Transparency and accountability are anathema to this coalition government. I think they do not like the words. If you were playing word games with them, they would never make those two words no matter how many letters they had to support them. In this instance, this government should take on board this recommendation. This will ensure proper scrutiny before projects are approved. It is about ensuring that we ask the minister to seek the views of the government's expert adviser on infrastructure, Infrastructure Australia. It makes sense. If you are going to spend in this area, why would you not get the expert's evaluation? I think the coalition will not support this amendment, because they love the black. They do not want to have transparency and accountability.


The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill enables the continuation of the Roads to Recovery program after 30 June 2014. It seeks to unify the scheme for funding national land transport network projects. It also seeks to enlarge the scope of the power to fund research, investigation, studies and analysis. Ultimately, the policy area by the coalition is not new—and I think that is the main point we should note in this debate. They have not come up with any new policy position in this debate. They have done what I said they did when I started—they have simply renamed it and exaggerated the impression of a major shift for the media's consumption. They bang the tambourine drum, as you say, but ultimately it is the same tune. Nothing has changed—except the areas I highlighted where I think they are being tricky and mean, and are seeking to rip funding out from this area. Why they hate local councils so much, I am not sure. In opposition, the coalition would praise local councils. They would talk to them continuously. But now when you travel around rural and regional Australia, local councils are feeling like they have been short-changed by the coalition—I think Senator Williams, particularly, has an affinity with rural Australia. I think the coalition have done themselves a huge disservice in this debate, particularly around roads. When you understand that councils rely significantly on this funding stream to ensure that local communities can be well supported with roads, it really makes you reconsider the coalition's position on this—and appeal to local councils to reconsider their position, which has been to support this program under the now coalition government.



One of the areas I would like to go to briefly is that, whilst Labor was rebuilding the road infrastructure network, we also, through Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, rebuilt many roads and other infrastructure out in the community. Like Senator Rhiannon, I would also like some assurances from the coalition that, as part of the way forward, they will not also—as they have done with Roads to Recovery and with the federal grants to local councils—short-change local councils on NDRRA spending. We are a country which suffers from floods. We are a country which has cyclones. These events decimate local areas, particularly roads and infrastructure. and they need to be rebuilt; rebuilt quickly and rebuilt well. When Labor was in government, we did just that. I worked with the Attorney-General and I worked with Mr Albanese, to do just that. What I worry about—and the government could put this beyond doubt—is whether the coalition will continue that hard work to make sure that they do not push the cost onto councils like they have done under FAGs.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (12:32):  I am pleased to make a contribution to this debate on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. As alluded to by Senator Ludwig, the bill seeks to amend the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act in the following areas: continued funding for the Roads to Recovery program, which expired on 30 June 2014—the program will be made ongoing indefinitely, rather than having a set expiry date in the act; the minister will acquire an ongoing power to determine a Roads to Recovery list which is not a disallowable instrument; the distinction between the national network and the off-road projects will be eliminated, and all will be retitled as investment projects; transport research funding criteria will be widened to include research into front-end projects; partnerships and non-corporate Commonwealth entities will be made eligible to apply for research funding; the act will be renamed and 'nation building' references will be taken out; and some spent acts will be repealed.


What does all this mean? We have councils that are saying, 'Roads to Recovery funding needs to come through or we are going to stop important, urgent works', and 'we may have to lay people off'. What this is really all about, in my humble view, is that we have a new government—which in earlier contributions has been labelled 'tricky', 'mean', and 'lacking clarity and transparency'.


If we take, for example, the minister requiring an ongoing power to determine a Roads to Recovery list: previously, the situation was that Infrastructure Australia would have had an open and full consultation. There would have been a complete and transparent economic evaluation of the project. It would have been ranked in the national scheme of projects; it would have had a priority, clear and transparent for all to see. And the nation would have been built to a better and higher standard. But they are not doing that. They are determining what gets funding. They are not doing a clear and transparent economic precis of the requirement for a project, the cost-benefit analysis, what it is going to bring to the nation, or to the economy—they are simply going to do it politically. And there is plenty of evidence of that going on around the country.


Importantly for the coalition, they had to take 'nation building' out of it—because they are not building the nation; they are building where they want to build. They are not building in a coherent, cohesive manner, in accordance with the nation's priorities; they are doing it in accordance with their—dare I say it—electoral priorities. The simple fact that they are taking all funding of rail out of the equation is a very clear indicator that they are not looking at the nation as a whole, or at its needs as a whole.


What I really wanted to do, Mr Acting Deputy President, is go to yours and my—very heartfelt—clear area of some expertise. I think it is really important to have on the record that heavy vehicles are involved in many serious accidents across this country annually; in fact, almost daily. During the 12 months to September 2011—and these are old figures—230 people died from 204 fatal crashes involving heavy vehicles or buses. There is significant evidence linking such accidents with fatigue. Drivers are required to comply with heavy vehicle driver fatigue related legislation which ensures that regular and effective rest breaks are taken during long journeys. According to the National Transport Commission, the size of the heavy vehicle road transport freight task in 2008 was 503 billion tonne-kilometres. This is expected to reach 1,540 billion tonne-kilometres by 2050.


If there is not a clearer indication that we need nation building in our roads, then I do not know where you would look for more compelling evidence. And we have not even talked about the passenger vehicles. We have not talked about the commuters and the millions and millions—probably billions—of kilometres that are done by the travelling public. The whole purpose of investing in our infrastructure is to make the economy work, but it has to work in a safe way. Along with the Hon. Darren Chester, I co-convened the Parliamentary Friends of Road Safety, and there is no clearer indication of the need for investment in rest areas, technology trial projects, parking bays and road enhancement projects than a quick look at the road toll.


Interestingly enough, we have had a very, very successful period—particularly in South Australia, I might say, and a great credit to some very influential and important people like Sir Eric Neal, Roger Cook and the like, who have been involved for many years in reducing the road toll. But we know that there will be improvements in vehicles and, importantly, that there will be improvements in roads. Let us hope that this government does not fall for pork barrelling and make those improvements in roads away from where they can best meet needs—where they can deliver the best result in terms of safety and economic benefit to this nation. We know that these things happen, and they happen with due planning and process. We know very clearly that you cannot portray economic benefit and improvement in safety as red tape, as some in this government are attempting to portray it, like the Hon. Jamie Briggs: 'We'll get rid of red tape; that'll save us.' But it will not save anybody if you get rid of the absolute prudent requirement to plan tasks carefully, to follow them in accordance with the appropriate safeguards, thereby affording every road user the ability to get up and down the road safely, not just the truck drivers but other people. We have had some awful examples in very recent times in Adelaide, such as a continual stretch of road that seems to attract significant road safety catastrophes, with a number of people being killed in recent times.


I note in that debate that the Hon. James Briggs was immediately out there saying: 'We'll spend some money on that; we'll be out there. Whatever you need, we can do something there.' But I do not think that is how the government should run. The government should run on the basis of proper evaluation through the auspices of Infrastructure Australia or the department, do a proper cost-benefit analysis and get the matter addressed that way, not wait for a burning issue and then throw a pot of money at that in an ad hoc matter. We had a nation-building strategy. They are even seeking to remove the name 'nation building'. They do not even like the fact that it had 'nation building' under it. Why that is so offensive to them, I am not sure. But it will not be sufficient for this economy to function effectively and for people to get their right to safe roads—it will not be fair dinkum, if you like—for a government to lack transparency, to put things in the dark. It is very clear that there needs to be investments in rural Australia, and it is very clear that if you live in rural Australia you do not have the many large centres that they have in the city. The argument could be that unless we can weight a bit of funding to regional Australia then all the money will be spent in and around the cities, where the masses of population are, and you can probably do a better business case analysis.


I am not sure that any Australian government has ever been guilty of that. We have built where the need has been demonstrated. If it has been a safety criterion, where there has been a stretch of road that has not been sealed or a stretch of road that has had soft shoulders and has not been upgraded, then all governments have invested that way. So I have the view that getting rid of Infrastructure Australia—getting rid of the independent economic analysis, the measuring of the effect on the productivity of the country and the awareness of safety—is a very retrograde step. And I am not sure—in fact, I will be as blunt as Senator Sterle: I have no confidence that the Hon. James Briggs is a person with enough experience to make some of the judgements he may be called upon to make on a daily basis. Let us hope his department is sufficiently skilled, qualified and able to give him good advice and is able to make sure that that advice sticks, because if we are in the hands of the Hon. James Briggs in terms of economic benefit in the road infrastructure network and in safety in the road infrastructure network, then I would have some concerns. I would think that he may well be taking on a job that is a little beyond him. That is why he should endorse and accept a structure like Infrastructure Australia that does the cost-benefit analysis, does the research, is contestable and stands up on its own. It can be put out there, you can pull it to pieces, you can argue the toss, but experts have come up with a robust model that will, in my view, deliver the right outcome for this nation.


The Hon. Anthony Albanese has been very clear and straightforward on all of this. He saw his task as the transport minister to build infrastructure for the nation. He did not rule in anything and he did not rule out anything. He got the advice, set up the institutions and took action where the evidence was clear and unequivocal to put in place the best thing for the nation. And this government has had to come in and say, 'That doesn't quite suit our priorities.' Our priorities may be different, and I suppose that is fair enough, but you should be able to point to the logic of your argument, the fairness of your argument, the transparency of the argument, the wholeness of it. The first thing this government did was rule out investment in rail. I am sure the founding fathers would have thought that was a bit strange, because I think their first thought was that rail was the way to go. I am no open advocate of—

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2014-08-27,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (12:45):  I would like to speak this morning about the trucking industry and its safety. I do so with some familiarity with the industry. My father-in-law is a truck driver. My uncle is a truck driver. I have seen firsthand how important safety is in that industry. It has a much higher fatality rate than most industries. The trucking industry has about 10 times the average fatality rate of any other industry. It is something that families always live with when they have members of their family in that industry driving long distances. Right now, my father-in-law is somewhere between Wagga Wagga and Lightning Ridge on another long-haul drive.


In the 12 months to March this year, 207 people were unfortunately killed in 180 heavy vehicle accidents. It is a very serious issue. Two years ago this place established a Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal to help try to deal with these issues—the so-called safe rates legislation. At the time I remember thinking, 'I do not exactly know how this is going to deal with safety.' I remember it going through. It was something that was pushed by the Transport Workers Union at the time. They were able to get that up through the then government.


We heard last week at the royal commission how the president of that union, Mr Tony Sheldon, had used money in the McLean Forum and that he had been able to control and leverage those funds to help him control other unions—such as the Health Services Union, the Flight Attendants' Association of Australia and also the Electrical Trades Union—by funding campaigns. That obviously gives him a fair amount of influence over unions in this country. The evidence at the royal commission did seem to say that. But it is not just unions, of course, because when he has control of those unions he also has control of preselection to the Australian Labor Party. If he has control over preselection for the Australian Labor Party, he has control of the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. Unions were able to leverage that influence to get a lot of things out of the former government. We saw a lot of those things go through parliament last year.


One of the things that went through was this safe rates legislation in 2012. We know that they did use that influence because there was a meeting at Kirribilli House in November 2011 between Julia Gillard and union bosses. We know that Mr Ferguson said of that time:


It was another Kirribilli agreement … It was the deathknell for her government. She gave the unions everything they wanted … It was 'lock in behind me and I will deliver for you'.


And she did deliver. She delivered this safe rates legislation, which was simply a sop to the Transport Workers Union. It has not delivered any real benefits for the trucking industry or truckers themselves.


There is no evidence that higher rates of pay lead to more safety. There was an OECD report in 2011 which broke down the causes of heavy vehicle collisions. It reported on the results of an International Road Transport Union study. It showed that about 85 per cent of accidents involving heavy vehicles do not involve driver fault. Only for a quarter of those cases was the heavy vehicle driver at fault. A similar conclusion was reached in the Australian context in a 2003 study, which found that in 82 per cent of motor vehicle accidents involving heavy vehicles the driver of that vehicle was not at fault.


I am not a truck driver; I am an economist. I always felt that, when you increase hourly wages or pay, you increase the supply of labour. You actually encourage people to drive more, not less. The whole reason for the legislation was to try to encourage people to drive less and therefore be safer on the roads. It was an admirable goal. But I did not quite see how those two things were linked, and neither did the regulatory impact statement of the government of the time. The government of the time had to do a regulatory impact statement on this legislation. The regulatory impact statement itself found no link between higher rates of pay and safety. It evaluated two options and they came at a net cost of $44 million in one case and $228.4 million in the other case. There was no evidence for the legislation's establishment.


But establishing the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal has been very good for one group. It has been very good for those people connected to the Transport Workers Union, because there have been seven members appointed to the tribunal and they have done quite well. There is the president, who is the Hon. Jennifer Action. Her husband was Bill Shorten's office manager.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Acton.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Jennifer Acton, sorry. I correct the record, thank you. A former senator of this place and former TWU boss as well, Steve Hutchins, is also on the tribunal. Paul Ryan, who represents an employer body, is also reportedly close to the Transport Workers Union. All of these people are being paid in the order of $95,000 to sit on that tribunal. That is very good. It is good for them. Good on them. But we have had this tribunal in place for two years and, so far, there has not been one remuneration order made by the tribunal that has increased pay for truck drivers.


I know my uncle and father-in-law would love to have increased pay. They would love it. But they have not got any benefits from this remuneration tribunal. The only order the tribunal has made duplicates state based safety regimes—another layer of red tape for employers which makes it harder for them to employ people in the trucking industry. It has not been so much 'safe rates' legislation as 'mate rates' legislation. That is what has happened here. The mates of the union have been able to come in and get lots of largesse from this new body.


I remember when the legislation went through. I remember, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, that you gave a very passionate speech on the night about safety in the trucking industry. I was genuinely moved by it. There were a bunch of people up in the gallery who applauded when the legislation went through. But nothing has changed. What has this body been charged with doing? What is it doing, other than providing jobs for former union members and former Labor senators?


I would like to conclude on a couple of issues from that royal commission. Mr Tony Sheldon made some comments around that royal commission last week about the safe rates legislation, including reporting on a tragic accident that occurred last week when a runaway garbage truck had an accident and unfortunately killed somebody. He said at the time that we need the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal because it is 'one of the few mechanisms available to help enforce safe working conditions for drivers.' He used that tragic accident to try to call for the tribunal to stay. As a matter of fact, the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal does not apply to waste collection services, including garbage trucks. It has nothing to do with that industry. Comcare is the national safety regulator that regulates road safety. It has issued a prohibition notice, but the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal has done nothing in response to this accident. The Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal is not about safety. It is not about remuneration. It is purely about promoting TWU bosses and securing their influence in the Labor Party.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Johnston) to questions without notice asked by Senators Wong, Conroy and Carr today relating to the Australian naval manufacturing industry.


We learnt two things in question time today. Firstly, no-one in this government appears capable of keeping a promise. The second thing we noticed is that the South Australian Liberals are the doormats in the Liberal party room. We know, of course, that the National Party have long been the doormats in the coalition party room. But let's be really clear: there is no advocate on that side of the chamber and on the frontbench prepared to stand up for South Australian jobs. We saw that when it came to Holden and we have seen it again today.


Minister Johnston had a number of occasions today when he could have backed in the promise he made to South Australia on behalf of the coalition prior to the election. I invite Senator Birmingham, who is in the chamber—and I hope he will speak—to reassert the promise that was made in Adelaide before the election. I invite him to say the words, 'We will honour our pre-election commitment.' He has his head down, and I guarantee that he will not recommit the coalition to an election promise that they want to break. That is because it was an election promise they made because of politics only.


The sad thing is that we know how important the shipbuilding industry is to South Australia. We know how important this industry is to Australia. We know how important it is for Australia's manufacturing and technology sector. We know how important it is for jobs, advanced technical engineering skills and cutting-edge manufacturing technologies. All of the coalition appear to have taken the Joe Hockey line on everything: it is always someone else's fault. We hear excuse after excuse from the coalition about this issue. Frankly, the excuses just do not stack up. Rather than go into that, I think it comes back to one simple issue: before the election the then shadow defence minister went down to Adelaide and said, 'The coalition is committed to building 12 new submarines here in Adelaide.' What have we heard since? What have we seen in this and other question times since? We have seen ducking and weaving, preparation for the breaking of yet another promise from a government that seems incapable of keeping any pre-election promise. I would say also that this comes on top of the way this government walked away from the auto industry across the country, which is going to have such devastating effects on the economy of South Australia.




Senator Abetz:
  Huh!




Senator WONG:
  Senator Abetz scoffs! Unlike him, we on this side of the chamber and I suspect across the chamber, apart from those opposite, do not believe that seeing thousands of workers lose their jobs is something simply to be laughed off. We saw the Treasurer on the floor of the House of Representatives goading Holden to leave. Where were the South Australian Liberals? They were all very quiet. In the past there have been some staunch advocates for South Australia on both sides of the parliament. Under the coalition we saw Senator Minchin back Sundowner. We saw Robert Hill. They were staunch advocates for South Australia. Under our government we had advocates for South Australia, ministers at the table who were prepared to stand up for South Australia. Where is Christopher Pyne? Where is Mr Briggs?



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  Where are all the staunch advocates for South Australia? They are sitting quietly, simply allowing this coalition to destroy jobs in Adelaide and to break election promises which go directly to South Australian jobs. Senator Birmingham, if you get up to speak, recommit to the promise and show the people who sent you here that you are not going to break another promise. (Time expired)

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (15:10):  What hypocrisy it is for Senator Wong to stand up here after she presided as Minister for Finance and Deregulation over one of the worst financial periods in Australia's history. Do not come in here with that hypocrisy and allege broken promises by this side. I refer Senator Wong to TheAustralian of 20 August 2007, when Mr Rudd promised:


Federal Labor has promised to extend South Australia's boom in defence work by building a new generation of submarines in Adelaide.




Senator Birmingham:
  Off she goes!




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Senator Wong, you do not want to listen to this? In South Australia, opposition leader Kevin Rudd said—



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator Wong:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. As a matter of courtesy, I will let Senator Birmingham know, as I advised your leader, I do have an appointment now and I am seeking to attend it. If you wish to make a political point why don't you get up to speak.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong,  that is not a point of order.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  We were told that a Labor government would ensure that the submarines were built by ASC at the Port Adelaide site. We were told that production would begin in about 2017, at about the same time that work on the $6 billion air warfare destroyer in Adelaide would also be tapering off. Mr Rudd said:


Starting the process this year will guarantee continuity of work for South Australia's defence industry and those employed in the sector.


It will also provide a big boost to South Australia's growing knowledge and skills base and its reputation as the defence state.


What did you do? You did absolutely nothing, but you come in here with hypocrisy and making assertions of broken promises.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Again I will call the Senate to order. I would ask senators from both sides of the chamber to cease interjecting. Senator Fierravanti-Wells, I also request that you direct your comments to the chair.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  At the time, we were also informed that the Rudd Labor government would make it a priority to ensure that the necessary preliminary work on Australia's next generation of submarines was carried out in time for consideration and initial approval in 2011. 2011 came and went and nothing happened. Mr Rudd asserted at the time:


There is widespread agreement that the Collins Class boats built by ASC in Adelaide are the best conventionally powered submarines in the world and that they provide a vital military capability for Australia.


If that was the case, why did you do absolutely nothing?




Senator Birmingham:
  They must have run out of napkins after the NBN plan.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Yes, absolutely. They ran out of napkins. I remind the Senate, and Senator Carr, who came in and bleated today, that 140,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during the time in which he was the minister. I also remind those opposite that Mitsubishi left South Australia under Labor's watch. So do not come in here as the party that gave us the biggest broken promise of all—that is, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'—and make these assertions.


As the Prime Minister indicated on the weekend—and he wanted to stress this, so I would like to repeat it to those opposite—we will make 'the right decisions for the right reasons'. He said:


Defence acquisitions have to be made on the basis of defence logic; not industry policy, not regional policy, but on the basis of sound defence policy.


He went on to say:


… we have not yet made a final decision on the design and build of the next generation of Australian submarines. But, there will be more of them. The bulk of the Australian work will be done here in Adelaide, and that means more jobs for South Australia … the best way to help South Australia, the best thing that we can do for South Australia, the best thing that any of us can do for any of the great states of this Commonwealth is to build a stronger economy.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:16):  I rise to take note of the answers from Senator Johnston to questions from opposition senators. I think those who are listening to this debate should know that there are no South Australian coalition senators in the room. This is an issue about 12 new submarines that were promised, and now we have a complete reversal of the commitment given by successive governments to defence shipbuilding and submarine building.


I do not want to stand here and say that everything has been perfect, but if you have a glance at the report on the air warfare destroyer program you will see the comments in there going to the heart of Senator Wong's contribution. There have been people on both sides of the chamber committed to building naval hardware, submarines, warfare destroyers and the like. Successive governments accepted that there was a premium on that. There was a 30 per cent premium; it is quantified in the audit report. Successive governments quantified a premium on building this stuff in Australia, developing the capability and developing the workforce, because building your own submarines, your own hardware, to defend this nation is the sensible thing to do. Minchin, Hill and Downer were all great contributors in this space.


But what do we have now? We have a complete absence of anyone in the government articulating for the workforce. We had the minister saying that people in the gallery should have some influence and get people to be more productive. I was on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. I asked the question: is this a case of people taking the wages and not doing the work? The answer came back, 'No, Senator, that is not the case. It is the fact that we have redrawn the work several times.' In some cases the work was redrawn up to six times, and the work had been done three times by the workforce. The productivity of the workforce is not in question. The productivity overall in the scheme is in question, because Spanish designers do not translate into Australian shipbuilders.


There are the same issues with the Collins class submarines. I have spoken to people who work in that area, and the redrawing of the drawings was compounding the cost blowout in every case. Yet these people have the gall to say it is the workforce. Senator Fawcett knows very clearly that it is not the workforce. He is intimately involved with this and understands the issue very well. He is not in the chamber today. Senator Edwards is probably a bit bereft of knowledge in this area. Senator Birmingham and Senator Bernardi are both absent in defending what is a very critical part of the South Australian economy. We want to be the defence state. You can get bipartisan cooperation on this if you invest in it. It has been going on since Robert Hill, Nick Minchin and Downer. They understood that you need to invest.


I am not sure how confidential this is, but in a briefing this morning the Japanese ambassador said, 'We are looking forward to very close cooperation with Australia, particularly in respect of submarines.' What does that do for the workforce there, patiently waiting for someone to get their act together so that they can actually build and deliver 100 per cent on-time, first-class, excellent products? It terrifies those people. They are without a voice in the government. If you look around the other side of the chamber, there are people of independent mind and stature who have taken their own side on the PPL and whatever else they disagree with. Senator Macdonald has been toasting the finance minister at length in committee. He has repeatedly asked questions about the sense of the finance minister's arguments. What do we have here? Not one South Australian making a contribution, other than Senator Birmingham's snide remark about the Leader of the Opposition leaving for an important meeting. That is a shame. They need to be truly embarrassed for themselves. They need to stick up for South Australia and have a go.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-08-27,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:21):  All I can reflect is, 'Thank God the Labor Party didn't put a team into the World Cup soccer.' With three leaders like Senators Wong, Conroy and Carr, they just would have had three home goals. Imagine trying to take on Senator David Johnston when it comes to matters related to Defence, given his obvious knowledge of the answers to the questions. It is a shame that some of you in the gallery did not hear the pathetic questions and Senator Johnston kicking them away as expertly as he did. He was armed with the fact that the recent Minister for Defence under the Labor government—a Western Australian, Mr Stephen Smith—allowed some $23 billion of money to be lost out of the Defence budget under the last Labor government.


It might interest some people listening to this to know that in fact, as a proportion of GDP under Labor, Defence spending got down to figures equivalent to 1938, which was before the Second World War. And here is Senator Wong, who once was the minister for finance of this country, who was the South Australian minister at the time and who had the opportunity to actually set the South Australian shipbuilding industry up for the future. But what did Senator Johnston say about that? In 2008, the opportunity was there to secure this for the future and the then Labor government—led by its Minister for Finance and Deregulation, who was based in South Australia, Senator Wong, who did nothing. They lost the opportunity, they did not take it up and here they are whingeing.


We then come to the questions of Senator Conroy, the minister for the 'no bloody network'—the NBN! I remember in my first weeks in this place asking Senator Conroy where the business case was for the NBN. Of course, there was your usual cynicism and your usual derision, Senator Conroy, saying, 'We do not need a business case for a multi-billion dollar project.' There was no cost-benefit analysis and no risk analysis, because it was all done on the back of a napkin on a VIP flight from Adelaide up to Canberra. What a shame the flight was not from Perth to Canberra, because it is a longer flight, so they might have actually got a few things right!


What Senator Johnston said in answer to Senator Conroy was: 'When they opened the bickie barrel, as a result of winning government from Labor, how much money was there?' What was in the bickie barrel? There was absolutely nothing. Should we be surprised at that from a minister who supposedly ran NBN Co and a minister who proudly came into this place and was able to tell us that he could do so without a business plan, without a cost-benefit analysis and without a risk analysis, when indeed the greatest risk to the NBN is sitting opposite me here: Senator Conroy?


We now come to Senator Kim Carr. I think it was Senator Fierravanti-Wells, in the last few minutes, who said that under his stewardship 140,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in this country. That was under the stewardship of Senator Kim Carr. We had bleating going on about the car industry. Indeed, if I am correct, Mitsubishi left South Australia as a manufacturer under the then federal and, indeed, state Labor governments. Senator Johnston, the minister, was able to give us those such telling figures when it came to the criteria for actual assessment of shipbuilding capacity and the fact that internationally the yardstick is some 60 man-hours per tonne of construction. The Australian government lifted that to 80 as our standard, but what was achieved was a figure of 150.


In the few minutes available to me, I will just quote from Senator Johnston's comments to the Australian Business Defence Industry group only in the last week. This is what he said:


Our local defence industry contributes significantly … for industry to be sustainable there needs to be significant and smart investment from both Government and industry… Under-investment in Defence by the previous Labor Government resulted in a breakdown in Australia’s long term defence planning.


Labor’s 2013 plan out to around 2030 was underfunded by about $30 billion.


… 119 key projects delayed, 43 severely degraded and eight cancelled.


There are the answers for the failures of the then Labor government. (Time expired)

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:27):  I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate today on answers to questions on Defence procurement. Today in question time, Senators Wong, Carr and Conroy asked questions of the Minister for Defence—the hapless and hopeless Senator Johnston—about the future of the Australian submarine project. Questions were asked with the intention of finding out from the minister whether or not he would stick by his commitment, made before the 2013 federal election, that those 12 submarines will be built in my home state of South Australia and by South Australian workers.


We wanted to find out from the minister whether he has changed his mind and is instead going to buy those submarines from Japan. Is he is going to buy those submarines from a foreign country? Will he rule out buying their submarines from Japan? Well, no. He clearly said, 'We will not rule it in and we will not rule it out.' That is no solace for the people of South Australia, who value so much our defence industries and in particular our defence shipbuilding industries.


We witnessed here today the birth of another broken promise from this terrible government. We have seen so many times that the government said one thing before the election—they deceived the people of Australia before the election—and immediately after the election did something completely different. They said that there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education and no cuts to pensions. What are we seeing? Cuts to all of those things. They said there would be no surprises, but there was a surprising new GP tax. Now, it looks like the defence industry is also going to be subject to another massive broken promise by this government.


I will remind you of exactly what the Minister the Defence said before the 2013 election. I printed this off today from his very own ministerial website. He said to the ASC, the Australian Submarine Corporation, in Adelaide on 8 May 2013:


The Coalition today is committed to building 12 new submarines here in Adelaide, we will get that task done, and it is a really important task, not just for the Navy but for the nation. And we are going to see the project through, and put it very close after force protection, as our number priority if we win the next Federal Election.


They did win the next federal election. And what are they doing? They are running away from that commitment to the Australian defence industry, to Australian shipbuilding, to South Australian jobs and to South Australians. When the minister made those statements back in May 2013, the people of South Australia thought quite rightly that the subs would be built in South Australia and that the hundreds of jobs at the Australian Submarine Corporation and the thousands of jobs in South Australia that depends on defence shipbuilding would be safe. Well, the people of South Australia have been well and truly deceived by this minister and this government, because today we heard there are no guarantees about those jobs at all. It was a disgrace that the minister said that in front of workers from the Australian Submarine Corporation and their union representatives, who were here today to hear what the minister would say. He said that he could not give them the guarantees of those jobs—even though his commitment before the federal election was quite clear.


Before the federal election Labor had a clear plan for Australia's naval shipbuilding industry. We were going to build the subs in South Australia and we were going to bring forward the build of the replenishment frigates. The new federal government have also walked away from ensuring that those new frigates are built in South Australia, and they even refuse to allow Australian companies to tender for that work. Those ships will also be built overseas. In that context the minister said that, in his view, it was beyond the capacity of Australia to build those ships. What a disgraceful, insulting thing to say to the workers of South Australia! What is even more insulting about this whole debate is that there is not one South Australian Liberal senator in the Senate chamber defending South Australian defence shipbuilding jobs—not one of them has got up to say anything to defend naval shipbuilding in South Australia. There is no-one here who will get up and say, 'We are going to do what we can to support jobs in South Australia.' They are as bad as their state Liberal colleagues. Where is Steven Marshall in this debate? He stood with David Johnston in May 2013 to say the ships would be built in South Australia and he is nowhere now. (Time expired)

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:40):  I present the explanatory memorandum and I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Mining Subsidies Legislation Amendment (Raising Revenue) Bill 2014 seeks to remove a distortion in the tax system that favours some industries over others by abolishing fossil fuel subsidies (except those used for agricultural purposes) from 1 January 2015.


Supporting mining and fossil fuels puts them at a huge advantage compared to other sectors of the economy.


As a nation we should be investing in higher education, not cutting funding to universities and putting students under even greater pressure. We should be increasing Newstart, not condemning people to poverty, and we should be caring for single parents, not making their lives even more difficult. 


We can do all these things and more, like bringing dental care into Medicare for everyone, by standing up to the big mining companies and big banks and demanding a fairer contribution to the whole community.


This Bill could counter Abbott's cruel budget by saving the cuts made to ABC, SBS, and CSIRO, by freeing up billions of dollars from ending fossil fuel subsidies.


The government is exacerbating global warming by making it cheaper for big mining corporations to extract more coal, oil and gas via special tax treatment for exploration, depreciation and fuel rebates. If mining companies didn't get so much government assistance, then renewable energy would be more competitive.


This Bill will abolish the following fossil fuel subsidies from 1 January 2015:


1. The diesel fuel rebate for the mining industry—since the carbon price repeal, mining companies no longer pay a cent in tax for their fuel, compared to ordinary Australians who pay 38 cents litre.


2. Accelerated asset depreciation for aircraft, the oil and gas industry and vehicles (excepting for those used for agricultural purposes)—instead of the usual practice of depreciating assets such as cars, planes and machinery over their useful life, the mining industry is allowed to claim depreciation over a shorter period. 


3. Immediate deduction for exploration and prospecting expenses for the mining industry—expenditure on exploration and prospecting by the mining industry is immediately deductible for company tax rather than depreciated over time as is the usual practice for investments.


We know that the Abbott government's first budget has not attempted to raise extra revenue in any real way. In fact they have deliberately chosen to reject revenue streams from the big polluters and mining companies, and subsidies continue to be paid to fossil fuel industries. 


Costings from the Parliamentary Budget Office, requested by the Greens, show that removing tax concessions for the big miners would raise close to $13 billion in revenue.


As the Abbott Government dismantles universal healthcare, defunds access to quality public education, strips money from indigenous programs, pushes young people into poverty, saddles students with ever increasing higher education debt, and abandons action on global warming, they are ripping up a safety net and social contract that has been central to safeguarding egalitarianism in this country. 


Along with ensuring that the funding for the above essential services and programs is maintained through the revenue that is raised through this Bill, the savings measures from removing fossil fuel subsidies could also be redirected to prevent the following cuts to research and development, the arts, and the environment:


CSIRO—$111.4 million


ABC—$232.2 over four years


SBS—$8 million


Landcare—$100 million


Australia Council for the Arts—$28.4 million


Screen Australia—$25.1 million


Australian Research Council—$74.9 million


Bureau of Meteorology—$10 million over four years


Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority—$2.8 million


Revenue from a well-constructed mining tax, ending tax breaks to the mining corporations, a millionaires' tax, a public levy on the big banks, and taxing trusts as companies are all responsible measures that would ensure the slash and burn approach adopted by the Abbott government is not needed.


The Greens believe in a safety net that will prevent people from crashing into poverty and homelessness when they are facing difficult circumstances.


Taxpayers shouldn't fork out billions of dollars each year just so the likes of Gina Rinehart can buy cheap diesel, while everyone else is told to tighten their belts. 


I commend the Mining Subsidies Legislation Amendment (Raising Revenue) Bill 2014 to the Senate.

The PRESIDENT:  There being no objection, leave is granted for one minute.




Senator FIFIELD:
  The government is committed to building a world-class mental health system that delivers appropriate services to support people experiencing mental health issues and their families. The National Mental Health Commission is currently undertaking a review of mental health and suicide prevention programs across Australia. The review is looking at whether services are being properly targeted and ensuring that services are not being duplicated or unnecessarily burdened by red tape. As part of this process the commission will assess whether there are any gaps in mental health and suicide prevention and post intervention services, research and workforce development and training, along with considering the particular challenges of providing services in rural, regional and remote Australia.


The review is important to ensure that services are being properly targeted and that funding is going to programs that have proven the most effective. The report referred to in the motion, The hidden toll: suicide in Australia, was produced in mid 2010. The commission is considering a broad range of previous reports along with conducting consultations and receiving submissions as part of the review.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:56):  This motion calls on the Senate but particularly the government to show some leadership rather than the B-grade governance we have seen in recent months and, most especially, during the period of this new Senate. Last session, with respect to leadership, we saw, as we can all understand and still see today, the budget chaos. Indeed, we saw Senate chamber chaos over the two sitting weeks at the end of the last period. We saw evidence of this yesterday in the discussion about the budget. I suppose I am calling this lack of leadership along the path of the Bs. It seemed, yesterday, that we do not talk about the budget anymore. There are not the dorothies about the budget that we saw in the past from government senators, and the government remains quite unclear about what it wants to do about the budget. In fact, some of the characterisations are practically in denial. We do not know whether we have a budget emergency or not. It depends on who you talk to and on what day. 




Senator Johnston:
  You wouldn't know.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Senator Johnston says I would not know. Yesterday we saw ignorance from senior government ministers about the Parliamentary Budget Office and its statement related to the budget. We saw complete ignorance about the likely blow-out of the PPL—the Prime Minister's champion program. We saw ignorance of that. At the last session, and most related to this motion, we saw concern from Senator Brandis for bigots' rights—not a broader concern that one might expect from a competent Attorney-General but a narrow concern with the issues of the rights of bigots. On another side, though, fortunately, we did see a backflip with respect to the National Security Legislation Monitor. This was a very good thing, because if we are going to act competently on national security then we need the provisions and the balance to secure the protections in that system as well. 


During the break we saw some astounding stunts. We saw that Senator Brandis needs to lift his head out of his books for a while and understand exactly what metadata is—and that is probably highlighted by the vote we just saw a moment ago. There is an astounding, surprisingly strong level of support from the Senate for better action with respect to metadata, better transparency and a more competent response. And we saw, of course, Senator Abetz and his need to be more careful in his expressions about breast cancer. 


These were the Bs: we saw the budget chaos; we saw the concerns for bigots' rights; we saw Senator Brandis's fetish with his books, rather than the important issues of the day; and we saw clumsy expressions around important issues to do with breast cancer. I could go on to the Cs; I could talk about Mr Hockey's understanding about who uses cars; or I could talk about the commentary about who should be a future Senate leader. There have been suggestions, similar to my own musings, that Mathias Cormann is starting to show some signs of interest in Senate procedure. The leadership in this place, in recent times, has been astounding. But there are more serious matters for me to address. It is good to see that Senator Smith has arrived for his lengthy contribution to this debate, although I must say I am saddened that his will be the only government contribution to this debate. This government has chosen to hide yet again. They have put their full 20 minutes on to Senator Smith. I hope you are up to that burden—




Senator Smith:
  I am honoured.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  The Australian people have lived with the threatened repeal of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act for far too long. It is time to bring this issue to a head once and for all. The Labor Party's position on 18C is crystal clear. The Labor Party introduced 18C and the Labor Party will fight to retain it. We have campaigned in the streets to protect 18C and we will vote in this parliament to oppose any attempt to weaken the vital protections it contains against the scourge of racist hate speech.


We in the Labor Party believe that 18C is a critical element of Australia's anti-discrimination framework, which has served this country well for 20 years. What does that tell us about our leadership today? This is an area where we had general community consensus for 20 years until we got the Abbott government. Section 18C strengthens the rich fabric of Australia's successful multicultural community, and we cannot afford to risk this. Section 18C appropriately balances freedom of speech with the right of all Australians to live in dignity and free from bigotry —no rights for bigots—and the destructive, divisive effects of racially motivated hate speech. This is our position, and we are proud of it. We have never waivered on it and we never will. Almost two decades of experience have unequivocally demonstrated that this is the right policy for Australia.


The Labor Party is not alone in its support for 18C. In recent months thousands of Australians have rallied behind 18C to affirm their support for tolerance and social cohesion and voiced their opposition to bigotry and hatred. These voices have been heard in the parliament and have powerfully resonated at the highest levels of government. Public opinion polls and, embarrassingly, even statistics released by Senator Brandis's own department clearly show that the vast majority of Australians strongly oppose any moves to water down protections against racist hate speech. The Labor Party's position, as I have said, is crystal clear and the mood of the Australian people is beyond doubt. But, unfortunately, the Liberal Party's position is much more questionable. It is murky, indeed. Senator Brandis and then Opposition Leader Tony Abbott promised Andrew Bolt they would repeal 18C in 2011, after he was found guilty of offending, insulting, humiliating and intimidating 'fair-skinned aborigines'. 


After coming to government, Senator Brandis published an exposure draft of what I will call his 'bigots' charter'. But even at this early stage, the Liberal Party's position on 18C was in flux. Media reports revealed that Senator Brandis had been rolled by his cabinet colleagues, who had doubts about the wisdom of repealing 18C. These reports exposed Senator Brandis's original intentions. We learnt that he originally intended to ram legislation through the parliament without even a hint of public consultation. Embarrassingly, he was smacked down by cabinet and forced to first publish an exposure draft to gauge the extent of community anger—and, boy, have we seen that.


The concern is, though, that Mr Abbott has now decided that that level of community anger cannot be borne at the same time as the level of community anger over the budget. He has described the issues around 18C as having become 'a complication', but the issues involved in 18C are much more than a complication. The Senate and the Australian public at large deserve more respect than that. Mr Abbott tries to close down one front while he deals with the issues around the budget—a weakened government could ill afford further conflict such as the furious reaction that has occurred to the budget. But the Prime Minister has not ruled out proceeding with plans to repeal 18C in the future, if the political environment becomes more favourable. Australians who hoped to have closure on this shameful episode in political history are set to be disappointed. That disappointment has transformed into renewed fear and anger after a group of senators, including the Attorney-General's Liberal Party colleague Senator Bernardi—who we are not hearing from today—announced that he would soon sponsor a private bill to resurrect plans to weaken 18C in favour of their belief in a right to be bigots.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2014-08-27,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (16:06):  I am delighted to have the honour to speak to this particular motion, even though I disagree with it. At the outset I think that—and I think this is a test for future speakers—if the issue is as important to us as many think it is, irrespective of the various positions we come to, then it should be a debate about the issue and we should refrain from the temptation to weave into it a whole range of other issues that are just distractions.


I would have liked to have seen the government maintain its commitment to pursuing a public discussion around the merits of amending section 18C. That was not to be, but I think it demonstrates two things. The first is that, even though my opinion did not take hold or have sway, the government did listen to the opinions of others. I think, in the first instance, that deserves proper consideration. The second is that we should understand more accurately the word 'complication' in its proper context. If the government made a decision that national security interests were best advanced in the absence of other political debates then—even though I might disagree with it, with the limited knowledge that I might have about our national security threats at present—I accept that. The challenge in government is that sometimes you cannot do all the things you want to do at the same time. Sometimes some policies and issues have to take precedence over others. 


We should be calm about the decision that was taken. It does not mean that the debate will go away; it does mean that perhaps people might frame the debate differently in the future. All I can talk about is the experience I had over the last few months speaking about this particular issue to a variety of groups across the community. I was surprised by the level and depth of conviction with which people who had a different view to me prosecuted that view. I thank those people who came to my office here in Canberra, in Perth and across Western Australia to express their point of view. In the debate, important elements of the government's compromise were not well understood. For example, the introduction of a Commonwealth racial vilification mechanism was not understood. I think the mechanism would have been a powerful and positive contribution to our laws, in the same way that I think the removal of some other elements of section 18C would also have been a positive development on our nation's pathway to greater freedom of speech and expression. That was not to be. It does not mean that the debate has ended. It does not mean that we cannot continue to discuss the merits or otherwise of this particular law in the context of our changing community.


I am an Australian optimist. I am confident that Australians can be the best that they can be. It is good to see Senator Peris here. I remember an exchange we had during a take note of answers debate some months ago. Senator Peris talked personally about her experience, and I stood up in this place and I said, 'I don't understand. I don't have the experience that Senator Peris has. I have had my own experiences. I have had my own challenges. But I want us to be the best that we can be.' Bringing unfortunate thoughts and ill-considered statements out of the darkness into the community provides a much better outcome over the longer term. But that was not to be. That is where we are up to. I think it is important that the community continue to debate the merits or otherwise of reform to section 18C. As I said, I am an Australian optimist. I think Australians can be the best they can be. I think when ill-considered, hurtful thoughts are brought out into the open, Australians respond well by challenging those ideas and thoughts. 


Some senators may be familiar with the case of Nilson Dos Santos which came to prominence just last week. Mr Dos Santos, a Brazilian born gentleman seeking employment as a barista in Sydney, was refused a job at the Forbes and Burton cafe in Darlinghurst in Sydney's inner east. According to media reports, Mr Dos Santos was refused a job by the cafe owner, Mr Stephen Hu. Apparently the reason given to Mr Dos Santos was that the cafe's customers 'would not want coffee made by black people'. It was most interesting that, when Mr Hu was contacted by the media to investigate the claim, he did not deny making the remark. Unbelievably, he tried to justify it, at least initially, going on to claim:


… I think the clients here want local people, not African people. 


He also told one media outlet:


… I think the coffee culture is more about white people.


Adding a further twist to this, to my mind, bizarre and unacceptable story, Mr Hu is himself an immigrant to Australia, so his claim is as illogical as it is offensive. But that is not the issue. Once the case was reported, the public reaction was swift and decisive. This was a case of out-and-out racism, pure and simple. It is a great pity that this kind of thing is still happening in contemporary Australia, but nonetheless it has happened and I do not doubt that it will happen again. The incident represents the very worst elements in our society. However, what happened next represents the very best and goes to my point about the need for ideas and commentary that we find ill-considered and offensive to be better put in light than kept in the darkness.


Media reports today indicate that the Forbes and Burton cafe in Darlinghurst is now closed—not open, not vibrant; it is now closed. Whether that is temporary or permanent is yet to emerge, but the appalling racial remarks of the business owner would appear to have cost him his business. I think that is an important point. The cafe doors are closed today, not because the government closed them—there are no police in the doorway; there was no ministerial directive; there was no court order. The Forbes and Burton cafe is closed this afternoon because when its customers—Australians—heard what had happened to Mr Dos Santos, they boycotted the cafe. When they heard about it, Australians made a judgement as to whether these things were acceptable or not—and changed their behaviour in a way that penalised the action. When previously loyal, local customers heard about what had happened, they voted with their feet.


This is what I have said is the right way in which to engage the public discussion that has taken place this year around section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. This section of the act is not needed, to my mind, because its continued presence on the statute books suggests that we in this place have little faith—have no faith—in the fundamental decency of our fellow Australians. I come to this discussion from a simple starting position, which is that Australians are fundamentally decent and possessed of tremendous common sense which, when called upon and when required, they use with great grace and dignity. Australians know racism when they see it or hear it. They know bigotry, homophobia or hatred. But, as I said previously, if I am in a room with a racist, homophobe or bigot, I want to know about it; I do not want it to be hidden from me. And I hope that I, and others, when confronted with that, will rise to the challenge to call it out—not to accept it, not to excuse it, not to politely ignore it, but to call it out. I want those racists, homophobes and bigots to air their views so that their views can be exposed for the unenlightened, misguided, unthinking, hurtful objects that they are. The best way to move forward and have a prosperous free country is to trust Australians with their freedoms.


As we have seen in the case of Mr Dos Santos—who I understand has received more than 20 offers of employment in the past week—where racism and intolerance exist, the community can step up to the challenge. Those in our community can take action and censor the racists themselves—they can censor the racists with their own actions. Australians do not need the heavy hand of the state to tell them right from wrong. My problem with section 18C in its present form is that that is what it suggests they do. Part of living in a free and democratic society involves hearing things that we might disagree with, or that we might find offensive. For example, when I hear Labor MPs accuse the government of wanting to 'give the green light to racism'—which was the shadow Attorney-General's contribution to the earlier debate on section 18C—I was disappointed by that. I was offended by that. No government in this country would ever want to do that. And I challenge those people, both inside this place and outside it, who really think that the motivations of those people who support reform are because they are racist.


I hold some pretty fundamental disagreements with those opposite. But I do not ever for a moment believe that my opponents' views are evil. I just believe that, on many issues, they are wrong. And, like me, over time they might change their views on issues—as I, no doubt, will change my view on issues. It is pleasing, however, that one of the new Labor voices in this place, Senator Bullock, shares views similar to mine and others. In his first speech to the Senate last night, Senator Bullock said the following:


The politically correct place tolerance on a pedestal among virtues but hold that it requires that all sincerely held views—provided that they are not politically incorrect—be held to be equally valid with respect to the holder of them. This is not tolerance but rather a flawed doctrine of moral equivalence. To be tolerant of your views I do not need to pretend that you are just as right as I am but rather to accept that you have a perfect right to hold a view I believe to be wrong, even if I find your view offensive.


Senator Bullock has hit the nail on the head, in my opinion. It is a pity that those of his colleagues who brought this motion appear not to have listened to his contribution. I disagree with Senator Bullock on a great many issues—although I was pleased to hear his reference to the constitutional monarchy in his maiden speech—but I also respect his right to hold his views—to hold them vigorously and to articulate them well; but nonetheless to hold them. And when I disagree with them, I will say so and point out why he is wrong—and I expect others to say so and point out why they think he might be wrong. That is the way this parliament is supposed to work, this is the way the parliament often works and it is the way that our society is supposed to work. Section 18C was a great test for our parliament. For me—who has been in this place only a short while—it was an early demonstration of how, sometimes, very important and necessary debates can find themselves unfortunately hijacked by the politics of the day. But the section 18C debate is not going to go away. To lock ourselves into this idea that there is no better way to deal with these issues is to limit us as a parliament, to limit us as a community and to limit Australian progress.


My great hope is that Australia will be free of scurrilous, unenlightened, misinformed comments—free not because people are scared to make those comments but because we as a community actively challenge them. How many times have people in this place seen or heard something and, rather than stand up and say, 'Excuse me, I do not find that acceptable'—to challenge it in the light—have politely turned the other way or looked down? That is us failing ourselves; it is us failing our freedoms. We can do much better as a country. I do not think we need this type of legislation in its current form to guarantee that freedom. I do think that we can, instead, look beyond ourselves and have debates about these issues, knowing comfortably that Australians will, can and often do rise to the challenge of being a harmonious nation.


It is disappointing that the debate has gone. I accept the reasons for the debate having now passed us, but I have no doubt the debate will come back again in a different form. I do not doubt for a second that it might come back in a form in which it finds support because some of the rough edges of the original proposal will have been cut off and that we might find agreement and progress with some common ground around some amendments that reflect the country we want to be but also provide some of those protections to those who feel a little more vulnerable, who are not yet convinced that we can be the best we can be.


I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to speak on this bill. I do not agree with the motion; I think we can do better. We should always be open to the idea of reform, and I suspect that in coming months in this chamber, this Senate—and I hope in this parliament—the Australian community will again have an opportunity to debate this issue in another form.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2014-08-27,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (16:24):  This issue has been characterised as a debate between freedom of speech on the one hand and the heavy hand of regulation and government censorship on the other. We hear a lot about freedom in this place. We hear constant references to 'the nanny state'. We hear about the curtailment of individual liberties and freedoms. But it has become increasingly clear to me over time that the debate we have about freedom is often couched in very narrow terms. In fact, what we have just heard from the coalition is a very narrow interpretation of freedom, and indeed one that is not shared by the Australian community. This is not just about freedom of speech. It is about the freedom of a young Muslim family to travel on a train without being racially vilified. It is about the freedom of an Aboriginal boy to play football without being insulted on the grounds of race. Freedom is much, much broader than simply being able to express your opinion regardless of the circumstances. It is about freedom to flourish—to grow.


The government does not seem to be concerned about the freedom of individuals who do not want the communication they have with their friends, family, businesses and so on to be under surveillance by the government. The freedom for two people of the same sex to have their love recognised through marriage is an important freedom but one that is ignored. Indeed, what about the freedom of a person in tremendous suffering who wants to be able to choose the way in which they end their life? That is a freedom that does not seem to be important to this government. It appears that freedom is important only when it serves a political agenda. If you have made a promise to your mates at News Corp that you are going to try to kill section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act then freedom is paramount.


The good news here is that the Australian community have made their views very, very clear. In some sense, I welcome the debate we have had. We have seen a response where people have marched, we have seen town hall meetings and we have seen councils right across the country express their views on these changes and on how they see people's freedoms that need to be protected. What it has really done for me is consolidate the view that Australians have a sophisticated view of what freedom is and that sometimes, in order to be able to protect freedom, we need to take collective action. Governments need to pass laws because we recognise that through that collective action we enable individuals to flourish and to grow. That is what freedom is.


The message to the government here is very loud. It has come through very clearly: you have to get out of the echo chamber you are currently in. It is convenient for you at the moment to be in an environment where you are listening to your mates at News Corp or you are listening to the big end of town, where you are getting a very narrow interpretation of what the Australian community believes and wants. And it is why you are in the trouble you are in with your budget at the moment. You have to get out into the community, you have to connect with people and you have to understand that freedom is a much broader, much more generous concept and one that the Australian community have very clearly expressed a view on. They do not want to be in an environment where their kids are going to be subject to racist taunts, to be vilified on the grounds of the countries of their origin, because they know that is a great threat to their kids' freedom to grow, to flourish and to develop. That is what this debate has done. It has consolidated that very clear view that government action collectively—when there is a consensus, as there is around section 18C of the racial vilification legislation—is the best protection against intrusions on freedom.

"Peris, Sen Nova",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (16:29):  I also rise to speak in support of this motion. Thankfully, the proposed ill-conceived changes to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act now rest where they always truly belonged—and that is on the scrap heap. This is a win for all Australians, regardless of background or culture. However, there is a very real concern that it is only a matter of time before the Abbott government will try once again to weaken protections against racism and bigotry.


That is why today we must affirm our support for section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act in its current form. By doing so, we will send a clear message to all Australians that the attempt to water down the Racial Discrimination Act was a huge mistake and should not be repeated. This is about sending a clear message about standing up for what is right. This is about sending clear message to all who have been vilified that we in this house stand with you, not against you. To do otherwise would only confirm that there is still life left in the watering down of the Racial Discrimination Act.


Let me be absolutely clear on this: the weakening of our discrimination laws was never a good idea. The changes should never have been proposed. This was an insult to all Australians. People around the country felt shocked, people were hurt and people were ashamed. These proposed changes were completely unacceptable to Australians the very moment George Brandis admitted right here in the Senate chamber—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order, Senator Peris! You will refer to senators by their correct titles.




Senator PERIS:
  The Attorney-General admitted right here in the Senate that the government were about protecting the rights of bigots. Well, hundreds of thousands of Australians disagreed with that. I believe no-one has a right to be a bigot. I will also take this opportunity to congratulate the thousands of Australians and hundreds of organisations who rose up to speak against these changes. People power has worked. Your voices have been heard in this win for tolerance and respect.


We do ourselves a total disservice if we as elected senators do not take the time to reflect on what message this sent to young Australians at a time when we are trying to stop bullying. What lessons do our children learn when they hear our country's first law officer standing up for bigots? It is not a lesson I would have thought we in this house would be proud to promote. Once again, for the record, let me state that I am not against free speech—not at all. I am against promoting hate speech, which is what these proposed changes were about. As a new senator in this chamber, I am extremely disappointed that we even had to have the debate in the first place.


I remain concerned that the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have not ruled out reintroducing these changes sometime in the future. Senator Smith also made the suggestion that these changes could be reintroduced. I thought about his comment when he talked about bringing racism into the light. The reality is that, when you have been vilified and attacked racially, you remain in the dark. It is very difficult to get out of the dark. This law protects those people.


You do not have to be Indigenous or from one of the many international cultures that make Australia so fantastic to be appalled by what has transpired in this house. You do not have to have been personally subjected to racial abuse to understand why the weakening of these laws signalled a green light to racism. You do not have to have been a victim of hate or have been persecuted based on your race to have been offended and hurt by the proposed changes to the Racial Discrimination Act of the Abbott government.


In contrast to this, I recall attempts from the Attorney-General at the time to defend his previous position when he said:


… we offend and, I dare say, we insult each other every day. That is part of the robustness of the discussion of public issues.


To use this example as a defence signalled that the Attorney-General was drastically incorrect about what these changes would entail. I stand to correct the Attorney-General and say that in this house we do not attack and insult each other every day based on race, religion or cultural heritage.


I implore all of my fellow senators to show their support for section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act in its current form as a sign of standing up for all Australians and moving towards a progressive tomorrow. All Australians, especially young Australians, deserve no less, because we all have a right to be free from discrimination.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-08-27,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (16:34):  I rise to reaffirm the support of the Australian Greens for Australia's Racial Discrimination Act 1975 in its current form. Over the last year, we have seen this federal government intent on weakening the act and removing restrictions on the damaging things people can say and do to other people on the basis of race. But we have also seen a resolute, united response across the Australian community—in all its diversity—and this wonderful response has now convinced the government to back down for the time being. I see that as a fundamental victory for decency in Australia. The Australian Greens are committed to standing with most Australians to keep this crucial piece of legislation intact.


Practically speaking, the much-debated section 18C provides protection from racially motivated hate speech and action—but, of course, this legislation means a great deal more than that. It is really about the kind of community we want to be. Do we want to be a welcoming and inclusive place that accepts and even celebrates our differences or do we want to be a community that is bigoted and divided? The Greens are clear about the kind of country we want to live in, and racially motivated hate speech and action is simply not a part of it.


The Australian community has been very clear too. Having fought off the government's attempts to weaken the Racial Discrimination Act, the Australian community has sent a loud and clear message. The majority of Australians—in letters, emails, petitions and polling and at events and marches—have said, 'It is not okay to be a bigot in modern-day Australia.'


Over the last year, I have met with people from across Australia who have shown me that the Racial Discrimination Act is not just a matter of words on paper. For many people, it is a living law that protects them from degrading and humiliating hate speech and behaviour, from wounding words that attack the very core of who they are—their heritage and their identity—and sometimes on a regular basis. But as well as providing a means of righting a wrong it serves as an important signal from this parliament that this behaviour is not acceptable. Watering down our protections against racially motivated hate speech sends a damaging message to the community—and indeed to the world—that this kind of hate speech is acceptable in Australia. It is not.


While Attorney-General Brandis says we all have the right to be bigots, the rest of the community is making it clear that the Attorney-General does not speak for us. We do not appreciate the government's moves to support and protect conservative commentators like Andrew Bolt and his offensive, insulting, humiliating and intimidating remarks, as they were characterised by a Federal Court judge. I am not sure the Attorney-General expected such a significant public outcry. I am pretty sure he underestimated the way in which the Australian public values the Racial Discrimination Act and the protection it provides for all Australians—no matter who they are or where they have come from. But after receiving more than 5,000 submissions about the changes, most of which would have opposed them, I am sure the Attorney-General now has a better sense of how important this legislation is to so many Australians. I know I have been encouraged by the strength and depth of the community's response to the proposed changes. But we must remain vigilant.


Despite the government's backdown at this point, there are still those who will continue to push for a weakening of the Racial Discrimination Act, including Senator Cory Bernardi, Andrew Bolt, Tim Wilson, the Institute of Public Affairs and the hugely discredited, holocaust-denying Fredrick Toben. New ALP Senator Joe Bullock showed support for changes to the Racial Discrimination Act in his first speech, yesterday. According to media reports this morning, Senator Bullock would


… support lifting the ban on offending, insulting or humiliating people on racial grounds—if given the opportunity.


He may have that opportunity. South Australian Family First Senator Bob Day has vowed to revive the plan in a private senator's bill.


Today I implore every member of this parliament to treat decisions about the Racial Discrimination Act with a great deal of care—for our constituents, for the broader community, for cohesion and inclusivity and for the kind of country we want to be. We must always be asking the question: what kind of country do we want to be? The vast majority of decent Australians have shown that they want to live in a country that is better than bigotry.

"DAY, Sen Bob",FFP,2014-08-27,"



Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (16:40):  Let me start with a quote:


… tolerance is displayed in upholding the right of people to express views with which I disagree. A tolerant society is one prepared to uphold the precious right of free speech, provided such speech does not intimidate or incite the injury of others.


No, it is not JFK, not LBJ, not even FDR but our very own senator from Western Australia JWB—Joseph Warrington Bullock. I could not have said it better myself. I agree that no-one should be obnoxious, that no-one should be rude or insulting or offensive, but should these things be outlawed?


The Australian people own our language, not us. A few moments ago, Senator Smith gave us a real-world example of how things should work, proving the Australian people are the umpires of what is and what is not acceptable. The Australian people have delegated to us the responsibility to protect them from harm, from  intimidation and from incitement to hatred, which can cause others, mobs, to inflict harm—and rightly so. They have not, however, delegated to us the right to decide who should or should not be offended. Regulating for what is essentially the hurt feelings of a reader or a hearer is altogether different to racial vilification and incitement to hatred, which is not in contention. It is not our role to regulate free speech; it is society's.


Freedom of speech is not some niche issue; it is an essential foundation of democracy. I have noticed that Edmund Burke gets quoted a lot in this place. One of the things Mr Burke said was: 'It is the duty of parliamentarians to teach the public that which they do not know.' Removing words like 'offend' and 'insult' from the Racial Discrimination Act is not hate speech. It is not incitement to hatred. Those new Australians who have escaped tyranny and settled here should celebrate the freedom they have to express themselves without being hauled off to court. I would urge senators who have constituents who do not fully understand these things to explain it to them. Teach them that which they do not know. Tell them that they may have found themselves in court in their former country for insulting or offending someone but that that will not happen to them here.


Earlier this month we commemorated 100 years since the commencement of World War I—the Great War. We heard many times of the sacrifice of those who died in the cause of freedom. I did not come to Canberra to defend free speech. I came to help every family to get a job and own a home, but sometimes when you are on a journey something happens along the way that requires you to stop what you are doing and lend a hand. This is one of those occasions. The Racial Discrimination Act cannot be left as it is. It contains a flaw which must be corrected. The words 'offend' and 'insult' must be removed.


I started with a quote from a great Labor figure. Let me conclude with a quote from a great Liberal figure, none other than the founder of the Liberal Party himself, Robert Menzies:


… if truth is to emerge and in the long run be triumphant, the process of free debate - the untrammelled clash of opinion - must go on.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:44):  I speak on this urgency motion in the hope that this whole sad and sorry saga of politicising race relations in Australia has come to an end. Earlier this month the Abbott government faced up to the reality of its own political incompetence when the Prime Minister, overruling his Attorney-General on the latter's signature policy—and one that Senator Brandis had promised to his backers in the Institute of Public Affairs that he would bring through if elected—backed away from introducing changes to the Racial Discrimination Act. This was an abandonment of a reckless and ill-conceived election promise to gut federal protections against racist hate speech that are contained in section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.


These protections have supported and underpinned Australia's multicultural society for more than two decades. The defence of these important protections, and the government backflip on their proposal, was a major victory for people power—for the communities that had organised and spoken up against this assault on the harmony of the nation's diverse cultures. Those community organisations were many and varied. There were groups such as the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, the Arab Council Australia, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the Chinese Australian Forum, the Australian Hellenic Council, the Korean Society of Sydney, the Armenian National Committee of Australia, the Law Council, the Human Rights Commission—it goes on and on.


In announcing the policy backflip, and overruling the blundering Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, the Prime Minister indicated that his government was reversing course because its proposed green light to bigotry was a needless complication in the government's relationship with the Australian Muslim community. The question remains: has this arrogant government abandoned its promise to give the green light to racist hate speech in Australia because it has listened to the vast majority of Australians and now realises that its policy was very much recklessly irresponsible and destructive? Is it because of that, or has the government only reluctantly retreated for the time being from its ideologically blinkered promise because it realised its charter for bigots was exacting too high a political price on a government that is already the most unpopular in living memory?


Let us take a moment to reflect. On 24 March this year, the Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, shocked the Australian public by stepping in to defend the rights of bigots, and backing this with major changes to our laws against racial hate speech. 'People do have the right to be bigots, you know,' he told the Senate. The opposition to such a radical tear in Australia's multicultural fabric came from all over Australia, but included rumblings from within his own side, from his own backbenchers—the member for Hasluck, the member for Reid and even Senator Seselja as well—as from Liberal leaders, such as the then New South Wales Liberal Premier, Barry O'Farrell, and his successor, Premier Mike Baird.


To declare that the rights of bigots are more important than the rights of minorities—minorities who suffer race hate speech on a daily basis in this country—is simply wrong. While more than 150 community groups came out against the legislation, not one pledged their support for it. Instead, Senator Brandis had to look elsewhere to find support. He looked to fringe groups, like the Institute of Public Affairs, and to the man to whom he owed the greatest debt, and to whom he had promised a legislative change in the first place, the well-known right-wing commentator Andrew Bolt. Even further out was the support he received from the notorious holocaust denier Frederick Tobin and the Adelaide Institute.


Senator Brandis had gone so far to the right that even the Prime Minister had to intervene. And what did Senator Brandis say at that moment of backflip when the Prime Minister made a leadership call? He said, 'Well, you know what this business is like. You win a few, you lose a few.' Well, what has Senator Brandis won? He has won nothing in his entire time as Attorney-General. He has won nothing and lost a lot. He has lost a lot of respect. He has lost a lot of credibility, so much so that the Prime Minister himself had to rein him in.


Let's not forget the attempts that Senator Brandis made when he was trying to repeal section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. He made an attack on a very highly credible, highly regarded senior counsel in Arthur Moses when Mr Moses provided advice to then Premier Barry O'Farrell on these proposed changes—advising that they certainly were not something the premier should support. Then, there was Senator Brandis's phone call appointment of the new 'Freedom Commissioner', Tim Wilson, who was appointed to help him with his cause to repeal section 18C. Then, of course, there was Senator Brandis's attempt during Senate estimates to silence entirely the Race Discrimination Commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, from being able to speak on this issue. Well, now what we have seen is Prime Minister Abbott outlining:


I don't want to do anything that puts our national unity at risk at this time and so those proposals are now off the table.


That was his remark, because of his new counter-terrorism proposals that he wanted support for from the Muslim community. It was okay for the Prime Minister to put our national unity at risk before. It was okay before to divide Australians, to give freedom to bigots and to take away the rights of victims of racial abuse. But now that he wants to get his counter-terrorism proposals through, he wants national unity. Now national unity is all of a sudden important to him. When all of a sudden the Prime Minister wants the Muslim community onside, the government backflips on these draconian racial discrimination laws.


What does this mean, then, for the future? The question still remains, and I put it to Senator Brandis: what is it that you want to say to people that you cannot say now under the current legislation? That is really the fundamental question here when it comes to the attempts by this government to make these changes. What is it that you want to say to Aboriginal people in this country that you cannot say under the freedom provisions currently in section 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act? What is it that you want to say to me that you cannot say now under our current racial discrimination laws and the freedom provisions provided within them? Why have you seen it to be so necessary to politicise race relations in this country?


There has been a flawed consultation process in the government trying to make these changes and bring them forward. Nevertheless, that did not stop the community from putting in 5,000 submissions or more, the majority of which were against the changes. The people have won out here with this backflip. The people have won out and our laws remain, which is a good thing for Australia. (Time expired)

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:25):  I present the interim report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee on the comprehensive revision of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and I move:


That the time for the presentation of the final report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee be extended to 29 October 2014.


I took up one of these issues with the Attorney-General during question time earlier this afternoon. Senators will be aware that this is an area that I have had a strong degree of interest in for quite some time. With the support the Labor Party and the crossbenchers last December, we moved a referral to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee on the comprehensive revision of telecommunications interception legislation in Australia—principally the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. 


We are not the first ones to have traversed this ground. The Australian Law Reform Commission and, indeed, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—which canvassed issues that go very strongly to the surveillance regime that prevails in Australia—canvassed the issue in quite detailed studies by people with specialised interest and expertise and recommended that the TIA Act be effectively burnt down and rebuilt from scratch—that it not be amended or tinkered with as it has been on so many occasions since 1979.


In tabling this interim report I want to thank the committee secretariat for their work and I thank all senators who have taken the time to participate. I particularly want to thank the witnesses from ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission—who gave detailed evidence and some private briefings to committee members that we all found immensely valuable. I also thank those from civil society: the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance and others who brought some very different perspectives to the issue of the difficult balance that Australians are having to strike. There are conversations and debates going on right around the world at the moment about exactly where you find the balance between the ability for law enforcement agencies, intelligence agencies and anticorruption agencies to do their job—which on some occasions involves interception and really extreme breaches of privacy of particular people for good reason—and, on the other hand, protecting the privacy of ordinary citizens.


In democracies we are, I think, entitled to expect that we will not be arbitrarily surveilled by government agencies speaking for national security, law enforcement or anything else. The way that this balance has been struck in the past in democracies—in a model that has prevailed for decades and is moderately uncontroversial to this day—is that you go to a judicial authority and get a warrant to chase serious criminal activity or genuine national security threats, targeting individual suspects or devices. In other words, it is not indiscriminate; it is discriminating, it is necessary and it is proportionate. There is that check and balance that is provided in the Australian context by the judiciary or by certain authorised members of the AAT.


I think we have discovered, in particular in evidence that we have taken from the law enforcement and intelligence community, that—to mangle a metaphor—the hurdles are high. The procedural hurdles to get a warrant are moderately high. There is paperwork involved, there is back and forth involved, and there is also transparency involved. The system allows for reporting once a year in the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act annual report that is tabled by the Attorney-General. We can go back and see in aggregate—not in a way that compromises investigations—exactly how many of these things are being applied for, the purpose and the agencies that are doing it. I have some sympathy with those agencies who presented the evidence to us. It is a system that does need streamlining and refining, and that is part of the ongoing work of the committee.


One of the chapters of the annual report—as senators would be well aware because I have spoken on it at great length—covers those intercepts that are not based on a warrant, that have no judicial oversight, that do not necessarily need to target individual people and that do not necessarily have to involve resolution of serious crime or national security threats. That, of course, is the warrantless metadata access.


This is an issue that blew up pretty severely when the National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden took a cache of these documents to Hong Kong and disclosed them to journalists from The Guardian, The Washington Post, The New York Times and others. That effectively blew the lid off the fact that the US NSA was harvesting vast amounts of metadata on US citizens—in what, it has been argued, is an effective breach of the US Constitution by way of illegal search and seizure—and was stockpiling and warehousing massive amounts of this material for access by analysts from an unknown number of agencies, and not only that. In fact, the NSA was scooping up, under a doctrine that has been spoken of in abbreviated form as 'collect it all', content, non-content, everything: financial records, all forms of data and personal material. Everything is just being dumped into these massive data centres in case it happens to be useful later. It is the precise reversal of that balance that has been struck in democracies: discriminate, proportionate and lawful. It is the reverse of that.


In Australia we have a very serious problem, because the T(IA) Act annual report states—and there have been massive increases year on year—that in the last financial year for which there is data there were nearly 320,000 warrantless requests for metadata, not just by ASIO, the AFP, the Crime Commission and those who do such valuable work but by literally dozens of other agencies. When you ask for a list of how many agencies can access this material on a warrantless basis, no-one can tell you, because no-one even knows how many agencies can get it. If we were designing the T(IA) Act now or if these categories of metadata had existed in 1979—categories that allow you to track a mobile phone handset around the landscape, precisely map people's social networks, everyone they have been in contact with and their financial transactions and build these incredibly invasive pictures of social networks and people's lives—of course they would have been included in the warranted regime. That is the balance that now is before Australia and that we need to try to strike.


This issue has been sharpened, obviously, by the introduction of what I believe is the quite dangerous concept of mandatory data retention: that not only should it all be available on a warrantless basis but we should collect it all—the so-called envelopes that our Attorney-General so famously referred to in a memorable interview of a couple of weeks ago. Nothing could be further from the truth. If you have enough metadata, you have content.


I would like to thank my Senate colleagues from all sides of the chamber. I reiterate that one of the aspects of this work that I enjoy the most is when you leave your politics at the door in a committee inquiry, you bring the best evidence forward from right across the spectrum of views, and you actually think hard about how to solve some of these difficult problems. It has been a privilege for me to chair this committee thus far and also to work with Senate colleagues, including people who I have had plenty of dust-ups with in my time in here thus far but who have applied their intelligence and their expertise to asking the right questions and getting the right evidence on the table.


So I thank the Senate for the indulgence. I will table this interim report, which is very brief. I think, on the basis of how fast moving these events are and the fact that we are told the Australian government intends within weeks or perhaps months to put legislation into this place, that the work of the inquiry has probably never been more important than now. The actions of this government and some of its apparent intentions, I think, have sharpened the importance of this work. So I look forward to continuing it. I look forward to continuing the work that the secretary has been doing and that witnesses have been doing to bring the best collective intelligence to bear on these issues. Hopefully, we can come up with some recommendations that may even be cross-party and start to build consensus about how to strike that balance that I think has gone so severely astray in recent years. I thank the chamber.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:34):  Ever so briefly, I want to support Senator Ludlam's motion and the committee's request to extend the date for the consideration of this reference until a time later in the year when the committee is better able to assess some of the issues. As Senator Brandis has spoken about publicly, and indeed in question time today, this is a pretty complex sort of issue relating to telecommunications interception and access. As Senator Brandis has said, the government's intention is to legislate in this general area. Therefore, the committee thought that it was probably a good idea not to table its final report until we actually saw where the government was going and what it intended to do. A lot of the evidence given to the committee did indicate that the government needed to consult further and to explain further, and that appears to be what Senator Brandis was talking about in his public comments and again in question time today.


This committee was chaired by Senator Ludlam, who, as Senator Brandis acknowledged in question time today, has an expertise in this area that I would suggest few other senators share and that I certainly do not share personally. I will not speak for the majority of the committee, but certainly I think there is a general understanding that something needs to be done to protect all Australians from the sorts of criminal and terrorism activities that are around us in the world we live in at the present time. The committee had some discussions with both ASIO and the Australian Crime Commission. I understand—and I think most of the committee understand—that there is an essential need to make sure that our law enforcement agencies are well provisioned to do the task that they are given, which is to protect all Australians. I often make the point that the criminals against whom the Crime Commission and ASIO are fighting do not abide by any rules at all. They have no accountability; they can do what they like. Whereas in our society, perhaps appropriately, the Crime Commission and ASIO are constrained by an enormous number of regulations, laws and accountability provisions that they have to follow to the letter of the law. If they step outside that jurisdiction they get front-page headlines criticising them. They are there to try to protect us and they do it, at times, with one hand tied behind their back. They have constraints that the criminals, the terrorists, never have to bother with. Maybe that is essential in a democracy, but it does mean that we do have to make sure that, within the constraints of accountability, privacy and human rights, we give our agencies the absolute maximum ability to do their job—which is, as I say, to protect all Australians.


The collection of metadata, which was referred to during question time today, and which Senator Ludlam probably referenced in his contribution earlier—I apologise as I did not hear all of it—is something that is a little onerous. Some believe that it does infringe on human rights. Of course, I am not commenting on what the committee might report but simply on this interim report. My understanding is that one of the telecommunication companies that gave evidence—and this is all on the public record—indicated, as Senator Brandis mentioned this morning, that they do collect the metadata and that it is currently available. It really comes down to the question of who pays for the cost of not so much the collection but the storage and the retention of this metadata. As I understand it, in the evidence that was given to us, there are huge warehouses solely to store the enormous amount of metadata that is collected right around the world and even, currently, in Australia. That is a question that the government will have to assess. I think there was a plea by some of the witnesses for the government to consult with them, to take them into their confidence, so that the constraints which those at the coalface may be aware of, which perhaps the public servants who are drafting the legislation may not be, is fully understood by the government as it proceeds with this legislation.


This report, as I understand it, will now be tabled later in the year. If, as has been indicated by Senator Brandis, there is some legislation coming forward, then no doubt that would be referred to the same committee so as to assess the finer details. I would hope that the government and the Attorney-General, in reading the evidence that has been taken so far by this committee, will get a good understanding of some of the issues involved, some of the issues that are of concern, and will take notice of that in drafting the legislation into the future.


I commend to the house Senator Ludlam's motion to adopt this interim report which, in effect, is simply indicating that we will be reporting fully later in the year.


Question agreed to.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-08-27,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:25):  I present the interim report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee on the comprehensive revision of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and I move:


That the time for the presentation of the final report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee be extended to 29 October 2014.


I took up one of these issues with the Attorney-General during question time earlier this afternoon. Senators will be aware that this is an area that I have had a strong degree of interest in for quite some time. With the support the Labor Party and the crossbenchers last December, we moved a referral to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee on the comprehensive revision of telecommunications interception legislation in Australia—principally the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. 


We are not the first ones to have traversed this ground. The Australian Law Reform Commission and, indeed, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—which canvassed issues that go very strongly to the surveillance regime that prevails in Australia—canvassed the issue in quite detailed studies by people with specialised interest and expertise and recommended that the TIA Act be effectively burnt down and rebuilt from scratch—that it not be amended or tinkered with as it has been on so many occasions since 1979.


In tabling this interim report I want to thank the committee secretariat for their work and I thank all senators who have taken the time to participate. I particularly want to thank the witnesses from ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission—who gave detailed evidence and some private briefings to committee members that we all found immensely valuable. I also thank those from civil society: the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance and others who brought some very different perspectives to the issue of the difficult balance that Australians are having to strike. There are conversations and debates going on right around the world at the moment about exactly where you find the balance between the ability for law enforcement agencies, intelligence agencies and anticorruption agencies to do their job—which on some occasions involves interception and really extreme breaches of privacy of particular people for good reason—and, on the other hand, protecting the privacy of ordinary citizens.


In democracies we are, I think, entitled to expect that we will not be arbitrarily surveilled by government agencies speaking for national security, law enforcement or anything else. The way that this balance has been struck in the past in democracies—in a model that has prevailed for decades and is moderately uncontroversial to this day—is that you go to a judicial authority and get a warrant to chase serious criminal activity or genuine national security threats, targeting individual suspects or devices. In other words, it is not indiscriminate; it is discriminating, it is necessary and it is proportionate. There is that check and balance that is provided in the Australian context by the judiciary or by certain authorised members of the AAT.


I think we have discovered, in particular in evidence that we have taken from the law enforcement and intelligence community, that—to mangle a metaphor—the hurdles are high. The procedural hurdles to get a warrant are moderately high. There is paperwork involved, there is back and forth involved, and there is also transparency involved. The system allows for reporting once a year in the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act annual report that is tabled by the Attorney-General. We can go back and see in aggregate—not in a way that compromises investigations—exactly how many of these things are being applied for, the purpose and the agencies that are doing it. I have some sympathy with those agencies who presented the evidence to us. It is a system that does need streamlining and refining, and that is part of the ongoing work of the committee.


One of the chapters of the annual report—as senators would be well aware because I have spoken on it at great length—covers those intercepts that are not based on a warrant, that have no judicial oversight, that do not necessarily need to target individual people and that do not necessarily have to involve resolution of serious crime or national security threats.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:08):  I move:


That the Social Security (Reasonable Excuse - Participation Payment Obligations) (Employment) Determination 2014 (No. 1), made under subsection 42U(1) of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, be disallowed.


This is a disallowance of the Social Security (Reasonable Excuse—Participation Payment Obligations) (Employment) Determination 2014 (No. 1). The opposition is opposed to the social security reasonable excuse legislation that was tabled in the Senate. We have a number of concerns with this issue relating to the discretion acknowledged to exist in determining whether circumstances directly prevent a job seeker from complying with requirements. This concept of 'directly prevent' is a new concept by the government. It is a concept that is really about trying to ensure that an ordinary recipient of Newstart, an ordinary recipient of a payment, is not entitled to have a decent excuse; they are not entitled to actually argue the position before a set of penal provisions are implemented against them. 


A number of factors that the secretary of the department was required to take into account have been removed. Previously, the secretary of the department had to take into account a whole range of issues when a person had a reasonable excuse. When the secretary had to deal with this issue, they had to deal with whether the person had access to safe, secure and adequate housing or was using emergency accommodation or a refuge. I would have thought that would have been a reasonable excuse in terms of a person coming into DHS and arguing their position as to why they could not comply with the legislated obligation. 


The next one was the literacy and language skills of the person. I know that Senator Edwards made a pretty botched-up attempt to copy a Scottish accent, but there are many, many Australians out there who have literacy and language skills that are not sufficient for them to put their arguments on their own, and from time to time they do need support and help when in that position. 


Also, the secretary was required to take into account any illness, impairment or condition of the person that requires treatment, including an illness that is episodic or unpredictable in nature. How many of our poorest Australians or how many of our fellow Australians who are unemployed who are amongst the lowest socioeconomic group in society have illnesses that are a result of their poor economic circumstances or an impairment or condition that requires treatment? Some of them may have been living on the street. Some of them may have addictions. Some of them may have problems that I do not think the coalition could even contemplate some of our fellow Australians having to deal with in their struggle and battle with daily life. 


The secretary was also required to take into account any cognitive or neurological impairment of that person, or any psychiatric or psychological impairment or mental illness of the person. I know from talking to DHS workers that one of the key issues facing many Australians who are on Newstart or who are receiving some payment from government is that they have a psychiatric problem, a psychological impairment or a mental illness. Getting that individual to be able to turn up and actually comply with the obligations on a black-and-white basis of 'If you don't turn up and you don't comply then you are under a penal provision that means you get absolutely no income' is an attack on people who may have a psychological impairment or a mental illness. Similarly, many Australians unfortunately, have a drug or alcohol dependency. 


No-one is saying that these are excuses that can go on forever or that you should not take steps to try and ensure that you comply with your obligations. There has been a flexible position in the past, where DHS personnel look at the specific circumstances of an individual and apply some compassion, some common sense and some reason to the failure of that individual to comply. But what this tabled social security determination means is that you cannot run these arguments and, even if you could, there has to be this higher test of 'directly prevent'—a new concept that is designed to mitigate against some of the poorest people in this country getting access to government payments. 


Another area when deciding whether a person had a reasonable excuse was unforeseen family or caring responsibilities of the person. Many of the people who receive government support are young women with family responsibilities who may have been victims of a violent relationship, and they cannot comply because their kid might be sick—they have no other support around and they need to deal with that issue. Yet, the black-and-white approach that the government is seeking to put in place would mean that person would end up with no payments for eight weeks. A related issue was that the person was subjected to criminal violence, including domestic violence and sexual assault. I would have thought that, if you were a victim of violence or a victim of sexual assault and you could nominate that as the reason you could not comply, then you would have been dealt with in a compassionate, sensible manner.


But for the coalition you have to have this black-and-white approach—an approach that is simply about victimising some of the poorest people in this country and people who need support. Another factor that would have been taken into account in the past was that the person had been adversely affected by the death of an immediate family member or close relative; and another reason was a person's recent imprisonment or release from imprisonment. There was a range of arguments, but what was accepted in the past was not a black-and-white position and not a position based on an ideological attack on the individual—it was a position that needed some sensitivity. It is a complex position and a position that means you have to look at the individual circumstances that people find themselves in. Unfortunately, we have a government who do not seem to care about those issues. We have a government who, through their recent budget, attack the lowest paid and poorest people in this community. We have a government which shows no compassion and no understanding of the real struggles that many Australians face.


The government argues that some of the factors which I have outlined could still be considered in determining what constitutes a reasonable excuse. However, job seekers would have to prove that the circumstances directly prevent them from meeting the requirement and they would have to give prior notice where required by the act under section 42U. The secretary will no longer be required to take the above factors into consideration when deciding whether a job seeker has a reasonable excuse. There are many organisations who deal with some of the most unfortunate Australians in this country on a day-to-day basis—non-government organisations and charities. They end up having to deal with many of these unfortunate Australians as a last resort. They take the view that this determination is unfair and should not be implemented. The National Welfare Rights Network said that, if the changes went ahead, they would mean increased financial hardship for people living on $36 a day and more red tape for thousands of employment service providers. Remember that we are talking about people on $36 a day. For most of us, if we were told we had to survive on $36 a day, we would think that $36 a day would be a sufficient penalty anyway. We are talking about penalising people who are living below the poverty line—people who are battling to put clothes on their back. 


Under this coalition government, people on $36 a day will now be expected to make 40 job applications a week, go out and get transport to and from jobs and present themselves effectively for jobs. Unfortunately, this government does not have a clue what it is like for some of the poorest people in this country and I suppose their budget is exactly the reasoning that they have on how you deal with people who are poor and unemployed. It really does say that this government has got no concern and no compassion.


The National Welfare Rights Network, who deal with these people, say that this determination should not be made. They say that, if employment providers assume responsibility for decisions to deny income support payments for people missing regular appointments, they fear it will fundamentally alter the nature of the relationship with the job seekers. The National Welfare Rights Network and other organisations have to build some compatibility with the individual person; they have to try and counsel the individual person; they have to try to get them ahead in what is a pretty tough situation on $36 a day. They do not want to determine whether someone is given a payment or not, because they have to build up some credibility and some empathy with the individuals. The National Welfare Rights Network has said:


Under these reforms, employment providers will be required to become instant experts on complex social security rules.


That is why you need experts in the Department of Human Services—professionals, face-to-face providers of expertise and advice. The Department of Human Services are under a massive industrial attack by this government, and the workers in DHS are being used as the test bed for Work Choices mark 2. These are the people who are face to face with some of the poorest and most underprivileged people in our community. The National Welfare Rights Network says that it is highly unlikely that the charities will become experts on these complex rules, and it is unrealistic to expect them to do so. What the coalition are putting forward, according to the providers that are being asked to deal with some of this, is unlikely and unrealistic. Jobs Australia Chief Executive David Thompson said:


It represents a significant shift of responsibility from government to contracted providers and is a matter of very grave concern to mission and values centred non-profit services from a moral point of view.


He went on to say:


On a practical level it will make it hard to establish effective helping relationships with the unemployed because job agencies will become the enforcer. This is quite unprecedented.


Jobs Australia are saying this is a moral issue. It is an issue of morality. Why would they be surprised about this coalition government having no morals when it comes to the poor and the most challenged people in our community?


Under the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011, every piece of legislation is scrutinised to ensure compatibility with Australians' human rights. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has taken issue with the government's assessment that the bill is compatible with human rights. This is a real problem for the government, because the cross-party human rights committee says that, based on the information and analysis provided to the committee, it does not consider that the statement of compatibility adequately demonstrates that the proposed amendments are needed for the purpose of meeting a pressing and substantial concern, that there is a rational connection between the measure and the identified objective, and that the measure is reasonable and proportionate for the achievement of that objective. They are basically saying, 'This is not good.' This is not the first time that we have had the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights—where the Liberals, Nationals, Greens and Independents sit down and analyse these bills for human rights—say there is a problem. That is a problem that should be addressed. You can only address that by getting rid of a bill that tramples over the human rights of ordinary and the most vulnerable Australians. 


But what do you expect from the coalition government? There are not too many over the other side who would ever have experienced poverty. They would never understand what it is like not to be able to pay the bills. They would never understand what it is like to be out on the street. They would never understand what it is like for some of the poorest and most vulnerable in this country. The previous legislation that the coalition wanted to trample over was reviewed independently under the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Act, and this is what the review said:


The combination of greater flexibility for providers and a more modulated range of sanctions appears to have led to modest improvements in job seekers’ engagement with providers and to a major reduction in concerns about unduly harsh treatment of vulnerable job seekers. As intended, the system has led to a substantial increase in the number of early, lower-level sanctions and a substantial decrease in the number of higher-level sanctions.


This was the independent review of the Labor legislation. It said, 'Look, it is early, but these are the things that are happening.' It was clear that you cannot have a black-and-white position on dealing with vulnerable Australians. There must be some flexibility. There must be some capacity to look at the circumstances for individuals. This is another set of penal provisions against some of the weakest and most vulnerable Australians, and we are opposing this because we need to stand up for vulnerable Australians. We need to stand up for the weak. It should not be some ideological obsession about dole bludgers that drives legislation, which seems to be the position here. Vulnerable Australians deserve a fair go in this country. (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2014-08-27,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:28):  The Greens will be supporting the motion to disallow this reasonable excuse determination. We do not support this regulation. It is more of the government's attack on the most vulnerable in our country, attempting to blame those that cannot find work, to demonise them, to imply that they do not want to seek work—which seems to be the government's approach from the comments they have made about people without a job sitting at home on the couch collecting their unemployment payments. That simply does not reflect the truth. I have spent a lot of time talking to people who are, unfortunately, unemployed, and I have not met anybody that does not want a job. I am aware of the very large number of Australians who are desperately seeking work—but there are just not enough jobs on the market for everybody. There is a little bit of context here, which is that the previous Liberal government, under Mr Howard, brought in Welfare to Work, and they significantly tightened up the regulations relating to people who are unemployed who are on Newstart—bearing in mind that Newstart forces people to live below the poverty line. They were harsh requirements. Later, the Rudd government did change some of those rules: for the better, we thought; in fact, the Greens thought that they did not go far enough in some instances.


This is an attempt to wind back a more humane approach to how we support and work with the unemployed. The approach of, 'punish, punish, punish', does not incentivise people to find work. People want to find work; in fact, they get significantly depressed about continuing to be blamed for not being able to find work. I mentioned earlier today some of the evidence that was presented to an inquiry into the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill—which is another piece of the government's puzzle, in terms of wanting to put more and more pressure on to those that are looking for work—as well as evidence to the inquiry into the government's other proposed changes to social security legislation——these are the bills that contain about 20 measures, including a measure dumping young people off income support for six months and expecting them to live on thin air. In that particular inquiry, held just last week, we heard evidence about the high number of people who are on the Disability Support Pension, Newstart or youth allowance and who are looking for work. At the moment, there is just no way that there is work for all of those people.


As Senator Cameron was just outlining, this particular regulation winds up the pressure on those people who are looking for work. The explanatory statement to the regulation says that 'the department will implement a policy to clarify that a person should not typically be found to have a reasonable excuse if the circumstances in subsections 6(3) or 6(4) are not present, or if they are present but did not directly prevent the person from meeting the requirement that was the subject of the failure'. That is the bit I think is particularly important: it is 'not directly to prevent the person'—who is going to make that decision? As Jobs Australia has pointed out, that question is causing a great deal of concern for providers, because they are being put in the position of making that call, and putting that information through to the department. I think this is bad policy. Again, the motivation is to seek to demonise job seekers and to imply that they are not genuinely looking for work.


When we consider this regulation, we have to consider it in the context of all the other changes the government is making to social security. I cannot get past this issue: the huge mistake the government is making, or wants to make—hopefully this Senate will not pass this measure—that is, dumping anybody under the age of 30, subject to some exclusions which I will get to in a minute, onto 'nil payment'. It is a really cute term: 'Newstart nil payment'. It means people will still be subject to the rules of Newstart, but they will not get any payment for six months, and then they will go on to Work for the Dole, and then they will go back on to 'nil payment' again. I ask anybody how they could survive for six months on nil payment.


Job seekers will still have to apply for 40 jobs. I know that there has been speculation again in the media today—and Senator Abetz might want to clarify this in his contribution to this debate—that the coalition are rethinking that requirement to apply for 40 jobs. They have actually realised that it is totally unrealistic to require people to find 40 jobs to apply for, and they have realised just what that meant for the community. They misread that. It showed a clear lack of understanding about the sorts of jobs that are out there, about how people apply for jobs, and about what that requirement would actually mean. I keep saying this: they either get it, and they are just being indescribably, outrageously mean and cruel to people under 30, by subjecting them to no income support; or else they are bad policymakers.


Even if they were just looking at this particular measure, that measure in itself is terrible enough. But then we look at this measure—the regulation that we are talking about—in the context of forcing people off Newstart. We know that the evidence shows that when you are subjected to living in poverty—and in this instance they will have no visible means of support—it becomes yet another barrier to employment. Living in poverty means they may not be able to remain in accommodation; they are likely to get sick because they cannot eat—their diet will be inadequate, to say the least; they will be in quite vulnerable circumstances; and it will definitely affect their mental health. They may then, for example, miss applying for 40 jobs, or make some other mistake in their participation—living on nothing is, very clearly, going to affect their ability to participate. And then how will they be able to demonstrate that it does 'not directly prevent the person from meeting the requirement'—to participate—'that was the subject of the failure'? In this instance, that means that they will be put on a no-income support period for even longer. That is just one interaction that I think will have some significant problems. There are also issues around caring, and around single parents being able to find work, now that more of them have been dumped off parenting payment onto Newstart. This also affects parenting payment obligations. We are subjecting job seekers to even greater problems and barriers to finding work.


This is clearly about penalising people. It is not about helping them into work. Again, the cute explanation in the statement of compatibility with human rights for this particular measure talks about article 6 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and recognises the right to work. This includes the right to the opportunity to gain a living by work which a person fully chooses or accepts and is considered an inherent part of human dignity. Then it seeks to justify this by the determination:


… encourages participation payment recipients to engage with their right to work by incentivising those people to actively participate in statutory requirements and mechanisms designed to encourage them to obtain work.


What a lot of nonsense! If I was not in this place I would probably be using more creative language, because this is a pack of nonsense. What an absurd attempt to justify being cruel to job seekers by saying it is 'incentivising those people to actively participate in statutory requirements'. It is a load of codswallop. This is nothing short of the government's continued campaign of harsh, cruel, blaming and demonising treatment of job seekers who want to find work. They face many barriers to work, but they want to find work. We should not be demonising people. We should be helping and truly incentivising people. This is not incentivising. This is cruel and harsh treatment as part of the government's extended campaign to demonise people who are genuinely trying to find work. We will be supporting the disallowance and not supporting this regulatory change.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2014-08-27,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (18:39):  Australia, overall, has a very good welfare system. Australians are relatively pleased with it, and we as a government are seeking to maintain it. But it is vital that our welfare system be retained as a fair and sustainable system. And for it to remain fair and sustainable it has to be robust and it has to be as rort-free as possible.


Before going into what the legislative instrument, or regulation, actually does, allow me to debunk the myths we have just heard from Senators Cameron and Siewert. Senator Cameron's speech reminded me of the Empire State Building: for every story there was a major flaw. Whilst he generated a lot of heat in his contribution, there was not much light. It appears he actually pulled out the wrong speech. Let us just go through a few comments made by Senator Cameron. He talked about the parliament's Human Rights Committee's observations on this regulation. There was no such report. The report to which he referred refers to legislation that is still to come before the parliament, not this regulation. Wrong, wrong, wrong. But isn't it great to be wrong and to then make false accusations about the government and pretend that somehow, by peddling these falsehoods, you have heart, you have compassion, you have a social conscience? He was so concerned about the issues that he actually got the wrong speech and was talking about matters completely and utterly unrelated to this regulation.


He went on to say that job service providers will now have to make these decisions under this regulation—again, false; again, wrong. No: the Department of Human Services officials, under this regulation, will continue to make the decisions. But he said, 'But these professionals in the Department of Human services will be swept aside, and job service providers will have to make decisions they don't want to make.' Guess what? They will not have to. The Department of Human Services continues to make these decisions. Again, Senator Cameron was either clothing himself with complete ignorance when coming into this debate to make his contribution or deliberately seeking to scare the Australian community. Either way, Senator Cameron has done himself and the Australian Labor Party a great disservice.


Some of the comments he made also related to the draft request for tender—nothing to do with this regulation whatsoever. The Department of Human Services will continue to make the decisions. Then the good senator asked, 'What if the person has psychological issues, or he or she has drug and alcohol issues?' It is pretty simple. Have a look at the regulation—if you got that far. I think he was reading other documentation, and that is why we got the confused speech. All this regulation seeks to do is to explain matters to be taken into account in determining whether a person had a reasonable excuse: in clause (4)(i), 'If the person's failure was a result of the person being incapacitated due to illness, injury or disability'. The test further up says, with reference to the reasonable person, that if you suffer from injury or from mental illness then that is covered by the regulation. Every single example, every single story, was completely flawed in Senator Cameron's contribution.


He then asked, 'What about if you have family responsibilities?' It is a pity he did not read clause (4)(iv): 'If the person's failure was a result of the person having unforeseeable and unavoidable caring responsibilities'. It is there, black on white, for anybody who actually does the hard yards of reading the regulation. Anyone wanting to know what is actually in it will be satisfied that everything Senator Cameron said was spoken either in ignorance or with a complete wilfulness to mislead the Australian people. It is there, black on white. Then he asked, 'What about if somebody was the victim of criminal violence or the victim of assault?' I have already gone through if a person's failure is due to being incapacitated by injury. I would have thought that would be a pretty good answer to Senator Cameron's question.


Indeed, the regulation we have before us is designed to ensure that there is some robustness in the system, and every fair-minded Australian would say that that is reasonable. But because Senator Cameron does not want people to think it is reasonable or fair he came out with these extreme examples—each and every one of which is covered in the regulation before us. Indeed, he went as extreme as to ask, 'What if there was a death in the family?' If Senator Cameron had done his homework he would have seen that clause (3)(b) says the matters include:


(b) whether there were exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances beyond the person’s control such that no reasonable person would expect the person to comply with the requirement that resulted in the failure …


I think every Australian listening in to this debate this evening would accept that the professional people in the Department of Human Services would come to the conclusion that a death would be just such a circumstance covered by clause (3)(b). So it really does beg the question: what is it that motivates the harsh, ugly and misleading language used by the Australian Labor Party?


With what the senator said, trying to champion the workers of the Department of Human Services, he is in fact saying that the officials in the Department of Human Services, confronted with a job seeker not reporting because of a death in the family, would say that was not an exceptional or unforeseeable circumstance. Basically what he is saying is that the professional staff would be completely and utterly unreasonable. It is a sad reflection on Senator Cameron that he has such a view of the hardworking people in the Department of Human Services. It is a sad reflection on Senator Cameron and the Australian Labor Party that they do not understand that which is before them, black on white, in relation to this particular regulation. In all of this, Senator Cameron pretends that he is compassionate. There was a lot of passion in what he said, but it was not compassionate, because the passion with which he spoke was conceived in ignorance and born in ignorance. There was simply no truth to that which he was asserting.


Australians are willing to assist their fellow Australians in tough times. In exchange, those Australians who provide that assistance—namely, the taxpayers—do not unreasonably expect that those who are the beneficiaries of their largesse through their taxes will do their very best to do the right thing in all circumstances.


I return to Senator Siewert's comments. Regrettably, I think she may have listened in to the comments of Senator Cameron and then just echoed them. Senator Siewert asked, 'What if you have caring responsibilities?' I have already pointed out that caring is specifically referred to in the regulations. But then she had the audacity to say, 'This is a government that is harsh, cruel and seeking to demonise.' No. It was Senator Siewert's contribution that falsely accused the government of seeking to demonise and acting cruel and harshly in certain circumstances, but her assertions can be absolutely and utterly rebutted by the words of the regulation that is currently before us.


Having debunked the nonsense of Senator Cameron, in particular, and Senator Siewert, I will turn to the positive elements of this regulation.


Debate interrupted.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-08-27,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:08):  I move:


That the Social Security (Reasonable Excuse - Participation Payment Obligations) (Employment) Determination 2014 (No. 1), made under subsection 42U(1) of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, be disallowed.


This is a disallowance of the Social Security (Reasonable Excuse—Participation Payment Obligations) (Employment) Determination 2014 (No. 1). The opposition is opposed to the social security reasonable excuse legislation that was tabled in the Senate. We have a number of concerns with this issue relating to the discretion acknowledged to exist in determining whether circumstances directly prevent a job seeker from complying with requirements. This concept of 'directly prevent' is a new concept by the government. It is a concept that is really about trying to ensure that an ordinary recipient of Newstart, an ordinary recipient of a payment, is not entitled to have a decent excuse; they are not entitled to actually argue the position before a set of penal provisions are implemented against them. 


A number of factors that the secretary of the department was required to take into account have been removed. Previously, the secretary of the department had to take into account a whole range of issues when a person had a reasonable excuse. When the secretary had to deal with this issue, they had to deal with whether the person had access to safe, secure and adequate housing or was using emergency accommodation or a refuge. I would have thought that would have been a reasonable excuse in terms of a person coming into DHS and arguing their position as to why they could not comply with the legislated obligation. 


The next one was the literacy and language skills of the person. I know that Senator Edwards made a pretty botched-up attempt to copy a Scottish accent, but there are many, many Australians out there who have literacy and language skills that are not sufficient for them to put their arguments on their own, and from time to time they do need support and help when in that position. 


Also, the secretary was required to take into account any illness, impairment or condition of the person that requires treatment, including an illness that is episodic or unpredictable in nature. How many of our poorest Australians or how many of our fellow Australians who are unemployed who are amongst the lowest socioeconomic group in society have illnesses that are a result of their poor economic circumstances or an impairment or condition that requires treatment? Some of them may have been living on the street. Some of them may have addictions. Some of them may have problems that I do not think the coalition could even contemplate some of our fellow Australians having to deal with in their struggle and battle with daily life. 


The secretary was also required to take into account any cognitive or neurological impairment of that person, or any psychiatric or psychological impairment or mental illness of the person. I know from talking to DHS workers that one of the key issues facing many Australians who are on Newstart or who are receiving some payment from government is that they have a psychiatric problem, a psychological impairment or a mental illness. Getting that individual to be able to turn up and actually comply with the obligations on a black-and-white basis of 'If you don't turn up and you don't comply then you are under a penal provision that means you get absolutely no income' is an attack on people who may have a psychological impairment or a mental illness. Similarly, many Australians unfortunately, have a drug or alcohol dependency. 


No-one is saying that these are excuses that can go on forever or that you should not take steps to try and ensure that you comply with your obligations. There has been a flexible position in the past, where DHS personnel look at the specific circumstances of an individual and apply some compassion, some common sense and some reason to the failure of that individual to comply. But what this tabled social security determination means is that you cannot run these arguments and, even if you could, there has to be this higher test of 'directly prevent'—a new concept that is designed to mitigate against some of the poorest people in this country getting access to government payments. 


Another area when deciding whether a person had a reasonable excuse was unforeseen family or caring responsibilities of the person. Many of the people who receive government support are young women with family responsibilities who may have been victims of a violent relationship, and they cannot comply because their kid might be sick—they have no other support around and they need to deal with that issue. Yet, the black-and-white approach that the government is seeking to put in place would mean that person would end up with no payments for eight weeks. A related issue was that the person was subjected to criminal violence, including domestic violence and sexual assault. I would have thought that, if you were a victim of violence or a victim of sexual assault and you could nominate that as the reason you could not comply, then you would have been dealt with in a compassionate, sensible manner.


But for the coalition you have to have this black-and-white approach—an approach that is simply about victimising some of the poorest people in this country and people who need support. Another factor that would have been taken into account in the past was that the person had been adversely affected by the death of an immediate family member or close relative; and another reason was a person's recent imprisonment or release from imprisonment. There was a range of arguments, but what was accepted in the past was not a black-and-white position and not a position based on an ideological attack on the individual—it was a position that needed some sensitivity. It is a complex position and a position that means you have to look at the individual circumstances that people find themselves in. Unfortunately, we have a government who do not seem to care about those issues. We have a government who, through their recent budget, attack the lowest paid and poorest people in this community. We have a government which shows no compassion and no understanding of the real struggles that many Australians face.


The government argues that some of the factors which I have outlined could still be considered in determining what constitutes a reasonable excuse. However, job seekers would have to prove that the circumstances directly prevent them from meeting the requirement and they would have to give prior notice where required by the act under section 42U. The secretary will no longer be required to take the above factors into consideration when deciding whether a job seeker has a reasonable excuse. There are many organisations who deal with some of the most unfortunate Australians in this country on a day-to-day basis—non-government organisations and charities. They end up having to deal with many of these unfortunate Australians as a last resort. They take the view that this determination is unfair and should not be implemented. The National Welfare Rights Network said that, if the changes went ahead, they would mean increased financial hardship for people living on $36 a day and more red tape for thousands of employment service providers. Remember that we are talking about people on $36 a day. For most of us, if we were told we had to survive on $36 a day, we would think that $36 a day would be a sufficient penalty anyway. We are talking about penalising people who are living below the poverty line—people who are battling to put clothes on their back. 


Under this coalition government, people on $36 a day will now be expected to make 40 job applications a week, go out and get transport to and from jobs and present themselves effectively for jobs. Unfortunately, this government does not have a clue what it is like for some of the poorest people in this country and I suppose their budget is exactly the reasoning that they have on how you deal with people who are poor and unemployed. It really does say that this government has got no concern and no compassion.


The National Welfare Rights Network, who deal with these people, say that this determination should not be made. They say that, if employment providers assume responsibility for decisions to deny income support payments for people missing regular appointments, they fear it will fundamentally alter the nature of the relationship with the job seekers. The National Welfare Rights Network and other organisations have to build some compatibility with the individual person; they have to try and counsel the individual person; they have to try to get them ahead in what is a pretty tough situation on $36 a day. They do not want to determine whether someone is given a payment or not, because they have to build up some credibility and some empathy with the individuals. The National Welfare Rights Network has said:


Under these reforms, employment providers will be required to become instant experts on complex social security rules.


That is why you need experts in the Department of Human Services—professionals, face-to-face providers of expertise and advice. The Department of Human Services are under a massive industrial attack by this government, and the workers in DHS are being used as the test bed for Work Choices mark 2. These are the people who are face to face with some of the poorest and most underprivileged people in our community. The National Welfare Rights Network says that it is highly unlikely that the charities will become experts on these complex rules, and it is unrealistic to expect them to do so. What the coalition are putting forward, according to the providers that are being asked to deal with some of this, is unlikely and unrealistic. Jobs Australia Chief Executive David Thompson said:


It represents a significant shift of responsibility from government to contracted providers and is a matter of very grave concern to mission and values centred non-profit services from a moral point of view.


He went on to say:


On a practical level it will make it hard to establish effective helping relationships with the unemployed because job agencies will become the enforcer. This is quite unprecedented.


Jobs Australia are saying this is a moral issue. It is an issue of morality. Why would they be surprised about this coalition government having no morals when it comes to the poor and the most challenged people in our community?


Under the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011, every piece of legislation is scrutinised to ensure compatibility with Australians' human rights.

They are basically saying, 'This is not good.' This is not the first time that we have had the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights—where the Liberals, Nationals, Greens and Independents sit down and analyse these bills for human rights—say there is a problem. That is a problem that should be addressed. You can only address that by getting rid of a bill that tramples over the human rights of ordinary and the most vulnerable Australians.

It means people will still be subject to the rules of Newstart, but they will not get any payment for six months, and then they will go on to Work for the Dole, and then they will go back on to 'nil payment' again. I ask anybody how they could survive for six months on nil payment.


Job seekers will still have to apply for 40 jobs. I know that there has been speculation again in the media today—and Senator Abetz might want to clarify this in his contribution to this debate—that the coalition are rethinking that requirement to apply for 40 jobs. They have actually realised that it is totally unrealistic to require people to find 40 jobs to apply for, and they have realised just what that meant for the community. They misread that. It showed a clear lack of understanding about the sorts of jobs that are out there, about how people apply for jobs, and about what that requirement would actually mean. I keep saying this: they either get it, and they are just being indescribably, outrageously mean and cruel to people under 30, by subjecting them to no income support; or else they are bad policymakers.


Even if they were just looking at this particular measure, that measure in itself is terrible enough. But then we look at this measure—the regulation that we are talking about—in the context of forcing people off Newstart. We know that the evidence shows that when you are subjected to living in poverty—and in this instance they will have no visible means of support—it becomes yet another barrier to employment. Living in poverty means they may not be able to remain in accommodation; they are likely to get sick because they cannot eat—their diet will be inadequate, to say the least; they will be in quite vulnerable circumstances; and it will definitely affect their mental health. They may then, for example, miss applying for 40 jobs, or make some other mistake in their participation—living on nothing is, very clearly, going to affect their ability to participate. And then how will they be able to demonstrate that it does 'not directly prevent the person from meeting the requirement'—to participate—'that was the subject of the failure'? In this instance, that means that they will be put on a no-income support period for even longer. That is just one interaction that I think will have some significant problems. There are also issues around caring, and around single parents being able to find work, now that more of them have been dumped off parenting payment onto Newstart. This also affects parenting payment obligations. We are subjecting job seekers to even greater problems and barriers to finding work.


This is clearly about penalising people. It is not about helping them into work. Again, the cute explanation in the statement of compatibility with human rights for this particular measure talks about article 6 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and recognises the right to work. This includes the right to the opportunity to gain a living by work which a person fully chooses or accepts and is considered an inherent part of human dignity. Then it seeks to justify this by the determination:


… encourages participation payment recipients to engage with their right to work by incentivising those people to actively participate in statutory requirements and mechanisms designed to encourage them to obtain work.


What a lot of nonsense! If I was not in this place I would probably be using more creative language, because this is a pack of nonsense. What an absurd attempt to justify being cruel to job seekers by saying it is 'incentivising those people to actively participate in statutory requirements'. It is a load of codswallop. This is nothing short of the government's continued campaign of harsh, cruel, blaming and demonising treatment of job seekers who want to find work. They face many barriers to work, but they want to find work. We should not be demonising people. We should be helping and truly incentivising people. This is not incentivising. This is cruel and harsh treatment as part of the government's extended campaign to demonise people who are genuinely trying to find work. We will be supporting the disallowance and not supporting this regulatory change.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (18:39):  Australia, overall, has a very good welfare system. Australians are relatively pleased with it, and we as a government are seeking to maintain it. But it is vital that our welfare system be retained as a fair and sustainable system. And for it to remain fair and sustainable it has to be robust and it has to be as rort-free as possible.


Before going into what the legislative instrument, or regulation, actually does, allow me to debunk the myths we have just heard from Senators Cameron and Siewert. Senator Cameron's speech reminded me of the Empire State Building: for every story there was a major flaw. Whilst he generated a lot of heat in his contribution, there was not much light. It appears he actually pulled out the wrong speech. Let us just go through a few comments made by Senator Cameron. He talked about the parliament's Human Rights Committee's observations on this regulation. There was no such report. The report to which he referred refers to legislation that is still to come before the parliament, not this regulation. Wrong, wrong, wrong. But isn't it great to be wrong and to then make false accusations about the government and pretend that somehow, by peddling these falsehoods, you have heart, you have compassion, you have a social conscience? He was so concerned about the issues that he actually got the wrong speech and was talking about matters completely and utterly unrelated to this regulation.


He went on to say that job service providers will now have to make these decisions under this regulation—again, false; again, wrong. No: the Department of Human Services officials, under this regulation, will continue to make the decisions. But he said, 'But these professionals in the Department of Human services will be swept aside, and job service providers will have to make decisions they don't want to make.' Guess what? They will not have to. The Department of Human Services continues to make these decisions. Again, Senator Cameron was either clothing himself with complete ignorance when coming into this debate to make his contribution or deliberately seeking to scare the Australian community. Either way, Senator Cameron has done himself and the Australian Labor Party a great disservice.


Some of the comments he made also related to the draft request for tender—nothing to do with this regulation whatsoever. The Department of Human Services will continue to make the decisions. Then the good senator asked, 'What if the person has psychological issues, or he or she has drug and alcohol issues?' It is pretty simple. Have a look at the regulation—if you got that far. I think he was reading other documentation, and that is why we got the confused speech. All this regulation seeks to do is to explain matters to be taken into account in determining whether a person had a reasonable excuse: in clause (4)(i), 'If the person's failure was a result of the person being incapacitated due to illness, injury or disability'. The test further up says, with reference to the reasonable person, that if you suffer from injury or from mental illness then that is covered by the regulation. Every single example, every single story, was completely flawed in Senator Cameron's contribution.


He then asked, 'What about if you have family responsibilities?' It is a pity he did not read clause (4)(iv): 'If the person's failure was a result of the person having unforeseeable and unavoidable caring responsibilities'. It is there, black on white, for anybody who actually does the hard yards of reading the regulation. Anyone wanting to know what is actually in it will be satisfied that everything Senator Cameron said was spoken either in ignorance or with a complete wilfulness to mislead the Australian people. It is there, black on white. Then he asked, 'What about if somebody was the victim of criminal violence or the victim of assault?' I have already gone through if a person's failure is due to being incapacitated by injury. I would have thought that would be a pretty good answer to Senator Cameron's question.


Indeed, the regulation we have before us is designed to ensure that there is some robustness in the system, and every fair-minded Australian would say that that is reasonable. But because Senator Cameron does not want people to think it is reasonable or fair he came out with these extreme examples—each and every one of which is covered in the regulation before us. Indeed, he went as extreme as to ask, 'What if there was a death in the family?' If Senator Cameron had done his homework he would have seen that clause (3)(b) says the matters include:


(b) whether there were exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances beyond the person’s control such that no reasonable person would expect the person to comply with the requirement that resulted in the failure …


I think every Australian listening in to this debate this evening would accept that the professional people in the Department of Human Services would come to the conclusion that a death would be just such a circumstance covered by clause (3)(b). So it really does beg the question: what is it that motivates the harsh, ugly and misleading language used by the Australian Labor Party?


With what the senator said, trying to champion the workers of the Department of Human Services, he is in fact saying that the officials in the Department of Human Services, confronted with a job seeker not reporting because of a death in the family, would say that was not an exceptional or unforeseeable circumstance. Basically what he is saying is that the professional staff would be completely and utterly unreasonable. It is a sad reflection on Senator Cameron that he has such a view of the hardworking people in the Department of Human Services. It is a sad reflection on Senator Cameron and the Australian Labor Party that they do not understand that which is before them, black on white, in relation to this particular regulation. In all of this, Senator Cameron pretends that he is compassionate. There was a lot of passion in what he said, but it was not compassionate, because the passion with which he spoke was conceived in ignorance and born in ignorance. There was simply no truth to that which he was asserting.


Australians are willing to assist their fellow Australians in tough times. In exchange, those Australians who provide that assistance—namely, the taxpayers—do not unreasonably expect that those who are the beneficiaries of their largesse through their taxes will do their very best to do the right thing in all circumstances.


I return to Senator Siewert's comments. Regrettably, I think she may have listened in to the comments of Senator Cameron and then just echoed them. Senator Siewert asked, 'What if you have caring responsibilities?' I have already pointed out that caring is specifically referred to in the regulations. But then she had the audacity to say, 'This is a government that is harsh, cruel and seeking to demonise.' No. It was Senator Siewert's contribution that falsely accused the government of seeking to demonise and acting cruel and harshly in certain circumstances, but her assertions can be absolutely and utterly rebutted by the words of the regulation that is currently before us.


Having debunked the nonsense of Senator Cameron, in particular, and Senator Siewert, I will turn to the positive elements of this regulation.


Debate interrupted.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (18:52):  In recent times, the people of Tasmania elected the Will Hodgman government. Tomorrow it will be delivering a state budget which seeks to repair the damage occasioned to that state and her people over the previous 16 years of Labor government, maladministration and destruction of its economy. What the Labor-Green government, in particular, left as a legacy to the people of Tasmania was an economy that on all the CommSec economic indicators was at the very, very bottom, except for one—that was the unemployment rate, where Tasmania, regrettably, topped the scales.


It was a shameful outcome. After 16 years, over 1½ decades, of Labor rule and, part of it, Labor-Greens rule, we saw what Labor governments do to an economy and, more importantly, to the people. Part of the disastrous Labor-Greens government, especially in more recent years, was what it did to the forestry sector in my home state of Tasmania. Through a so-called intergovernmental agreement, a so-called peace deal, which the people rejected overwhelmingly at the election in March, the Labor-Greens legacy was the destruction of livelihoods and communities from Triabunna to Zeehan and townships in between and people suffering in a manner that was completely and utterly unconscionable. The good news is that things are turning around in my home state of Tasmania and, what is more good news, I now see Senator McKenzie in the chamber. I will defer to her.
