"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-11-29,"—I rise today to speak to the new business tax system legislation, the first tranche of legislation for the government's business tax proposals.
Labor has supported the concept of business tax reform since the debate commenced. We have also sought a bipartisan outcome. We said we would have a review process before the election if we won. In that spirit, we supported the Ralph process that the government set in motion. The final report was issued at the end of July, and then the government took over the process.
We did not get a full response. We got a stage one announcement on 21 September. This left a $3.8 billion funding hole. Then, on 11 November, we got the stage two announcements which could only be regarded as in-principle announcements at that stage.
Now, Labor has forced the government to commit to fully implementing these proposals. There can be no backsliding, no welching, no giving in to the vested interests. The anti-avoidance measures have to be implemented, lock, stock and barrel. In addition, an important new anti-avoidance measure is being brought forward by the government. That is one dealing with income conversion schemes. I will return to this at a later part of the debate.
Labor supports the small business measures in the package before us today. These will ensure that small business is not adversely impacted on by the capital allowance changes. In effect, small business is insulated from many of the measures that ensure that the package will be revenue neutral. Of course, they will not be exempt from the integrity measures in this legislation. These are necessary to secure the future revenue base and rightly apply to all taxpayers, whether large or small.
Labor supports a lower company rate as long as it is fully funded. We especially support CGT reform in the area of venture capital. We welcome the government coming on board in this area. Labor went to the last election with a similar initiative to attract venture capital into Australia. The government rubbished it, but now they have picked it up. All parties to the debate agree that the package has to be revenue neutral. Revenue neutrality means that the package has to pay for itself. It means that any dollars forgone through a lower company rate have to be made up through increases in collections from other areas—by increasing the base, for example, through clamping down on tax avoidance and through removing other legitimate concessions such as capital allowances.
The reason that the package has to pay for itself is simple—the GST. Labor said that if the GST did not pass, business did not have to meet the revenue neutrality test. Since the GST is now a reality, this package has to meet that test. This is something that all parties have signed up to. Labor will not be compromising on this issue, nor can the government.  
The Timor commitment further reinforces the necessity for the package to pay for itself. Labor has secured this commitment from the Treasurer. We had much evidence before the Senate committee from Treasury and from John Ralph saying that the figures used in the Ralph committee report and the government's official announcements were conservative—that is, they believed that the package would actually generate net revenue when implemented. Nobody can be precise about such things, but there is much opinion by practitioners and others that the savings generated by some of the anti-avoidance measures will dramatically understate the actual receipts.
I would now like to contrast this approach with that of the Democrats and the GST. The reason the GST has become such a dog's breakfast for Australian business is the way the government went about it: a dirty deal with the Democrats built on the foundations of overblown rhetoric.
—One thousand amendments.
—That is right, Senator Sherry, 1,000 amendments. That dud deal has now come home to roost with the budget forecast to slip into deficit, built on the back of a $20 billion cost to the budget bottom line over three to four years. That is right: the GST will cost this country $20 billion in forgone revenue. This compares with the business tax package which will be, on balance, over time, revenue neutral. Unlike the Democrats, the Labor Party was not willing to support tax reform at any cost—$20 billion cost versus revenue neutrality. That is the great difference between our support for business tax reform and the Democrats' support for the GST.
Former senator Peter Walsh described the Democrats as the fairies at the bottom of the garden, and we know that they proved themselves to be that in their negotiations with the government over the GST. Despite holding in effect four aces to the government's pair, the Democrats folded and settled for the tea party and a tax package that did not pay for itself. I still remember Senator Lees's famous words: `We got more from this government in 13 hours of negotiations than we got from 
 Labor in 13 years.' What exactly did Senator Lees and the Democrats get? She has got over 1,000 amendments to a package that has not even started yet. She has got a predicted inflation rate of 5.25 per cent when the government told her it would be 1.9 per cent. And she has quite happily allowed the million dollar tax rate for casino high rollers to be passed by doing the chicken run out the Senate doors. What about the GST-free books? She lost that. What about assistance for charities? She lost that as well. What about a tough GST anti-avoidance regime? She gave in to the government on that as well.
We are also now starting to see the real impact of the GST. Insurance premiums are going up by more than the government told us they would, but what is Senator Lees doing about it? Nothing of course. The airlines have told us that prices are going up by 7.5 per cent when the government told us they should rise by no more than 0.8 per cent. And what was the government's response? Mr Fahey, the Acting Treasurer at the time, stated that at least they were not going up by the full 10 per cent. That is okay then. And what have Senator Lees and the Democrats done about that? Nothing of course, because as long as those casino high rollers get their tax breaks, that is where the Democrats' priorities now lie.
The Prime Minister announced last week a new tax to partially fill the hole that has been created through this GST deal with the Democrats. After not coming clean in the parliament last week, the Prime Minister admitted on the 7.30 Report that the GST caused the budget black hole and hence forced the imposition of the new tax. The dirty deal with the Democrats has led to this situation—nothing else. Not only is the GST unfair but Labor's criticism that the package was highly fiscally irresponsible has also been borne out. Australian businesses now will not face the same problems with the business tax reform as long as the government keeps its side of the bargain. Labor has repeatedly, for many months, called for bipartisanship on business tax reform. The government has finally conceded the importance of such an approach. 
 Business needs the certainty in its tax arrangements that goes beyond one electoral cycle—and that can only be achieved through support by the only two parties that can form a government.
I will now turn to some of the myths about the capital gains tax arguments. The effective rate of capital gains tax has not, as has been claimed, been halved by this package. It has been altered but it certainly has not been halved. As the Ralph report and the government have said, there will be some circumstances where the rate of tax on gains made in the future will actually increase, not decrease. There will be circumstances where the rate of tax decreases. The reason for this is that we are moving to a nominal system of assessing capital gains. Previously it was possible to make a capital gain but to pay no tax on it. This arose because of the indexation provisions, which kept that amount relating to inflation out of the capital gains tax base, or because of the design of the averaging provisions.
As the interim Ralph report, called A platform for consultation, noted at page 308, there has been significant abuse of the averaging provisions. This occurred through taxpayers effectively obtaining multiple tax-free thresholds by ensuring that they only earned capital gains. This meant that wealthy taxpayers could earn more than $25,000 per family member and pay no tax—a very unfair situation compared with a family earning the same amount of income through the PAYE system. That huge anomaly is being addressed. These taxpayers, these avoiders, will now face significantly higher taxation on these capital gains.
There are also a variety of important integrity measures concerning capital gains tax in these bills. The provisions concerning value shifting and multiple loss creation are also important initiatives which improve the integrity of the capital gains tax base. They attack avoidance and abuse and will contribute to a stronger, surer revenue base into the future.
The other area of capital gains tax avoidance which needs comment is the incentive for schemes to convert income into capital. 
 There was excitement in the tax planning industry when the government made its initial announcements. There were lots of people going public about the schemes they were already starting to devise to avoid the new tax. This was a genuine threat to the revenue neutrality of the package. If this behaviour was allowed to flourish there was a genuine threat to the revenue base into the future. What we would have seen would have been a return to the pre-1985 system where, if you were wealthy and smart, you were able to design your tax structures so that you paid almost no income tax so, as usual, the better off would have had an opportunity to benefit at the expense of the hard working battlers who pay their tax and contribute to our society.
That is why Labor fought for, and won, the strong new general anti-avoidance provisions which will be inserted into the legislation during the committee stage of this debate. This new measure will ensure that the Australian Commissioner of Taxation has the undoubted power to attack schemes which seek to convert income to capital gains—no return to the pre-1985 system, no return to taxation being optional for the rich. This is an important victory in Labor's war against tax avoidance. This is a necessary tool in the armoury of the tax commissioner to fight all those smarties and spivs out there who always seek to abuse our tax laws.
People should remember that if it is argued that the new structure will lead to planning opportunities, that is exactly what Senators Murray and Lees were planning to support. They were engaged in negotiations with the Treasurer to support the measures before us today with some slight variations. We expect now to hear them say that they do not support the arrangements, but people should remember that they accepted the principle of moving to a nominal capital gains tax system. They were reported as arguing for a 45 per cent cut in the nominal rate as opposed to a 50 per cent cut. What a great deal! Then they could argue that the principle is now wrong, but if the cut was 90 per cent of what is in this bill, the Democrats would be supporting it. We can see this hypocrisy for what it is.
Let us be clear about the revenue neutrality of this package. It has to be revenue neutral, not only in the medium term but in the long term. We have ensured that appropriate anti-avoidance measures will be enacted to stamp out the conversion schemes. This will stymie the new schemes but, of course, we need eternal vigilance in this area. We know from history that all it takes is one adverse court judgment and a hole may emerge. That is why the government have to ensure ongoing revenue neutrality. If they do not, Labor will be up the government like a rat up a drainpipe.
This task will be never ending. The Treasurer has to live up to his responsibility and to his word on these issues. This government has given a commitment that it will empower the tax commissioner to give no quarter to the spivs in this country who design tax avoidance schemes to get around these laws. That is the challenge for this government. That is what we have signed up to with this government. This government has promised us that it will not stand back and allow the tax base to be eroded by the spivs, the smart-money accountants and the wealthies. Hopefully, through the amendments we are moving, we will find a way to shut down this area but, as has happened in the past, when a government moves to block one hole the spivs and the smarties find a way to unblock another.
This government has given us a commitment that it will block every hole at every turn. What we want is a fair share paid by everybody. It should not matter how much you earn or whether or not you can afford a smart accountant—people should pay their fair share. That is what we have negotiated in this package. I look forward to the contributions from other senators. I hope we can ensure that this legislation goes through, as the Democrats promised, by Christmas.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (INCOME TAX RATES) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1999-11-29,"—The government welcomes the support of Senator Conroy and the Labor opposition. I can put Senator Conroy's mind at ease. He can rest assured that this government has a commitment to closing tax evasion schemes and our record shows that. We believe that the new business tax system legislation contains the appropriate measures to prevent 
 any holes being opened up by unscrupulous tax advisers. The new business tax system legislation is significant as it follows on from the government's new tax system legislation, which was introduced in June, if my memory serves me well. It completes the story of this government's major tax reform. It will add to underpinning the very strong economy that Australia has.
To paraphrase the Treasurer's speech made in Boston in October this year to an American business group, he claimed that we are the 13th largest world economy. The Treasurer made good and very proud comparisons between Australia and the United States economy. To state the obvious, the United States economy is the largest world economy. It is widely recognised that Australia and the United States had the strongest performing economies in the world in the last decade. Australia has high growth and low inflation locked in, and a rate of economic growth matched by no other economy in the world. Over the past decade, Australia's economic growth has outstripped the United States and, on average, our inflation has been lower than the US. Also, like the US, Australia's economy has very low interest rates.
This government has tackled the debt problem which we inherited when we first came to power in 1996 and it is worth restating that legacy. In 1996, we were left with a legacy of some $100 billion debt and an interest bill of $10 billion per year, which was the budget deficit—$10 billion a year. To put that into perspective, in the last four years of the previous government that debt jumped from a very manageable $32 billion under the Hawke Prime Ministership, from $32 billion at the beginning of the Keating Prime Ministership to $100 billion. Quite frankly, if we had come into government with a $32 billion debt, it would have been quite manageable. But we were left with a $100 billion debt and had to go about the business of introducing tough budgets and a regime of privatisation to bring that debt down.
Since 1996, the official interest rates have fallen and the net public debt has fallen well below the 11 per cent of GDP, as against the 25 per cent of GDP when we first came to 
 office. So you can see we have halved the debt. Productivity has jumped and is now higher than that of the United States. Both the United States and Australian markets are performing at record employment growth rates.
That economy has sustained us during the Asian crisis. The news of late is that the Asian countries are starting to recover, that they are on the mend. If we think back to a year or two ago, or more, when those countries collapsed, we remember the economic dread throughout Asia. The fact that the Australian economy has been able to survive and to maintain its growth throughout that economic crisis is a testament to the government's good fiscal and monetary management, to its underpinning of the economy with the fundamentals—to returning to the fundamentals. The tax system we have before us is part of that reform.
We have introduced flexibility into our economy, with the key ingredient being a budget surplus. That was tough to do. We were hindered every step of the way. The 1996 budget and every budget since has been prevented from being passed, at least in whole, by the opposition. They may well have changed their tune on this legislation, but it has taken them some three or four years to see the light. But we welcome it. We welcome the opposition's support of the government's tax bill.
With the surplus, we have been able to put downward pressure on interest rates. We have introduced the structural reforms necessary to underpin the economy, to secure it against boom and bust. We have introduced labour market reforms, comprehensive corporate law reforms and financial sector reforms. We have privatised many of our utilities, including half of Telstra. The previous government introduced a national competition policy, which we have built on. The benefits of introducing more competition into the economy are stark. You need only look at the telecommunications sector. Prices are coming down in that area.
We have introduced the goods and services tax, something we have stuck by. In 1993 under a previous leadership we flagged this 
 new tax system, but it was not palatable. But we so believed in it that we stuck to it and reintroduced it in the 1998 election. We went to the election on this very difficult policy and won. Subsequently, with the Democrats' help, we got it through the Senate. It was necessary. That new tax system is a more simplified tax system. We have abolished wholesale sales tax, so the weight of this tax has been lifted off our exporters. We have brought down personal income tax. Now we are pushing for more reform. This government will continue, so long as it stays in government, to push the boundaries of reform. We can see the benefits of the reform we have introduced—not just in the area of tax but in the labour market and in the area of asset sales.
That brings me to this new business tax system. Before I speak on the most significant reform, the capital gains tax reform—I think that is going to have the most significant effect on business—I would like to outline how we reached this point: the amount of consultation the government went through, the amount of listening, to put it simply in political terms, this government undertook. We appointed a three-man committee to introduce broad guidelines, to reduce the complexity of the system and to explore the scope to reduce company tax and capital gains tax.
Importantly, the review was also requested to look at the business tax system in a revenue neutral context. We believe we have achieved this. Those opposite support us in regard to that revenue neutral context. The objective was not simply to give concessions by reducing taxes but to improve the inherent structure of the system, to introduce structural change, recognising that the basic purpose of taxes is to raise revenue to fund essential public services.
We do not believe there is much more the government can prune from its existing budget. We are not looking to reduce the services any further. We did the tough budget in 1996, for the good reasons I outlined. The government does not believe there is any more pruning to do of future budgets, other than to seek internal efficiencies, which are always possible. Therefore, we are not seek 
 ing to have the new business tax system anything less or more than neutral. That was one of our main criteria. We believe we have achieved that. The review consulted extensively with businesses and produced a draft report before going on to produce its final report.
As with the reform of direct personal income taxes, the new business tax system announced on 21 September will achieve a broadening of the tax base. So both systems, the GST and the system we are introducing now, the new business tax system, broaden the tax base. That is our philosophy: to broaden the tax base so we can lower the rate of CGT and therefore reduce tax induced investment distortions away from the most profitable uses, permitting higher economic growth. This will also achieve considerable reductions in compliance costs.
The Treasurer's icon—and definitely one of the main features of the new tax system—is the reduction of the company tax rate from 36 cents in the dollar to 30 cents in the dollar. That will make businesses far more competitive on the international stage. It brings us more in line with other countries' tax rates. In Asia they are even lower than that, but on balance 30 cents in the dollar is a very competitive company tax rate.
Another feature of the tax system is that the reduction in company tax rates will be funded in part by moving to effective life depreciation, rather than the current system of accelerated depreciation for plant and equipment. That is important in so much as it is part of maintaining the neutrality of the new tax system.
The capital gains tax will be reduced. At present individuals are taxed on real capital gains at their marginal income tax rates. That can range, of course, from 20 cents in the dollar to the highest rate of 48 cents in the dollar—a crippling and uncompetitive tax rate and, without question, the highest in the world. The reforms will tax 50 per cent of nominal gains. So, effectively, the capital gains tax for individuals will be 24 cents in the dollar. They can be lower, but the top rate will be about 24.25 cents in the dollar and as low as 10 cents in the dollar.
Companies will also get the benefit of a reduced capital gains tax of 30 cents in the dollar and there will also be capital gains tax rollover relief on scrip for scrip takeovers. In addition, there will be substantial capital gains tax concessions for small business, as well as a dramatic reduction in compliance for such businesses with the introduction of a simplified tax system. Because of the $1 million threshold some 97 per cent of farmers—or perhaps even as high as 99 per cent—will be able to use the simplified tax system. This is a great benefit for my constituency, the primary producers of Australia, because most of them will be under the $1 million threshold and will be able to use the simplified tax system.
The combination of the indirect tax and income tax reforms, along with the business tax reforms, have been estimated by independent economic modellers to increase production across Australia. We do not need economic modellers to know that that statement is true. It is just common sense. We know that by simplifying and broadening the tax system we will have a much healthier economy and sustain our economic growth. The modelling does suggest that the mining industry will be a major net beneficiary of the overall tax reforms, as will the manufacturing, agricultural and finance and insurance sectors.
In other words, if you take the tax system as a whole every sector will benefit. If you start nitpicking at certain elements of our tax reform, you may find fault, but if you look at the whole system—not only at the benefits to a sector but to the economy—then this really is the most major reform this government has brought to the parliament yet and will have lasting effects. This is the sort of thing that a government's history will be written around when we look back. In addition, we will have the support of the opposition. This is one part of our history they will never be able to pull down because they actually agree with us on this. When the books are written and history is told, the fact that the Labor Party supported the government on this makes me quite confident that history will not be distorted.
This is one of the most major reforms for business. It will maintain our business growth 
 and put business on an internationally competitive footing. The bottom line of all this is growth in jobs: employment. We are already seeing how some of those reforms introduced by the government have maintained strong employment growth and reduced our unemployment levels to what will be less than seven per cent by the year's end—the best we have had in a decade. We can do better than that. We want to get around the five per cent mark, and perhaps even reach full employment of around three to four per cent as the years go on.
That can only be done if the economy is underpinned by the fundamentals, and that is what we are doing. Jobs really are the prime end responsibility of any government. It begins and ends there. The government does everything around that to get full-time jobs and flexibility in the workplace. That will probably be the most pleasing aspect of all our reforms, as hard and as tough as they have been. We will be able to look back as a government and say that we locked in low unemployment rates in this country. We do not have that cruel economic and social legacy of high unemployment. With these sorts of reforms we will be able to lock in an unemployment rate of around five to six per cent for decades to come. That is a reward for being in public life that very few governments will have. I am sure that this new tax system will make business competitive and maintain the profits of business, which will lead to greater employment throughout the economy as a whole.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (INCOME TAX RATES) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-11-29,"—We are dealing with a package of six bills which represent part of what is known as the Ralph committee business tax reforms as introduced by this government in response to that Ralph committee report. We just had a contribution from Senator McGauran and I want to make a couple of comments in respect of his contribution. Senator McGauran outlined a number of economic statistics in relation to economic growth, which has been running at between four and five per cent in recent years. He also referred to our current lower inflation environment and to the fall in unemployment. 
The government certainly can take some credit for those economic statistics, but it should also be pointed out that the reason for the improvement in those economic statistics he referred to was in significant part the sound basis on which the economy was left by the Labor government.
—Oh!
—I hear Senator Abetz scoff. It was in fact his leader, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, who shortly after coming to office in 1996 referred to the economy as being basically sound. So there were important contributions from the previous Labor government. What Senator McGauran did not highlight is that, at the present time, total national debt is increasing, the current account deficit is increasing, our current savings levels—total savings, not government savings but total national savings—are in very significant decline. It is not my purpose to go into the detail of that today. I just sound a warning that there are some clouds on the economic horizon. It is all very well to talk about reductions in government debt, but the critical issue relating to government debt is that it is sustainable. The level of government debt when Labor was defeated and left office was sustainable. It was not high by international comparisons. We should not just focus on government debt; we should focus on total national debt.
I was pleased that a representative of the National Party has spoken in this debate. But I was disappointed that Senator McGauran did not refer to the comprehensive drubbing that the National Party has had, yet again, with respect to its lobbying efforts to try and minimise the impact of some of the measures in this package we are considering. As we know, the National Party and the National Farmers Federation represent the top end of town with respect to rural producers in this country. From the public utterances of Senator McGauran's colleagues, such as the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, who promised that he would go in hard for the top end of town farmers in this country, there is no doubt— 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. It goes to 
 the matter of relevance. Senator Sherry has strayed because he fails to make the point that the 16 House of Representatives seats that the National Party represent are the lowest socioeconomic—
—What is your point of order, Senator McGauran?
—He should be making that point, that the 16 National Party seats are the lowest socioeconomic seats throughout Australia. Therefore we do not represent the big end of town and he should come back to the fact.
—That is not a point of order.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—I do not need your advice, Senator Conroy. You are out of order.
—I obviously touched a raw nerve there, to prompt that spurious, irrelevant point of order from the National Party's Senator McGauran, who has participated in this debate. I believe it is relevant to the debate to yet again touch on the fact that the National Party and its extraparliamentary organisation, the NFF, have once again been comprehensively rolled. It is nothing more than the doormat for this government. I am pleased to see that more and more people in rural and regional Australia are coming to realise the fact that the National Party is nothing more than the doormat of this government.
We are considering a package of reforms with respect to business tax reform. The legislation will touch on a range of tax measures in this country in a substantial way. The first matter I want to refer to is the company tax rate. At the present time, the company tax rate payable by companies in Australia is 36 per cent. In 1996-97, revenue from company tax was $19.173 billion, which represented about 18 per cent of total revenue collection. I have to come back to Senator McGauran at this point. He made reference to our company tax rate, which he claimed was internationally uncompetitive. There may be some substance in this. Some of the comparative rates are: 
 Hong Kong 16 per cent, Singapore 26 per cent, Germany 30 per cent, Indonesia 30 per cent, Thailand 30 per cent, United Kingdom 30 per cent, Korea 31 per cent, New Zealand 33 per cent and the United States 35 per cent. It is interesting that there are at least two Asian countries there—Indonesia and Thailand—with income tax rates of 30 per cent. I have referred to Hong Kong and Singapore. These low company tax rates did not stop the recent Asian crisis. I think we have to be a little bit more circumspect, Senator McGauran, when we make claims about low company tax rates. There certainly is some substance to the issue of having competitive company tax rates, but I do not think we should overstate the situation.
Competition between nations for investment is affected by other factors. It is not just the company tax rate alone that determines investment levels. We have other issues such as the education, training and skills bases of a nation, the political stability, the size of the domestic economy and its relationship with larger economies around it, and also capital infrastructure. We have to examine our competitiveness in the context of those other factors. The government is proposing that the existing company tax rate will be phased down to 34 per cent in 2000-01 and to 30 per cent for 2001-02. This comes at a substantial cost to government revenue. In the year 2004-05, this will have a negative effect on government revenue of approximately $3.4 billion, and that is substantial.
To some extent, this loss in revenue is offset by changes to depreciation measures. This forms a large part of the savings in lost revenue from the reduction in company tax. These savings in depreciation measures—the removal of accelerated depreciation—were recommended in the Ralph report. If we look at the savings to be obtained in this area, again by the year 2004-05 there will be savings of approximately $2.5 billion by the removal of accelerated depreciation.
Of course, we should pose the question `What will be the long-term impact of a reduction in company tax—and obviously the flow-on increase in income to the shareholders of those companies and, as argued, some 
 stimulation in investment—vis-a-vis the possible reduction in investment from the removal of accelerated depreciation?' To what extent is this a short-term income gain vis-a-vis a long-term investment loss. That particular credit-debit scenario will be interesting to examine in the coming years.
Another large part of the reforms being considered is capital gains tax measures. The government's proposal—the Liberal-National Party proposal—is to halve the capital gains tax rate for individuals, meaning that they will pay no more than 24.25 per cent on nominal capital gains held for at least one year. This, of course, sounds superficially very impressive—halving the capital gains tax rate. But what we have to remember is that the base on which that capital gains tax is being paid is being changed, and being changed quite radically. It is proposed to freeze the indexation of the cost base for calculating capital gains at 30 September 1999, and averaging of capital gains will be discontinued effective from 21 September 1999. There is no doubt that in respect of these capital gains tax measures there will be some winners, but there will be some losers as a result of the change to the base for the calculation of capital gains tax.
In the reasons outlined by the government for these proposed changes the assertion is made that this will invigorate asset management, stimulate greater participation by individuals in investment, and achieve a better allocation of capital resources and again make Australia more internationally competitive as an investment location. I have touched on this issue of international competitiveness, but it will again be interesting in relation to the other assertions—this unleashing of the lockup of asset and capital that is involved in the capital gains tax—to see whether this unleashing of investment does in fact occur. It certainly will occur to some extent, but again I think it is certainly a matter of reasoned argument as to what the level of unleashing will be.
Very important to the Labor opposition is that we have a significant improvement in integrity measures as part of this package. The government has proposed its stage 1 
 response to the Ralph report. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, made a second announcement in a press release, No. 74, on 11 November this year relating to business tax reform, and this concentrated largely on a number of integrity measures to contribute to the fairness and equity of the business tax system. They include limiting the extent to which non-commercial losses can be used to reduce the tax paid on other income, restricting the ability of individuals to reduce tax by diverting the income they earn from their personal services to an entity, requiring prepayments in respect of the tax shelter arrangements to be deductible over the period during which the services are provided, improving the general anti-avoidance rule—part IVA of the income tax legislation—and streamlining its operation, and the denial of losses on certain interposed companies for tax purposes. In addition, it is proposed that the holding period for dividend streaming and franking credit trading rules will be reduced and the exemption for small transactions raised from $2,000 to $5,000.
These integrity measures, it is estimated, by the year 2004-05 should save approximately $1.6 billion in revenue. There are a number of other measures that time does not allow me to touch on today. This was very important to the Labor opposition in agreeing to support the business tax package that we have before us. They certainly add weight to the argument that the proposals we are considering will be revenue neutral. But of course Labor has given two very clear warnings to the Liberal and National parties with respect to this package. Firstly, we expect the range of integrity measures to be implemented in full, as outlined by the Treasurer in response to Labor's insistence that there should be a significant crackdown in this area. We expect those to be implemented in full. The word of the Treasurer and the word of the government are on the line in this area, and, if that is not done in full in further legislation to be considered, to quote the words of our shadow Treasurer, Mr Crean, we will be chasing this government like a rat up a drainpipe. But there is also the declared intention of Labor to ensure that, if these measures are not implemented in full and if this package is not 
 revenue neutral, a future Labor government will pursue these particular measures with renewed vigour.
I would like briefly to refer to the work of the inquiry into business tax reform by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. This illustrates the very positive contribution the committees of this chamber make. I notice the deputy chair, Senator Gibson, is to speak shortly. I would also like to refer to the positive work carried out by the chair, my colleague Senator George Campbell, and my other colleague Senator Conroy, who has spoken in this debate.
If we look at this report, very appropriately the Senate committee has attempted, as they did with the GST proposals, to examine as thoroughly as they could, through modelling, the impact of the business tax reform package that we are considering. On page 17 of the report there are some very pertinent and impressive observations made by Professor Dixon, who examined the government's business tax changes in some detail.
Before concluding my remarks I would like to touch on the assertions made by the government senators in their report on page 61. They make claims that have been made many times before in the context of tax debate in this country. Senator McGauran referred earlier to the claim that is often made that this economy is doing well. We can accept that in view of at least a number of the economic indicators, with the strong reservation of our current account, investment and particularly saving. This Liberal-National Party government have drawn the line and said, `The economy is doing well but it will do even better under this proposed tax reform and under the GST.' That is an interesting argument to put. We will look with interest at the evidence over the coming years to see whether this economy does grow more than it has in the last few years and whether government debt does decline with the advent of a GST and with business tax reform. That will be interesting to observe.
The government senators make the claim that the objective is to simplify and to improve Australia's tax system. I suppose it 
 depends on your definition of simplification. The result of all of the legislation we are considering does mean lower tax rates in some areas. It does mean a new 10 per cent GST. It does mean adding thousands more pages to the tax acts that we have in this country. It does mean that we will be considering, prior to the Christmas recess, another 1,000 amendments to the GST. So with regard to whether or not it is simplification, again the evidence and the long-term outcomes will be interesting to examine. We have a reference to a sustainable revenue base so that the government can deliver social services and provide public goods. This government's benchmark has been to significantly cut education and health expenditure, so that is somewhat cynical.

"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,1999-11-29,"—I rise to talk on these new business tax system bills. I believe they are probably the most important bills to go through this place for a very long time because they affect the very heart of how the economy works in Australia—not how the government works but how the economy works. I remind the Senate and listeners that government accounts for about one-third of the Australian economy. The Commonwealth collects about 25 per cent of GDP, the states about 7½ and local government about 1½, so about 33 per cent of the economy is run by government. The other two-thirds is run by private enterprise and by business. It is the health of business on which the government third depends, so we have to encourage the growth of business enterprises in Australia.
We have known for a very long time that the taxation system in Australia has been a mess. There have been many attempts to have thorough taxation reform. The Asprey committee reported back in the 1970s that the Australian tax system was a mess. Why? Because it was designed in the 1930s and then just patched and built on, bit by bit. It ended up being extremely complicated. Today, there are 4,000 pages of tax act. The Asprey committee led to no political action. The Hawke government tried to reform tax in the mid-1980s with the famous option C, but that was shot down by combined work be 
 tween the former Prime Minister Mr Hawke and the ACTU. In 1992-93 we had the coalition attempt with Fightback, which failed with the electorate.
Just over two years ago, in August 1997, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, announced that this government was going to have the guts and the determination to see through taxation reform for Australia. Shortly thereafter I had the honour of being made chairman of a coalition committee which sought input from the Australian community as to what was actually wrong with the Australian tax system and, secondly, suggestions for change. We started our investigations in September 1997 and reported to the government in March-April 1998.
Without going over personal income tax and consumption tax, with regard to business tax what were the main findings of the input into the committee that I had the honour of chairing? The recommendation from business and anyone to do with business was, first of all, that our tax system was too long and far too complicated. Its administration was not as efficient as it might be. Its structure was wrong and not based on principles. It had very high compliance costs. Avoidance was fairly common, even though this government in particular had tackled avoidance very strongly indeed. The amount of avoidance was directly related to the amount of complexity. We had to do something about the very complex act.
The final recommendation resulting from those inputs nearly a year and a half ago was that we had to make our business tax rates competitive relative to the rest of the world, because we wanted investment, jobs and growth in income. Australia has a very long history of being reliant on foreigners to provide capital into Australia so that the Australian economy can continue to grow. We in Australia for a very long time have spent more each year than we have actually earned. We rely on the savings of foreigners to make up the difference.
The government took the inputs from the committee I chaired and came up with its recommendations in August last year with the big report, Tax reform, not a new tax system. 
 That report went out into the community well before the election last year. The system put forward by the government with regard to business tax—leaving the other bits and pieces aside—was to lower both company tax and capital gains tax to make them internationally competitive with rates in the rest of the world and to simplify the business tax system. We won the election; we were voted back in to go ahead with tax reform. The government has already achieved great milestones by getting the income tax reforms, the diesel tax reforms and the GST through the parliament.
Shortly after the election last year, the Treasurer appointed the Ralph committee, and I want to pay tribute to three great Australians, in particular the chairman John Ralph, Mr Rick Allert and Mr Robert Joss, who were the committee that formed the group that produced the Ralph report. They have done an enormous amount of work. I must also pay tribute to the public servants and consultants who worked with that group, night and day since late last year right through until August this year, doing magnificent work for Australia.
They produced three interim reports. Firstly, there was one on process, criticising the process of tax reform in the past and recommending a process of structure based on principles and not ad hocery. They commissioned a second report making international comparisons of our tax system with those of all our main trading partners around the world. That was done in December last year. Then they produced a draft report earlier this year with their draft recommendations and sought input from the community, particularly the business community, and then produced their final report in August this year. It is a very large, comprehensive report, an absolutely excellent job well done by everyone involved with it.
Again I stress what Mr Ralph recommended: a return to simplicity, to a tax system based on principles. If you do that and get rid of complexity you get rid of the opportunities for avoidance, because people who are smart and who can afford to engage the appropriate lawyers and accountants can make use of the 
 complexity that is in the system to avoid tax. Mr Ralph recommended that we retreat and base our tax system on a much simpler structure.
One of the key items that had a lot of discussion, particularly during the hearings of our Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee, chaired by Senator Campbell, was the capital gains tax regime. Again, what have the government put forward—thankfully, supported by the Labor Party? We have put forward a structure which is internationally competitive. Let me go back through the history of the main capital trading nations of the world over the last few years to see what has happened. First of all, in the USA the Clinton administration reduced capital gains tax from 28 per cent to 20 per cent about 2½ years ago. In response, the UK Blair administration about two years ago announced that it was reducing its capital gains tax regime. Essentially, for high income people and for passive investment—in other words, arms-length investments in commercial buildings or shares, for example—the capital gains tax regime in the UK reduced from 40 per cent to 24 per cent over a 10-year period. It came down substantially. But more importantly for small business, it reduced the capital gains tax regime from 20 per cent to 10 per cent over a 10-year period—in other words, a stepped regime.
Australia, with about 1½ per cent of the equity capital of the world market, cannot stand outside this system—we have to be competitive. We had to respond. I note that, following the UK example, Ireland reduced capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent. A recent report from Ireland showed that, with that reduction in capital gains tax, the tax  collections by the revenue office from capital gains tax  actually went up the following year by 75 per cent. I note that only three weeks ago the Blair government announced that it was further reducing its capital gains tax regime, and instead of having a 10-year stepped regime—from 40 down to 24 or 20 down to 10—they are going to reduce that to a five-year stepped rate, again to make it competitive with regard to the rest of the capital world. We are talking about a world 
 where capital is very mobile. The USA market accounts for about half the equities market in the world, Britain about 15 per cent and Australia about 1½ per cent. We are tiny and we really have to fit in if we want capital to continue to flow into the Australian economy—and we do.
So the government has put forward an internationally competitive capital gains tax regime and company tax regime. More importantly, it has recommended simplifying the tax act, and one of the recommendations to do that is to tax trusts as companies. This is called entity taxation. That will greatly simplify the tax structure.
The government has also taken up the Ralph committee's recommendations in following anti-avoidance procedures. The government has announced several anti-avoidance procedures to basically strengthen the hand of the tax office and to make sure that people do pay their fair share of taxation. These measures will have a very big impact on the structure of the Australian economy, though not tomorrow. I note the comment my colleague Senator Sherry from the opposition made that he was looking forward to seeing whether or not these changes in structure might have any impact on the Australian economy. You cannot expect changes in tax structure to have an immediate impact. What we are trying to do is set the structure that will have an impact in five to 20 years from now so that Australia does grow and we do provide investments, jobs and incomes for our children and our grandchildren into the future.
This is an extremely important change in the legal structure in Australia that is proposed in these bills. I give one quote from evidence that was given to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee recently. It is from Mr Reynolds, who is an expert on capital gains tax and did a review of capital gains tax changes in the USA where, in the recent past, in the last 20 years, they had had increases in capital gains tax followed by decreases in capital gains tax. When the capital gains tax was increased, revenue went down; when capital gains tax was decreased, revenue went up. In his evidence to this committee Mr Reynolds said:
I think that what you are proposing to do on capital gains tax is the single most important tax change in Australian history.
One of the reasons is the reason you are speaking of: that it brings you out of the mining business, which I greatly respect, into the age of the knowledge industry. Rather than sending your people to Silicon Valley, you will be bringing some of Silicon Valley to Australia.
That is what this is all about, and that is why, when these bills go through the Senate—and I am pleased that the Labor Party has decided to support the government's initiatives in this regard and the Democrats have also in large measure agreed with the government's proposals—they are going to have a very fundamental effect on the structure for Australian business, the two-thirds of the Australian economy which we want to keep growing: growing jobs, growing investment and growing income for everybody. This means that governments can take their third of the economy out of those incomes and do those things for health, education and welfare in looking after those who need looking after.
As I said earlier, these are probably the most important bills with regard to the structure of the economy of Australia that this parliament has seen for many a long day, and I applaud the government for its work with those bills.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (INCOME TAX RATES) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,1999-11-29,"—On 21 September 1999 this government, through the Treasurer, released a report on the review of business taxation called the Ralph report. Before proceeding to the comments I wish to make today in respect of the package of legislation before the Senate, the New Business Tax System (Income Tax Rates) Bill (No. 1) 1999  and related bills, I wish to highlight the work of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee inquiry into business taxation reform, which reported in November 1999. I think it is a comprehensive report, given the short time frame that was made available to the committee. Indeed, therein lies one of the positive outcomes of the process that was entered into. In a very short time frame committee members were able to turn their minds to the necessary elements that made up the terms of reference and to report in a 
 comprehensive and factual manner. I think it highlights that the committee has certainly met that challenge and has provided a comprehensive document through which to highlight the bills before the Senate and for the Senate to be able to make informed, considered views about that.
Turning to the issues in respect of the bill itself, following from that Ralph report the Treasurer announced the government's proposal to introduce a phased reduction in the company tax rate to 34 per cent for the 2000-01 income year and 30 per cent for the 2001-02 income year and thereafter. The rationale was that the low company tax rate should strengthen Australia's prospects for investment, economic growth and—my emphasis—jobs. In addition, there will be removal of accelerated appreciation. This is where the tax deduction allowed for the decline in value of an asset is brought forward. This will provide revenue savings to partly offset the lower company tax revenues mentioned earlier. Depreciation measures will now be based on the effective lifetime of the business asset. The government also has proposed that small businesses, defined, as I understand it, as having three years average turnover of less than $1 million per annum, will be able to have simplified depreciation provisions, a cash accounting regime and other measures which will assist them in their business opportunities.
Other significant measures were those that touch upon capital gains tax. The government's proposal, amongst other measures, is to halve the capital gains tax rate for individuals. Thus these individuals will pay no more than 24.25 per cent on nominal capital gains. The reasons underpinning this, as stated by the government, are to integrate asset management, to stimulate greater participation by individuals in investment and to achieve a better allocation of capital resources. This should improve our overall international competitiveness. However, Labor has steadfastly maintained that the tax package should pay for itself—that is, be revenue neutral. Labor wants to ensure that other areas of government expenditure are not deprived of revenue in order to pay for the business tax 
 package. Labor set out to make sure there are good integrity measures which are designed to instil fairness and equity into the tax package. At their core are anti-avoidance measures designed to make sure that individuals and businesses would not seek to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. The Treasurer has now locked the government into implementing measures to ensure that tax avoiders do not cheat the system. Consequently, Labor will be supporting the proposals.
The debate that I wish to add to today is necessarily short: much of the bill has been explained succinctly and well by the shadow minister and Senator Sherry and I do not wish to recap on much of the submissions that were already put before the Senate today. I thank particularly the chair of the committee for providing documents to the inquiry into business taxation reform in a short time frame and for providing the ability for people to be able to then go to those issues and read the committee's conclusions on chapter 8, so that I can participate in the debate today.
The summary of the committee's proceedings and their conclusions have now been provided through the committee, as well as those matters that they have gone to in part. One matter which, I suspect, kept us focused was that it would be—and we would continue to ensure that it would be—a revenue neutral package. The Senate inquiry highlighted that and we find now that the Treasurer has similarly taken that on board. I think that highlights again the worth of the committee's inquiry into the tax reform package and I commend the proposals and the legislation.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (INCOME TAX RATES) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-11-29,"—I want to speak about the New Business Tax System (Income Tax Rates) Bill (No. 1) 1999  and the five related bills, and I want to begin with a reflection on Senator Conroy's contribution to this debate, because I thought it was really quite astonishing. I would like to remind Senator Conroy and all other senators of the bills that we are debating. We are debating business tax reform—not the GST or indirect tax but business tax.
Labor have said that the business tax should be revenue neutral. If it is, they will pass it. Unfortunately, it simply is not revenue neu 
 tral. Let me read some of the recent conclusions of very eminent people on the business tax reform package. This is what they said:
. . . Labor believes revenue neutrality can be achieved, but from the evidence provided to the Committee this has not been achieved.
. . . The final package can achieve revenue neutrality if:
*	 there is no further watering down of measures already announced in ANTS and the other stage 1 proposals;
*	 the revenue hole from the overestimation of asset realisations is filled;
*	 there are effective anti-avoidance measures to prevent the large scale conversion of income into capital gains; and
*	 the stage 2 in-principle announcements are not watered down when the final detail is settled, and therefore achieve their revenue targets.
. . . Until the above conditions are met it is not possible to conclude that the package meets the test of revenue neutrality.
Who wrote these pearls of wisdom? Senators Conroy, Cook and George Campbell. This was the conclusion of these Labor luminaries tabled in the Senate only a week ago. But what has happened since then? Senator Conroy has been rolled; his leadership team rolled him. Simon Crean says, `No, I don't care about the budget. The worse the budget next year, the better off Labor will be. The worse the budget cuts if this package is revenue negative, the better the chance of being re-elected.'
Senator Conroy accuses the Democrats of being poor negotiators. Well, before Simon Crean undercut us last week, we had an in-principle agreement to reduce the size of the capital gains tax cut by 20 per cent, to lock in all of the anti-avoidance measures by making the company tax cuts conditions of their package, to have a full inquiry into the whole area of charities—which is also Labor policy—and to improve the anti-avoidance rules on capital gains. And what did Labor get? Nothing. Senator Conroy's committee report last week found the figures do not stack up and still Labor, so desperate to look relevant, ignored its own senators and all the evidence to the Senate inquiry and voted into law a package that will cost around $1.5 billion in revenue over the next four years.
Dud negotiators? No, Senator Conroy, the Democrats were in the process of negotiating the pants off Simon Crean. It was Simon Crean who rolled over. The Democrats wanted a business tax package that was revenue neutral and that did not replace one set of tax loopholes with another set of tax loopholes in the capital gains tax area. Unfortunately, it looks as though Labor MPs, although we may be able to convince them in the debate to do otherwise, are going soft on tax avoidance. That worries me. I wonder if they really care about policy. They are in a policy free zone, it appears. I will be looking for amendments on business tax because they really do need to be made, as came out in the report that was written, but I have not seen any Labor amendments yet.
We need a policy on tax avoidance. They do not have a policy on tax avoidance through a capital gains tax anymore. Even though 80 per cent of capital gains tax is paid by high income earners and this tax is not revenue neutral, Labor do not seem to care and are prepared to pass these measures, which in their current form are little more than a signal to high wealth individuals to avoid tax. What about trusts? If the current regime goes through, then you can convert your income to capital gains and avoid tax to your heart's content.
I feel genuinely sorry for Senator Conroy. He, Senator Cook and Senator Campbell diligently went through the business tax inquiry. As usual, they did a very thorough job. They found the package did not add up, duly reported that and then were rolled. I feel sorry for Mark Latham, who tried to move in caucus to change the CGT rules. He knows that the Labor heartland supporters out in Campbelltown do not want to give unfunded tax cuts to the wealthy, but he was rolled too. The last thing that new Labor want is backbenchers discussing policy. There is only one policy—none at all.
In an incredible twist, Labor are trying to blame the Democrats for the lack of revenue neutrality in the package. They say the next budget is being run down to pay for the GST. That is untrue. The income tax cuts will cost $5 billion in revenue next year, but that is 
 because bracket creep has added $8 billion to income tax revenues since 1993. Inevitably, part of that had to be refunded. Base broadening measures will fund around $7 billion of the $12 billion of tax cuts. High income earners on over $100,000 a year, after looking at the base broadening, would be paying more tax under the new system than the old. But, overall, the cost of the tax cuts was considerably less than the gain from bracket creep over the last seven years.
I acknowledge that the Democrats amendments to the GST package will cost more to the budget bottom line. But let me make a few points. The budget surplus is not raided to fund the extra concessions on the GST that we won on food, health and education. These measures, worth $3.2 billion in 2000-01 and $3.8 billion in 2001-02, are fully funded over the two years by lower income tax cuts, higher taxes on diesel and deferral of state business tax. No, the sundown of the surplus of $1.5 billion in 2000-01 and $500 million in 2001-02 comes because of the extra spending measures we won: real-term social security increases for pensioners, self-funded retirees and the unemployed worth $760 million per year; environment measures worth $220 million per year; and educational assistance worth $60 million per year. I am proud of these spending measures. They deliver real-term increases in living standards for pensioners, the disabled, the unemployed, sole parents, low income families and all other social security recipients. Research by Professor Ann Harding confirms this. The environment measures deliver a huge reduction in diesel particulate emissions and a modest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions—an outcome confirmed by modelling from the Bureau of Transport Economics and the Australian Greenhouse Office.
So let us be clear about this: the surplus is not run down to fund the Democrats GST deal. No, the surplus is run down to increase funding on social and environmental programs. That is entirely appropriate, because the surplus was created on the back of the aged, the sick and the unemployed by $1.7 billion dollars of budget cuts to the social safety net in the first two Costello budgets. 
 We succeeded in getting much of that put back into the budget with the GST negotiations, and for that the Labor Party, which delivered no real increases in employment assistance in a decade of government, are criticising us. Now they are ticking off a package which will cost the budget bottom line at least $1.5 billion over four years and will probably cost more once high income earners work out the tax avoidance opportunities this capital gains tax system entails.
We do not really need to be lectured on social or economic responsibility by Senator Conroy. He is not even listened to in his own caucus, as evidenced by the failure to accept the Senate committee conclusions. So he does not have credibility on policy at this point—although, of course, I did express my sympathy for the fact that he probably had been rolled. Labor have no policies on social responsibility and improving the social safety net, no policies on environmental responsibility, no policies on—
—Who rolled him?
—It was Mr Crean. I thought you would have known that, Senator McGauran. Labor have no policies on tax reform and now no policies on fiscal responsibility either. A policy free zone, dud negotiators, political opportunists—if this is the new, liberated Labor that Kim Beazley and Simon Crean intend to take to the next election, then the Liberals and the National Party must be laughing all the way to the ballot box.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (INCOME TAX RATES) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-29,"—The Greens oppose this package. We believe that the Labor Party and the Democrats have been involved in a process of bargaining to the bottom, to the lowest common denominator. The government has had its way with a tax package which is regressive in that it gives nothing to the disadvantaged in this country and everything to the already rich. It is going to increase the gap between the haves and the have-nots, between the rich and the poor. I cannot accept Labor's assurances that it will be revenue neutral because it simply will not be. When it is discovered how far short of being revenue neutral it is, how many billions of dollars are essentially redirected to the rich in this package, we will 
 then have to look at where that shortfall will be made up—and, of course, it is going to be made up by the average punter. It is going to be made up by the people who are not the increasingly select mega-rich in this country. It will most likely be made up by a reduction in health and education services and essential government services to the people of this nation who believe in a fair go.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-11-29,"—I seek leave 
 to incorporate in Hansard  responses to questions asked by Senators Mackay, West and Evans last week.
Leave granted.
The answers read as follows—
Response to Question asked by Senator Sue Mackay on 24 November 1999
As with the Australian economy generally, Tasmania is experiencing an improving economic and employment situation that is paralleled by a reduced number of job seekers requiring support through social security payments.
Centrelink is monitoring this improving situation as part of its regular review of resource requirements in line with forecast revenue. Centrelink's internal budgets for 1999-2000 were set in June 1999 based on estimated workload and revenue forecasts.
As Centrelink revises its workload and revenue forecasts local managers are provided with information to ensure they are able to manage resources to match local demand. The budget forecasts for Tasmania have recently been revised downwards as a result of the reduced number of job seekers requiring support through social security payments.
Area Tasmania use a range of strategies to manage within their revenue forecasts to ensure they meet their service requirements in Tasmania and will continue to do so. In the current situation, such strategies may include reduced numbers of temporary employees, natural attrition or, in some cases, voluntary redundancies. There will be no office closures or reduction in access through current service agents around Tasmania.
Centrelink will continue to monitor their revenue and resource management to ensure quality service is maintained around Australia.
Response to Questions from Senators West and Evans on 25 November 1999
I would like to respond to the questions asked by Senator Evans and Senator West on 25 November 1999 regarding the Supported Wage System and Wage Subsidy programs within the Family and Community Services portfolio.
The questions addressed two employer incentive programs delivered by my department for people with a disability and reforms to those programs.
No reduction has been made to expenditure for either the Supported Wage System or the Wage Subsidy Scheme. Both programs will continue to provide capacity for new clients.
My commitment to ensure people with a disability have opportunities to maximise their participation remains firm. However, I am also concerned that the available employment assistance funding is 
 managed effectively and is directed to clients who most need assistance.
Senator West asked the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 25 November 1999:
(1)	 Can the Minister for Family and Community Services inform the Senate why staff of her department are contacting disability employment service providers in Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales, informing them that ""employer payments have now ceased for any further new applicants to Supported Wage""?
(2)	 Is the Minister aware that this scheme saw 3,188 people with disabilities in 1998-99 reduce their reliance on the disability support pension and enter into employment?
(3)	 How can the minister justify shutting down this obviously successful incentive while, at the same time, maintaining ""many people with a capacity to work needlessly stay on disability payments for a long time?
Senator Newman—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	 The Department of Family and Community Services has advised disability employment service providers of changes to program guidelines for new Supported Wage System entrants to remove overlap between funding programs which support people with disabilities to access employment.
Under previous arrangements both ""on the job support"" and employer incentives were available to support job seekers with disabilities from the Supported Wage System and from annual block grants. Block grant funded employment services have also accessed Supported Wage System funding to assist people with disabilities.
In fixture Supported Wage System ""on the job support"" and the employer incentive payment will be payable for employment placements under the Supported Wage System that have not involved FaCS funded specialist disability employment assistance services.
(2)	 This statement is incorrect. The Annual Report 1998/99 for the Commonwealth Department of Family and Community Services, page 147 indicates that 3,188 employment placements were obtained with wage subsidies paid by the FaCS specialist disability employment services, not the Supported Wage System. In 1998/99 1217 new Supported Wage System placements were achieved.
(3)	 I have no intention of ""shutting down"" the Supported Wage System. This system is very important to reducing employment barriers for people with disabilities. In fact the Govern 
 ment recently approved an additional $1 million allocation to the Supported Wage System for 1999-2000.
Senator West asked the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 25 November 1999:
(1)	 In respect of the letters that the department has sent to organisations in the three states, can the minister confirm that, according to department correspondence from New South Wales, the supported wage system approved over 1200 new applications in 1998-99, putting it 20 per cent over the annual target?
(2)	 Is the minister aware that the manager of the department' s New South Wales Economic and Social Participation branch dubbed this increase unsustainable?
(3)	 Can the minister inform the Senate why a scheme that offers an annual average subsidy of just over $1,600 to each worker, thousands of dollars less than what the Commonwealth would be paying out in disability support pensions, is unsustainable?
Senator Newman—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	 1217 new Supported Wage System placements were achieved in 1998/99, approximately 20% above the target of 986.
(2)	 Yes. The advice to service providers was simply intended to indicate that a Supported Wage System growth rate of 20% per annum was unsustainable within current budget allocations.
(3)	 See response to question (2). Funding for wage subsidies ($1600) continues to be available under the Wage Subsidy Scheme (not the Supported Wage System) to assist job seekers with disabilities and potentially reduce their need for the Disability Support Pension
Senator Evans asked the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 25 November 1999:  
With respect to the Supported Wage System for people with disabilities and the minister's department's decision to cut back the program's growth: 
(1)	 Can the Minister inform the Senate why her department considers it fair and equitable to limit the wage subsidy to just 45% of those workers with disabilities who require job placement in 1999-2000?
(2)	 Just what are the other 55% of disabled people supposed to do without that important wage support?  

Senator Newman—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	 The honourable senator refers to recent changes announced for the Wage Subsidy Scheme. This scheme provides a subsidy as an incentive to employers to provide employment, under open employment conditions to an eligible person with a disability. Changes to the wage subsidy scheme for 1999-2000 financial year provided a more equitable distribution of funding to services consistent with their negotiated job seeker outcome targets for the year. In the previous financial year allocations were based on service estimates of requirements with little regard to outcomes being achieved.
A total of $7 million is available for wage subsidies in 1999-2000. This is a substantial increase on 1998-1999 wage subsidy expenditure.
Wage subsidy funding has been allocated to disability employment services in 1999-2000, on the basis of a formula
.	 Open employment services, have been allocated wage subsidy funding for 45% of work placements during the year, at an average subsidy value of $1600. This subsidy can be spread across all job seekers on an ""as required"" basis.
.	 Supported employment services have been allocated wage subsidy funding for 45% of new workers at an average subsidy value of $1600.
The average subsidy value represents the national average wage subsidy expenditure in 1998-99.
Peak bodies were consulted on the funding allocation method. The approach took into account the wage subsidy expenditure trends in 1998-99, but also made allowance for increased demand with 1998-99 being the first full year of the scheme's operation in the portfolio.
The new allocations provide Disability Employment Services the flexibility to use the wage subsidy funding with any eligible job seekers and negotiate the wage subsidy amount with employers. Disability employment services can also provide a range of employment assistance to job seekers with disabilities, including employment preparation, job search, placement and post placement support.

Dear Minister
I refer to the Superannuation (PSS) Membership Exclusion Amendment Declaration 1999 (No.1), Statutory Rules 1999 No.168, which exclude from the Scheme persons who have transferred to the Australian Government Solicitor.
Although, by virtue of regulation 2, these Statutory Rules commence on Gazettal, the terms of item 2 in the Schedule apparently indicate that the amendments made by them apply from 1 August 1998. The Explanatory Statement, however, does not provide any indication of the correct commencement date for this item. The Committee would 
 therefore appreciate your advice as to whether the amendments apply retrospectively and, if so, whether any person other than the Commonwealth will be affected adversely.
Yours sincerely

Dear Helen
Thank you for  your letter of 23 September 1999 seeking my advice as to whether the amendments contained in Superannuation (PSS) Membership Exclusion Amendment Declaration 1999 (No. 1) (the Amending Exclusion Declaration) have retrospective effect, and if so whether any person  other than the Commonwealth will be affected adversely.
The amendments contained in the Amending Exclusion Declaration do not have retrospective effect. The amendments replace item 38 of the Schedule to the Superannuation (PSS) Membership Exclusion Declaration (the Exclusion Declaration). Item 38 was inserted in the Exclusion Declaration before it took effect on 1 August 1998. As inserted, item 38 provided that PSS membership would not continue for a person who became on or after 1 August 1998 a person to whom the ""mobility provisions"" contained in Division 2 or 3 of Part IV of the Public Service Act 1922 applied, other than persons who were to be transferred to the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) on its commencement.
AGS was not established until 1 September 1999 and prior to that date I agreed to extend the classes of persons employed by AGS for whom PSS membership would be available. This was done by means of an amendment to the Superannuation (PSS) Membership Inclusion Declaration (the Inclusion Declaration) which includes as PSS members AGS employees who were transferred under the mobility provisions as well as certain other AGS employees.
As a consequence, item 38 in the Exclusion Declaration has been replaced with a provision that excludes persons from membership of the PSS who become subject to the Public Service Act mobility provisions on or after 1 August 1998, other than persons included as PSS members by the Inclusion Declaration.  

Because the amendment to the Exclusion Declaration was made at the same time as the Inclusion Declaration was amended in relation to AGS employees, the amendment to the Exclusion Declaration had no effect on AGS employees. Nor does it have any retrospective effect on other persons.
Yours sincerely,
JOHN FAHEY

Dear Minister
I refer to the Judicial and Statutory Officers (Remuneration and Allowances) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.1), Statutory Rules 1999 No.171, which omit the offices of the Privacy Commissioner and the Director of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and set the annual rate of remuneration for the office of the Australian Electoral Commissioner.
The Explanatory Statement advises that the amendment made by item 1 in the Schedule removes the reference to the Privacy Commissioner from the Principal Regulations, as from 11 January 1999. However, that Statement does not explain why the Regulations are no longer to provide for the payment of remuneration of the Privacy Commissioner, nor why the removal of that office from the Regulations was done retrospectively.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice.

Dear Helen,
I refer to two separate letters from you each dated 23 September 1999. One letter sought advice on the retrospective removal of the Privacy Commissioner 
 from the Principal Regulations by the Judicial and Statutory Officers (Remuneration and Allowances) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1). The other sought confirmation that Remuneration Tribunal Determination 1999/11 was not in breach of section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (the A1 Act).
The Principal Regulations authorise salary maintenance arrangements for certain offices, as provided by section 8(1) of the Judicial and Statutory Officers (Remuneration and Allowances) Act 1984. Section 8(1) provides that, where an officer of the Australian Public Service or a full-time statutory office holder is appointed to another full-time statutory office that has a lower rate of salary than that previously received, regulations may be made to have the higher level of salary maintained.
Regulation 4 of the Principal Regulations provided salary maintenance arrangements for the former Privacy Commissioner. The regulation was no longer required as the person for whose benefit it was made resigned from the position with effect from 11 January 1999. Thus the retrospective application of the regulation does not disadvantage or impose a liability on the person contrary to section 48 of the A1 Act.
The second matter raised by you concerned Remuneration Tribunal Determination 1999/11 and its consistency with section 49A of the A1 Act. I am advised that officer level discussions have confirmed that section 49A of the A1 Act is not applicable to determinations made by the Tribunal.
Should you require further information in relation to these matters, the Departmental contact officer is Lembit Suur telephone 6275 4368.

Dear Minister
I refer to the National Health Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.4), Statutory Rules 1999 No.174, which extend various arrangements by which patients may be paid health insurance benefits for hospital type treatment rendered in community settings.
The amendment made by item 3 of the Schedule changes the benefit arrangements for private health insurance funds participating in the South Australian Psychiatric Patient Trial. The Explanatory Statement advises that there will no longer be a 
 minimum benefit payable, but `participating funds and facilities will be able to agree a benefit level which does not exceed the daily fees and charges incurred'. Thus, it would appear that this item replaces a minimum  level of benefit with one that is described in terms of the possible maximum  level of benefit. Is this sufficiently precise to ensure that patients may be adequately covered for such treatments?
The Committee would be grateful for your advice on how the change to the benefit arrangements will affect both the facilities and patients participating in this Trial.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 23 September 1999 to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Honourable Dr Michael Wooldridge, concerning benefit arrangements for private health insurance funds participating in the South Australian Psychiatric Patient Trial. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, I am responding on behalf of the Government.
The purpose of the amendment made by item 3 of the Schedule, which changes the benefit arrangements for private health insurance funds participating in the South Australian Psychiatric Patient Trial, is to allow the participating funds and facilities more flexibility to negotiate an agreed benefit level which does not exceed the daily fees and charges incurred.
The benefit paid would be the amount agreed by the particular parties involved (ie the health fund and the hospital). Under this arrangement patients will not incur out-of-pocket expenses associated with their hospital and community accommodation and/or services. The number of days for psychiatric care available to patients participating in the Trial will continue to be unlimited, that is, it will continue to be determined by clinical need.
I trust that this explanation clarifies the intent of the Amendment for the Committee. Thank you again for your interest in this matter.
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
I refer to the Workplace Relations Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.5), Statutory Rules 1999 No.205 which give effect to the Government's response to aspects of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters concerning the role of the Electoral Commission in conducting industrial elections.
New paragraph 60A(6)(a) of the Principal Regulations, inserted by item 1 of the Schedule to these Statutory Rules, creates a criminal offence of using information about voter rolls for `any purpose other than  a purpose in connection with the election'. Since that offence carries a maximum penalty of $1,100, it may be thought that the content of the offence might be more fully spelt out than merely by the reference to `a purpose in connection with the election'. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether this offence might be more fully defined.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 14 October 1999 concerning the Workplace Relations Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 5), Statutory Rules 1999 No. 205 which give effect to the Government response to certain of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommendations regarding the role of the Australian Electoral Commission in conducting industrial elections.
In your letter you have queried the wording of paragraph 60A(6)(a) of the Workplace Relations 
 Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 5), (inserted by item 1 of the Schedule to Statutory Rules 1999 No. 205). Paragraph 60A(6)(a) prohibits a person from using a voter roll for any purpose other than `(a) a purpose in connection with the election'. Breach of this provision carries a maximum penalty of 10 penalty units ($1,100).
You queried whether the wording of the new offence sufficiently details the type of uses of voter rolls that will contravene the provision.
The form of words used in drafting that paragraph is based on section 91A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Subsection 91A(1) of the Act prohibits a person from using information obtained from electoral rolls except for a permitted purpose. Breach of this provision carries a maximum penalty of 10 penalty units. Specifically, subsection 91A(2B) defines permitted purposes in relation to people, other than a Member of Parliament or members of political parties, in the same terms as paragraph 60A(6)(a) of the Workplace Relations Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 5).
I trust this information answers your query.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1999-11-29,"—I present the report of the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee on the provisions of the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 , together with submissions and Hansard  record of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I want to make it very clear to the Senate once again that the taking note of a report—even though it has been done—which has been referred to the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Commit 
 tee via the selection of bills process is a clear breach of the standing orders. This report is listed for consideration by the Senate within a couple of sitting days. The standing orders have determined that if a bill is referred to a legislation committee then it will be tabled and `received by the Senate without debate'. We are now about to embark on a debate. I understand from talking to the opposition that they are determined to debate this, and clearly Senator Ferguson would want to put the government's view in such a debate.
This is a practice that is pursued regularly and a standing order that is defied regularly—a very sound standing order, I might say, for those senators who like to see the Senate get on with its business in a timely manner—to embark upon a debate on a matter that is listed on the Notice Paper within, as I understand it, two sitting days. I will, I indicate, refer the use and misuse of this standing order to the Procedures Committee. Perhaps it may be better to come up with a standing order that has the respect of all senators because this one is continually abused.
—There is no point of order.
—Madam Deputy President, on the point of order.
—There is no point of order because leave was given by the chamber for this process to take place.
—I ask for leave to respond to that statement.
Leave granted.
—Briefly, the situation is that, having been requested to pursue the noting of this report, I did so at the whips' meeting this morning and understanding was reached. In fact, I was informed at that time that Senator Ferguson intended to seek leave to take note of the report, so I hardly think it is fair to suggest that he was doing so simply because the opposition was proposing to do the same. I remind Senator Ian Campbell that it would be quite in order for a senator to speak to the motion that the report be printed, and that would allow an opportunity to pursue the same course. But perhaps this is a more open and honest way of doing it.
—It is an abuse of the standing orders.
—I do not think it is an abuse, Senator Campbell. If a motion is moved there is an opportunity to speak on it, as I understand it. That has been exercised here before.
In terms of referring the matter to the Procedure Committee, it has, in most cases, been rather orderly when these matters are done by leave. I would have thought that the Procedure Committee would have regard to that. The opposition and others have, from time to time, sought leave to note particular committee reports. Leave has been granted on most but not all occasions, and this is no different.
—Order! It is the will of the Senate to allow this to be debated by leave.
—Before I commence, can I say that I made no request at the whips' meeting. This is something that I found out since then.
On 11 August the Senate referred to the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee for inquiry the provisions of the  Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 . The committee has looked at over 530 submissions and held eight days of hearings in four states and in Canberra. As all honourable senators will know, inquiries into legislation tend to attract far more submissions from individuals and organisations who oppose the legislation than from those who support it, and this inquiry has been no exception. An orchestrated campaign by the ACTU saw a great many like minded submissions, including pro-forma letters, received by the committee.
The committee's terms of reference broadly required it to look at two matters: the objects and impacts of the current Workplace Relations Act, and the provisions of the amendment bill. In regard to the first part of its terms of reference, the majority report concludes that the existing act has successfully implemented a further evolutionary stage in the reform of labour relations and has contri 
 buted significantly to wages, employment and productivity growth over the past three years. In fact, Senator Murray confirms this in his minority report when he talks about five tests for the effectiveness of the 1996 reforms and identifies in each case favourable outcomes. Senator Murray goes on in his minority report to point out that these were the key economic criteria that were set by Labor for the existing act, and the act has clearly delivered. Significantly, the act has contributed to historically low levels of industrial strife.
Those who allege that the existing legislation has had undesirable social consequences have failed to make their case. To the contrary, there is evidence that the existing legislation has had very positive social effects. With regard to the second part of the terms of reference, the majority report concludes that the amendments proposed in the 18 schedules of the bill introduce more flexibility into wage fixing agreements, simplify negotiation and dispute resolution processes and advance a culture of change in workplace relations through stronger and more effective freedom of association provisions.
Much of the evidence submitted to the committee by unions on both the operation of the Workplace Relations Act and the potential impact of the provisions contained in the amendment was unfavourable. In particular, they claimed that the legislation's consequences would include reduced job security, less equality of income distribution, increased pressure on families and a more adversarial employment relationship. Again, the unions failed to establish a causal link between these alleged consequences and the existing act or the proposed bill. Interestingly, the most frequently complained about provision related to the diminished role of unions in the proposed new workplace agreement negotiations. I will return to this issue in a moment.
A number of submissions received by the committee gave both broad support for the legislation as well as support for the legislation in detail. Some individual employers gave evidence, but most were content to allow their national bodies to represent their point of view. There was a general agreement from the business community that both the Work 
 place Relations Act and the current proposals were important steps in the evolutionary process of industrial relations reform, ensuring that Australia would be able to compete more effectively in the global marketplace. This evolution began with the legislation passed by the previous Labor government and has been pursued and developed since 1996.
Some witnesses, while generally happy with the broad direction of government reforms, were of the view that they did not go far enough, claiming that further deregulation would be needed if Australia were to substantially reduce its structural unemployment rate. This is consistent with the spirit of the bill, which acknowledges the need for continual and evolutionary reform. Senators who remember the long debate over the 1996 bill, which was subsequently passed by the Senate, will recall the gloomy predictions made then which have proven unfounded, yet the same critics persist in peddling the same myths. To the contrary, the evidence shows that since the implementation of the 1996 act we have enjoyed a greatly improved economic climate, to which this act has contributed.
The thrust of the new legislation follows the logic of incremental workplace reform over the past decade. The most important aspect of this policy has been to dismantle a monolithic labour market so that it can more flexibly service a widely diverse economy. Labour market and wages regulations policy over past decades was based on the notion that there was a single Australian economy with some segments subsidising others. The advent of the global economy rendered this policy both inoperable and incompatible with Australia's long-term economic interests.
The committee heard evidence of the campaign 2000 strategy planned by the AMWU, a drive by this union to institute a concerted industry-wide negotiation for a wage raise next year. This strategy fails to recognise that profit and productivity performances across the manufacturing sector vary. Market forces, in particular export markets, and shifts in investment and currency values, among other factors, determine the capacity of industry to pay higher wages. Despite massive improvements in productivity and 
 flexibility provided under the current act, it is clear that some unions have failed to recognise that a campaign like this is likely to result in retrenchments and industry closures.
The reality of this inquiry is that it has been ideologically driven by the ACTU and their representatives in this place. The Labor senators here owe much to their union masters, so much so that they have included a quote from practically every union and its supporters in what they call their minority report. That should ensure preselection support for many of them for a long time. Jennie George, the President of the ACTU, actually wrote to a committee member and listed the unions and supporters who want to give oral evidence to the inquiry. She said:
There are a number of matters I would like to raise with you re the Senate inquiry. Could we please make provision for some time to be set aside each day for individuals to make statements on the impact of the act.
She also says:
I note that Wollongong has been scheduled on the tentative agenda for October the 27th.
This is before the committee had decided on and confirmed any dates regarding where it was going to be. She thought they needed a second hearing day in Sydney, which we acceded to, as we did in Melbourne. Otherwise, she felt that many key presentations would be missed. She then recommends the list of unions that she wanted to attend. There are others, including Professor McCallum, the Young Christian Workers Movement, the Uniting Church, non-English speaking women, Asian women at work and the Fair Wear Campaign. They were all there, and we heard the lot.
She also said that she would like the ACTU to have an opportunity to respond on the last hearing date. We did not have hearings in Adelaide, but she said that she wanted Keith Hancock and Barbara Pocock to give evidence. We made sure that they had the opportunity to come to Canberra so that they could be heard. In Perth, she noted the people she wanted there. In reality, it was driven by the ACTU and was continued by the Labor senators in this place. We heard them all ad 
 nauseam say that they support the submission of the ACTU.
Another pro forma letter said in general terms:
I don't know why you sent me this letter in my mailbox saying I must write a letter to the committee by Friday the 17th to let you know I am not working, which I still want to. I know what I did was wrong, but if I do get my job back again, I won't go to any other things but work. And I want to stop this legislation being passed in the Senate, so this is my letter.
If getting people to put in pro forma letters is not some form of coercion, I do not know what is.
We need to remember that the union movement represents less than one-third of the work force in Australia. Their `just say no' campaign is really just a Jennie George recruiting drive to try to boost a falling membership, which has now fallen to below one-third of the work force. Many of those who say they are supporting the `just say no' campaign have no idea what is in the bill. They are just blindly following union propaganda, and that was obvious from the committee hearings. The Labor Party report mentioned the Victorian government submission, which was received after the committee had completed its initial report.
I firstly thank those members of the secretariat, who worked very hard in a very short time frame to make sure that this report was possible. They worked very hard during the hearings and in writing the report. I also thank senators on this committee for the way that they conducted themselves during this inquiry. There were a number of hearings. I thank them for the way that they conducted themselves.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-11-29,"—Senator Ferguson, I am sorry, but that is one of the most sorrowful performances I have ever seen you make. I will highlight a couple of areas, because one of the comments that you have made in relation to one of the individual submissions is actually quite offensive. But let me go back to my more general comments. I was going to commence by reminding the Senate that this inquiry was meant to be a review of the 1996 
 legislation. As I understand the arrangements reached between the government and the Democrats, they actually were that the government would chair the inquiry and that the government would have the majority membership on the inquiry, as part of the deal that you would review the current act. So let us take a step back when we are making assertions about the ACTU orchestrating or controlling events: how on earth could they have orchestrated or controlled events when the government is chairing the committee and the government has the majority on the committee?
But let me go further to my comments on the quality of the government's report. Unfortunately—and it is, again, a cause of my sorrow—the government's report goes nowhere near reviewing the overwhelming evidence we received through our inquiries about the effect of the current act. Chapter 2 of the report purports to do this over somewhere between 12 and 15 pages, and that is all, of the report.
—Because it is working so well.
—Senator Ferguson, not because it is working well—
—Senator Collins, address the chair, please.
—You will note that there is a preface to the minority reports of both Labor and the Democrats, expressing our concern that it was unfortunate that many important issues were not adequately canvassed in the majority report. My sorrow is also that, with Senator Ferguson as chair, other members of the committee have felt the need to do this—because, as you have already foreshadowed, your reputation as a chair of committees is one of relative unbias and of good management of hearings. Unfortunately, this has not been translated into the quality of the report and, from your comments today, the quality of the tabling statement. My sorrow is that you have allowed the reputation of the minister for misrepresentation to be spread to yourself and, unfortunately—
—Order! Do not reflect upon the minister.
—I withdraw that, Madam Deputy President. Unfortunately, the evidence has had the effect, it appears, of causing absolute and complete denial. When I look at the fact that you often refer to how much impact that evidence we have received recently and in the past has had in relation to outworkers, I am absolutely astounded that you could represent the evidence of an outworker in the way that you just did in your statement. The statement you referred to was—
—Order! Address the chair, please, Senator Collins.
—Sorry. The statement referred to was from a witness who obviously responded to a request that problems be highlighted to this committee. This witness obviously had a very poor and limited understanding of English and, for you to misrepresent it in the way you have done—
—Order! Address the chair.
—Through you, Madam Deputy President—
—`To' me, not `through' me.
—The representation of that evidence was offensive. I have already referred to the preface of the minority reports, and we highlight in those all the areas that we believe are important to review the current act. We also refer to the fact that the Labor senators' report, in its nature and length, attempts to address these issues so that the inquiry's terms of reference and the depth of the evidence provided to this inquiry are more fully reflected. We cover many areas and again express concern that those areas were not picked up in the majority report.
I now move on to the areas where we have reviewed the process as a whole. Unfortunately, at this stage I need to note something and, so that I do not run out of time before I do this, in the context of noting this I will also make some comments thanking the secretariat and addressing their work in this process. There is a page missing from the printed document. It appears that there has been an 
 error in the printroom as this document was produced. It basically commences our concluding remarks in our overview of the report.
In saying this, I want to stress that the work of the secretariat on this matter has, beyond question, been more than any senator could anticipate. Unfortunately, despite the minister suggesting that the government would report early so that we could report early in this process, the chair then took an additional two weeks to complete the chair's draft, and we were left with essentially less than a week to conclude minority reports during a sitting week. As a consequence of that, the reader will probably find a number of grammatical or typographical errors throughout this report and, again, the printing error that one of the pages is missing. I would like to thank, in particular, Bevan Kirk and Penny Shakespeare for the work that they have put in during the past week in that climate, where we have sought to do what the chair should have done and what he in fact had promised Senator Murray and me that he would to—and that was to adequately canvass the evidence that was put to the committee on the impact of the 1996 act. His denial here today is simply not good enough. The evidence is there and it can be seen to some limited extent through the content of our report.
Given the chair's earlier comments about the process, I have been provoked to make one additional comment. Given that we received two copies of a particular chapter of his report, one of those copies highlighted that the chair has deliberately sought to minimise employee concerns raised in this process and has withdrawn evidence that the secretariat was putting forward as an unbiased description of the evidence that had been put before us. Here is a clear example of the chair actually seeking deliberately to misrepresent it. Unfortunately, Senator Ferguson, that matter is what leaves you open to the accusation of allowing executive interference—because I do not believe that you would do that of your own motion. Now, going back through the chair—
—`To' the chair, please; not `through' the chair.
—Tell her about eight times and she will finally get it.
—Madam Deputy Chair, Senator Campbell is obviously irritated that we are taking time on this here today so, at this point, I will move on to the matter which is the other area of misrepresentation. Senator Ferguson assured me, I think it was yesterday or the day before, that he would make a motion to his people that we should have the opportunity to speak on this report. As I understand the situation, despite Senator Ferguson's comments today, his whip did raise that request at the whips meeting. Let us get those facts correct for Senator Campbell so he can take up his problems with his own people.
I want to highlight our conclusion, given the fact that some of the printed copies at least will not deal with these issues. The conclusion of our minority report commences:
Overall, the Labor senators conclude that the evidence provided to the committee demonstrates that the Workplace Relations Act 1996 is regressive and has had serious and far-reaching negative social impacts, particularly on the most disadvantaged Australian workers. In addition, there is a paucity of evidence to support the need to extend further deregulation on the labour market as proposed in this bill.
Labor senators do not claim to come to the above issues without preconceptions, but the evidence that came before the committee was overwhelming; in particular, the opinions of ordinary people who sent in submissions opposing this bill, condemning the changes in 1996 for the damage it had done to their work, their health, their family lives, their friends and the community; also, eminent persons such as Professors Hancock, McCallum and Isaacs; academics like doctors Peats, Pocock, Hall; and community groups, lawyers, unions, public servants and even employers.
Some employers made a real effort to leave political allegiances aside and to deal with the issues before us in a dispassionate and thoughtful manner. Notable for their constructive contributions were the Australian Industry Group—but Senator Ferguson would not let them come back at the end of the process in Canberra—the Victorian Automotive Chamber of Commerce and the Australian Catholic Centre for Employment Relations. 
As I have said, unfortunately the majority report does not reflect much of this evidence. This is unfortunate for those who made an effort to contribute to the committee's inquiry. The inability to deal honestly and constructively with the thoughtful contributions of so many people and organisations does no credit to the majority, to the Senate or to the parliament.
I also thank my staff—and I have raised the issue of the extraordinary circumstances—and, in particular, I thank an intern whom I have had working on one component of this report, Helen Nezaritis. I conclude with the comments that, for the record, Minister Reith has got it wrong.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-11-29,"—I rise to comment briefly on the report of the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee on the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 . When you hear Senator Collins and Senator Ferguson having a go at each other, you need to remind yourself that they actually get on quite well and have a good working relationship. They are the same team that was there in 1996. I want to personally thank the committee chair and Senator Collins for allowing a committee process which has to consider very contentious material to be conducted in a well-mannered, orderly and helpful manner.
I recognise that each disagrees with the other's position, but the committee process does allow one to put down whatever report one feels is appropriate. Certainly, the government has put down its report. We have put down a 12-page report and Senator Collins—and maybe it is an all-time record for a minority report—has put down a report of about  260 pages. I regret that I have not yet had the chance to read it, but I am sure that I will have the chance before next week when we have to deal with it. Despite what we have just heard, the attitude of the chair is gratefully recorded by my party. Some chairs of some committees do not handle the management and the process well and so it is very helpful when you have someone from the government side who does.
Having said that, I move on to the substance of the report from the Democrat perspective. One thing needs to be said again and again about workplace relations legislation—and, indeed, perhaps about much of the legislation that we deal with: the emphasis is far too much on economic outcomes and far too little on social outcomes. That is one of the government's great weaknesses in proposing the changes—and they are very wide-ranging changes as we are talking about 300 pages of legislation and 18 schedules—because, on the economic side, there is really not much call for the act to be further changed.
On any analysis, this country has now got higher productivity, higher employment, higher real wages, significantly reduced industrial disputation and more reasonable national wage case safety-net increases than it used to have. On those grounds, whilst there is always a case to be made for evolutionary or modest reform, there is not that much desire or need for major economic reform. On the social side, there is a much stronger case for reform, but probably not in the way that the government would want; that is, there is a greater need for attention to work and family relationships; to the issues of job insecurity which are still out there in the community; to the issues resulting from a very heavy casualisation of our work force; and to issues of being trained and skilled for a rapidly changing work environment, both in the technological and the organisational sense. However, if you look at the submissions that came through to us, the concentration of criticism of the bill was primarily on the social side rather than the economic side.
The Democrats took the view that this bill, overall, should be split into three. I will read from my report which explains exactly what I mean. I said:
The inquiry has convinced me that a number of schedules have very little merit overall and should be rejected outright.
I rejected eight schedules in my recommendations. Those eight include schedule 1, objects; schedule 4, conciliation; schedule 5, mediation; schedule 6, awards; schedule 8, certified agreements; schedule 9, Australian 
 Workplace Agreements; schedule 12, secret ballots; and schedule 16, independent contractors. Later on in the report I detail my findings.
I then went on and said that there was a second set which should be considered. To quote from my report:
There are five schedules of relatively low importance (except No 15) which are worthy of due consideration. In its submission, the ACTU, despite its `just say no' campaign, did not even comment on these five schedules. I can only conclude that this is because these schedules either contain good legislation for employees, (Schedule 15 contains clauses which materially and beneficially assist Victorian employees), or are quite modest in effect.
The five schedules are schedule 3, Employment Advocate; schedule 10, relevant and designated awards; schedule 15, Victoria; schedule 17, miscellaneous amendments; and schedule 18, amendments of other acts. I remind all those people who in all honesty and commitment write or ring or email my office, without ever having turned a page of the legislation, that the ACTU did not have a single thing to say about five of those schedules. So the `just say no' campaign, on those grounds alone, becomes exposed.
I then picked up the third category. I wrote:
The remaining schedules have major provisions that should be rejected and other clauses which need amendment. These schedules nevertheless retain substance worth considering further.
They are schedule 2, the Industrial Relations Commission; schedule 7, termination of employment; schedule 11, industrial action; schedule 13, right of entry; and schedule 14, freedom of association. However, before the proponents of the bill get too excited, in every single one of those schedules I have rejected the government's major propositions.
In the time that is left, I want to pick on a few schedules. The first relates to awards. When you boil the concerns of ordinary employees down, their major concerns are pay and conditions. That is what an employee is concerned about. The unions, their organisers, their officials and their leaders are much more concerned with the mechanics of industrial action, right of entry and all that sort of stuff. But for the ordinary employee it is pay and conditions. Therefore, I want to focus, for the 
 ordinary employee, on the award side. Although unions now represent a little more than a quarter of all workers, awards—even federal awards—affect far more than just a quarter of employees. For me, this was one of the least attractive schedules in the bill.
I pulled out some figures which, fortunately, had been issued by the Industrial Relations Commission. I wrote:
In 1997, there were 3197 federal awards. As at 31 October 1999 359 awards—
or about 10 per cent—
had been simplified, a huge number (1245) had been set aside or deemed to have ceased operation—
in other words, they were out of date or no longer relevant; that is about 35 per cent of all awards—
1172 were undergoing simplification and 363 were still to begin simplification.
When you are in the middle of a major process like that you would have to ask yourself why you would want to stir up the workers in the way that they have been stirred up on the awards issue. The minister will mention union picnic days. I do not think union picnic days should be in awards, but that is not a reason to attack the whole process when we are in the middle of award simplification.
My problem with much of this bill is that it is too early, too much, too soon. It is unnecessary and it does not address the fundamental problems, which are social and not economic. Furthermore, it includes the usual healthy dose of union bashing which I think is unhelpful in moving us on to a better way, a less adversarial way, of dealing with industrial relations in the future. Lastly, I note in the submission from the Victorian government that they support a unitary industrial relations system and so do I. (Time expired)
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,"<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MORE JOBS, BETTER PAY) BILL 1999</title>","<title>Report of Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee</title>",Bills,8,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-29,"—I oppose this legislation on the new business tax system. It is regressive. It ducks the opportunity to do far better by the Australian community as far as tax reform is concerned. It gives the advantages to the rich. It takes from the poor. It leaves the added threat that there will be a squeeze on the ability of government to pay for services to the whole of the community further down the line when the degree to which there is a shortfall in income because of this tax package becomes obvious.
The tax package is built upon the ideology that, if you cut the company tax rate from 36 to 30 per cent and balance it in other ways, you will in some way improve things for business. Regardless of that debate about business, what about the community? The reality is that the community will be badly served. This will increasingly lead to a shortfall of tax in the future but, that aside, I can remember a different argument being put by the Keating government when the corporate tax rate was reduced from 39 per cent to 36 per cent.
In those days, it was going to be a stimulus for jobs—that is, there was going to be a trickle down and a flow-on to the average Australian. What in effect happened was nothing of the sort. The money went straight across to the profit line and, in the following years, there was an added profit in the corporate sector and to the shareholders in the community who are not, by and large, the workers or, even to this date, average Australians. I do not believe this is going to move towards the fairer society which the big parties ascribe to.
The second component of this formula for business tax reform essentially is to halve the rate of the capital gains tax so that those on 
 the top marginal rate will see that drop from 48½ per cent to 24¼ per cent. It effectively means that people who are paying tax on capital gains rather than on labour are going to have a windfall. Mark Latham, an honourable member of the House of Representatives, was speaking on this matter very recently. He said:
. . . the proposed changes to the capital gains tax will provide an average gain of $149 a year to people with taxable incomes below $20,700 and a gain of $6,500 a year to people earning between $100,000 and $500,000. These proposals . . . entrench the guiding light and symbol of taxation policy of the Howard government: the more you earn the bigger the tax cut.
Mr Mark Latham went on to say:
The first law of good tax policy is: do no harm; treat all parts of the economy, all types of investment and all types of revenue the same; don't distort investment decisions; don't open up avoidance techniques; don't tax capital at a lower rate than income; don't give the land speculator on the Gold Coast a lower tax rate than the small IT company trying to trade in products and income; don't give doctors buying in and out of private hospitals a lower rate of tax than the local service franchise trying to build up its business activity; don't give the smarties who milk the market for short-term gain a lower rate of tax than those who use their intelligence and know-how to actually develop products and markets . . . ; don't reward the great Australian disease of property trading and punish the knowledge economy; . . . 
I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Latham on this matter. He went on to say:
Labor—
in government—
wanted to create an economy in which you could turn a dollar by being creative, not by being a speculator.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Unfortunately, these tax changes . . . are going back to the future. They are going back to the old culture, the old ways and all the distortion and corruption that came with it.
Yet here today we have Labor spurning that commonsense from one of its more formidable debaters and backing the government in this matter which will help the big end of town against the average Australian. So, on both counts—that is, the reduction in the corporate tax rate and the reduction in the capital gains tax—I am opposed to this 
 because it is regressive, because it does help the big end of town and because commonsense, as expostulated by Mr Latham, would have us going in a different direction.
A number of different directions could be taken. I favour to put before the Senate one from the Australian Conservation Foundation which is much more in keeping with modern tax practice in Europe, including more recently the United Kingdom where there is a Labour government, than the Howard philosophy now backed by the Labor Party in this place. The Australian Conservation Foundation recommends, of course, emissions trading as a business energy tax and comments that a major opportunity here would be to introduce a business energy tax or a suitably designed carbon emissions trading scheme. They have those in Scandinavia and have had them in Germany for years. The ACF goes on to say:
This would have substantial advantages for both meeting our greenhouse targets—
about which the Minister for the Environment and Heritage was tearing his hair out here in the Senate and blaming state governments for the troubles along that road—
and also for enhancing the productivity of Australian industry.
The ACF says:
Importantly, the revenue from the UK business energy tax is recycled back to business to ensure overall competitiveness of industry is not reduced. Most carbon taxes in Europe operate in this manner.
The ACF suggests that, in the Australian context, the revenue be used to reduce or eliminate payroll tax, thereby boosting employment uptake. In the context of revenue neutrality for business tax reform, the additional revenue of business energy tax is also a potentially important component. On a second matter, the Australian Conservation Foundation says:
Taxation related measures can be used to enhance reduction, reuse and recycling of waste in Australia.
This is not a matter that we hear much about in this place—certainly not from the minister for the environment—but it is a matter that is very much in the public domain. There is enormous frustration in Australia about the 
 failure of the so-called voluntary recycling packs that industry has put in the way all around the country, except South Australia, to prevent legislation for compulsory recycling of reusable products. The Australian Conservation Foundation has suggested that the best way to do this is through a waste tax or levy. It went on to point out:
Waste minimisation and recycling of used resource materials are immediate ways in which we can reduce total resource consumption while also generating additional jobs. The critical issue for successful recycling programs is the development of markets for the products which emerge. Where insufficient attention has been paid to this aspect—
and that is the case with many of the so-called voluntary schemes by industry—
the recycling schemes have run rapidly into problems of over production and low demand. Programs for the development of markets for recycled products have been successfully used overseas—for example, in Minnesota and in New York State. Analysis shows that in Minnesota the Recycled Products Market Development Program led to the generation of 1,700 jobs and $39.1 million in additional wages, as well as positive environmental outcomes.
In New York State, a similar program is run for $8 million per annum and funded by an oil levy. Its feasibility grants program, with funds in excess of $1 million, has created 380 jobs.
I might add that the South Australian experience, where recycling has been in for some decades—the seminal experience in Australia—has resulted in 700 to 1,000 jobs being created, a much cleaner environment and a much less wasteful community. It wins in all directions.
A third option for business tax reform that the Australian Conservation Foundation points to is natural resource management. The foundation believes that considerable gains in nature conservation can be achieved by changes and cites the recent paper `Philanthropy, Sustaining the land', which draws on the work of Carl Benny and Mike Young from the CSIRO and which outlines changes, two of which directly relate to the treatment of capital gains. They are:
Firstly, to encourage greater private contributions, allowing all donations of property to conservation trusts, which would need to be established by legislation, to be tax deductible over five years and exempt from capital gains tax. Property would 
 include land, physical and financial assets, conservation covenants, bargain sales of land, donations of land with an occupation retained, and donations of assets for which a limited lifetime annuity is paid.
Secondly, to facilitate the creation of private conservation reserves, provide the following tax incentives to land covered by a conservation covenant. These should include access to tax donations of the 34 per cent Landcare rebate for costs associated with managing land covered by conservation covenants and allowing private conservation reserves to be negatively geared and giving their owners primary producer status.
Good gracious, we have actually come up with an ethical reason for negative gearing! It is one the government should look at.
Finally, I will point to the Australian Conservation Foundation's idea of an employer provided tax exempt public transport pass. The ACF states:
The business tax reform process provides the opportunity to introduce a public transport initiative that is currently law in the United States.
It is not speculative but law there already, and it is likely to become law in Canada. It continues:
One change, for example, in the United States is to allow up to $780 a year of an employee's gross income to be used for transit expenses. The money spent on commuting is not taxed so employees can save $300 a year if they use the maximum amount. Employers save on payroll taxes and other costs they are required to pay on money set aside by their employees. Of course you get a transfer of people off the roads into public transport.
The ACF says:
Based on experience in the United States, a report to the Canadian government estimates transit increases of 30 to 60 per cent—
that is people going across to public transport—
if tax reforms are implemented to encourage employer provided public transport. There has been a 31 per cent increase in transit use amongst participating employees in the San Fransico Bay area. An estimated 17 million vehicle miles were removed from their roads, 61 million tonnes of pollutants were avoided and $1.6 million of new transit revenue was generated, of course to allow for the improvement of public transport.
There are far better answers than this regressive taxation which the Howard government has come up with and so strangely the Labor 
 Party has given the nod to. I cannot understand why there has not been opposition to these taxes in this place. Senator Murray is going to speak shortly and may be able to enlighten us more on the options put to the federal government by the Democrats.
It is a very bad pass indeed that a Labor opposition committed to social equity and committed to closing the gap between the rich and poor should be supporting this very regressive gift to the rich, a package for the big end of town coming from the Howard government. I hear that there are political reasons for that, but I do not accept them. What we have is an unfortunate circumstance for the average Australian where the Democrats have supported the goods and services tax proposal, which itself is regressive. Remember, it is a $3 billion per annum gift to the big transport and mining corporations, with some of it going to loggers as well: that is more than it is costing us to have our armed services in East Timor. That $3 billion is going to the big corporations in Australia at a time when the GST is going to hit people right across the country when they go to their local grocery shop.
The gift is not to the people really; as a whole, the gift has been to the big end of town. Now the government brings in a tax package which compounds that inequity, and the Labor Party is supporting it. The Greens have consistently opposed regressive taxes. There are better options, as I have outlined. I think it is very unfortunate for this country that it has been so easy for the government to get one opposition party and then the other in a bidding opportunity, which they have taken the bait on, to support bringing in a double whammy of regressive taxes this year. It is going to lead ultimately to a less fair society, a growing of the gap between rich and poor, and that means social problems down the line for this country of ours. Those problems are not just put on the sideboard; they are real problems. As the gap between rich and poor grows in this country, it is a prescription for enmity, it is a prescription for an increased crime rate and it is a prescription for a blighting of the hopes of those people who want their children to inherit a fairer country—not 
 one in which capital is able, through the political system, to get the accelerated advantage all the way down the line. I oppose this legislation.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CAPITAL GAINS TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-11-29,"—In speaking to the new business tax system bills, I have to begin by addressing this question of revenue neutrality, although the issues of equity and good tax policy need to be fully covered in the debate as well. The government asserts that business tax reform will, despite being revenue negative in 2001-02, be revenue positive over its first five years—that is, the years 2000 to 2005—to the tune of around $1.27 billion. For any forecaster, the estimation of revenue up to five years into the future is fraught with difficulty and uncertainty. Treasury witnesses have pointed out that revenue estimates, even a year into the future, have a considerable margin for error. Government revenue figures are of such a magnitude that such errors in forecasting can translate into billions of dollars and the Treasury relies on `overs and unders' to balance the effects.
The Democrats do not believe that the business tax package, as it stands, will be revenue neutral. Importantly, neither do Labor, who have clearly said in their report that the package is not revenue neutral by $3.8 billion initially and then by a subsequent unnamed amount later on. In the interests of politics, not policy, and contrary to its committee senators' views, Labor's executive have now accepted a symbolic anti-avoidance amendment coupled with a touching trust in Treasurer Costello, rather than negotiating real safeguards.
The Democrats, in contrast, have concluded that the behavioural assumptions on the capital gains tax cuts provide for an overoptimistic estimate of likely revenue gains which knocks more than $2.5 billion out of the forward estimates, leaving the budget in the red by around $1.49 billion over five years. It is my view the Democrats were close to negotiating hundreds of millions of dollars of safeguards in return for our support for what is, in many respects, a very good package. 
In our report we concluded that the capital gains tax cuts in their current form are likely to lead to considerable tax avoidance, more than that allowed for by Treasury. We concluded too that in the longer term the `growth dividend' may not plug the very considerable hole in the forward estimates beyond five years as the revenue effects of changes to accelerated depreciation wash out. Against that, the Democrats recognise that Treasury has been conservative in its estimates of revenue gains from some measures such as the `growth dividend', the personal services income initiative and the option 2 higher level reform.
The OECD has warned that maintaining the budget in surplus is essential, given Australia's large current account deficit, to maintain financial market confidence. An expansionary fiscal policy providing business tax cuts above those of the personal income tax cuts is simply not responsible. Business tax must pay its way and, if possible, contribute additional revenue to the budget. For these reasons, the Democrats believe that conservative assumptions should be used in calculating business tax revenue effects.
As outlined in the main committee report, the key weakness in the revenue figuring behind the Ralph report does lie in the capital gains tax proposals, particularly in the treatment of tax realisations. The Democrats conclude that Ralph was overoptimistic in assuming that a cut in capital gains tax will deliver an elasticity of 1.7 in the short term and 0.9 in the long term. Labor senators in the committee had a similar view. The more recent research projects referred to by Dr Gravelle and Professor Auerbach in the evidence show quite clearly that these estimates are far too generous. Dr Gravelle outlined in detail her conclusion that the short-term elasticity is likely to be closer to 0.6 and the longer term to 0.2. Private sector Australian economist Dr John Edwards, in his submission to the inquiry, said:
I frankly doubt we would see it on anything like the scale implied by the elasticity estimate.
The Democrats believe that, in erring on the side of caution, the elasticity estimates used 
 should be those proposed by Dr Gravelle rather than those adopted in the Ralph report.
The generosity of the lower capital gains tax is also likely to lead to an increase in tax avoidance, particularly because of the retention of 100 per cent deduction for negative gearing, despite only a 50 per cent capital gains tax. Professor Rick Krever, economist Dr John Edwards and United States proponent of capital gains tax cuts Alan Reynolds, in evidence, warned that this combination was likely to lead to an increase in tax avoidance. Dr Edwards warned that negative gearing was in fact on the rise in the equities market. He said:
Negative gearing is now, even with the current capital gains tax, a hugely popular strategy. In most banking institutions, for example, marginal lending into equities is the most rapidly growing part of their business. You can see it in the housing finance figures. There are huge increases in individual credits lent on the security of houses which are going into the stock market or into other properties.
The Ralph report, in dealing with the ability to negatively gear non-commercial losses, originally carved out a continuing exemption for rental properties but not for shares. The government, in its stage 2 response, broadened this to also include shares without any indication of why or any adjustment to the revenue costing.
Professor Chris Evans suggested in evidence that even a slight movement in tax planning from earned income to capital gains would reduce the revenue take considerably. He found that a one per cent movement of converting income into capital would cost $359 million in annual revenue, based on the 1996-97 tax stat figures. In 1996-97, negative gearing cost the tax system around $937 million in tax forgone on losses on rental properties alone. Just a 10 per cent increase in negative gearing would cost around $94 million a year. Professor Krever and Dr Edwards also warned that the tax arbitrage effect was likely to be higher than predicted by Treasury.
Given these sorts of risks, the Democrats believe that the tax arbitrage effect allowed for in the Ralph estimates of a maximum of $180 million a year in lost tax due to the conversion of income to capital is likely to be 
 an understatement, given the size of this capital gains tax cut. The Democrats conclude that the capital gains tax gains to revenue have been overstated and that the loss to revenue has been understated. By correcting for these effects, we conclude that the package, rather than being revenue positive by $1.267 billion, as claimed by the government, is in fact revenue negative to the tune of $1.49 billion.
The Ralph report forecasts a very high growth dividend flowing through from the tax changes. This growth dividend is essential to the package being revenue neutral over the medium and longer term. Any shock to the economy would affect that growth dividend. The report makes a judgment that the reforms would deliver a growth dividend of 0.75 per cent of GDP by 2009, which the report says is `likely to be conservative'. This would deliver a revenue gain by 2004-05 of $650 million, which is rounded down to a conservative $500 million in the Ralph report tables. The government, in its official press releases, halves this figure again to a $250 million growth dividend in 2004-05. However, the importance of the growth dividend is in the medium term to offset the wind down of accelerated depreciation. The Ralph report claims that its 0.75 per cent growth dividend would push the revenue gain to $1.8 billion by 2009-10.
Chris Murphy's modelling supported the view that there would be a growth dividend in the long run—that is, 10 years—which would be a boost of 1.5 per cent to GDP. He concludes:
There would be a substantial growth dividend out of all of that in terms of government revenue.
That is the kind of figuring that the Labor Party and the coalition are relying on. However, Dr Matt Benge and Professor Peter Dixon disagreed with this assessment, coming to the tentative conclusion—on what, it must be admitted, was very limited data—that the overall effect of the package was likely to be negative on new investment and hence on long-term GDP growth. Senator Cook in particular seemed attracted by Professor Dixon's evidence.
Long-run modelling is very difficult to make firm conclusions on, particularly given the limited material in front of this inquiry and the limited experience of the modellers in terms of the parameters being addressed. The Democrats would be reluctant to rely on high assumptions of revenue gains from a growth dividend which may or may not arrive. We note that the government are running on a growth dividend of less than 40 per cent of that forecast by Ralph, and we commend their conservatism in this regard. The reliance on the growth dividend to fund the package in the medium to long term highlights the importance of ensuring that the package is robustly revenue neutral or indeed revenue positive in the short to medium term.
The Democrats welcome the decision of the government to proceed with the stage 2 tax integrity measures with full effect from 1 July 2000. We also note the current determination of the government to proceed with the entities taxation scheme—that is, taxing trusts as companies—from 1 July 2001. We hope Labor's poor negotiation does not result in this being watered down. These items are very important to the funding of this package and the ANTS package. Any watering down or further deferral of their commencement dates will have serious implications for the revenue neutrality of the package.
The amount of revenue involved is quite considerable. The tax integrity measures in stage 1 and stage 2 total $1 billion in 2000-01, rising to $1.49 billion by 2004-05. Similarly, the trusts measure was estimated to raise $900 million in its first year, falling to $430 million by the third year, although these figures did assume a 36 per cent company tax rate. If any of these measures are watered down considerably, the capacity of the budget to fund a $3 billion company tax rate cut is brought into doubt. Any talk about chasing rats up the drainpipe will not change that situation. While we appreciate that the task of drafting the personal service income and trust legislation is daunting, we believe that such legislation should be considered and passed before the company tax rate cut takes effect on 1 July 2000. Indeed, the one should be contingent on the other. That is what we 
 would have negotiated, and we will move amendments to this effect.
The cost of negative gearing to revenue is enormous—$937 million in 1996-97 on rental properties alone. This inquiry has heard that cuts to the capital gains tax rate are, when aligned with negative gearing, likely to lead to considerable further revenue erosion. Halving the negative gearing concession in line with the 50 per cent capital gains tax rate would save around $470 million a year. Few other countries in the world, including the United States, Canada and the UK, still allow negative gearing. Negative gearing, in our opinion, promises to be an even greater revenue loss in the future, taken in conjunction with the capital gains tax cuts. The Democrats believe that the option 2 reforms have considerable scope to reduce corporate tax avoidance and tax planning. It is impossible to estimate this amount, but we note that the alternative minimum company tax in the United States, which operated on a similar principle, increased revenue collections by seven per cent in its first year.
The cut in company tax has the undesirable and perhaps unintended consequence of cutting the effective tax concession on research and development from 9 cents in the dollar to 7.5 cents in the dollar. Geoffrey Lehmann, a witness to the inquiry, has calculated that to restore the R&D concession to its real incentive rate would require an increase in the concession from its present 125 per cent to 130 per cent at an annual cost to revenue of $97 million. Another issue is the question of maintaining or assisting viability for major projects, such as those outlined in the submission by the Australian Gas Light Company. This whole cost area remains very vague in government announcements today but, with the loss of accelerated depreciation, plainly needs more clarity for such businesses.
The last issue I will mention here is the delay until 1 July 2001 in introducing the simplified tax system for small business. Ideally, those small businesses that wish to should be given the option of moving onto that beneficial new system from 1 July 2000. There may be too great a cost to revenue in bringing forward this measure. However, it 
 seems foolish not to allow new small businesses that start up in the year 2000-01 to go straight onto that system rather than start with one system and have to change to a better system less than 12 months later.
In the time remaining to me, I want to move to some of the political issues. We are well aware, and the government is well aware, that the Labor Party have agreed to this package not because they do not believe their senators about the weaknesses in the bills and in the revenue calculations but because they wish to clear the decks for an attack on the GST and the ANTS tax package. All that is so obvious and so evident, but the problem for them is that if—as I expect—the income tax cuts, the social welfare improvements, the compensation measures and the implementation of the GST come out in a favourable manner or in a manner which has far fewer effects than otherwise they would expect, the Labor Party are going to be left without much of an election strategy.
Given that Senator Conroy gave us some gratuitous advice in his remarks, I thought I should assist you with some measures which might help when you go out and campaign for the next election. You have to prove that you can count on the $10 billion black hole which you left the government. You have to prove to the community that you can count on the l-a-w tax cuts. Remember the l-a-w law tax cuts? Then you have to be able to tell the community that you can count on the Olympics tickets and how you distribute those sorts of things. You have to be able to tell them that you can count on the Collins submarine contract. You have to be able to tell them that you can count on the WA Inc. mess that you left in WA and other disgraceful Labor Victorian and South Australian disasters.
You have to prove that you are able to count on the GST numbers. You have to prove that you are able to count on the Ralph numbers. The problem hanging around your neck is this vision of Labor as poor economic managers. If the coalition could add a bit of heart to their money skills, I think Labor would never govern in Australia again. Every time you stand up and talk about money and about numbers, you get a problem. The 
 problem with the Collins class party—as I have described them, noisy and ineffective—is that they are also the party that cannot say sorry. You cannot say sorry for your awful East Timor policy and the way you deserted the Australians' allies. You cannot say sorry for the White Australia policy which you began. You cannot say sorry for making the rich richer and the poor poorer during your time in office. You cannot say sorry for economic rationalism and all its extremes. You cannot say sorry for corrupt party practices. You cannot say sorry for branch stacking, thuggery and mendacity.
—Senator Murray, I wonder what this has to do with the bills before us.
—The chair at that time allowed this kind of remark to be entered into during the debate, and I am merely responding to the allegations of how the next election has to be run.
—Perhaps you could direct your response towards the bills before the chamber.
—The point I make, through the chair, is this: if the Labor Party are going to clear the decks for a campaign against the GST and if they find out that the GST actually settles in very well—the income tax cuts settle in very well, the social security payments settle in very well and the environmental issues settle in well—they are going to have to have a strategy which enables them to face up to that election. I am just suggesting to them there are a few areas which they need to be able to address as well as the GST, because their whole strategy is to clear the decks and just deal with the GST. In view of the kinds of remarks made by Senator Conroy in his second reading debate address, I thought I should give him some gratuitous advice as well. Later on, when I have time, I will read at length from the clippings of the newspapers today as to what they thought of Labor's inability to negotiate a good outcome with the government. To the government, I must congratulate you on playing a very good hand. You got the better deal.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CAPITAL GAINS TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-11-29,"—Thank you, Senator Murray, for those kind comments at the end of your remarks. The New Business Tax System (Income Tax Rates) Bill (No. 1) 1999  and the five related bills represent the first and second groups of bills introduced into the parliament which will implement a new business tax system for Australia. There are six bills in all which implement many of the government's landmark reforms to business tax. The government's business tax reforms build on the significant reforms that it has already legislated. In relation to indirect and personal income tax, more legislation will follow in the new year.
The business tax reforms that the government announced on 21 September and 11 November this year represent the culmination of 12 months of consultation with the Australian business community—an unparalleled degree of consultation. As I have said so often in this chamber before, this government is a consultative government. This consultation was led by three businessmen: Mr John Ralph AO, Mr Rick Allert and Mr Bob Joss. The review of business tax which was chaired by Mr Ralph was given broad terms of reference to consider reforms to the Australian business tax system.
I take it from your comments, Senator Conroy, that you approved of their work because my understanding is that you are supporting this package. Over a 12-month period the review consulted extensively with small, medium and large businesses, rural and farming businesses, and other interested organisations. This open and consultative process was welcomed by business and made a significant contribution to the comprehensive recommendations of the review. Indeed, business has been very supportive of the reforms that the government has announced and this is due, in part, to the extensive and inclusive consultative process the government established.
By way of example, I will quote from a number of major industry organisations. The Australian Institute of Company Directors stated that it:
. . . has welcomed the New Business Tax System, released today by the Federal Government, as a win for Australian businesses large and small and for the taxation reform process.
The Government's proposed changes to the capital gains tax regime to offer rollover relief for scrip for scrip takeovers are key elements in removing barriers to growth in the Australian economy and enhancing our international competitiveness.
The Tourism Council of Australia remarked:
The Tourism Council today welcomed the Federal Government's New Business Tax System as investment friendly and encouraging future growth within the sector.
The new business tax system, combined with a new overall taxation system would help Australia's tourism industry compete in a global market place. These changes bring Australia into line with developments overseas and provide tourism businesses with certainty and simplicity—changes which are long overdue.
There were further supportive comments from the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. They stated:
The Government has listened to the calls of small business to reduce compliance costs they are facing . . . Of particular benefit will be the Simplified Tax System for small business and the rationalisation of the capital gains tax relief benefits available to small business.
These capital gains tax reforms will make investment in small business a much more attractive proposition and should assist in the growth and employment generating capacity of the economy as a whole.
Dick Warburton, speaking on behalf of the Business Coalition for Tax Reform, also remarked:
The agreement secures comprehensive tax reform that will deliver a modern, stable, fairer and more competitive tax system. Business tax reform was the last link. It is now up to everyone involved to get on with the implementation and the detailed consultations necessary to bed down the changes.
The new business tax system that the government is implementing will give Australia internationally competitive business tax arrangements, including the lower company tax rates included in this group of bills. The company tax rate will fall from 36 to 34 per cent for the 2000-01 income year, and to 30 per cent thereafter. This will make our company tax rate more competitive than that of many developed nations and amongst the 
 lowest in our region. This, combined with the reforms to indirect and personal income tax, will create the environment for higher economic growth and more investment. In turn, this will mean more jobs and improved saving.
Under the government's reforms to the capital gains tax, individuals will pay tax on only 50 per cent of any gain they make on the disposal of assets. This means that the highest rate for individuals will effectively be 24.25 per cent. In addition, superannuation funds will be taxed on only two-thirds of their capital gains. These cuts in capital gains tax, together with scrip for scrip rollover relief, will give Australia an internationally competitive capital gains tax regime and therefore encourage investment. Other government reforms to capital gains tax will particularly encourage investment in venture capital and in Australian small businesses and farms. The government will legislate to make capital gains made by Australian superannuation funds from pooled development funds exempt from capital gains tax.
Similarly, investments in venture capital projects in Australia by non-resident tax exempt pension funds, such as UK and US pension funds, will also not be subject to capital gains tax. The government has already legislated to provide small businesses with capital gains tax rollover relief or exemptions where they use funds to purchase other businesses or to retire. These changes were, I think, very much welcomed at the time. Under the reforms contained in these bills, these provisions will be extended and simplified. As a result, individual operators of small businesses will not have to pay capital gains tax on 75 per cent of any gain made on the sale of active business assets. The remaining 25 per cent will be subject to significantly expanded and simplified rollover provisions and retirement exemption provisions. Where taxpayers dispose of an active asset, that asset was held continuously for at least 15 years and the taxpayer is at least 55 years of age and intends to retire or is incapacitated, no capital gains tax will be payable.
Small businesses will also benefit substantially from the implementation of a simplified 
 tax system. It will dramatically reduce compliance costs and maintain small business access to existing concessions. Indeed, the government's changes to Australia's taxation system are landmark reforms. They include a number of integrity measures, as well as other measures that I have already discussed. Some of these measures take effect from 22 February 1999, as foreshadowed by the Treasurer in a press release of that date. The Treasurer has written to the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee regarding the delay in introducing the legislation.
I now turn to some of the issues which have been raised by honourable senators in the debate today. Senator Conroy wants me to wind up at this stage but, Senator Conroy, out of courtesy I might seek to respond to some of those issues. The government's reforms to the tax system contain provisions to address the conversion of income to capital. For example, taxpayers must hold assets for 12 months before they become eligible for the discounted capital gain. In addition, the Australian Taxation Office is of the view that the existing provisions in part IVA of the income tax legislation are effective in curbing anti-avoidance activity.
During the Senate committee hearings, Mr Reynolds noted that there is no evidence of such conversion in the United States. He also noted that, if it were easy to convert income to capital `it is kind of surprising that Australia ever collected any income tax prior to 1985—when in fact it collected quite a lot—because people could convert everything into capital gains and not be taxed at all'.
The government's reforms, announced in two stages, are also revenue neutral. The government will introduce all the business tax changes announced in full. Despite all your remarks, Senator Conroy, my understanding is that the Labor Party is supporting this. I hope that you are not showing any signs of wavering here, or I will have to draw your remarks to the attention of Mr Crean.
The government has already introduced into the parliament a number of integrity measures. These are contained in the integrity and other measures bill, which is currently before the Senate. In addition, the government has 
 announced that it proposes to pass legislation dealing with the alienation of personal service income and non-commercial losses prior to 30 June 1999. The government also proposes to pass legislation on trusts in time for it to apply from 1 July 2001.
These commitments will provide all taxpayers with certainty regarding their business affairs. Tying the passage of income tax cuts to the passage of other measures, as Senator Murray was proposing, would create great uncertainty when taxpayers are making decisions which have taxation implications. As the government has indicated, during the committee stage I will be introducing an amendment dealing with part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. In conclusion, the government's reforms will deliver to Australians a more competitive, more effective, more equitable and less complex business tax system to see Australia into the 21st century. I commend the bills to the Senate chamber.
—The question is that these bills be read a second time.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, would you please have my opposition to this bill registered.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1999-11-29,—I table a correction to the explanatory memorandum relating to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 .,SENATE,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-11-29,"—I rise on behalf of the opposition to speak to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 . This bill overwhelmingly contains provisions that the government claim meet their promises to the veterans community in the last election. I accept, reading through the bill, the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech, that it does meet the promises made by the government in a number of areas of benefit to the veterans community, and of course the opposition do not oppose them. We welcome the fact that the government are meeting those promises. They are not earth-shattering or big bang promises; they are refinements in a number of areas, worth while and beneficial to the veterans community.
The major issue that developed from this bill is the impact of the changes to the invalidity service pension. That appears to be a minor part of the bill, but it certainly created some interest in the veterans community. As a result of that interest, when the bill was introduced into the House of Representatives I, on behalf of the opposition, recommended that this bill go before the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee to seek the views of the public and, if necessary, hold a public hearing on the bill, particularly on that provision I just mentioned.
I was very pleased to see that there was considerable interest from the veterans community and from the public. Some 68 submissions were received. Many of them were received from individual members of the community, veterans in the community and veterans organisations. Most of them dealt with the issue of the invalidity service pension. Of course a number dealt with issues that were not specifically in this bill but raised issues of a wider nature of concern in the veterans community. When we held a hearing some of those views came out, but the issue that held the most interest at the hearing for one evening was the impact of the invalidity service pension change.
The government had recommended that those who received the invalidity service pension as veterans could have the way they obtained that pension, that benefit, reviewed. In evidence given to the committee, the department said that something like 17,000 invalidity service pensions are provided in Australia. After questioning it became clear that, of those 17,000, the government were interested in only some 1,700 pensions that had been issued and that they would like the opportunity to review those pensions by having veterans undergo a further medical examination. That means that some 1,700 veterans who had been receiving the pension could be called upon to front up to the Department of Veterans' Affairs or to an appropriate medical officer and have the test redone.
That did create a fair amount of apprehension in the veterans community, particularly amongst Vietnam veterans and Gulf War veterans. They lobbied hard, saying that this uncertainty was retrospectively changing an entitlement. We in the opposition had considerable sympathy for their concern about retrospectively taking a pension away from somebody once they had received it through the normal processes. We made it quite clear that, if fraud was involved at any stage in someone obtaining a benefit, we in the opposition would in no way support or allow fraudulent activity or fraudulent behaviour to proceed. What we found at the committee hearing was that the government were not worried so much about the fraud; they wanted to review the actual eligibility test people underwent to receive the benefit of the invalidity service pension and see whether the test had been properly applied. There was no fraud involved; the government wanted a second chance to check the test.
I was a bit surprised that the Liberal government would support a retrospective change. As I understand it, it has been an article of faith in the Liberal Party for a long time that they do not support retrospectivity in legislative change. This clearly was a retrospective change, in that people who were receiving the benefit had to undergo a further test and could lose the benefit. I put in a 
 minority report on behalf of the opposition. Our recommendation states:
Labor Senators believe that the anxiety and uncertainty created by requiring current recipients of the invalidity service pension to undergo the new eligibility test is unwarranted and unfair to these pensioners. We support an amendment that would exempt current recipients of the invalidity service pension from the proposed test but would require new applicants to be subject to it.
That was signed by me and my colleague Senator Hogg on behalf of the opposition. I was therefore pleased to see that the government last week issued a statement accepting the opposition's recommendation in the report that the retrospectivity be withdrawn. That was a considerable relief to the veterans community, and I am pleased that the minister was able to change the bill, change the proposal and accept our recommendation.
I understand from the government that, for the government to accept the opposition's recommendation, it does not actually need an amendment to this bill. It is an administrative matter that the government will not give administrative orders to any of the 1,700 to ask them to resubmit to the test. We take it on faith here—and I trust that the parliamentary secretary will reaffirm that in the second reading debate summing up—that this will be clarified. Clearly, the parliamentary secretary would be aware that, if there were any going back on that by administrative action at a later date, he could expect the whole ceiling of the veterans community to fall in on top of him at a very rapid rate. We are pleased to see that the government has accepted that. We take it on the record that the government is not proceeding with that.
I also want to put on the record that the veterans community have raised the area of suggested further amendments. They are concerned that the 40-point GARP test for the invalidity service pension will still be too strict in the new arrangement and that having that test apply to the invalidity service pension will mean that some veterans who are presently getting it will not be getting it in the future.
The government has said two things to the opposition in briefings and at the hearing. It has said that the test is not going to be a 
 tougher test but a more defined, more easily understood and more easily applied test by having the 40-point GARP test operate. However, in the evidence given to the committee, it was said that in the out years for the next four years the department estimated that some 600 fewer invalidity service pensions would be granted under the 40-point GARP test. This immediately raised the idea in the veterans community that the test must be tougher—if an estimated 600 people in four years are not going to get it when they would have got it if this change had not been made. So far I have not received an absolutely satisfactory explanation of how it is that, if the test is not tougher, 600 fewer people over the next four years will not be getting it. I still think the government owes the veterans community an explanation on the record here in the Senate of how you can say, `The test is not tougher, but 600 fewer people are going to get it according to estimations by the government.'
As a result of that evidence, the veterans community raised two further suggestions. I would like the parliamentary secretary at the table to respond to them either in the second reading debate or in the committee stage. One of them was that the 40-point GARP test be reduced to a 30-point GARP test so that it is less stringent than what is proposed. One of the suggestions made was that the invalidity service pension could be the equivalent of TPI. You get it when you are TPI and you are fully incapacitated, but the TPI is still a tougher test. Applying the same test for the invalidity service pension as for the TPI is not consistent. It should be at a lesser level because it is not the same as the benefit you get for the TPI.
The further suggestion was made that the number of hours people receiving the invalidity service pension are allowed to work should be increased from the present eight hours to something like 20 hours—the equivalent of what the intermediate pension gets. Again, I can understand why the veterans community has raised that. It does encourage people to work more hours as part of their rehabilitation as an invalid. Even in the veterans community, I think a lot of people understand that it is 
 better to get people off the invalidity service pension and back to work so that they are more productive in themselves psychologically, with their families and in the community. That is a theme running through all occupational health and safety schemes in Australia. I can understand why they raise it.
But, if you do accept those suggestions as amendments, you may well undermine the invalidity service pension itself. You are decreasing its importance. It is an invalidity service pension because you are a full invalid and you cannot work. If you reduce it to a level where you have the same point test as for an intermediate pension, which does allow 20 hours of work, you may be undermining the value of that pension. Who knows? In some dark days in the future, some bureaucrat in the finance department may well recommend that, as a savings measure, the value of the pension be reduced to match the points rather than the other way around. I am always nervous when putting anything up that it may allow some bureaucrat in the finance department or in the Treasury to use such changes ultimately to make further savings and disadvantage the veterans community.
Therefore, after further discussion with the government, on behalf of the opposition I will not be moving a further amendment to take account of that, though, if it turns out that the veterans community is being disadvantaged because of the new 40-point GARP test, clearly the government is going to have to respond. Otherwise, it will be literally belted around by the veterans community for putting into place a measure that has unintended consequences.
On balance, though we are not proceeding with amendments when we have this opportunity at the moment, I will take the word of the government. I still wait for an explanation, Parliamentary Secretary, of how the test can be the same—it is not being made tighter—but still 600 fewer people are estimated to receive the pension. A new explanatory memorandum was tabled tonight by the parliamentary secretary. I notice at the back of it the sentence: `These corrections remove reference to existing pensioners whose eligibility will not be affected by the new provi 
 sions.' I understand that sentence is the commitment that we will remove the retrospectivity.
I also ask the parliamentary secretary to respond to the issue that, when you compare the financial impact on page (ii) of the original explanatory memorandum with what was tabled today, they are quite striking in their difference. As I read it, in the original document the total financial impact for the first year, 1999-2000, is an increase in revenue of $394,000. In the new explanatory memorandum, that goes up to $607,000. In the following years, the financial impact is shown as being a substantial reduction of what was in the original memorandum, because Centrelink and health have been put in. I would like the parliamentary secretary to make this clear.
As I read this, in the total in the new explanatory memorandum the government has now deducted Centrelink and health. Though there may be a bigger cost to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, when you balance what happens at Centrelink and health, the reduction in the loss of revenue is considerably less. For example, in the original explanatory memorandum, it is minus $5.3 million in 2000-01, minus $12.9 million in the following year and then, finally, minus $16.09 million in 2002-03. The comparison years in the new memorandum are $0.029 million, $1.16 million and $2.6 million loss of revenue. If what I think has happened is right, I trust that can be explained in the parliamentary secretary's summing up of the second reading debate or in the committee stage, which may be very brief.
In the time remaining to me, I wish to touch on a couple of other matters that the government has to be aware of in the operation of the invalidity service pension. The concern I have mentioned from the Vietnam veterans is important. Since this bill has been introduced, Gulf War veterans have raised the concern that the new test may affect them adversely. As yet, we have not got a full scope of the impact of Gulf War syndrome, which is still being investigated by the department. We also now have a large number of soldiers—running into several thousand—serving in the East Timor situation, and they 
 will be entitled to full veterans benefits in the future.
One can anticipate that in the future Australian soldiers will serve in peacekeeping forces around the world as we, as a good international nation, accept our responsibility. Therefore, the invalidity service pension test that has been talked about here is the main matter of interest and controversy in this bill. These are reasons why sections of the veterans community are very concerned about it. On balance, the opposition are not moving further amendments. We will take the government at its word, but I would expect the government to respond rapidly. If, over the next year to 18 months, the new test for the invalidity service pension has the unintended consequence that large numbers of veterans—Vietnam veterans and new veterans from the Gulf War—start missing out, that will be a public issue that will have to be dealt with by the government.
On behalf of the opposition, we support the bill. We recognise it has a number of measures that meet the government's promises from the last election. We are pleased the government has accepted the opposition suggestion to remove the retrospectivity nature of applying the test to 1,700 veterans already granted the pension, but we look forward to monitoring very closely the operation of this new amendment to ensure that veterans, the people who have served this country well and bravely in the national interest, are not disadvantaged.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1999-11-29,"—I thank Senator Schacht, who is the opposition spokesman in this area, for his constructive approach to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 . I indicate that all the matters that the honourable senator has referred to are matters that I will be able to confirm. This bill has a number of provisions in it, all of which we believe will ensure that the veterans of this nation are looked after in an appropriate manner—and, indeed, their children as well, in one particular aspect of the legislation.
The government fully agree that it is appropriate that those people who have been found 
 willing to serve their nation in a time of conflict and difficulty and who have been prepared to risk their lives for the freedom that we enjoy today be looked after in their time of need. I will refer to some of the matters Senator Schacht has asked me to refer to and confirm that the amendments that we have proposed do flow from the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee report, where a suggestion was made in relation to making amendments. We as a government have agreed not to review existing payees against the new criteria of 40 points and eight hours capacity to work.
The explanatory memorandum was changed accordingly to reflect that. Instead, the current veteran payees will be safe by way of regulation—that is, no current veteran will be reviewed against the new criteria for the invalidity service pension. The government believes that 40 impairment points is a reasonable test. Senator Schacht referred to GARP, which is the acronym for the Guide to the assessment of rates of veterans' pensions. I do not blame him for using that acronym at all. To give an example of this test in the case of the amputation of fingers and thumbs, 30 points would equate to the amputation of a thumb and index finger on one hand, whereas 40 points would equate to the amputation of a thumb and the index, middle and ring fingers on one hand. So there is a substantive difference in the criteria that Senator Schacht floated. I understand that he will not be insisting on or suggesting any amendments on this but is asking the government to monitor the situation to ensure there are no unintended adverse consequences.
I can assure Senator Schacht, the veteran community and, indeed, the Australian people that the government will keep this under review to ensure there are no such unintended consequences. We believe that the eight-hour test, as it is called, is an appropriate test as well. Both these criteria apply to the totally and permanently incapacitated pension. I think Senator Schacht suggested at one stage that there might be 17,000 veteran pensioners. I understand the figure to be 13,000 veteran pensioners, but I do not think that changes 
 anything in the substance of what we are talking about this evening.
—We were told at one stage that there were 17,000 to be reviewed.
—There were 17,050 that were potentially reviewable, but overall I think you mentioned a figure of 17,000.
—I accept that it is 13,000.
—There will be some savings made as a result of the proposed test. I suppose we can discuss whether or not it is a tougher test. We believe it is a more rigorous test and, ultimately, a fairer test than the one that currently applies, which was subject to certain subjective assessments. We believe that the GARP point test is somewhat more objective and more capable of scrutiny and therefore is more fair. In his comments, Senator Schacht also mentioned the difference in the savings and the figures. He is correct that the variation in those figures is as a result of departmental savings, on the one hand, and the whole of government savings, on the other hand. I have been advised that we will provide a full reconciliation in due course on that. I will conclude—unless there are any other matters that Senator Schacht wants me to raise at this stage.
—I will have some brief questions in the committee stage.
—In that case, I thank Senator Schacht for his constructive contribution to this debate. I think the people of Australia can be assured that both the government and the opposition are seeking to ensure that the veterans of this country get the best possible deal—and a fair deal.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-11-29,"—I commence the Labor Party second reading debate contribution on the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999  with the statement that we are in fact pleased that the government has sought to bring on this matter today because, as I think we made quite clear in our report also tabled today on the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999, we thought it should in fact be withdrawn. Essentially that translates into a position where we oppose the second reading of this bill and, given comments by the Democrats today, we would hope that they would join us in that opposition. Mr Reith has indicated in media reports today that he hopes to revisit some of these issues next year, and I am wondering whether, from his statements today, he is actually indicating that he anticipates that the second reading will in fact be opposed and that he will then resubmit some elements of this bill to the Senate in the new year.
The other reason that I have no problem with dealing with this bill at short notice is that, during today's tabling of our reports, I had very limited opportunity to deal with several issues and this tonight gives me the opportunity to add to my contributions from earlier in the day. I want to go to a couple of aspects of Senator Murray's report. Apart from highlighting the fact that his overall conclusion is that major provisions of the bill should be rejected as harsh, unfair, unbalanced and unnecessary—and some of his media statements today have actually been quite a bit stronger than that—I want to deal with some other elements in his report which relate to comments that he has made about the Labor Party's position today as well.
Senator Murray starts with what he calls the Labor assessment of what we wanted to see 
 come out of the 1996 bill. I encourage Senator Murray, when he has the time—which is, of course, very limited—to look at the chapter in our report which deals specifically with economic conditions. Senator Murray cites various economic criteria set by Labor, through the then shadow minister, Mr Bob McMullan, in relation to how we would look at the success or otherwise of the 1996 bill—which became an act after the Democrat deal with the government. Senator Murray goes through various components of Mr McMullan's criteria.
I am pleased to highlight a couple of elements of that because the last time I read these criteria they were presented in a speech by Senator Murray roughly three or four weeks ago which he gave to the eight universities. He set out the criteria on that occasion. It was round about the day on which we held our hearings in Sydney and heard evidence from various women's organisations and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. When he ran through these criteria on that occasion, he made a statement along the lines that women's pay had improved under the 1996 act.
I note from his description of the criteria on this occasion that women's pay has actually been dropped off the list. I am very pleased to see that, and I am sure that the very large number of women's organisations—I think nearly every women's organisation in Australia of any significance was represented—would be pleased to see that they have managed to convince the Australian Democrats that the effect of the 1996 act on women and, in particular, on women's pay has been negative and that it is not selectively being referred to in a list of criteria about how the act has been successful.
The next issue that I draw on in relation to Senator Murray's comments is where he refers to the various waves of industrial relations reform. Quite rightly in one sense, he says that the first wave was under the then minister, Mr Laurie Brereton, when various changes were made to our federal industrial relations legislation back in 1993. However, again I would like to refer Senator Murray to a comment in our report. I think this state 
 ment was made on a day when he missed the hearing in Sydney and Senator Allison was there instead. This was a pretty powerful statement made by the various significant women's organisations. It is referred to on page 290 of our report where it says:
As highlighted by submissions from a large number of women's organisations:
It has been a decade of decentralisation. However, we believe this was intensified greatly by the Workplace Relations Act—
that is the 1996 Democrat-coalition act. The statement continues:
Protections that were put in place previously in the Industrial Relations Act to counteract some of these tendencies towards dispersion were removed in the 1996 Act and there was also an additional and even more decentralised level added of AWAs.
That quote pretty much encapsulates what this whole review has been about. I am pleased the Democrats were able to pressure the government into a position where we reviewed the operations of the current act, because I think that has essentially forced the Democrats to very seriously consider the consequences of the deal that they reached with the government back in 1996. I think, quite genuinely, the Democrats have been very concerned by the outcomes of that deal.
When I dealt with the tabling of this report earlier today, I highlighted that, for instance, the government has not dealt with the review of the current act. A number of very concerning elements of the current act raise problems for both the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party. Let me go through those issues because they are a component of the preface that Senator Murray joined with Senator Carr and me in composing to indicate the areas of concern that we think relate to the current act.
We are concerned that industrial relations law should include a social justice agenda; that is what the government is trying to remove, particularly with this bill. We are concerned that all workers need to be covered by an industrial instrument and that, therefore, we should not be dealing with a schedule to try and remove independent contractors. We believe that Australia should meet its international obligations. The government senators' report leaves only half a page to discuss this 
 matter. We believe that the industrial relations system should be focused on the prevention and settlement of disputes through negotiation in the first instance.
We also believe there should be an ability for workers to balance their work and family lives and that this should be promoted. We believe that the needs of workers vulnerable to discrimination should be adequately protected—and that is what this act does not do. We believe there should be adequate standards for Victorian workers, and we believe there should be a strong and independent Industrial Relations Commission. With respect to all these issues, I say to the Australian Democrats that, through the Senate, we have other potential vehicles to move these matters. We do not need to deal with them within the tainted scope of this bill.
That is why the Labor Party has taken a very strong position, which is that we should reject the bill at its second reading and that the other issues that both the Democrats and ourselves highlight in our report that need work in the current act are a matter that we can work with the Democrats on through vehicles other than this tainted piece of legislation. So I conclude, as I did earlier today, that Reith is a wrecker who has got this legislation wrong and we should not join with him in any sense. As the Victorian government has already said, what he is proposing is perverse.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-11-29,"—Last Wednesday, in one of a series of speeches that I have been giving in this chamber on the future of regional and rural Australia, I outlined some of the main findings of the regional summit that was held in this parliament a few weeks ago. What emerged as one of the key findings was the central place of a social coalition. This is about encouraging partnerships between government, business and the community to 
 find realistic solutions to the challenges faced by regional, rural and remote Australia.
The Deputy Prime Minister called the regional summit to generate more ideas at the grassroots about what such partnerships could achieve. The Howard coalition government is determined to restore and improve the services in rural and regional Australia. The Prime Minister is committed to that outcome. The government is determined to upgrade the basic services in smaller regional towns in our country. It is doing this through initiatives like the rural transaction centres, which is a $70 million program; Networking the Nation, which is a $250 million program; and extending services like Australia Post's giropost network to include banking services through the Post's bill paying system.
On Friday, 29 October, the Prime Minister opened Australia's very first rural transaction centre in the small town of Eugowra, which has a population of 670 people. Described as a `dwindling town' by Mrs Whittle, who is the owner of the Wobble In—Eugowra's second-hand treasure store—there is a double irony here. Firstly, there used to be so much money going through the town of Eugowra that, on 15 June 1862, eight bushrangers, including Frank Gardiner, Johnny Gilbert and Johnny O'Meally, robbed the Cobb and Co. coach. They stole 2,719 ounces of gold and £3,700 in cash, which was a vast fortune in those days and represents Australia's biggest gold robbery ever.
The second irony is that the old sandstone building which now houses Eugowra's rural transaction centre used to be a Westpac branch. Like the National Australia Bank, Westpac closed down its branch, both banks deciding it was no longer profitable to stay in this town. This was the straw that nearly broke the camel's back in this town, which was also suffering from a decline in wool prices, ongoing farm losses, the consequential loss of farm worker income and the closure of the railway line in 1988.
Before the Prime Minister opened Eugowra's rural transaction centre—which will provide retail banking through the Reliance Credit Union, Centrelink services, Medicare Easyclaim, community Internet 
 access, business support services and jobs for locals who are trained to run the local rural transaction centre—the town folk used to have to make a very long round trip to Forbes or Parkes to do their banking. Of course, while they were there, they tended to do a fair bit of their shopping. This had a crippling effect on many of the local businesses, many of which had to shut down. However, and as the Prime Minister announced at the opening of this centre:
The good news is that we have done something to bring services back to the bush.
Not only will those basic services that I mentioned return; there will also be the on-flow from that—that is, people in the towns who go in to use those services in rural transaction centres will also be shopping in that area, not going to the bigger centres. No wonder the town is elated and morale is up.
Over the next five years, this government plans to continue to roll out these sorts of services across rural and regional communities right around Australia. Any rural community with a population under 3,000 is eligible for assistance under the Rural Transaction Centre Program. Once the criteria are met, funds will be provided for a range of basic transactions, including retail banking, postal services, Medicare services and phone, fax and community Internet services. Even if the population of a regional community is greater than 3,000, if they can make a strong case for assistance, the government will not turn its back on them. The government will actually pitch in.
It is important to make the point that those regional communities that meet this criteria are entitled to two types of funds. The first is project assistance for the capital and some operating costs of their rural transaction centres, and the second is business planning assistance to help applicants develop their RTC business plan.
The coalition government is adamant in wanting to forge positive partnerships with local communities and with business. We do not want a passive, welfare dependent mind-set in the bush. As Senator Macdonald said on 12 November this year, what we want is for these RTCs to be sustainable. Once they 
 have been set up and assistance is given, we want to see them manage themselves with the transaction fees that they will be generating. That is exactly what rural and regional Australia want. They want to retain the dignity and the tradition of their spirit of self-reliance, and we saw that at the summit. Delegates were unanimous in not wanting a `top down' or `one size fits all' solution delivered to them from the big smoke.
The Howard government's rolling out of the rural transaction centres is not only an historic first in the history of this country; it also mirrors in a very tangible manner the collective outcome of the regional Australian summit. We are responding to the core aspirations of regional, rural and remote Australians in wanting to shape their own futures at their own local level, from the bottom up and in a journey of partnership with business and government.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia: Social Conditions</title>,Adjournment,15,1
