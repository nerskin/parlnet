The SPEAKER
 (09:01):  Yesterday, the Treasurer asked me whether I would consider making printing copies of Hansard available in the chamber to assist members during the course of question time. He specifically asked that six copies would be made available.


I have asked the Department of Parliamentary Services to provide six printed copies of the previous day's Hansard daily proof each sitting day. Copies will be available on the table of the House from the commencement of each sitting. This arrangement will apply from today, and I understand they are on the table.

Mr PASIN
 (Barker) (09:02):  Madam Speaker, in addressing this place for the first time, I add my voice to the chorus of congratulations on your election to the speakership. I am proud to have voted to elect you as the first conservative female Speaker—based on your merits and achievements, as all appointments should be. I am certain that in the discharge of your duties you will act with fairness and decorum, and ensure that my colleagues and I maintain our respect for this place and each other.


In this you can have no better role model than the 26th Speaker of the House of Representatives, Neil Andrew, a man who I have long admired, a man who, through this incredible journey of mine, I have had the privilege to come to know, and a man who I regard as a friend and mentor.


I also acknowledge and thank the member for Berowra for his wise counsel and pastoral care over recent weeks. I am also honoured that I will forever be able to boast that I was a member of this place during the tenure of the current Clerk of the House, albeit briefly. His legacy will be recorded not just in the pages of House of RepresentativesPractice but also in the actions of his staff. Never have I had the pleasure of dealing with such pleasant, professional, helpful and committed men and women. They are a testament to his leadership.


'Tra il dire e il fare ce di mezzo il mare' is an Italian phrase which translates loosely as 'between words and deeds exists the ocean'. In essence, talk is cheap. I am honoured to be a member of a team led by a man of principle, who says what he means and does what he says. He is a Prime Minister who will lead a government of honesty and integrity, a government focused on matching words with deeds.


There is no more important deed for this government than creating a strong and prosperous economy, where lower taxes and less regulation will deliver greater business productivity and ensure that more Australians experience the dignity of employment.


My family's home in Barker is located near a property called Dingley Dell. Dingley Dell was purchased in 1864 by one of Australia's first poets, Adam Lindsay Gordon. Whilst living there Gordon became a member of the South Australian state parliament, where he was renowned for two things: the first, I hope not to replicate—that is that his speeches, whilst entertaining, were largely irrelevant. The second, I cannot hope to replicate, for Adam Lindsay Gordon was considered dashing and handsome whereas, unlike others in this chamber and in the other place, I lend weight to the claim that politics is show business for ugly people!


I am proud that like the first four members for Barker, John Bonython, John Livingston and the Camerons—Malcolm and Archie—I am a son of immigrants. I am a parochial Australian, immensely proud of my Italian heritage. I honour the rich contribution that immigrants have made to my home state of South Australia and the nation.


My father, Luigi, the only child of Giuseppe and Angela Pasin, arrived in Australia as an 18-year-old seeking opportunity and adventure. My mother, Giuseppina, is the eldest daughter of Antonio and Immaculata Peppi. For both of them, World War II had been indirectly formative. My paternal grandfather died in 1948 as a consequence of tuberculosis, acquired whilst making the dangerous trek at night from Germany to northern Italy—an ordeal lasting 12 months. After spending two days at home he was hospitalised for two years before succumbing to the disease. Nothing I do in this place will ever be as hard as his journey home.


As a consequence of his father's sacrifice, my father was given a privileged education that ignited his passion for adventure. My maternal grandfather, after whom I take my name, served in Africa before being taken prisoner. As a prisoner he was treated with kindness and respect, and came to learn English. At the conclusion of the war he too returned to Italy, but armed with his newly acquired language skills he sought out for his family the opportunity a better life in Australia could provide.


Opportunity is so often the driving force of the migrant story. As Nick Cater, himself an immigrant, states in The Lucky Culture:


No-one comes to Australia for an easy time, they come here for a future. They do not seek deliverance, they seek the opportunity to deliver.


I am proud to be part of a government that is working to ensure that once again those who come to our great nation to share in its opportunities and to add to its prosperity do so in a safe and orderly manner, respectful of proper processes.


My parents met and married in Mount Gambier. Their entrepreneurialism saw them establish and operate many successful businesses. My father returned ultimately to his rural roots, farming land at Yahl, OB Flat and Kalangadoo. My mother operated a retail fashion and lingerie store in Mount Gambier for 46 years. It became a meeting place for the ladies of Mount Gambier. Shortly following its opening, my mother took the decision to display intimate apparel on mannequins in the shop window—an action which at the time was regarded by many, including community leaders, as provocative. When I inevitably say things that challenge both sides of this place, you will know where my inspiration came from!


The shop and the farm taught me much about life—hardly surprising, given that if I was not at school the choice was either the shop or the farm. To give you a sense of it, Madam Speaker, in my early years my morning and afternoon naps took place in a suitcase under the shop's counter and my weekends and school holidays were spent at the farm or in the packing shed. You might say I was exposed firsthand at an early age to the hard reality of running small businesses. Indeed, as a young child I once guided a friend and good customer of my mother's to the most expensive item in the store—it was a full-length mink coat—and insisted that she purchase it. When the customer inquired why, much to the embarrassment of my mother I said, 'Because things are tight.' The kindness of the customer saw her offer my mother a loan, which made it all the more embarrassing. I also watched as unnecessary government intervention ended my father's desire to continue growing, packing and exporting onions to the world.


Without my knowing it, these real-life experiences and others formed the genesis of my ideological beliefs. As a Liberal I know that our national interest is best served by a free citizenry empowered by personal responsibility and supported by a government that knows its place. It was Philip McBride, a senior Menzies government minister and a federal Liberal president, whose descendants I count amongst my constituents and friends, who defined the Liberal Party's historic mission as the preservation of individual freedom and a determination to restrain the powers of government. To this end, we have not always succeeded. We must have the courage to do better and ensure that we strive for the discipline that small government demands. We must at the same time respect and protect our traditional values and institutions. They are the bedrock on which our nation was built. Their conservation is essential to ensure the continued peace, order and good governance of this country.


Like this place that draws its foundation from several sources, I acknowledge that so too does the Liberal Party. Where our Constitution adopted elements from two great democracies, Britain and the United States of America, the Liberal Party was informed by two great traditions, both liberal and conservative. Where our Constitution founders created a uniquely Australian Federation to unite a diverse and geographically dispersed young nation, Robert Menzies created a uniquely Australian party to represent the interests of all Australians, not just the sectional interests of a few. I, like our former Prime Minister John Howard, consider my guiding philosophy to be a fusion of economic liberalism and social conservatism. I believe that our party is at its best when we remain true to our core ideologies and use them to inform and implement pragmatic policies.


Throughout my professional career I have honed my skills as an advocate. I am proud that for much of it, whilst operating my own legal practice, I have spoken for those whose voice, by reason of means or capacity, would have otherwise fallen silent. I intend to use my skills not only for the betterment of my electorate but for the cause of rural and regional Australia at large. It is easy to complain that things are tough for rural and regional Australia and to outline the challenges we face. It is harder to suggest and implement solutions to meet these challenges because so often they involve standing strong in the face of populist opinion. Here I draw inspiration from the 'Modest Member', South Australia's Bert Kelly, who, despite almost universal opposition, never wavered in his fight to rid Australia of the scourge of protectionism. It was said by the seventh member for Barker, Ian McLachlan, that Kelly, for his efforts, should have earned five knighthoods.


I also draw guidance from McLachlan himself, who spearheaded some of the most important workplace relations reforms in the history of the agricultural sector. These reforms occurred when, as he later recounted to the HR Nicholls Society, conciliation and compromise were the norm, when unions were dominant, and government and big business were compliant. It was individual farmers, not big business or government, who had the courage to force this change, to stand up for what was right, which of course happened to also be what was right for the nation.


Madam Speaker, as you know, the Liberal Party boasts a strong heritage of rural representation, especially in seats like Barker. I hope to add to this rich pedigree in a way that will earn the respect of my political mentors and honour the memory of my political heroes. Since its establishment following the redistribution of the former division of South Australia on 2 October 1903, eight members have served as the member for Barker. I pay my respects to each of them: John Bonython, John Livingston, Malcolm Cameron, Archie Cameron, Jim Forbes, James Porter, Ian McLachlan and Patrick Secker. Each of them were strong advocates for rural Australia, connected deeply, as I am, to the land. I wish to particularly acknowledge the service of my immediate predecessor, Patrick Secker. I am grateful for the manner with which he conducted himself during the period of transition in Barker. I wish Patrick and his wife, Sharon, every happiness for the future.


I come to this place without political antecedents. I am what in my former professional life I would have referred to as 'a cleanskin'. The use of that phrase, coincidentally, was responsible for the fourth member for Barker, Archie Cameron, earning the unenviable distinction as the first minister ever named and expelled from this chamber. He, also during a party room debate, famously lost his temper and 'further harangued the meeting before hurling his boots at the wall'. Whilst I have no personal connection to Archie Cameron and, indeed, no inclination to imitate his antics, I am proud to have had a strong personal connection to many of the men who have served in this role before me, including Malcolm Cameron, who occupied the post from 1922 to 1934. On my political journey I have always had the support of Malcolm's grandson, Nevin Lamont, who is present with us today. Indeed, I have brought to the chamber this morning Malcolm Cameron's first-class rail passage, issued on the occasion of the establishment of the seat of government in Canberra in May 1927.


Barker is my home. It is where I was born, raised and spent my formative years. It was where I took my first steps and watched my daughter do the same. In this way, I count myself truly fortunate. Barker is an electorate that has delivered so much to the nation and sought so little in return. It is an electorate whose economic strength is matched only by its diversity. It is the engine room of regional South Australia, endowed with natural resources perfectly suited to the pursuit of agricultural production. It is a place of natural beauty, from the volcanic region of the south to the river oasis of the north, from the rolling hills of the Barossa to the picturesque plains of the Murray lands and Mallee. It is a place that boasts leading, world-class production of grain, vegetables, fruit, timber and livestock for meat and dairy. These commodities link wine grape growers at Angaston, Waikerie and Penola, croppers at Karoonda and Loxton, plus livestock farmers at Lucindale, Meningie and Lameroo. These common industries unite Barker and make it a truly strong and interwoven community.


Barker's strong communities are a product of its warm-spirited, resilient and innovative people. That warmth of spirit, resilience and innovation are best personified by the story of Saint Mary of the Cross McKillop. As a Catholic, I regard myself as blessed to serve an electorate so intrinsically linked to the life of our nation's only saint. After all, it was in Barker that a young Mary McKillop met Father Julian Tenison Woods, who inspired her journey in faith. Father Woods's parish at the time covered 56,000 square kilometres of bushland; Barker covers an area of 64,000 square kilometres. Woods serviced his parish by horse and cart; I by modern motor vehicle. As I travel past the very red gums under which he prepared his sermons and celebrated mass, may I be inspired by the commitment he showed to his people and his faith.


An entrepreneurial spirit runs strong in Barker through the efforts not only of the primary production sector but also of the manufacturers who add value to the region's primary products and who, it should be said, form the second largest group of employers after primary producers in the electorate. I speak here of businesses such as Naracoorte's MiniJumbuk, Mount Gambier's NF McDonnell & Sons, the Riverland's Nippy's Fruit Juices, Bordertown's Blue Lake Milling and Murray Bridge's Thomas Foods International.


Manufacturing does, however, face many challenges as the recent closure of the potato processing plant in Penola demonstrates. If we wish to capitalise on our competitive agricultural advantages and reap the benefits of the Asian century, we must combat the strong headwinds facing the sector. As a Liberal I know that government must incentivise business by creating a climate in which business can seek out and seize opportunities. Amongst other things in Barker, this means creating certainty for irrigators, whether that irrigation water is drawn from the River Murray or the aquifers of the south-east. It means taking action to lower import costs, undertaking labour market and taxation reform, increasing access to international markets and more appropriately balancing the needs of the environment with the right to farm.


We must encourage investment in the best of science and technology to improve our productivity, grow our economy and feed the world. The future of agricultural enterprise is not, as the South Australian state Labor government seems to insist, to be found exclusively in the domain of premium produce but rather in a balance between bespoke production of low-volume, high-value offerings and the large-scale production of commodities.


We must continue to embrace the novel and the new and seek ideas from abroad. The second member for Barker, John Livingston, inspired by his overseas travels, encouraged the planting of pine forests in the south-east. Thanks to his vision, the softwood forests in Barker now cover over 100,000 hectares. Livingston also pioneered the freezing and shipment of prime lambs to Britain, an early example followed today by not only the three world-class export abattoirs in Barker but also live exporters. Livingston's legacy, as impressive as it is, serves more importantly as a guide for the future. If we are to follow Livingston's lead, rural and regional Australia needs access to improved infrastructure, and I welcome our government's commitment, as do the residents of Barker, to deliver the roads of the 21st century. 


Rural and regional Australia also needs access to the best digital technologies, technologies that have within their ambit the potential to deliver enhanced health, education and business connectivity to bridge the urban-rural divide. This divide exists as much now as it did when, upon the foundation of the Liberal Party, Menzies sought to create a country where both farmers and city residents enjoyed stability and the amenities of life.


I come to this place determined to strive to ensure that my actions will contribute to the restoration of the Australian people's regard for this place and those that sit within it. I thank the people of Barker for the honour they have bestowed upon me and acknowledge that a heavy responsibility accompanies that privilege. I must say that I am acutely aware of the weight of their expectation. To them I give this solemn pledge: I will be at all times your best advocate. I will steadfastly protect your interests and ardently champion your causes. In return I ask the people of Barker to heed the guidance of Edmund Burke and trust me to apply my own intelligence, industry and judgement to their concerns. 


We all stand on the shoulders of giants. To those giants that have made it possible for me to hold this office, I say thank you. To the Liberal Party's federal and South Australian secretariats, thank you. To my campaign manager, Dale Howard, and the hardworking and dedicated members of my campaign team, thank you. To the wider membership of the Liberal Party in Barker, thank you. For the wise counsel of Nick Minchin, Alan Ferguson, Joan Hall and the late Dale Baker, thank you. To my state parliamentary colleagues for your cooperation and support particularly Adrian Pederick, Ivan Venning, Tim Whetstone, Mitch Williams, and Legislative Councillors John Dawkins, Terry Stephens and David Ridgway, thank you.


To my staff for all you have done and in anticipation of all that you will do, thank you. To Senator Bernardi for your encouragement, friendship and guidance over many years, thank you. To my sister, Angela, who taught me the art of argument and the importance of persistence, thank you. To my parents, Luigi and Giuseppina, for your unconditional love and support and for equipping me to face the challenges of life, thank you. To my gorgeous wife, Fiona, and beautiful daughter, Bella, for allowing me to follow my passion, for sharing me with the people of Barker and for your constant reminder of what is truly important in life, thank you. To my brother, Giuseppe, I miss you.


In closing, I reflect on the words of the handsome and dashing Adam Lindsay Gordon that I hope might guide me and perhaps others in this place:


Life is mainly froth and bubble,


Two things stand like stone,


Kindness in another's troubles,


Courage in your own.


In her address on the occasion of the opening of the first session of the 44th Parliament, Her Excellency the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia said:


With a new parliament a page is turned. A new page in our country's history is about to be written. 


I hope that in adding my ink to that page I will be remembered as a man of kindness whose courageous actions honour his family, his party, his country and his god.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-11-21,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House, Minister for Education) (09:28):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The coalition government is committed to ensuring that Australia has a strong, high-quality university system now and in the years and decades to come.


This bill will give effect to higher education savings measures of the previous government, announced by the then minister for tertiary education on 13 April and confirmed in the 2013-14 budget.


These are Labor's cuts. These cuts of April came on top of repeated attacks by Labor on support for universities, for students, and for research. These cuts show just how damaging to the university sector the previous government was. They show clearly that Labor is no friend to universities. They show that Labor is no friend of students or higher education.


We are very pleased that we have been able to reverse one of Labor's most foolish and damaging measures—the cap on tax deductibility of self-education expenses. The vast majority of those who claim for self-education expenses earn less than $80,000 a year. This cap was going to hurt our nurses, teachers, doctors and other front-line services. Not only that, it would add to the burden on universities and professional and other bodies.


By 'scrapping the cap' this government is sending a clear message that the resources available to universities and students will be greater under the coalition than they would have been under Labor.


However, given the fiscal mess we have inherited from Labor as a result of their incompetence and wasteful spending, we have no responsible choice but to proceed with the other measures announced by Labor in April. We need to fix the budget for the long term and only by doing so will we ensure the sustainability of funding for the higher education sector. In addition to the measures in this bill, the Minister for Social Services will bring forth measures to implement the other part of Labor's April decisions–Labor's decision to convert start-up scholarships for students into loans.


Turning to the specific provisions of this bill: schedule 1 of the bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 (HESA) to abolish the HECS-HELP discount. Schedule 2 amends HESA to abolish the HELP voluntary repayment bonus. Currently, students receive a discount of 10 per cent on their student contribution by paying the amount up-front and an additional five per cent reduction in their HELP debt by making a voluntary repayment of $500 or more.


Schedule 3 of the bill amends HESA to apply an efficiency dividend of two per cent in 2014 and 1.25 per cent in 2015 to Commonwealth contribution amounts under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme. The efficiency dividend will not be applied to student contribution amounts but does impact on university revenues over 2014, 2015 and the years following. Future years will be indexed from a lower base because of this cut from the previous government.


Schedule 4 makes a minor amendment to HESA to reflect the change of the name of the University of Ballarat to the Federation University. The Victorian parliament passed the University of Ballarat Amendment (Federation University Australia) Act 2013 earlier this year to change the name of the university with effect from 1 January 2014. The new name, a decision of the Victorian parliament, reflects the planned broader role envisaged for the university and evident in the transfer of Monash University's Gippsland campus to it.


The coalition government is committed to a strong, vibrant university sector. The fiscal mess that has been left to us by the previous government leaves us with no practical alternative but to proceed with Labor's cuts. Their mismanagement has meant that the budget which they inherited in significant surplus has now become a budget in massive deficit, with the nation saddled with huge public debt.


As a result, our high performing higher education sector is required to live with measures that contribute to restoring the budget to health. That we have no option but to enact Labor's cuts does not in any way diminish our commitment to supporting a high-quality and accessible higher education sector in Australia. Labor's cuts show how empty their claim is, to be a friend of universities and students. This coalition government is the true friend of universities, of high-quality teaching and learning as well as of research, and of students. Coalition governments have a proven track record of support for universities—and also, sadly, of having to clean up Labor's messes.


As the Prime Minister pointed out in his address to Universities Australia in February, the principal founder of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies, had what he himself described as a 'passionate belief in pure learning'. The creation of new universities, the increase in the numbers attending them and much greater support for students was one of the main legacies of his long tenure.


The Prime Minister also pointed out that, over the term of the Howard government, the number of students in higher education increased by 63 per cent, the number of postgraduate students by 118 per cent, the number of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds by 23 per cent and the number of students with disabilities by 140 per cent.


Under the Howard government, as the Prime Minister said, total government funding increased by 13 per cent in real terms and total funding by 65 per cent. And of course, we established the $6 billion Higher Education Endowment Fund (since raided by Labor) to provide a guaranteed stream of income to the higher education sector for improved capital works and research facilities.


In that same speech, the Prime Minister laid down seven principles and policy directions for higher education that the coalition would follow if elected to government. The first and most important is to be a stable and consultative government. The second is to encourage Australian universities to protect their academic standing so that students can be confident that their degrees are taken seriously. The third is to work with universities to expand their share of the international higher education market. Fourth, we committed to a New Colombo Plan, building on the original one that brought tens of thousands of students from around our region to study in Australia by sending Australian undergraduates to study in the Asia-Pacific region. Fifth, we committed to encourage universities and institutes to ensure that their research work is world class, effectively delivered and well targeted, and to reduce the burden of grant applications. Sixth, we said that we would help to foster the creative and economic potential in our education and research sector by reducing their regulatory and compliance burden. Seventh, and finally, the coalition committed to helping Australian universities to be able to take advantage of the growth in online learning, such as the development of massive open online courses—otherwise known as MOOCs.


In the few weeks that this government has been in office, we have already taken many steps that implement these pledges and that demonstrate our commitment to higher education. We have been engaging in real consultation with our universities. As well as scrapping Labor's cap on tax deductibility for self-education expenses, we have acted to support the capacity of our universities and other higher education providers to attract international students to Australia. We have simplified the assessment level framework and extended the scope of streamlined visa processing for international students, and we are working towards a national strategy for international education and other measures recommended in the Chaney report and mentioned in my recent speech to the Australian International Education Conference. We are working towards the pilot programs for the New Colombo Plan, with Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan all having agreed to be Australia's partners in these.


We are recognising the most outstanding university teachers and programs that enhance learning in Awards for University Teaching created under the Howard government. We have announced $522 million in grants and fellowships to support 1,177 research projects recommended by the Australian Research Council following competitive peer review processes. We are lifting the heavy burden of compliance and regulation on our universities through giving a ministerial direction to the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency to engage in genuine consultation, including through an advisory council we are creating; to deregulate; and to report progress, including on cost savings to universities from this deregulation. We are ensuring that the burden of reporting requirements on universities is reduced. We are taking stock of the progress of the demand-driven system for higher education funding with expert reviewers assessing how the system is performing, and how it can be improved, including to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to ensure the high quality of graduates from our universities.


Labor's cuts—outlined in this bill—would be unnecessary but for Labor's profligacy, their sustained and irresponsible spendathon, and their disregard for the sound financial management that is essential for the health and vitality of our universities. This government is committed to ensuring sound financial management, and to ensuring that Australia has a world-class university system now and for the future. Cleaning up Labor's mess is an essential starting point for this.


I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (12:46):  I move:


That the Speaker's ruling be dissented from.


Madam Speaker, it is extraordinary for us now to be having a conversation about whether or not the parliament is allowed to debate what has been debated throughout Australia for so long. It is extraordinary, after all the conversation that has happened up until now about the shift to emissions trading and making sure that there is actually a limit on pollution rather than pollution being unlimited that we are now being told in this new parliament that that is a conversation you are not allowed to have. We thought it was bad enough for the debate to be gagged. Now this parliament is not to be allowed to consider these amendments at all. Your ruling, Madam Speaker, is not that the debate gets gagged; it is that the debate is not allowed to occur at all.


If there is a duty of the Speaker in this House, it has to begin with the concept of facilitating debate. If there is a view that you think amendments that have been circulated are in fact contrary to standing orders and you know full well that the debate has already had a gag put on it by the government, you know full well that there might not be time for redrafting to occur unless you provide the opposition with notice.


What would possess you, Madam Speaker, in those circumstances to wait until the commencement of the debate before we were told? In doing so, you guarantee that the debate cannot occur on the floor of this chamber. You guarantee the opposite of what is generally understood to be the role of the Speaker. You guarantee not that a vigorous debate will occur but you guarantee that a vigorous debate will be ruled out.


I have been critical of the Leader of the House for the gag resolutions that he has brought down in this chamber. I have been critical of the Leader of the House for the idea that debate on amendments would be limited to an hour. It never occurred to anyone on this side of the chamber that the Speaker would view one hour of debate as too long and say that the figure of one hour needed to be reduced to zero for the purpose of discussing these amendments.


Madam Speaker, it should be within the remit of this parliament to be able to debate the issues which have been discussed and flagged well in advance with the knowledge of the one-hour deadline already applying to the conduct of this debate. The precedent which you quoted, I have to say, is a real stretch because in that debate, even though as you say it was not brought to your attention until the beginning of the proceedings, I hazard a guess that there was not a one-hour limit on consideration in detail that day. I hazard a guess that we do not have those circumstances.


Most importantly, you refer to standing order 179(a) and (b) as though part (c) is not on the page—just not there. The reason that you will not refer to standing order 179(c) is that it would allow the amendment. That is exactly why we have a circumstance, Madam Speaker, where you are consciously and knowingly ignoring one of the standing orders. If (a) and (b) were the only standing orders which were there, the ruling that you have made would at least be arguable, notwithstanding the fact that the process you have followed restricts debate in an unacceptable way in this chamber. But you ignore the words of 179(c):


A Member who is not a Minister may move an amendment to the proposal which does not increase or extend the scope of the charge proposed beyond the total already existing under any Act of Parliament.


The amendments which are to be before the House, and which have been circulated by the member for Port Adelaide, fall entirely within that standing order. Madam Speaker, you have put the House in a situation where we do not get a written copy of your ruling. I think it would be more helpful if you were provided with a written copy of the standing orders because a written copy of the standing orders, I believe, would have led you to a circumstance where no reasonable person could have made the ruling that you have just made. It cannot be justified under the standing orders and it certainly cannot be justified if you have the slightest part of belief in having debate in this chamber.


I must say it is the first time I can recall that I have had a Speaker refer to the government's position using the pronoun 'we'. That was an extraordinary part of the way you sought to explain yourself to the chamber. If it was not enough for us to have a Speaker physically brought to the chair by a Prime Minister and a Leader of the House, to then have rulings that are governed by the term 'we' referring to yourself and the government as one, changes the role of your chair entirely and changes the role of the high office you occupy entirely.


Madam Speaker, we were told that you would be an independent Speaker. This ruling is entirely inconsistent with that. The timing you have given on this ruling is entirely inconsistent with that. The lack of notice you have given to the opposition is entirely inconsistent with that. We were told that things would be transparent. I have to say, you have delivered on that one because this is entirely transparent! These amendments would force those opposite to actually vote squarely on the question of the tax alone and change it to a circumstance where you could get rid of the tax but pollution could not be unlimited. That is exactly what these amendments would do. Now government members, because of you shielding them from that question, get to avoid that.



The SPEAKER:  That is a reflection on the chair and I ask you to withdraw.




Mr BURKE:
  It is a dissent motion. I have moved the motion because I think your ruling is wrong. I do not resile from that for one moment.



The SPEAKER:  I am not referring to that. 




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I think that the point that the Speaker is making is not that you should not be able to dissent from her ruling—



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Mr Pyne:
  Be quiet, you buffoon.



An opposition member:  What is the standing order?




Mr Pyne:
  Disorderly conduct. Check it out. Look it up. The point is in the member's dissent he is perfectly entitled to disagree with the Speaker's ruling, but he is not allowed to reflect personally on the Speaker and her impartiality. That is what the Speaker is asking you to withdraw, and I would ask you to do so on behalf of the Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  I ask you to withdraw the reflection on the chair that was made.




Mr BURKE:
  I withdraw. On saying that they would be transparent, they have delivered in spades. We have a situation now where all of this means one very simple thing: the government get to avoid a vote and this parliament avoids a debate. What does it say about how they feel about the strength of their arguments when this is where we end up? Had there been early notice, I have no doubt this would have been able to be rectified to your satisfaction, Madam Speaker. I have no doubt there would have been a way. Notwithstanding the interjections opposite and notwithstanding the shaking of your head, Madam Speaker, when I said that this could be rectified, you did refer to the opportunity for things to be redrafted and I take those words of yours in good faith. 


In turn, I acknowledge that the timing of this makes it impossible. The timing of it, the manner of delivery, the ruling itself, the ignoring of standing order (c), within the very section you chose to refer to, have put this parliament in a situation where debate is being silenced. And it is not like through the amendments we were about to form a majority of the chamber. It is not like that was about to happen. It is not like they needed to be running scared from the outcome. It should be reasonable that there is never a culture of secrecy here on the floor of the chamber. Madam Speaker, when you ask for things to be withdrawn, when you make different rulings and when you have asked us to quieten down at different points when you get on your feet, we will respect your role. Madam Speaker, but you need to abide by the standing orders—



The SPEAKER:  And I am—




Mr BURKE:
  and on this occasion you have not.



The SPEAKER:  Again, that is a reflection on the chair and I ask you to withdraw.




Mr BURKE:
  May I speak to the point of order?



The SPEAKER:  You can disagree with my ruling, but you cannot say that I am not abiding by the standing orders?




Mr BURKE:
  Then how can I move dissent? I am not presuming any ill will on your part, but I do not know how I can move dissent without saying that you were wrong on the standing orders. I do not know how else a dissent motion can take effect.



The SPEAKER:  You are correct to disagree with my ruling on the standing orders. That is not to say, at large, that I do not comply with the standing orders. That is a reflection on the chair.




Mr BURKE:
  Madam Speaker, your ruling must be dissented from. I presume on this occasion—



The SPEAKER:  Your time has elapsed.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (12:57):  Since your ruling, Madam Speaker, I have had the opportunity—




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Is the member for Port Adelaide seconding the motion?



Mr Butler interjecting—




Mr Pyne:
 He needs to say so.



The SPEAKER:  Is the member seconding the motion?




Mr BUTLER:
  I second the motion. Since your ruling, Madam Speaker, I have been able to read your written statement. As the Manager of Opposition Business pointed out, the statement appears to rely particularly on standing order 179(a) and 179(b)—



The SPEAKER:  As I said.




Mr BUTLER:
  but does not refer expressly to the provisions in 179(c), which provides:


A Member who is not a Minister may move an amendment to the proposal which does not increase or extend the scope of the charge proposed beyond the total already existing under any Act of Parliament.


What is the question here at issue? The question here at issue is what is the effect of the amendment moved by me on the existing act that is proposed to be amended or repealed by the government? The effect of the amendment proposed by me is to change the way in which carbon pricing works in the financial year 2014-15. What is the way in which it will change? The way in which it will change is that it will move from the fixed price that is currently set out in the legislation, described by the opposition over a long period of time as the carbon tax, to a floating price. So it moves to an emissions trading scheme. It does not bring in any additional liable entities. There is no change to scope. The only way 179(c) can be activated is an argument that it increases the charge—the charge currently set, I think, at $24.15 per tonne. That is a judgement to be made and it is a judgement that you have made, Madam Speaker, from which we greatly dissent. 


This is not a new set of amendments. These are the set of amendments that we released when in government as an exposure draft before the 7 September election. The draft was subject to public consultation, and it was released with very clear statements—from then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, from then Treasurer Bowen and from myself—about Treasury's advice on the impact in 2014-15 of moving from a fixed price—the carbon tax, as the now government like to call it—to a floating price under an emissions trading scheme. Treasury's advice was very clear. Treasury's advice was that the price would move from around $24 to around $6, that it would be reduced by 75 per cent. It seems to me, although the now government refuses to release any information about the basis of their current policy; they will not release the incoming brief, which Alan Kohler has told us this morning apparently indicates that Direct Action, their policy, will cost $10 billion per year—



A government member interjecting—




Mr BUTLER:
  Release your incoming brief and we will know whether or not it is false. The only thing we have to go on is articles from Alan Kohler.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Port Adelaide needs to be arguing why your ruling should be dissented from. He should not be arguing about the substance of the amendment or the bill. He has had that opportunity, and in consideration in detail he could have the opportunity again.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House makes a very valid point and I would ask the member to return to the substance of the motion.




Mr BUTLER:
  The point I was trying to make, with the greatest of respect, was that your ruling has sought to make an assessment about the financial impact of the change in 2014-15—



A government member interjecting—




Mr BUTLER:
  No, not the scope, the financial impact. There is no change to the scope, there is no change to the liable entities. What is changed is the way in which the price per tonne is fixed. Treasury's advice was that that price would reduce by three-quarters—



The SPEAKER:  You are now not debating the question as to why my ruling should be dissented from—




Mr BUTLER:
  I am directly debating it, because—



The SPEAKER:  No, you are not—




Mr BUTLER:
  Madam Speaker, with the greatest respect, your ruling makes an assessment that a change from a fixed price to a floating price in 2014-15 will increase that price. That is the only way in which standing order 179(c) cannot apply and cannot cover my amendments.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, with the greatest of respect, the dissent motion is about your ruling that the House is not capable of considering this amendment. You have made no assessment at all about the financial implications of any of these matters. To accuse you of doing so is quite out of order



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr Pyne:
  You need to study exactly what you are dissenting from and then you will be in a position to argue it more successfully.



The SPEAKER:  I simply ask the member to continue to address the motion.




Mr BUTLER:
  It is based on an assessment that the impact of our amendments would increase the charge. The only advice in the public realm is that it would reduce it by 75 per cent. (Time expired)

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-11-21,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House, Minister for Education) (13:02):  I do not wish to detain the House at great length, because the debate management motion that I had passed earlier in the debate provides for the consideration in detail to begin once the second reading has been carried and you have stated that the House will now consider the bill in detail. The opposition are in fact denying themselves the opportunity to consider the bills in detail by moving this dissent motion. Very simply, the ruling that you have made, Madam Speaker, is entirely consistent with every other ruling of a similar nature to do with the capabilities of the House to amend or change legislation introduced by the executive. It is very clear in standing order 179(a):


Only a Minister may initiate a proposal to impose, increase, or decrease a tax or duty, or change the scope of any charge.


It is very straightforward. It is there because the government needs to initiate money bills in the House of Representatives. And any amendment to try to change money bills is outside the capability of anybody other than someone from the executive. The opposition know this, because we had these debates quite routinely when we were in opposition before 7 September. The opposition know this, and this dissent motion, along with their amendment, is a try-on. It would be quite unprecedented for you to have ruled in any other way than that the House is incapable of dealing with this particular amendment, and you did—very generously, I thought—give the opposition the opportunity to try to move another amendment in consideration in detail which did not offend the standing orders or the Constitution of Australia, which makes it clear that only the executive can initiate money bills.


For the benefit of the House, and for many of the new members, why is that so? It is so because the history of the Westminster tradition is one of civil war in the 17th century which caused such great ructions in Britain that the parliament that replaced the civil war only allowed the executive to initiate money bills to make it clear between the Crown and the parliament who was responsible for what. We have inherited that Westminster system; therefore, it would be quite improper for you to have ruled in any other way than that the opposition cannot initiate changes to a money bill. The member for Port Adelaide made it very clear that that is exactly what his amendment seeks to do. I quote him. He said that his amendment 'changes the way the charge is collected and changes the timing of the act'—in other words, it extends the scope of the bill. That is your quotation from your speech. The Manager of Opposition Business in the House did it as well, throughout his contribution. He kept repeating that his amendment extended the scope and that he believes that we are capable of doing that in the House of Representatives today on a motion initiated by the opposition. 


When we were in opposition it was very clear that only the executive could initiate such changes and it is very important that the House upholds the standards that have been set over the course of our parliament. I could go on at great length but I want to get on with the consideration in detail and, as a consequence, I move:


That the question be now put.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that the question be now put.

The SPEAKER
 (13:23):  The House will now consider the bills in detail. In accordance with the resolution agreed on 18 November, the bills will be taken together. 




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order under standing orders 91 and 92: on social media, the members for Moreton and McEwen have been reflecting on the chair, on the impartiality of the chair. I point out to you that the member for McEwen is the Second Deputy Speaker and that it is what I would regard as disorderly conduct. 



Ms Macklin interjecting—




Mr Pyne:
  So the member for Jagajaga thinks that reflecting on the member for McEwen is the same as reflecting on the Speaker, does she? 


The member for McEwen has a higher level of responsibility. On social media, on Twitter, during the division and during the debate, the members for McEwen and Moreton were reflecting quite improperly on the chair and your impartiality. I ask you, as the Speaker, to consider whether this is disorderly conduct and what action you might like to take. I do not wish to take it to another level—privilege, for example. It might well be because of the inexperience of the members and their lack of knowledge of opposition. I would certainly ask the Manager of Opposition Business in the House to counsel members about reflecting on the impartiality of the chair. But I ask you to consider it rather than acting immediately—unless you choose to act immediately—to consider whether it has been a reflection on the chair and therefore is disorderly conduct and how you might like to deal with it.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the Leader of the House for his point of order. I would say that we have decided in this chamber that we do allow electronic media to be used and that it is the responsibility of individual members to abide by the standing orders in the way in which they use those electronic and social media. I would be disappointed if the Second Deputy Speaker had so reflected. I would find that if others have so reflected then they might like to consider their actions themselves. But I would simply remind you that, on the use of electronic media, the same rules pertain as to speaking in the House.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I would point you to precedents in these matters. The member for Canning was involved in a precedent in a previous parliament involving Speaker Andrew and was asked to apologise to the Speaker in the House, under threat of more serious action being taken—




Mr Husic:
  For what?




Mr Pyne:
  Reflecting on the Speaker, which is not allowed to be done.




Mr Husic:
  Where?




Mr Pyne:
  In the chamber—



A government member:  And on Twitter.




Mr Pyne:
  And on Twitter. You are not allowed to do it. I simply point out that precedent to you, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the Leader of the House, and call the Manager of Opposition Business—on the same point of order, I take it?




Mr Burke:
  Madam Speaker, if I may speak to the point of order, or on indulgence—



The SPEAKER:  No, we do not do points of order on indulgence. You are either speaking to the point of order or not.




Mr Burke:
  A point of order will do.



The SPEAKER:  On that point of order as raised?




Mr Burke:
  Yes, on the point of order that was raised: the issue of digital media within the chamber is one that I know has been raised with you in the interviews that you did shortly after becoming Speaker, and if you do wish to provide clarity at some point on how it is to be used within the chamber then the opposition would welcome that clarity.



The SPEAKER:  Well, I have actually just done that. I have said—




Mr Burke:
  It appeared to be different from what I recalled from the Sky News interviews.



The SPEAKER:  It is still used in the chamber.




Mr Burke:
  Thank you, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  There is no intention of not having it used in the chamber. But you do have to abide by the standing orders in its use.




Mr Perrett:
  Madam Speaker, on indulgence, a point of order—



The SPEAKER:  No, there is no indulgence, sorry—certainly not indulgence!




Mr Perrett:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order—



The SPEAKER:  What point of order?




Mr Perrett:
  On the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition—



The SPEAKER:  No, this is not a debate on the issue. We have just ruled on the point of order. The Manager of Opposition Business asked me how it was to be used and I have answered the question.




Mr Perrett:
  I was seeking to assist—



The SPEAKER:  Well, that will be new! The member for Moreton is speaking to what?




Mr Perrett:
  To the reflection on the chair, and I do wish to apologise for the retweet that I put, and I did make a line-ball call. I will certainly refrain from so doing in the future, and I will make every endeavour to assist the House wherever possible, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  Is that an apology, as well?




Mr Perrett:
  If you so require, Madam Speaker. You take it as you may.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his apology. We are now going to the consideration in detail.

The SPEAKER:  You can disagree with my ruling, but you cannot say that I am not abiding by the standing orders?




Mr BURKE:

The SPEAKER:  You are correct to disagree with my ruling on the standing orders. That is not to say, at large, that I do not comply with the standing orders. That is a reflection on the chair.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (12:57):  Since your ruling, Madam Speaker, I have had the opportunity—




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Is the member for Port Adelaide seconding the motion?



Mr Butler interjecting—




Mr Pyne:
 He needs to say so.



The SPEAKER:  Is the member seconding the motion?




Mr BUTLER:
  I second the motion. Since your ruling, Madam Speaker, I have been able to read your written statement. As the Manager of Opposition Business pointed out, the statement appears to rely particularly on standing order 179(a) and 179(b)—



The SPEAKER:  As I said.




Mr BUTLER:
  but does not refer expressly to the provisions in 179(c), which provides:


A Member who is not a Minister may move an amendment to the proposal which does not increase or extend the scope of the charge proposed beyond the total already existing under any Act of Parliament.


What is the question here at issue? The question here at issue is what is the effect of the amendment moved by me on the existing act that is proposed to be amended or repealed by the government? The effect of the amendment proposed by me is to change the way in which carbon pricing works in the financial year 2014-15. What is the way in which it will change? The way in which it will change is that it will move from the fixed price that is currently set out in the legislation, described by the opposition over a long period of time as the carbon tax, to a floating price. So it moves to an emissions trading scheme. It does not bring in any additional liable entities. There is no change to scope. The only way 179(c) can be activated is an argument that it increases the charge—the charge currently set, I think, at $24.15 per tonne. That is a judgement to be made and it is a judgement that you have made, Madam Speaker, from which we greatly dissent. 


This is not a new set of amendments. These are the set of amendments that we released when in government as an exposure draft before the 7 September election. The draft was subject to public consultation, and it was released with very clear statements—from then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, from then Treasurer Bowen and from myself—about Treasury's advice on the impact in 2014-15 of moving from a fixed price—the carbon tax, as the now government like to call it—to a floating price under an emissions trading scheme. Treasury's advice was very clear. Treasury's advice was that the price would move from around $24 to around $6, that it would be reduced by 75 per cent. It seems to me, although the now government refuses to release any information about the basis of their current policy; they will not release the incoming brief, which Alan Kohler has told us this morning apparently indicates that Direct Action, their policy, will cost $10 billion per year—



A government member interjecting—




Mr BUTLER:
  Release your incoming brief and we will know whether or not it is false. The only thing we have to go on is articles from Alan Kohler.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Port Adelaide needs to be arguing why your ruling should be dissented from. He should not be arguing about the substance of the amendment or the bill. He has had that opportunity, and in consideration in detail he could have the opportunity again.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House makes a very valid point and I would ask the member to return to the substance of the motion.




Mr BUTLER:
  The point I was trying to make, with the greatest of respect, was that your ruling has sought to make an assessment about the financial impact of the change in 2014-15—



A government member interjecting—




Mr BUTLER:
  No, not the scope, the financial impact. There is no change to the scope, there is no change to the liable entities. What is changed is the way in which the price per tonne is fixed. Treasury's advice was that that price would reduce by three-quarters—



The SPEAKER:  You are now not debating the question as to why my ruling should be dissented from—




Mr BUTLER:
  I am directly debating it, because—



The SPEAKER:  No, you are not—




Mr BUTLER:
  Madam Speaker, with the greatest respect, your ruling makes an assessment that a change from a fixed price to a floating price in 2014-15 will increase that price. That is the only way in which standing order 179(c) cannot apply and cannot cover my amendments.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, with the greatest of respect, the dissent motion is about your ruling that the House is not capable of considering this amendment. You have made no assessment at all about the financial implications of any of these matters. To accuse you of doing so is quite out of order



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr Pyne:
  You need to study exactly what you are dissenting from and then you will be in a position to argue it more successfully.



The SPEAKER:  I simply ask the member to continue to address the motion.




Mr BUTLER:
  It is based on an assessment that the impact of our amendments would increase the charge. The only advice in the public realm is that it would reduce it by 75 per cent. (Time expired)

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-11-21,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House, Minister for Education) (13:02):  I do not wish to detain the House at great length, because the debate management motion that I had passed earlier in the debate provides for the consideration in detail to begin once the second reading has been carried and you have stated that the House will now consider the bill in detail. The opposition are in fact denying themselves the opportunity to consider the bills in detail by moving this dissent motion. Very simply, the ruling that you have made, Madam Speaker, is entirely consistent with every other ruling of a similar nature to do with the capabilities of the House to amend or change legislation introduced by the executive. It is very clear in standing order 179(a):


Only a Minister may initiate a proposal to impose, increase, or decrease a tax or duty, or change the scope of any charge.


It is very straightforward. It is there because the government needs to initiate money bills in the House of Representatives. And any amendment to try to change money bills is outside the capability of anybody other than someone from the executive. The opposition know this, because we had these debates quite routinely when we were in opposition before 7 September. The opposition know this, and this dissent motion, along with their amendment, is a try-on. It would be quite unprecedented for you to have ruled in any other way than that the House is incapable of dealing with this particular amendment, and you did—very generously, I thought—give the opposition the opportunity to try to move another amendment in consideration in detail which did not offend the standing orders or the Constitution of Australia, which makes it clear that only the executive can initiate money bills.


For the benefit of the House, and for many of the new members, why is that so? It is so because the history of the Westminster tradition is one of civil war in the 17th century which caused such great ructions in Britain that the parliament that replaced the civil war only allowed the executive to initiate money bills to make it clear between the Crown and the parliament who was responsible for what. We have inherited that Westminster system; therefore, it would be quite improper for you to have ruled in any other way than that the opposition cannot initiate changes to a money bill. The member for Port Adelaide made it very clear that that is exactly what his amendment seeks to do. I quote him. He said that his amendment 'changes the way the charge is collected and changes the timing of the act'—in other words, it extends the scope of the bill. That is your quotation from your speech. The Manager of Opposition Business in the House did it as well, throughout his contribution. He kept repeating that his amendment extended the scope and that he believes that we are capable of doing that in the House of Representatives today on a motion initiated by the opposition. 


When we were in opposition it was very clear that only the executive could initiate such changes and it is very important that the House upholds the standards that have been set over the course of our parliament. I could go on at great length but I want to get on with the consideration in detail and, as a consequence, I move:


That the question be now put.

The SPEAKER
 (13:23):  The House will now consider the bills in detail. In accordance with the resolution agreed on 18 November, the bills will be taken together. 




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order under standing orders 91 and 92: on social media, the members for Moreton and McEwen have been reflecting on the chair, on the impartiality of the chair. I point out to you that the member for McEwen is the Second Deputy Speaker and that it is what I would regard as disorderly conduct. 



Ms Macklin interjecting—




Mr Pyne:
  So the member for Jagajaga thinks that reflecting on the member for McEwen is the same as reflecting on the Speaker, does she? 


The member for McEwen has a higher level of responsibility. On social media, on Twitter, during the division and during the debate, the members for McEwen and Moreton were reflecting quite improperly on the chair and your impartiality. I ask you, as the Speaker, to consider whether this is disorderly conduct and what action you might like to take. I do not wish to take it to another level—privilege, for example. It might well be because of the inexperience of the members and their lack of knowledge of opposition. I would certainly ask the Manager of Opposition Business in the House to counsel members about reflecting on the impartiality of the chair. But I ask you to consider it rather than acting immediately—unless you choose to act immediately—to consider whether it has been a reflection on the chair and therefore is disorderly conduct and how you might like to deal with it.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the Leader of the House for his point of order. I would say that we have decided in this chamber that we do allow electronic media to be used and that it is the responsibility of individual members to abide by the standing orders in the way in which they use those electronic and social media. I would be disappointed if the Second Deputy Speaker had so reflected. I would find that if others have so reflected then they might like to consider their actions themselves. But I would simply remind you that, on the use of electronic media, the same rules pertain as to speaking in the House.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I would point you to precedents in these matters. The member for Canning was involved in a precedent in a previous parliament involving Speaker Andrew and was asked to apologise to the Speaker in the House, under threat of more serious action being taken—




Mr Husic:
  For what?




Mr Pyne:
  Reflecting on the Speaker, which is not allowed to be done.




Mr Husic:
  Where?




Mr Pyne:
  In the chamber—



A government member:  And on Twitter.




Mr Pyne:
  And on Twitter. You are not allowed to do it. I simply point out that precedent to you, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the Leader of the House, and call the Manager of Opposition Business—on the same point of order, I take it?




Mr Burke:
  Madam Speaker, if I may speak to the point of order, or on indulgence—



The SPEAKER:  No, we do not do points of order on indulgence. You are either speaking to the point of order or not.




Mr Burke:
  A point of order will do.



The SPEAKER:  On that point of order as raised?




Mr Burke:
  Yes, on the point of order that was raised: the issue of digital media within the chamber is one that I know has been raised with you in the interviews that you did shortly after becoming Speaker, and if you do wish to provide clarity at some point on how it is to be used within the chamber then the opposition would welcome that clarity.



The SPEAKER:  Well, I have actually just done that. I have said—




Mr Burke:
  It appeared to be different from what I recalled from the Sky News interviews.



The SPEAKER:  It is still used in the chamber.




Mr Burke:
  Thank you, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  There is no intention of not having it used in the chamber. But you do have to abide by the standing orders in its use.




Mr Perrett:
  Madam Speaker, on indulgence, a point of order—



The SPEAKER:  No, there is no indulgence, sorry—certainly not indulgence!




Mr Perrett:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order—



The SPEAKER:  What point of order?




Mr Perrett:
  On the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition—



The SPEAKER:  No, this is not a debate on the issue. We have just ruled on the point of order. The Manager of Opposition Business asked me how it was to be used and I have answered the question.




Mr Perrett:
  I was seeking to assist—



The SPEAKER:  Well, that will be new! The member for Moreton is speaking to what?




Mr Perrett:
  To the reflection on the chair, and I do wish to apologise for the retweet that I put, and I did make a line-ball call. I will certainly refrain from so doing in the future, and I will make every endeavour to assist the House wherever possible, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  Is that an apology, as well?




Mr Perrett:
  If you so require, Madam Speaker. You take it as you may.

"Butler, Mark, MP",ALP,2013-11-21,"



Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (13:27):  I think it is important, at the beginning of the very short, curtailed consideration in detail that we have, to frame exactly what is at issue in this House, or what was at issue in a very formal sense had my amendments been ruled in order, and that is: there are points of agreement between the government and the opposition and there are points of difference.


The point of agreement, as much as the minister might seek to resist this point, is around the termination of the carbon tax. This was a position that the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, enunciated, as clearly as possibly could be the case, before the last election—that the termination of the carbon tax would happen next year. As it happens, now we have a measure of clarity about the government's position—I say only 'a measure of clarity'. 


We would actually have terminated the carbon tax on the same day, 30 June next year. The difference between the government and the opposition in this debate is not the termination of the carbon tax but what replaces it, and that is the debate that would have been had had my amendments been ruled in order, because very clearly before the election we indicated that Australia should move as quickly as possible, on 1 July next year, to an emissions trading scheme—not to the raft of policies that the minister would seek to introduce to an emissions trading scheme.


The minister and others of the government have sought to equate a carbon tax with an emissions trading scheme and, in doing so, you are either trying deliberately to mislead the community or you simply do not understand the fundamental economics of the two models. They are profoundly different. The carbon tax operates without a legal limit on carbon pollution and instead uses a price mechanism to seek to control the behaviour that is being targeted—in this case, the emission of carbon pollution. An emissions trading scheme is quite different. The discipline is not provided by price; the discipline is provided by a legislative cap on carbon pollution which then lets business work out the cheapest and most effective way to operate within that cap. Importantly, it lets business work that out rather than the minister or his office or his bureaucrats here in Canberra picking winners, like the one he was trumpeting in the newspaper this week in the Latrobe Valley as the project that deserves billions and billions of taxpayers' dollars.


We know so little about this replacement policy, which is why I—and, in different words, the member for Melbourne—moved amendments to get much greater clarity from the government about quite what it is their policy entails, because no-one has a clue. If you talk to environmental stakeholders or business, no-one understands what is involved in the Liberal Party policy, because the truth is that it was a policy which, as the member for Wentworth described, was devised as an environmental fig leaf—



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr BUTLER:
  before the member for Kooyong was here. It was devised as an environmental fig leaf to cover the fact that the member for Wentworth had just been defenestrated by the member for Warringah on the condition that the Nick Minchin forces insisted upon—that he move over from being a supporter of an ETS, which he was through to 2009 after campaigning on it in 2007, to being a climate sceptic, someone who would junk the previous consensus started by his mentor, John Howard, and continued by Brendan Nelson and Malcolm Turnbull. I feel great sympathy—




Mr Frydenberg:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, under the new standing orders, I have a question for the shadow minister.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Will the shadow minister take an intervention?




Mr BUTLER:
  No. I feel some sympathy for the minister because I think that—and I think generally stakeholders think so too—he is a person who takes climate change very seriously. He has dedicated a good part of his career to environmental issues but now has this stinking, dead albatross hanging around his neck called Direct Action. It is like getting Senator Cameron out to sell Work Choices. We know the minister does not believe this is going to have any effect on carbon pollution. We know that he is desperately trying to deal with the fact that survey after survey and economist after economist says it will not reduce carbon pollution. Alan Kohler said this morning that Treasury has estimated that the government's policy will cost $10 billion per year.




Mr Frydenberg:
  False!

  Show us the incoming government brief and we will know whether it is false. All we have to go on is suggestion because that is the only thing that comes out of this government.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (13:33):  I am glad the shadow minister opposite, the member for Port Adelaide, has raised the subject of sunshine because when the last parliament started we all heard that we were going to let the sunshine into this place. There was going to be a clean breath of fresh air in this place. With the minority government, the Independents suggested we were going to sing Kumbaya and let the sunshine in.


Indeed, we did, but it was not for very long because the member for Melbourne, along with his Greens mates, wanted to have a carbon tax, the carbon tax that the then Prime Minister—that is three prime ministers ago—said prior to the 2010 election would never be enacted under a government she led. 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' were her infamous words. Yet, despite the fact that we were going to let the sunshine in, despite the fact that we were supposedly going to be gentler, sing Kumbaya, get on with things and respect the people's wishes, not many months later, at the behest of the Greens, we had the carbon tax imposed upon us that the former Prime Minister, the then member for Lalor, said would never happen.


The Abbott-Truss government was elected on 7 September with a mandate to scrap the carbon tax and reduce costs for businesses and households, something that those people on that side would not understand—that businesses are under great pressure. I could name any number of businesses—in fact, I could name all of them—in the Riverina who do not want this toxic tax, who do not want the increasing power prices brought about by this toxic tax, who just want to get on with the job of doing what they do very well. That is producing and providing services for good, hardworking, taxpaying Australians. Families did not need the carbon tax imposed upon their family budgets. That is again something that people on that side would not understand—living within your means, keeping to a budget.


We promised that the carbon tax would go, that it would be the first item of legislative business for this the 44th Parliament. Indeed, it is. But all we hear from the other side is their endless negativity. They just want to stop it. They just want to stop the will of the people.



Mr Conroy interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  Here they go! We are hearing from a new member of parliament that they are just government change deniers, as the Minister for Agriculture quite correctly pointed out the other day in question time.


Labor knows that the carbon tax hurts families and businesses. The quarterly CPI figures released on 24 October 2012, the first since the carbon tax was introduced, saw a 15.3 per cent increase in electricity prices, with household gas and miscellaneous fuel prices seeing a 14.2 per cent rise. This was the largest quarterly increase ever—two thirds of which, on average, came from the carbon tax. Labor knows that families and businesses will be better off once the carbon tax is repealed. They know that. They know in their heart of hearts that that is correct. The removal of the carbon tax in 2014-15 will leave average costs of living across all households around $550 lower than they would have been otherwise, according to Treasury modelling. That is a substantial amount of money for people doing it tough. That is a substantial amount of money for people battling with the rising costs of grocery items and fuel. It is because we have had six long years of hard Labor, who have done nothing to help the economy, nothing to help families and nothing to help businesses.


It is time that Labor got with the program, accepted the result of the 7 September election and actually did something right for a change. It is time that they agreed with the government and said, 'Okay, we accept 7 September. You guys won; we lost. You need to get on with the will of the people. You need to get on with what the people wanted'—that is, to get rid of the carbon tax.


It is estimated that retail electricity prices will be around nine per cent lower and retail gas prices around seven per cent lower than they would otherwise be. Business compliance costs are expected to fall by around $87.6 million per annum as a consequence of repealing the carbon tax. We have to get on with the job of repaying the debt and the deficit that we have been saddled with unfairly, that the people of Australia have been saddled with, by that mob. (Time expired)

Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (13:38):  Today is the day of audacity in this place, typified by the last contribution, that of the member for Riverina. He talked earlier about negativity yet had precisely nothing to say about climate change, nothing to say about the legislation that is before us.


Unlike the member for Riverina and the other members opposite, I believe that taking action on climate change is the most urgent priority for Australia. Unlike members opposite, I believe that putting a price on carbon must be at the core of taking effective action. I believe the scientists on climate change and I believe the economists on how we should respond to meeting this great challenge. There is a consensus in both of those communities that flies in the face of the actions of this government. I refer in particular to September's Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We have heard the numbers plenty of times, but I think it is worth repeating them: 97 per cent of climate scientists concur that climate change is driven by man-made greenhouse gas emissions and 86 per cent of economists, normally the friends of members opposite, support an ETS as the cheapest and most efficient way to reduce carbon pollution.


Owing to the procedural games that are being played, we do not have the opportunity to go to the heart of the amendments of the member for Port Adelaide.



Mr Christensen interjecting—




Mr Giles:
  You will have your turn. We do not have the opportunity to talk about effective action in the form of the ETS. We have before us legislation that I will be opposing because it does not meet the challenge. Labor went to the last three elections promising to put a price on carbon. I was elected to this place on that basis and I will act accordingly.


Putting a price on carbon is of course the most efficient way to allocate capital to cleaner ways of producing and using energy. We need to put a cap on carbon pollution; we need to continue to support renewables; and we need to retain the Climate Change Authority so that the Australian people can continue to have the benefit of that which this government fears the most: independent advice.


We need to replace a backwards policy—this Liberal Party policy—that will not work with one that will, an emissions trading scheme, replacing the carbon tax with a market based mechanism that caps pollution and lets businesses determine the most effective and cost-effective way to operate under that cap. As we know from the procedural debate earlier, Treasury modelling tells us that an early ETS would also reduce significantly the cost of living as well as reducing the cost of carbon.


Our choice is stark. We have a choice to stand up for our children and their children or to blink in the face of this great moral challenge and reduce our future to a meaningless, misleading three-word slogan. As the member for Fremantle put it so well this morning when she had the opportunity to participate fully in this debate: polluter pays or paying polluters. That is the choice before us.


Considerations of equity today and, most importantly, considerations of equity tomorrow, of looking to our children and their children, require us to act, to do our fair share as others throughout the world are doing. To turn our backs on science, economics and indeed on the rest of the world is not an option. To mortgage our future on the farce that is Direct Action is simply not an option. I am confident that Labor stands on the right side of history in this debate.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (13:42):  On these bills before the House there must be no ifs, no buts. The world's largest carbon tax must go. This is the solemn commitment of the Abbott government. It is an insidious, jobs-destroying tax. Even the member for Griffith, when he was Prime Minister, conceded that the carbon tax was driving up the cost of living and hurting families. Members opposite are persisting with a tax that they know is hurting families, they know is hurting business, they know is driving up the cost of living and they know the people of Australia do not want.


Labor's attempts to introduce amendments to introduce an emissions trading scheme are simply an exercise in rebadging. It is a tax—lock, stock and barrel. The people of Corangamite, the people of Geelong, will not be fooled by Labor's rhetoric. They understand that, whether you are a worker from Alcoa or Ford, a small business operator from Belmont or a dairy farmer in Birregurra or Colac, this is a tax which makes no sense. This is a tax on jobs and on electricity. This is a tax on Geelong and a tax on the people of Corangamite.


The people of my electorate will not forget that great big deception in 2010 from former Prime Minister Gillard: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Today in this place, including what we have just heard from the member for Scullin, we hear a continuing deception about our government's commitment to climate change. We are committed to tackling climate change. We are committed to reducing CO2 emissions but we are not going to damage this nation irreparably in the process.


The futility of a carbon tax, by whatever name Labor wishes to call it, was summed up perfectly by Labor's former climate change minister, Senator Wong. On 6 February 2008, she said:


… the introduction of a carbon price ahead of effective international action can lead to perverse incentives for such industries to relocate or source production offshore.


There is no point imposing domestically a carbon price which results in emissions and production transferring internationally for no environmental gain.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (13:27):  I think it is important, at the beginning of the very short, curtailed consideration in detail that we have, to frame exactly what is at issue in this House, or what was at issue in a very formal sense had my amendments been ruled in order, and that is: there are points of agreement between the government and the opposition and there are points of difference.


The point of agreement, as much as the minister might seek to resist this point, is around the termination of the carbon tax. This was a position that the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, enunciated, as clearly as possibly could be the case, before the last election—that the termination of the carbon tax would happen next year. As it happens, now we have a measure of clarity about the government's position—I say only 'a measure of clarity'. 


We would actually have terminated the carbon tax on the same day, 30 June next year. The difference between the government and the opposition in this debate is not the termination of the carbon tax but what replaces it, and that is the debate that would have been had had my amendments been ruled in order, because very clearly before the election we indicated that Australia should move as quickly as possible, on 1 July next year, to an emissions trading scheme—not to the raft of policies that the minister would seek to introduce to an emissions trading scheme.


The minister and others of the government have sought to equate a carbon tax with an emissions trading scheme and, in doing so, you are either trying deliberately to mislead the community or you simply do not understand the fundamental economics of the two models. They are profoundly different. The carbon tax operates without a legal limit on carbon pollution and instead uses a price mechanism to seek to control the behaviour that is being targeted—in this case, the emission of carbon pollution. An emissions trading scheme is quite different. The discipline is not provided by price; the discipline is provided by a legislative cap on carbon pollution which then lets business work out the cheapest and most effective way to operate within that cap. Importantly, it lets business work that out rather than the minister or his office or his bureaucrats here in Canberra picking winners, like the one he was trumpeting in the newspaper this week in the Latrobe Valley as the project that deserves billions and billions of taxpayers' dollars.


We know so little about this replacement policy, which is why I—and, in different words, the member for Melbourne—moved amendments to get much greater clarity from the government about quite what it is their policy entails, because no-one has a clue. If you talk to environmental stakeholders or business, no-one understands what is involved in the Liberal Party policy, because the truth is that it was a policy which, as the member for Wentworth described, was devised as an environmental fig leaf—



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr BUTLER:
  before the member for Kooyong was here. It was devised as an environmental fig leaf to cover the fact that the member for Wentworth had just been defenestrated by the member for Warringah on the condition that the Nick Minchin forces insisted upon—that he move over from being a supporter of an ETS, which he was through to 2009 after campaigning on it in 2007, to being a climate sceptic, someone who would junk the previous consensus started by his mentor, John Howard, and continued by Brendan Nelson and Malcolm Turnbull. I feel great sympathy—




Mr Frydenberg:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, under the new standing orders, I have a question for the shadow minister.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Will the shadow minister take an intervention?




Mr BUTLER:
  No. I feel some sympathy for the minister because I think that—and I think generally stakeholders think so too—he is a person who takes climate change very seriously. He has dedicated a good part of his career to environmental issues but now has this stinking, dead albatross hanging around his neck called Direct Action. It is like getting Senator Cameron out to sell Work Choices. We know the minister does not believe this is going to have any effect on carbon pollution. We know that he is desperately trying to deal with the fact that survey after survey and economist after economist says it will not reduce carbon pollution. Alan Kohler said this morning that Treasury has estimated that the government's policy will cost $10 billion per year.




Mr Frydenberg:
  False!




Mr BUTLER:
  Show us the incoming government brief and we will know whether it is false. All we have to go on is suggestion because that is the only thing that comes out of this government.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (13:33):  I am glad the shadow minister opposite, the member for Port Adelaide, has raised the subject of sunshine because when the last parliament started we all heard that we were going to let the sunshine into this place. There was going to be a clean breath of fresh air in this place. With the minority government, the Independents suggested we were going to sing Kumbaya and let the sunshine in.


Indeed, we did, but it was not for very long because the member for Melbourne, along with his Greens mates, wanted to have a carbon tax, the carbon tax that the then Prime Minister—that is three prime ministers ago—said prior to the 2010 election would never be enacted under a government she led. 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' were her infamous words. Yet, despite the fact that we were going to let the sunshine in, despite the fact that we were supposedly going to be gentler, sing Kumbaya, get on with things and respect the people's wishes, not many months later, at the behest of the Greens, we had the carbon tax imposed upon us that the former Prime Minister, the then member for Lalor, said would never happen.


The Abbott-Truss government was elected on 7 September with a mandate to scrap the carbon tax and reduce costs for businesses and households, something that those people on that side would not understand—that businesses are under great pressure. I could name any number of businesses—in fact, I could name all of them—in the Riverina who do not want this toxic tax, who do not want the increasing power prices brought about by this toxic tax, who just want to get on with the job of doing what they do very well. That is producing and providing services for good, hardworking, taxpaying Australians. Families did not need the carbon tax imposed upon their family budgets. That is again something that people on that side would not understand—living within your means, keeping to a budget.


We promised that the carbon tax would go, that it would be the first item of legislative business for this the 44th Parliament. Indeed, it is. But all we hear from the other side is their endless negativity. They just want to stop it. They just want to stop the will of the people.



Mr Conroy interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  Here they go! We are hearing from a new member of parliament that they are just government change deniers, as the Minister for Agriculture quite correctly pointed out the other day in question time.


Labor knows that the carbon tax hurts families and businesses. The quarterly CPI figures released on 24 October 2012, the first since the carbon tax was introduced, saw a 15.3 per cent increase in electricity prices, with household gas and miscellaneous fuel prices seeing a 14.2 per cent rise. This was the largest quarterly increase ever—two thirds of which, on average, came from the carbon tax. Labor knows that families and businesses will be better off once the carbon tax is repealed. They know that. They know in their heart of hearts that that is correct. The removal of the carbon tax in 2014-15 will leave average costs of living across all households around $550 lower than they would have been otherwise, according to Treasury modelling. That is a substantial amount of money for people doing it tough. That is a substantial amount of money for people battling with the rising costs of grocery items and fuel. It is because we have had six long years of hard Labor, who have done nothing to help the economy, nothing to help families and nothing to help businesses.


It is time that Labor got with the program, accepted the result of the 7 September election and actually did something right for a change. It is time that they agreed with the government and said, 'Okay, we accept 7 September. You guys won; we lost. You need to get on with the will of the people. You need to get on with what the people wanted'—that is, to get rid of the carbon tax.


It is estimated that retail electricity prices will be around nine per cent lower and retail gas prices around seven per cent lower than they would otherwise be. Business compliance costs are expected to fall by around $87.6 million per annum as a consequence of repealing the carbon tax. We have to get on with the job of repaying the debt and the deficit that we have been saddled with unfairly, that the people of Australia have been saddled with, by that mob. (Time expired)

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-11-21,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (13:38):  Today is the day of audacity in this place, typified by the last contribution, that of the member for Riverina. He talked earlier about negativity yet had precisely nothing to say about climate change, nothing to say about the legislation that is before us.


Unlike the member for Riverina and the other members opposite, I believe that taking action on climate change is the most urgent priority for Australia. Unlike members opposite, I believe that putting a price on carbon must be at the core of taking effective action. I believe the scientists on climate change and I believe the economists on how we should respond to meeting this great challenge. There is a consensus in both of those communities that flies in the face of the actions of this government. I refer in particular to September's Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We have heard the numbers plenty of times, but I think it is worth repeating them: 97 per cent of climate scientists concur that climate change is driven by man-made greenhouse gas emissions and 86 per cent of economists, normally the friends of members opposite, support an ETS as the cheapest and most efficient way to reduce carbon pollution.


Owing to the procedural games that are being played, we do not have the opportunity to go to the heart of the amendments of the member for Port Adelaide.



Mr Christensen interjecting—




Mr Giles:
  You will have your turn. We do not have the opportunity to talk about effective action in the form of the ETS. We have before us legislation that I will be opposing because it does not meet the challenge. Labor went to the last three elections promising to put a price on carbon. I was elected to this place on that basis and I will act accordingly.


Putting a price on carbon is of course the most efficient way to allocate capital to cleaner ways of producing and using energy. We need to put a cap on carbon pollution; we need to continue to support renewables; and we need to retain the Climate Change Authority so that the Australian people can continue to have the benefit of that which this government fears the most: independent advice.


We need to replace a backwards policy—this Liberal Party policy—that will not work with one that will, an emissions trading scheme, replacing the carbon tax with a market based mechanism that caps pollution and lets businesses determine the most effective and cost-effective way to operate under that cap. As we know from the procedural debate earlier, Treasury modelling tells us that an early ETS would also reduce significantly the cost of living as well as reducing the cost of carbon.


Our choice is stark. We have a choice to stand up for our children and their children or to blink in the face of this great moral challenge and reduce our future to a meaningless, misleading three-word slogan. As the member for Fremantle put it so well this morning when she had the opportunity to participate fully in this debate: polluter pays or paying polluters. That is the choice before us.


Considerations of equity today and, most importantly, considerations of equity tomorrow, of looking to our children and their children, require us to act, to do our fair share as others throughout the world are doing. To turn our backs on science, economics and indeed on the rest of the world is not an option. To mortgage our future on the farce that is Direct Action is simply not an option. I am confident that Labor stands on the right side of history in this debate.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (13:42):  On these bills before the House there must be no ifs, no buts. The world's largest carbon tax must go. This is the solemn commitment of the Abbott government. It is an insidious, jobs-destroying tax. Even the member for Griffith, when he was Prime Minister, conceded that the carbon tax was driving up the cost of living and hurting families. Members opposite are persisting with a tax that they know is hurting families, they know is hurting business, they know is driving up the cost of living and they know the people of Australia do not want.


Labor's attempts to introduce amendments to introduce an emissions trading scheme are simply an exercise in rebadging. It is a tax—lock, stock and barrel. The people of Corangamite, the people of Geelong, will not be fooled by Labor's rhetoric. They understand that, whether you are a worker from Alcoa or Ford, a small business operator from Belmont or a dairy farmer in Birregurra or Colac, this is a tax which makes no sense. This is a tax on jobs and on electricity. This is a tax on Geelong and a tax on the people of Corangamite.


The people of my electorate will not forget that great big deception in 2010 from former Prime Minister Gillard: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Today in this place, including what we have just heard from the member for Scullin, we hear a continuing deception about our government's commitment to climate change. We are committed to tackling climate change. We are committed to reducing CO2 emissions but we are not going to damage this nation irreparably in the process.


The futility of a carbon tax, by whatever name Labor wishes to call it, was summed up perfectly by Labor's former climate change minister, Senator Wong. On 6 February 2008, she said:


… the introduction of a carbon price ahead of effective international action can lead to perverse incentives for such industries to relocate or source production offshore.


There is no point imposing domestically a carbon price which results in emissions and production transferring internationally for no environmental gain.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (13:45):  In February this year, I stood in this place to sing the praises of the Canberra Cavalry, who had won the Australian Baseball Championship and brought the Claxton Shield to Canberra for the very first time. At that point in time, I thought this was the pinnacle of baseball glory for Canberra—but I was wrong, because last night in Taiwan the Cavs stunned the baseball world to beat the Uni-President Lions 14-4 in the Asia Series final.


The Cavs have proven that they are not just the champions of Australia; they are the champions of Asia. It would be an impressive feat for any Australian baseball team to beat the multimillion dollar teams of Asia. But for the Cavs—who not so long ago were the wooden-spooners of the Australian Baseball League; who have been described as a motley crew of public servants, part-timers and minor league baseballers; who have a total payroll of just $47,000—this feat is nothing short of incredible.


As a lover of baseball and a lover of Canberra I could not be any prouder today—and I have dressed in Canberra Cavalry orange to prove it. 


Congratulations to Coach Michael Collins and General Manager Thom Carter and, most importantly, the players. Canberra is a very proud city today, and I am sure the Narrabundah Fort will be packed out on Friday night to welcome the Cavs home.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (15:24):  I will continue my contribution. Let us consider the cost of the carbon tax on the people of Corangamite. In Geelong, perhaps the most carbon intensive city in the country, the carbon tax is causing damage. We are home to many trade exposed companies—Ford, Boral, Shell and Alcoa—and a region extremely dependent on agriculture and manufacturing. In our region thousands of jobs have been lost or are under threat. The carbon tax is a cost of doing business and it is hampering our region's capacity to thrive and to prosper. Consider what it is doing to our farmers, food processors and timber mills. The carbon tax is costing every dairy farmer on average $7,500 a year.


On 10 September 2013 the member for Corio told Sky News: 'We do need to acknowledge the fact that Tony Abbott won the election and we lost.' Today members opposite must acknowledge that fact. Australian voters elected our government with a mandate to axe the carbon tax, to reduce costs for businesses and households, to boost jobs and to restore Australia's international competitiveness. I am proud to be a member of a government which is committed to abolishing the carbon tax.

 (Perth) (15:25):  I believe that the Prime Minister will go down as the Neville Chamberlain of the climate change crisis. You may remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that as World War II was brewing Neville Chamberlain went over and saw the Fuehrer and came back and said, 'I've got all this sorted—no problem.' He told the people to go home and to get a nice, quiet sleep. Well, I believe that is exactly what the Prime Minister is telling us to do, that we have got nothing to worry about, that we do not have to make any changes to the way we do things, we should just go home and have a nice quiet sleep.


We have had many of those on the other side tell us about problems from the financial impost that has occurred to people in their electorates. It is true that any change in the economy does cause some pain, some adjustment. That is the way of the world. But it can be managed, and it has been demonstrated that it can be managed. We have had members opposite saying it does not work. We have seen a 6.1 per cent reduction in our emissions from electricity generation but at the same time our economy continued to grow. We have had this really naive expression that we are running against the tide by putting in place a carbon price. This is the bit that I find really extraordinary. Just as we are seeking to remove any pricing on carbon, what do we see around the world? We see that next week Beijing and Shanghai will both sign up and commence the operation of a carbon emission scheme. They will be joining Shenzheng and Guangzhou, which have already got an emissions trading scheme. That actually encompasses more than 50 million people—more than twice the population of Australia. But we keep saying that no-one else is doing this. It is really interesting to see what has been actually happening in China. They chose seven cities to start off with to have an emissions trading scheme. There was concern among some of those seven cities that by the scheme being confined to them industry in those areas would be tempted to relocate to unaffected provinces. However, the very opposite appears to be occurring. According to reports, some Chinese regions that have not been included in the ETS trial are now putting their hands up and saying that they want to join in too. 


I think there are profoundly strong economic arguments, putting aside all the environmental arguments that we have heard. This is a matter of fitting our economy up. The sorts of adjustments we had to make in the 1980s when we were floating the dollar, when we were removing the tariff barriers, do require adjustment and there is a measure of pain. But ultimately that is what we have to do to get our economy in shape. We see countries now around the world and areas around the world embracing ETSs. Very interestingly, the American states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont talk about introducing their emissions trading scheme early, with the emphasis on learning and moving towards a more mature scheme, just as they did in the EU. They call it the 'learning by doing' phase. All these countries around the world are moving to an ETS—moving slowly, with a modest price on carbon, which is what we want. We want to align ourselves with the EU and the schemes that are coming on in all those Canadian provinces and US states. We need to do that. We need to work out how you do it. We need to be part of this global development that is happening. It is happening. As I say, next week it is Beijing and Shanghai.


What we are seeing here is not only the most appalling act of appeasement, an appalling betrayal of the Australian people which will end in disaster, but also an act of economic vandalism. It is taking us backwards. We need to accept that there is going to be a more carbon-constrained reality and make the adjustments that are necessary to do it now. (Time expired)

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (15:31):  The repeal of Labor's carbon tax demonstrates a new government on the front foot, a government which was elected with a clear and absolute mandate to liquidate the carbon tax. The Australian people have spoken, and this government is determined to give swift or, should the need arise, resolute effect to their voice. For, while the Labor Party seems set on playing some obstructionist political game or is otherwise bizarrely committed to hurting Australian families and businesses through higher electricity and gas prices, the coalition government will see this through. We will not stop until this toxic tax is disposed of. The reasons are simple, painfully simple.


With the carbon tax, the Australian people have been in equal parts mugged and taken for mugs. Julia Gillard declared there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. Later, her predecessor-cum-successor, Kevin Rudd, would proclaim that he had 'terminated' the carbon tax—another false utterance from the former Labor Prime Minister. Now we have the Leader of the Opposition on the one hand saying that he indeed intends to 'terminate' the carbon tax, yet at the same time he proposes to oppose the government's repeal of legislation that would satisfy this very objective. Work that one out.


Australians are tired of trying to work out or work through this unfathomable labyrinth of lies from those opposite. They are weary of the hubris and spin, while the reality of the carbon tax comes home to them every day. These families, pensioners, retirees and small businesses have all seen their electricity and gas bills surge. That the carbon tax has been a chief contributing factor is beyond question. Right from October 2012, with the release of the first quarterly consumer price index figures following its inception, we have felt it. Those numbers revealed an immediate 15.3 per cent rise in electricity prices, while the cost of household gas and miscellaneous fuel jumped by 14.2 per cent. The hike in these quarterly bills was the largest we have ever seen.


My electorate of Longman lies about 45 minutes north of Brisbane, where the big employers are retail, small business, tourism and light industry. In the 12 months prior to this year's federal election, business after business showed me the face of genuine fear, and, in every instance, the carbon tax was central to their anguish. One shop owner in Burpengary told me of surrendering $1,300 a month in higher input costs associated with the carbon tax. Another key local manufacturer forecast a $30,000 rise in electricity charges directly attributable to the carbon tax. And a Caboolture based refrigerated fruit and vegetable carrier had been belted by a substantial increase in refrigerant gas costs due directly to the carbon tax. If the 44th Australian Parliament does not stop Labor's carbon tax from running to schedule and being applied to heavy vehicle diesel fuel from 1 July next year, this great local enterprise will be beaten up once again. 


What ultimately emerges is a flow-on of the costs of the carbon tax for transport and storage to groceries, and every family will be paying more at the check-out. Unsurprisingly, these conditions have fanned a crisis of confidence, which, in turn, has knocked the health of the economy even more. During the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, Longman's unemployment rate more than doubled, from 3.06 per cent to 7.86 per cent. The youth unemployment rate skyrocketed from 4.3 per cent to 11.4 per cent. New taxes and increasing taxes do not create more jobs. This is a tax that hurts jobs and pushes up the cost of living. There is a better way, a smarter way, a more successful way, and the coalition  government is prepared to lead the way.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (15:36):  We on this side of the House accept the fact that climate change is real and we accept the science on this, which is in stark contrast to those opposite. We accept the scientific facts that are clearly telling us that human activity is causing climate change and will continue to grossly affect our economy and our way of life. We accept that and we accept the need to be taking action. And, because we accepted that and knew that we needed to act, in government we did act. I will remind the previous speaker, the member for Longman, of the comprehensive assistance packages that we had in place. So we made sure that we acted, but we also had an assistance package there for many people. Indeed, many people in my electorate received comprehensive amounts of assistance in relation to the policies that we brought in.


The truth is that a price on carbon pollution can work and has been working. Yet now this government is removing effective action on reducing carbon emissions. That is exactly what they are doing. It is irresponsible and it really is representative of this government's environmental vandalism and lack of understanding of the need to act effectively to combat dangerous climate change.


This bill, the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013, that is being put forward by the Prime Minister and the Liberal-National Party really dismantles our nation's scientific and very rational approach to tackling climate change. We on this side of the House know that it is vitally important to be taking that action for future generations, and not just for our environment but for our economy. The two are linked and indeed they support one another.


This is a view expressed by many people in my electorate of Richmond. I am very fortunate to have many very committed local individuals and groups who, for a long time, have strongly advocated for government to take action on climate change. That is why, when in government, we did act. And those same constituents in my electorate are bitterly disappointed about the actions now of the Abbott government and have expressed that to me on many occasions.


We see, nationwide and internationally, every day, more and more, the impacts of climate change. We see the massively varied weather patterns, oceans rising and increases in natural disasters. In many ways, this bill sums up this new government's attitude to the science of climate change. They are indeed a party of climate change deniers. Even in the face of the overwhelming scientific evidence emerging that mankind is directly contributing to the increasing pace of global warming, what do they do? They just do not believe it; they ignore it and refuse to take effective action. As we know from the Prime Minister's own words, he thinks it is 'absolute crap'. That is his summation of it. So this bill is not just about their actions in trying to stop carbon pricing; it is really representative of their obsession surrounding climate change denial.


What is also really distressing about this bill is that it is not just repealing the pricing of carbon. It is also going to be dismantling the Climate Change Authority, a really important body set up to give independent and scientific advice on renewable energy and on caps and targets on carbon pollution to the government. 


The bill is also abolishing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, a really important body that was set up to help get new commercial renewable projects started, to provide fantastic financing and incentives in all those important areas. Indeed, this bill will severely damage the clean energy industry—an industry that Australia takes great pride in and excels in. But all we hear from those opposite is about their so-called direct action; I think it is more 'direct inaction', with their bizarre policies of magic trees and magic soils which just will not work.


Let us compare ourselves to the rest of the world. Throughout the world we see that many countries are taking action on climate change through emissions trading schemes. More than 30 other countries have carbon pricing schemes. In fact, as we have heard from other speakers today, China has an emissions trading scheme set up in many of its provinces, Germany has an ETS, the United Kingdom has an ETS and France has an ETS. Even many states in the USA are now legislating to introduce an ETS. So many other countries in the world are acting, and it really is quite embarrassing to see Australian now going backwards on what really was effective action to tackle climate change. Now that we are moving backwards it is quite embarrassing for us on the world stage.


On this side of the House, our position is to support the policy we took to the federal election: we wanted to terminate the carbon tax and introduce an emissions trading scheme. Of course, those amendments were refused earlier in the day, but we are absolutely committed to making sure we have an emissions trading scheme. We know that moving towards that and having that market based system is the most effective way to be tackling climate change. That is the action that we should be taking.


In the closing moments, I will talk about some of the long-term economic benefits for places in my area, the North Coast of New South Wales, and for places just above that in South-East Queensland. We will rely in our future on tourism, and we need to take action to make sure we protect the very pristine environment that we have there. So I do find it absolutely remarkable that members of this House are not working with us to make sure we protect the environment for the future.

"Hendy, Peter, MP",LP,2013-11-21,"



Dr HENDY
 (Eden-Monaro) (15:41):  I rise in support of the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013. During the whole of the campaign in the year leading up to the election on 7 September, the abolition of the carbon tax was one of the key campaign issues in Eden-Monaro. I told the electorate that if I were elected the first principal speech I would make after the election, after my maiden speech, would be on the abolition of the carbon tax, and that is why I am rising to speak today. So this was an issue that was central to the policy debate in Eden-Monaro over the last three years but especially in the last five weeks of the election campaign. Everyone on this side who has spoken has informed or re-informed the House that, in the 2010 election—indeed, it was on 16 August 2010, just five days before the election—former Prime Minister Gillard said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' And the member for Lilley, who at that stage was the Treasurer of Australia, said on 15 August: 'No, it is not possible that we are bringing in a carbon tax. That is a hysterically inaccurate claim being made by the coalition.' The fact is that the election was a referendum on the carbon tax. The coalition won with a mandate to abolish it, and that is what we are doing here today and I hope it will pass the Senate once it has passed the House of Representatives.


As you will know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I am an economist by profession. In fact, I am proud to say that I am a Commonwealth Treasury trained economist. I am also a former chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and, as such, I know about economics from a business point of view as well. And I know that the carbon tax does not work as an economic concept. I know that there are a lot of economists around Australia and in other parts of the world who say, 'The carbon tax is the best economic alternative to deal with emissions reduction, to deal with the climate change issue.' But, frankly, they are not right, because they do not take account properly of the international marketplace. And the fact is that a carbon tax, an emissions trading scheme, will not work unless there is a comprehensive treaty arrangement across the world of the major emitters such that they all implement a carbon tax at the same time, basically at the same carbon price. It will not work. And the reason is because the market—the business community across the world—will game the system.


We are basically the only country in the world with a comprehensive carbon tax; we all know that. We know that the scheme in Europe is only a partial emissions trading scheme across the carbon production sectors of the economy of Europe. We know that what is being done in the US is an infinitesimally small part of the emissions-producing part of the sector in the United States. We know that in China—people have been talking about China today—it is only an infinitesimally small part of the Chinese economy that is producing emissions. If you do not have a comprehensive international agreement, a carbon tax in Australia does not work.


That is why we have proposed that it be abolished, that is why we have a direct action plan that will, in a market based system—what we call a 'reverse auction' system—actually fund those programs that will work to reduce emissions. That is why we are setting up an emissions reduction fund. That is the way to go about dealing with the climate change issue, because that will be a system that will work—to fund directly emissions reduction initiatives—as opposed to a carbon tax, which will only damage the Australian economy and not help it. I support the bill.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-11-21,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (15:46):  The previous speaker said that he was an economist. Let me quote from Professor Ross Garnaut, vice-chancellor, fellow and professorial research fellow in economics at the University of Melbourne, and author of Dog Days: Australia after the boom. He says, specifically on this question, in an article in today's paper:


It would lead to larger sacrifices of productivity than would be necessary with broadly based carbon pricing. It would lead either to much higher costs later in the decade or to Australia breaching its commitments to the international community and damaging its own interest in the global mitigation effort.


I think that Professor Garnaut is indeed an authority on this very subject, and he makes the point very well that if we do not proceed with action right now it will cost us much more dearly in the years to come.


This is a matter that is truly a debate about climate change being dressed up as a debate about tax for no other reason than political expediency and for the member for Warringah to become Prime Minister of Australia. By dressing it up as a debate about tax, what we are doing is diminishing the true issue and diminishing the reports of thousands of scientists around the world who have been telling us for decades that climate change is real, that climate change is resulting partially from the emissions of greenhouse gases around the world and that human activity is in fact contributing to those emissions.


The government has had to trivialise that debate in order to get back to turning it into a debate about carbon tax. The problem with that is that what we are doing as a nation is effectively walking away from our responsibility not only to the Australian people but to people right across the world. So much so, that this has been a matter that has been the subject of international discussions and debate for years and years. Right now, there is a conference taking part in Warsaw in Poland, and this government could not even see fit to send a minister of government to those discussions—such is the gravity of this issue.


Mr Deputy Speaker, if you accept the science—and this side of the House does—then this truly is the most serious issue facing Australia and the rest of the world. If you do not accept the science, then clearly it is not. It has been part of the government's strategy to undermine the science by running with many of the commentators who are prepared to diminish the work of scientists who have worked in this field for years. Even the most recent report of the IPCC confirms the findings of previous reports. The work of scientists that has been peer reviewed time and time again is supported every time there is another report.


Labor's position on this is very clear: we said from the outset that we are prepared to abolish the price on carbon that we had set. But we are prepared to do it only if the government is prepared to take appropriate and responsible steps in place of abolishing that, because if you do not, what you are doing is simply offloading the burden onto future generations. I want to talk about that burden just for a moment, because one of the primary arguments of members opposite is to talk about the cost to society as a result of the price on carbon that the former Gillard government put on.


What about the cost to society of doing nothing? The cost to society that arose after the 11 or 12 years of serious drought in the Murray-Darling Basin, that ran into billions of dollars? The cost to society every time there is a cyclone, a flood or a bushfire in this country? What is the cost to society of allowing this issue to go unchecked, when we know full well that it is going to have dramatic and drastic effects on our health costs in this country? What about all of those costs? If you factored those into account, then the reality is that with the cost to society it is much better to tackle the problem than to walk away from it.


We know that the government's response to this now is a policy of direct action—a policy that cannot be measured, a policy that nobody supports, a policy that will not achieve the targets and a policy that in reality comes at a greater cost than the price on carbon placed by the Gillard government was to families around Australia—a cost of $1,200 and more to each and every family in this country.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2013-11-21,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (15:51):  After the hot air that we have heard on this it is time for some clarity, time for some common sense and time for some understanding of exactly what this debate is. There has been a lot of confusion that was born in the creation of the carbon tax, because the Labor Party played the hokey-pokey game on this. Before the 2010 election the carbon tax was out, then after the 2010 election the carbon tax was in, and then before the 7 September election the carbon tax was out again, but now they are here telling us it is in. So you can understand why there has been a lot of confusion about this debate.


In essence, what we are debating is a very simple premise, and that is that this carbon tax is going to help save the planet by raising costs. It will not surprise you to know that I dispute that premise on many levels, but I think it is vitally important that we realise from the start that it is confusing two very different debates. The first involves science and the second involves economics. First, there is the debate on science, which I believe has created an extraordinarily unscientific reaction around the globe. Science is always about ongoing inquiry and understanding, whereas the global warming debate has been characterised as one between good and evil—and we have heard that here today from the members opposite. That fits in perfectly with their hokey-pokey, kindergarten approach to politics, but for the grown-ups in the room it is certainly not objective. And from where I stand the greatest  crime in this debate has been the demonisation of anyone who has the temerity to question any aspect of the theory of man-made climate change.


Just as those who subscribe to the anthropogenic climate change theories cannot be 100 per cent sure of their belief, I also cannot state categorically that I know there is no link between emissions and the climate. I do have doubts, and those doubts stem from the well-publicised antics of some of the climate scientists out there that were exposed in 'climategate', where they expressed private concerns over the negligible increase in global temperatures—in fact, there has been no increase statistically in global temperatures over the last 15 or 16 years—but then set about altering their statistics to try and prove the opposite.


The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, which is not influenced by the need to secure government funds, has published a report called Climate change reconsidered. That report showed that the science is nowhere near to being settled. They were reputable scientists—




Mr Zappia:
  It wasn't peer reviewed.




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  Just like the IPCC report is not peer reviewed—it is not, mate. The reports that come out are not peer reviewed. This is a document by real climate scientists who say that there is doubt about the science and the so-called science that we hear that is out there. But I want to get onto the economics because this is an area where the facts really are indisputable, and we do not need peer reviews to know that. The member who spoke before mentioned Professor Garnaut. Well, Professor Garnaut had an interesting quote from his report when he dreamed this whole mess up for the Labor Party. What he said was:


Regional communities and industries are likely to be more vulnerable to these impacts than urban centres, due to their reliance on agriculture and other natural resource-based industries.


He is right because in my electorate there is mining, agriculture and tourism, and this tax is suffocating all three industries. In mining the picture is very bleak. We have had 9,000 jobs cut across Queensland and New South Wales, many of them in the Bowen Basin, over the last 18 months. There is an undeniable link between the carbon tax and those job losses. Rio Tinto called it an unfair tax on Australian exporters. It is equally devastating for farmers in my electorate. Cane growers have come out against it, saying it adds significantly to the bottom line costs of cane farming businesses. The Queensland horticulture based body Grocom also predicted that a carbon emissions trading scheme—which these guys want this carbon tax to evolve into—could raise farm costs by about 1.15 per cent by 2020. Any addition to the bottom line of farms is not a good thing and it risks farmers going to the wall. Tourism is equally at risk. A new study by AEC Group research, commissioned by Tourism Accommodation Australia, estimates that the carbon tax will add $115 million in costs to hotels and motels. So three industries in my electorate are going to be hit, and hit hard.


Labor's carbon tax is just wrong. It is probably wrong on the science. It is definitely wrong on the economics. I urge every member of the House to distinguish between the two. Enough of the hot air. Let's get rid of this dreadful carbon tax.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (15:56):  It is my pleasure to follow the member for Dawson in this debate—somebody who I think exposes the real truth at the heart of the coalition's opposition to an emissions trading scheme. That opposition is not because they accept the science and dispute the economics. It is fundamentally because those opposite do not accept the science of climate change. The member for Dawson has been very clear about that. He thinks that 97 per cent of the world's scientists are wrong and he, instead, has the truth. I argued with the member for Canning on Twitter but eventually, about 20 tweets in, I just had to let him go because—




Mr Christensen:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Is the member for Fraser willing to give way?




Dr LEIGH:
  No. I stopped the Twitter battle with the member for Canning at a certain point when I finally got bored, but he was taking on the Bureau of Meteorology. They are now, of course, responsible for the Bureau of Meteorology, but the member for Canning disputes the bureau's finding that Australia has just experienced the hottest summer on record, the hottest winter on record and is on track to experience the hottest year on record.


The time for political games is gone. If this House does not take serious action on climate change we are kicking it off to future generations, and those generations will pay a higher cost than we will today. Future generations will look very dimly upon this government that took away an effective, efficient way of reducing Australia's emissions and replaced it with an expensive, ineffective hodgepodge of measures. Ross Garnaut was asked about this on Lateline the other night. He said of direct action that it would be considerably more expensive and that getting rid of the carbon price has a significant negative impact on the budget. The impact on the budget of getting rid of the mining tax and the carbon price is, between them, $17 billion, which must be paid by higher taxes on workers. That is what those opposite believe. They believe the tax burden on polluters and mining billionaires should be lower and the tax burden on workers should be higher.


I was listening before to the member for Eden-Monaro with his economic views and I have to say I was thinking at the time of that great Chris Caton quote when a range of eminent Australian economists were asked their view on carbon pricing and 86 per cent strongly supported carbon pricing over direct action. As Chris Caton said, anyone who believes direct action is economically more sensible 'should hand his degree back'.


When the Leader of the Opposition was confronted with similar evidence—a survey of the Australian Conference of Economists showing a vast majority of economists in favour of carbon pricing—he said that maybe that was a comment on the 'quality of our economists' rather than on the quality of our policy, to which Joshua Gans responded that maybe it just said something about the quality of the Leader of the Opposition.



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Dr LEIGH:
  We have the honourable member interjecting here, who wrote his very thesis on 'A tax to make the polluter pay' but has been willing to throw good economics out the window to score a political point! This is no small issue for this parliament. The cost of dealing with climate change will only rise. As the developed country with the highest level of per capita emissions, that cost will fall on future generations. This government is doing deep, deep damage to the country by getting rid of an emissions trading scheme and replacing it with a scheme which we know to be far more expensive.


We have had those opposite making claims that they have Nobel laureates supporting them. The member for Flinders named a series of Nobel laureates who supported Direct Action, but of course when contacted, those Nobel laureates had no support for the member for Flinders. Why? Because Nobel laureates like other economists recognise that a pricing system is the best way of dealing with climate change. There are plenty of economists who support climate change, but no credible economists that support Direct Action. It is more expensive, less effective and a punishment to future generations who will pay the price of this government's short-sighted decisions.

Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (16:01):  As a former farmer and small business owner I understand the many difficulties facing the sugar industry and the Hinkler business community more broadly. In a recent submission to government on the repeal of the carbon tax, Queensland cane growers advised that Labor's tax had increased the cost of production by $20 million since it was introduced, hurting the industry's international competitiveness.


Sugar cane is Queensland's largest agricultural crop by volume and value. With 80 per cent of Australia's sugar exported overseas, it is also Australia's seventh largest agricultural export. Australia's sugar exports were worth $1.4 billion last financial year, making us the third largest supplier in the world. The industry also employs 50,000 people, directly and indirectly.


Irrigators have been hardest hit by the carbon tax. Cane growers indicate that repealing the carbon tax will save them up to 10 per cent on their energy bills and save thousands of jobs. It will also bring significant supply chain benefits. The tax inflated the price of goods like fertiliser and chemicals. Industry research shows growers are paying up to 33 cents extra per tonne this financial year to produce the same crop they did in 2010-11, before the introduction of the tax. As cane growers are not able to pass the cost on to their international consumers, the increased cost of production is being paid for directly from the bottom line, in some cases leading to a reduction of wages and the loss of jobs. Cane growers have always opposed the carbon tax, and for good reason. Repealing Labor's carbon tax will go some way to helping restore profitability to the industry and provide workers with greater job security.


Despite the significant impact of the carbon tax and the relatively high trade exposure of the industry, sugar cane growers did not receive any assistance under the Clean Energy Futures package. The Queensland Cane Growers Organisation argues that they are the only sugar cane growers in the world to operate without some form of subsidy, trade barrier or market control. The only way Australia's cane farmers remain competitive by global standards is through constantly improving productivity and by containing the cost of production relative to cane producers in Thailand, Brazil and India. 


Agribusiness contributes greatly to the economic viability of regional communities like Hinkler and that is why this government is committed to repealing the carbon tax. Like cane growers, Hinkler's horticulturalists are price-takers and not price-setters, which means they are unable to pass the cost of the carbon tax on to their markets. Peter Hockings, Executive Officer at BFVG, recently told me his members were deeply concerned about their future under Labor's carbon tax. The tax has been the final nail in the coffin for many.


Many growers are eager to find ways to reduce their carbon footprint, but argue a tax is not the way to go about it. They, like this government, favour direct action, improving productivity and finding efficiencies. They are paying more for fertiliser, more to transport their products to market, and more to dispose of their organic waste material. As well as the increased cost of electricity for irrigators, our growers are paying more for their cold storage. 


Our farmers are not the only ones paying more for refrigerant gases. Businesses like the Woodgate Beach General Store, which services a small community, have taken a big hit. Owners, Barry and Rose, are looking to retire and know their prospects for selling the business will be better without a carbon tax. Businesses and community groups already running on tight budgets are feeling the pinch. The carbon tax has impacted on the cost of gas in the bowls club. It affects the electricity costs for the ice-makers who supply our commercial and recreational fishermen. It has increased costs for the local library and community hall.


But the strong opposition to Labor's tax does not stop there. Allow me to read just one of the many letters my office received in relation to the carbon tax, which said:


l am contacting you to express my concern of the impending rise in the cost of living and loss of industry when the carbon tax is introduced.


As a senior Australian I am finding that my dollar does not perform in the supermarket, petrol bowser or when paying rates.


I am fearful that the increased costs levelled at councils, through the introduction of the carbon tax, will mean I will have trouble finding the funds to meet the financial demands of life.


Being a baby boomer, I bought an investment property in Maryborough, as our superannuation would only support us for about six months in retirement.


There is no work for people my age in Hervey Bay and unfortunately, because we now have an investment property asset, we are not entitled to any Centrelink benefit and miss out on government assistant packages.


To gain employment we left the Bay in 2011 to pursue seasonal work. We cannot afford this tax and I ask that you take steps to prevent its introduction.


I am pleased to say, Madam Speaker, that the removal of the carbon tax in 2014-15 will save households around $550 a year. At the election, the people voted overwhelmingly for change.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (15:24):  I will continue my contribution. Let us consider the cost of the carbon tax on the people of Corangamite. In Geelong, perhaps the most carbon intensive city in the country, the carbon tax is causing damage. We are home to many trade exposed companies—Ford, Boral, Shell and Alcoa—and a region extremely dependent on agriculture and manufacturing. In our region thousands of jobs have been lost or are under threat. The carbon tax is a cost of doing business and it is hampering our region's capacity to thrive and to prosper. Consider what it is doing to our farmers, food processors and timber mills. The carbon tax is costing every dairy farmer on average $7,500 a year.


On 10 September 2013 the member for Corio told Sky News: 'We do need to acknowledge the fact that Tony Abbott won the election and we lost.' Today members opposite must acknowledge that fact. Australian voters elected our government with a mandate to axe the carbon tax, to reduce costs for businesses and households, to boost jobs and to restore Australia's international competitiveness. I am proud to be a member of a government which is committed to abolishing the carbon tax.

Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (15:25):  I believe that the Prime Minister will go down as the Neville Chamberlain of the climate change crisis. You may remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that as World War II was brewing Neville Chamberlain went over and saw the Fuehrer and came back and said, 'I've got all this sorted—no problem.' He told the people to go home and to get a nice, quiet sleep. Well, I believe that is exactly what the Prime Minister is telling us to do, that we have got nothing to worry about, that we do not have to make any changes to the way we do things, we should just go home and have a nice quiet sleep.


We have had many of those on the other side tell us about problems from the financial impost that has occurred to people in their electorates. It is true that any change in the economy does cause some pain, some adjustment. That is the way of the world. But it can be managed, and it has been demonstrated that it can be managed. We have had members opposite saying it does not work. We have seen a 6.1 per cent reduction in our emissions from electricity generation but at the same time our economy continued to grow. We have had this really naive expression that we are running against the tide by putting in place a carbon price. This is the bit that I find really extraordinary. Just as we are seeking to remove any pricing on carbon, what do we see around the world? We see that next week Beijing and Shanghai will both sign up and commence the operation of a carbon emission scheme. They will be joining Shenzheng and Guangzhou, which have already got an emissions trading scheme. That actually encompasses more than 50 million people—more than twice the population of Australia. But we keep saying that no-one else is doing this. It is really interesting to see what has been actually happening in China. They chose seven cities to start off with to have an emissions trading scheme. There was concern among some of those seven cities that by the scheme being confined to them industry in those areas would be tempted to relocate to unaffected provinces. However, the very opposite appears to be occurring. According to reports, some Chinese regions that have not been included in the ETS trial are now putting their hands up and saying that they want to join in too. 


I think there are profoundly strong economic arguments, putting aside all the environmental arguments that we have heard. This is a matter of fitting our economy up. The sorts of adjustments we had to make in the 1980s when we were floating the dollar, when we were removing the tariff barriers, do require adjustment and there is a measure of pain. But ultimately that is what we have to do to get our economy in shape. We see countries now around the world and areas around the world embracing ETSs. Very interestingly, the American states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont talk about introducing their emissions trading scheme early, with the emphasis on learning and moving towards a more mature scheme, just as they did in the EU. They call it the 'learning by doing' phase. All these countries around the world are moving to an ETS—moving slowly, with a modest price on carbon, which is what we want. We want to align ourselves with the EU and the schemes that are coming on in all those Canadian provinces and US states. We need to do that. We need to work out how you do it. We need to be part of this global development that is happening. It is happening. As I say, next week it is Beijing and Shanghai.


What we are seeing here is not only the most appalling act of appeasement, an appalling betrayal of the Australian people which will end in disaster, but also an act of economic vandalism. It is taking us backwards. We need to accept that there is going to be a more carbon-constrained reality and make the adjustments that are necessary to do it now. (Time expired)

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (15:31):  The repeal of Labor's carbon tax demonstrates a new government on the front foot, a government which was elected with a clear and absolute mandate to liquidate the carbon tax. The Australian people have spoken, and this government is determined to give swift or, should the need arise, resolute effect to their voice. For, while the Labor Party seems set on playing some obstructionist political game or is otherwise bizarrely committed to hurting Australian families and businesses through higher electricity and gas prices, the coalition government will see this through. We will not stop until this toxic tax is disposed of. The reasons are simple, painfully simple.


With the carbon tax, the Australian people have been in equal parts mugged and taken for mugs. Julia Gillard declared there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. Later, her predecessor-cum-successor, Kevin Rudd, would proclaim that he had 'terminated' the carbon tax—another false utterance from the former Labor Prime Minister. Now we have the Leader of the Opposition on the one hand saying that he indeed intends to 'terminate' the carbon tax, yet at the same time he proposes to oppose the government's repeal of legislation that would satisfy this very objective. Work that one out.


Australians are tired of trying to work out or work through this unfathomable labyrinth of lies from those opposite. They are weary of the hubris and spin, while the reality of the carbon tax comes home to them every day. These families, pensioners, retirees and small businesses have all seen their electricity and gas bills surge. That the carbon tax has been a chief contributing factor is beyond question. Right from October 2012, with the release of the first quarterly consumer price index figures following its inception, we have felt it. Those numbers revealed an immediate 15.3 per cent rise in electricity prices, while the cost of household gas and miscellaneous fuel jumped by 14.2 per cent. The hike in these quarterly bills was the largest we have ever seen.


My electorate of Longman lies about 45 minutes north of Brisbane, where the big employers are retail, small business, tourism and light industry. In the 12 months prior to this year's federal election, business after business showed me the face of genuine fear, and, in every instance, the carbon tax was central to their anguish. One shop owner in Burpengary told me of surrendering $1,300 a month in higher input costs associated with the carbon tax. Another key local manufacturer forecast a $30,000 rise in electricity charges directly attributable to the carbon tax. And a Caboolture based refrigerated fruit and vegetable carrier had been belted by a substantial increase in refrigerant gas costs due directly to the carbon tax. If the 44th Australian Parliament does not stop Labor's carbon tax from running to schedule and being applied to heavy vehicle diesel fuel from 1 July next year, this great local enterprise will be beaten up once again. 


What ultimately emerges is a flow-on of the costs of the carbon tax for transport and storage to groceries, and every family will be paying more at the check-out. Unsurprisingly, these conditions have fanned a crisis of confidence, which, in turn, has knocked the health of the economy even more. During the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, Longman's unemployment rate more than doubled, from 3.06 per cent to 7.86 per cent. The youth unemployment rate skyrocketed from 4.3 per cent to 11.4 per cent. New taxes and increasing taxes do not create more jobs. This is a tax that hurts jobs and pushes up the cost of living. There is a better way, a smarter way, a more successful way, and the coalition  government is prepared to lead the way.

"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2013-11-21,"



Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (15:36):  We on this side of the House accept the fact that climate change is real and we accept the science on this, which is in stark contrast to those opposite. We accept the scientific facts that are clearly telling us that human activity is causing climate change and will continue to grossly affect our economy and our way of life. We accept that and we accept the need to be taking action. And, because we accepted that and knew that we needed to act, in government we did act. I will remind the previous speaker, the member for Longman, of the comprehensive assistance packages that we had in place. So we made sure that we acted, but we also had an assistance package there for many people. Indeed, many people in my electorate received comprehensive amounts of assistance in relation to the policies that we brought in.


The truth is that a price on carbon pollution can work and has been working. Yet now this government is removing effective action on reducing carbon emissions. That is exactly what they are doing. It is irresponsible and it really is representative of this government's environmental vandalism and lack of understanding of the need to act effectively to combat dangerous climate change.


This bill, the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013, that is being put forward by the Prime Minister and the Liberal-National Party really dismantles our nation's scientific and very rational approach to tackling climate change. We on this side of the House know that it is vitally important to be taking that action for future generations, and not just for our environment but for our economy. The two are linked and indeed they support one another.


This is a view expressed by many people in my electorate of Richmond. I am very fortunate to have many very committed local individuals and groups who, for a long time, have strongly advocated for government to take action on climate change. That is why, when in government, we did act. And those same constituents in my electorate are bitterly disappointed about the actions now of the Abbott government and have expressed that to me on many occasions.


We see, nationwide and internationally, every day, more and more, the impacts of climate change. We see the massively varied weather patterns, oceans rising and increases in natural disasters. In many ways, this bill sums up this new government's attitude to the science of climate change. They are indeed a party of climate change deniers. Even in the face of the overwhelming scientific evidence emerging that mankind is directly contributing to the increasing pace of global warming, what do they do? They just do not believe it; they ignore it and refuse to take effective action. As we know from the Prime Minister's own words, he thinks it is 'absolute crap'. That is his summation of it. So this bill is not just about their actions in trying to stop carbon pricing; it is really representative of their obsession surrounding climate change denial.


What is also really distressing about this bill is that it is not just repealing the pricing of carbon. It is also going to be dismantling the Climate Change Authority, a really important body set up to give independent and scientific advice on renewable energy and on caps and targets on carbon pollution to the government. 


The bill is also abolishing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, a really important body that was set up to help get new commercial renewable projects started, to provide fantastic financing and incentives in all those important areas. Indeed, this bill will severely damage the clean energy industry—an industry that Australia takes great pride in and excels in. But all we hear from those opposite is about their so-called direct action; I think it is more 'direct inaction', with their bizarre policies of magic trees and magic soils which just will not work.


Let us compare ourselves to the rest of the world. Throughout the world we see that many countries are taking action on climate change through emissions trading schemes. More than 30 other countries have carbon pricing schemes. In fact, as we have heard from other speakers today, China has an emissions trading scheme set up in many of its provinces, Germany has an ETS, the United Kingdom has an ETS and France has an ETS. Even many states in the USA are now legislating to introduce an ETS. So many other countries in the world are acting, and it really is quite embarrassing to see Australian now going backwards on what really was effective action to tackle climate change. Now that we are moving backwards it is quite embarrassing for us on the world stage.


On this side of the House, our position is to support the policy we took to the federal election: we wanted to terminate the carbon tax and introduce an emissions trading scheme. Of course, those amendments were refused earlier in the day, but we are absolutely committed to making sure we have an emissions trading scheme. We know that moving towards that and having that market based system is the most effective way to be tackling climate change. That is the action that we should be taking.


In the closing moments, I will talk about some of the long-term economic benefits for places in my area, the North Coast of New South Wales, and for places just above that in South-East Queensland. We will rely in our future on tourism, and we need to take action to make sure we protect the very pristine environment that we have there. So I do find it absolutely remarkable that members of this House are not working with us to make sure we protect the environment for the future.

"Hendy, Peter, MP",LP,2013-11-21,"



Dr HENDY
 (Eden-Monaro) (15:41):  I rise in support of the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013. During the whole of the campaign in the year leading up to the election on 7 September, the abolition of the carbon tax was one of the key campaign issues in Eden-Monaro. I told the electorate that if I were elected the first principal speech I would make after the election, after my maiden speech, would be on the abolition of the carbon tax, and that is why I am rising to speak today. So this was an issue that was central to the policy debate in Eden-Monaro over the last three years but especially in the last five weeks of the election campaign. Everyone on this side who has spoken has informed or re-informed the House that, in the 2010 election—indeed, it was on 16 August 2010, just five days before the election—former Prime Minister Gillard said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' And the member for Lilley, who at that stage was the Treasurer of Australia, said on 15 August: 'No, it is not possible that we are bringing in a carbon tax. That is a hysterically inaccurate claim being made by the coalition.' The fact is that the election was a referendum on the carbon tax. The coalition won with a mandate to abolish it, and that is what we are doing here today and I hope it will pass the Senate once it has passed the House of Representatives.


As you will know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I am an economist by profession. In fact, I am proud to say that I am a Commonwealth Treasury trained economist. I am also a former chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and, as such, I know about economics from a business point of view as well. And I know that the carbon tax does not work as an economic concept. I know that there are a lot of economists around Australia and in other parts of the world who say, 'The carbon tax is the best economic alternative to deal with emissions reduction, to deal with the climate change issue.' But, frankly, they are not right, because they do not take account properly of the international marketplace. And the fact is that a carbon tax, an emissions trading scheme, will not work unless there is a comprehensive treaty arrangement across the world of the major emitters such that they all implement a carbon tax at the same time, basically at the same carbon price. It will not work. And the reason is because the market—the business community across the world—will game the system.


We are basically the only country in the world with a comprehensive carbon tax; we all know that. We know that the scheme in Europe is only a partial emissions trading scheme across the carbon production sectors of the economy of Europe. We know that what is being done in the US is an infinitesimally small part of the emissions-producing part of the sector in the United States. We know that in China—people have been talking about China today—it is only an infinitesimally small part of the Chinese economy that is producing emissions. If you do not have a comprehensive international agreement, a carbon tax in Australia does not work.


That is why we have proposed that it be abolished, that is why we have a direct action plan that will, in a market based system—what we call a 'reverse auction' system—actually fund those programs that will work to reduce emissions. That is why we are setting up an emissions reduction fund. That is the way to go about dealing with the climate change issue, because that will be a system that will work—to fund directly emissions reduction initiatives—as opposed to a carbon tax, which will only damage the Australian economy and not help it. I support the bill.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-11-21,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (15:46):  The previous speaker said that he was an economist. Let me quote from Professor Ross Garnaut, vice-chancellor, fellow and professorial research fellow in economics at the University of Melbourne, and author of Dog Days: Australia after the boom. He says, specifically on this question, in an article in today's paper:


It would lead to larger sacrifices of productivity than would be necessary with broadly based carbon pricing. It would lead either to much higher costs later in the decade or to Australia breaching its commitments to the international community and damaging its own interest in the global mitigation effort.


I think that Professor Garnaut is indeed an authority on this very subject, and he makes the point very well that if we do not proceed with action right now it will cost us much more dearly in the years to come.


This is a matter that is truly a debate about climate change being dressed up as a debate about tax for no other reason than political expediency and for the member for Warringah to become Prime Minister of Australia. By dressing it up as a debate about tax, what we are doing is diminishing the true issue and diminishing the reports of thousands of scientists around the world who have been telling us for decades that climate change is real, that climate change is resulting partially from the emissions of greenhouse gases around the world and that human activity is in fact contributing to those emissions.


The government has had to trivialise that debate in order to get back to turning it into a debate about carbon tax. The problem with that is that what we are doing as a nation is effectively walking away from our responsibility not only to the Australian people but to people right across the world. So much so, that this has been a matter that has been the subject of international discussions and debate for years and years. Right now, there is a conference taking part in Warsaw in Poland, and this government could not even see fit to send a minister of government to those discussions—such is the gravity of this issue.


Mr Deputy Speaker, if you accept the science—and this side of the House does—then this truly is the most serious issue facing Australia and the rest of the world. If you do not accept the science, then clearly it is not. It has been part of the government's strategy to undermine the science by running with many of the commentators who are prepared to diminish the work of scientists who have worked in this field for years. Even the most recent report of the IPCC confirms the findings of previous reports. The work of scientists that has been peer reviewed time and time again is supported every time there is another report.


Labor's position on this is very clear: we said from the outset that we are prepared to abolish the price on carbon that we had set. But we are prepared to do it only if the government is prepared to take appropriate and responsible steps in place of abolishing that, because if you do not, what you are doing is simply offloading the burden onto future generations. I want to talk about that burden just for a moment, because one of the primary arguments of members opposite is to talk about the cost to society as a result of the price on carbon that the former Gillard government put on.


What about the cost to society of doing nothing? The cost to society that arose after the 11 or 12 years of serious drought in the Murray-Darling Basin, that ran into billions of dollars? The cost to society every time there is a cyclone, a flood or a bushfire in this country? What is the cost to society of allowing this issue to go unchecked, when we know full well that it is going to have dramatic and drastic effects on our health costs in this country? What about all of those costs? If you factored those into account, then the reality is that with the cost to society it is much better to tackle the problem than to walk away from it.


We know that the government's response to this now is a policy of direct action—a policy that cannot be measured, a policy that nobody supports, a policy that will not achieve the targets and a policy that in reality comes at a greater cost than the price on carbon placed by the Gillard government was to families around Australia—a cost of $1,200 and more to each and every family in this country.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2013-11-21,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (15:51):  After the hot air that we have heard on this it is time for some clarity, time for some common sense and time for some understanding of exactly what this debate is. There has been a lot of confusion that was born in the creation of the carbon tax, because the Labor Party played the hokey-pokey game on this. Before the 2010 election the carbon tax was out, then after the 2010 election the carbon tax was in, and then before the 7 September election the carbon tax was out again, but now they are here telling us it is in. So you can understand why there has been a lot of confusion about this debate.


In essence, what we are debating is a very simple premise, and that is that this carbon tax is going to help save the planet by raising costs. It will not surprise you to know that I dispute that premise on many levels, but I think it is vitally important that we realise from the start that it is confusing two very different debates. The first involves science and the second involves economics. First, there is the debate on science, which I believe has created an extraordinarily unscientific reaction around the globe. Science is always about ongoing inquiry and understanding, whereas the global warming debate has been characterised as one between good and evil—and we have heard that here today from the members opposite. That fits in perfectly with their hokey-pokey, kindergarten approach to politics, but for the grown-ups in the room it is certainly not objective. And from where I stand the greatest  crime in this debate has been the demonisation of anyone who has the temerity to question any aspect of the theory of man-made climate change.


Just as those who subscribe to the anthropogenic climate change theories cannot be 100 per cent sure of their belief, I also cannot state categorically that I know there is no link between emissions and the climate. I do have doubts, and those doubts stem from the well-publicised antics of some of the climate scientists out there that were exposed in 'climategate', where they expressed private concerns over the negligible increase in global temperatures—in fact, there has been no increase statistically in global temperatures over the last 15 or 16 years—but then set about altering their statistics to try and prove the opposite.


The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, which is not influenced by the need to secure government funds, has published a report called Climate change reconsidered. That report showed that the science is nowhere near to being settled. They were reputable scientists—




Mr Zappia:
  It wasn't peer reviewed.




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  Just like the IPCC report is not peer reviewed—it is not, mate. The reports that come out are not peer reviewed. This is a document by real climate scientists who say that there is doubt about the science and the so-called science that we hear that is out there. But I want to get onto the economics because this is an area where the facts really are indisputable, and we do not need peer reviews to know that. The member who spoke before mentioned Professor Garnaut. Well, Professor Garnaut had an interesting quote from his report when he dreamed this whole mess up for the Labor Party. What he said was:


Regional communities and industries are likely to be more vulnerable to these impacts than urban centres, due to their reliance on agriculture and other natural resource-based industries.


He is right because in my electorate there is mining, agriculture and tourism, and this tax is suffocating all three industries. In mining the picture is very bleak. We have had 9,000 jobs cut across Queensland and New South Wales, many of them in the Bowen Basin, over the last 18 months. There is an undeniable link between the carbon tax and those job losses. Rio Tinto called it an unfair tax on Australian exporters. It is equally devastating for farmers in my electorate. Cane growers have come out against it, saying it adds significantly to the bottom line costs of cane farming businesses. The Queensland horticulture based body Grocom also predicted that a carbon emissions trading scheme—which these guys want this carbon tax to evolve into—could raise farm costs by about 1.15 per cent by 2020. Any addition to the bottom line of farms is not a good thing and it risks farmers going to the wall. Tourism is equally at risk. A new study by AEC Group research, commissioned by Tourism Accommodation Australia, estimates that the carbon tax will add $115 million in costs to hotels and motels. So three industries in my electorate are going to be hit, and hit hard.


Labor's carbon tax is just wrong. It is probably wrong on the science. It is definitely wrong on the economics. I urge every member of the House to distinguish between the two. Enough of the hot air. Let's get rid of this dreadful carbon tax.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (15:56):  It is my pleasure to follow the member for Dawson in this debate—somebody who I think exposes the real truth at the heart of the coalition's opposition to an emissions trading scheme. That opposition is not because they accept the science and dispute the economics. It is fundamentally because those opposite do not accept the science of climate change. The member for Dawson has been very clear about that. He thinks that 97 per cent of the world's scientists are wrong and he, instead, has the truth. I argued with the member for Canning on Twitter but eventually, about 20 tweets in, I just had to let him go because—




Mr Christensen:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Is the member for Fraser willing to give way?




Dr LEIGH:
  No. I stopped the Twitter battle with the member for Canning at a certain point when I finally got bored, but he was taking on the Bureau of Meteorology. They are now, of course, responsible for the Bureau of Meteorology, but the member for Canning disputes the bureau's finding that Australia has just experienced the hottest summer on record, the hottest winter on record and is on track to experience the hottest year on record.


The time for political games is gone. If this House does not take serious action on climate change we are kicking it off to future generations, and those generations will pay a higher cost than we will today. Future generations will look very dimly upon this government that took away an effective, efficient way of reducing Australia's emissions and replaced it with an expensive, ineffective hodgepodge of measures. Ross Garnaut was asked about this on Lateline the other night. He said of direct action that it would be considerably more expensive and that getting rid of the carbon price has a significant negative impact on the budget. The impact on the budget of getting rid of the mining tax and the carbon price is, between them, $17 billion, which must be paid by higher taxes on workers. That is what those opposite believe. They believe the tax burden on polluters and mining billionaires should be lower and the tax burden on workers should be higher.


I was listening before to the member for Eden-Monaro with his economic views and I have to say I was thinking at the time of that great Chris Caton quote when a range of eminent Australian economists were asked their view on carbon pricing and 86 per cent strongly supported carbon pricing over direct action. As Chris Caton said, anyone who believes direct action is economically more sensible 'should hand his degree back'.


When the Leader of the Opposition was confronted with similar evidence—a survey of the Australian Conference of Economists showing a vast majority of economists in favour of carbon pricing—he said that maybe that was a comment on the 'quality of our economists' rather than on the quality of our policy, to which Joshua Gans responded that maybe it just said something about the quality of the Leader of the Opposition.



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Dr LEIGH:
  We have the honourable member interjecting here, who wrote his very thesis on 'A tax to make the polluter pay' but has been willing to throw good economics out the window to score a political point! This is no small issue for this parliament. The cost of dealing with climate change will only rise. As the developed country with the highest level of per capita emissions, that cost will fall on future generations. This government is doing deep, deep damage to the country by getting rid of an emissions trading scheme and replacing it with a scheme which we know to be far more expensive.


We have had those opposite making claims that they have Nobel laureates supporting them. The member for Flinders named a series of Nobel laureates who supported Direct Action, but of course when contacted, those Nobel laureates had no support for the member for Flinders. Why? Because Nobel laureates like other economists recognise that a pricing system is the best way of dealing with climate change. There are plenty of economists who support climate change, but no credible economists that support Direct Action. It is more expensive, less effective and a punishment to future generations who will pay the price of this government's short-sighted decisions.

Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (16:01):  As a former farmer and small business owner I understand the many difficulties facing the sugar industry and the Hinkler business community more broadly. In a recent submission to government on the repeal of the carbon tax, Queensland cane growers advised that Labor's tax had increased the cost of production by $20 million since it was introduced, hurting the industry's international competitiveness.


Sugar cane is Queensland's largest agricultural crop by volume and value. With 80 per cent of Australia's sugar exported overseas, it is also Australia's seventh largest agricultural export. Australia's sugar exports were worth $1.4 billion last financial year, making us the third largest supplier in the world. The industry also employs 50,000 people, directly and indirectly.


Irrigators have been hardest hit by the carbon tax. Cane growers indicate that repealing the carbon tax will save them up to 10 per cent on their energy bills and save thousands of jobs. It will also bring significant supply chain benefits. The tax inflated the price of goods like fertiliser and chemicals. Industry research shows growers are paying up to 33 cents extra per tonne this financial year to produce the same crop they did in 2010-11, before the introduction of the tax. As cane growers are not able to pass the cost on to their international consumers, the increased cost of production is being paid for directly from the bottom line, in some cases leading to a reduction of wages and the loss of jobs. Cane growers have always opposed the carbon tax, and for good reason. Repealing Labor's carbon tax will go some way to helping restore profitability to the industry and provide workers with greater job security.


Despite the significant impact of the carbon tax and the relatively high trade exposure of the industry, sugar cane growers did not receive any assistance under the Clean Energy Futures package. The Queensland Cane Growers Organisation argues that they are the only sugar cane growers in the world to operate without some form of subsidy, trade barrier or market control. The only way Australia's cane farmers remain competitive by global standards is through constantly improving productivity and by containing the cost of production relative to cane producers in Thailand, Brazil and India. 


Agribusiness contributes greatly to the economic viability of regional communities like Hinkler and that is why this government is committed to repealing the carbon tax. Like cane growers, Hinkler's horticulturalists are price-takers and not price-setters, which means they are unable to pass the cost of the carbon tax on to their markets. Peter Hockings, Executive Officer at BFVG, recently told me his members were deeply concerned about their future under Labor's carbon tax. The tax has been the final nail in the coffin for many.


Many growers are eager to find ways to reduce their carbon footprint, but argue a tax is not the way to go about it. They, like this government, favour direct action, improving productivity and finding efficiencies. They are paying more for fertiliser, more to transport their products to market, and more to dispose of their organic waste material. As well as the increased cost of electricity for irrigators, our growers are paying more for their cold storage. 


Our farmers are not the only ones paying more for refrigerant gases. Businesses like the Woodgate Beach General Store, which services a small community, have taken a big hit. Owners, Barry and Rose, are looking to retire and know their prospects for selling the business will be better without a carbon tax. Businesses and community groups already running on tight budgets are feeling the pinch. The carbon tax has impacted on the cost of gas in the bowls club. It affects the electricity costs for the ice-makers who supply our commercial and recreational fishermen. It has increased costs for the local library and community hall.


But the strong opposition to Labor's tax does not stop there. Allow me to read just one of the many letters my office received in relation to the carbon tax, which said:


l am contacting you to express my concern of the impending rise in the cost of living and loss of industry when the carbon tax is introduced.


As a senior Australian I am finding that my dollar does not perform in the supermarket, petrol bowser or when paying rates.


I am fearful that the increased costs levelled at councils, through the introduction of the carbon tax, will mean I will have trouble finding the funds to meet the financial demands of life.


Being a baby boomer, I bought an investment property in Maryborough, as our superannuation would only support us for about six months in retirement.


There is no work for people my age in Hervey Bay and unfortunately, because we now have an investment property asset, we are not entitled to any Centrelink benefit and miss out on government assistant packages.


To gain employment we left the Bay in 2011 to pursue seasonal work. We cannot afford this tax and I ask that you take steps to prevent its introduction.


I am pleased to say, Madam Speaker, that the removal of the carbon tax in 2014-15 will save households around $550 a year. At the election, the people voted overwhelmingly for change. It was a referendum on the carbon tax and a referendum on Labor's $9 billion a year hit to the Australian economy.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (16:11):  Three years ago I delivered my maiden speech in this place. Since that time I have spoken on many occasions because of my very firm view that this chamber is the very heart of representative politics. During the last term of parliament we heard constantly of the so-called 24-hour news cycle, but can I say that, as important as a free and vibrant media is to our democracy, it is this parliament that is and must be the real bastion of debate. Madam Speaker, I was pleased with your comments last week that this chamber is a place for robust and spirited debate where that debate is not hindered and blinkered by those who would hide behind standing orders rather than come to this place ready to openly debate the issues of the day.


What issue could be more important today in this first session of a new parliament than the central issue of the election campaign in which the Labor-Greens alliance was comprehensively defeated—the central issue of the carbon tax and its repeal? Australians understand the concept of a fair go. They also understand that when they have voted to reject a government as clearly as they did some weeks ago that the incoming government will implement its policies. It is as simple as that. How tawdry is this opposition in denial, refusing to accept that the people of Australia have spoken and contemptuous of the public will? This opposition needs to be reminded that on 7 September we had an election, the people spoke, the Labor government lost and their policies were rejected. My advice to the opposition is: if you do not want to be part of the debate on our nation's future, if all you want to do is prevent debate in this House, then get out of the way because this is a government with work to do, promises to keep and an economy to rebuild.


Three years ago I was humbled to receive the trust of almost 100,000 Ryan electors to be their representative in parliament. I am honoured to be here today, re-elected by the men and women of Ryan. The last three years have been both a great privilege and a challenge. From the outset my first term was met with Queensland's worst flooding in over 35 years. The January 2011 floods swept away many homes and lives. It was to the credit of the Ryan community, including the Defence Force, that residents achieved in just three days of clean-up what had taken three months after the 1974 floods.


The value of volunteers was truly displayed during the 2011 and 2013 summers of natural disasters. I have had the honour of acknowledging the work of many of the dedicated volunteers in my electorate through the Ryan Community Service Awards, which recognise the remarkable people in my electorate who devote their lives to their community across the full range of community needs, from mental health support for teenagers to teaching literacy skills to refugee families, local environment groups, and school and supporting organisations. Volunteers are the heart and soul of Australian communities. They are so often the difference between hope and despair. My years of involvement in my community in Red Cross, Zonta and so many other wonderful organisations, such as the Multicultural Development Association, prove this to me time and time again. I salute you all.


Within my electorate I support many hundreds of community organisations, and I want to take a moment to highlight three of them. These are the Glenleighden School, the McIntyre Centre, and the Hear and Say Centre. The Glenleighden School at Fig Tree Pocket encourages achievement over adversity, helping children overcome their impairments at a young age with the integration of multidisciplinary perspectives on intervention, including specialist teaching, speech language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, music therapy and psychology.


One mother who wrote to me described the Glenleighden School as a godsend. Without the school, its therapists and its supporting community she felt her son would have had no career, no future and no friends. Since sending her son to the Glenleighden School she has become a more positive mother, knowing that her son will one day thrive despite his disabilities. These sentiments are shared by many of the parents who have moved closer to and/or taken second jobs to put their children through Glenleighden, to ensure that their children receive the support and early intervention that they need.


The McIntyre Centre at Pinjarra Hills provide quality horse riding programs in a caring environment for young people and children with a disability for the purpose of enjoyment, recreation, sport, education and therapy. Each week 30 horses are provided for riding lessons for more than 170 people with varying disabilities. Operating six days a week, the McIntyre Centre have a dedicated team, including more than 100 hard-working volunteers, and with strong local business support they have had a real impact on helping young people with a disability develop an independent life and social skills.


The Hear and Say Centre is recognised as a global leader in teaching children who are deaf to listen and speak. It has one of the most prominent specialist paediatric hearing and implantable technology programs in the world. Hear and Say's goals are aligned with the coalition's national health goals—they deliver frontline early intervention and hearing services for more than 600 children and families. It is committed to quality health services for all Australians, irrespective of where they live. Indeed, almost 70 per cent of families now access Hear and Say services from outside Brisbane. I have been happy to provide my support to these and many other groups within Ryan, groups that really make a difference to those in need.


Let me talk about defence. I am an Australian who is proud of our defence forces. They stand ready to go to war as and when their nation directs. These young Australians put their lives on the line day after day for us, the people of Australia. During the previous term, I attempted to gain a better understanding of the challenges they face and the opportunities to improve their lot. Madam Speaker, as you and many of our colleagues on both sides of this chamber have done, I participated in exercises—in my case with our troops in Exercise Talisman Sabre off the Queensland coast, with the Black Hawk high altitude training in the north of Papua New Guinea, and in 2012 with our troops in Afghanistan. My respect for these great Australians grows with my every involvement. My father knows the challenges of war and of prisoner of war camps; my son is a serving officer. But it is these interactions and my involvement with Gallipoli Barracks in Ryan and my local RSLs that serve as constant reminders of the contribution our service men and women have made and continue to make on our behalf, of the sacrifices of their families and the never-ending obligation that we all have to be steadfast in our support.


In Ryan, I particularly note the remarkable service of the men and women based at Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera. They are part of our Ryan community and we are proud to have them, just as I am proud to be part of a government that has such a strong commitment to protecting our national interests and supporting our servicemen and women and, significantly, supporting our veterans. And, as we talk about our veterans, I am reminded that in my maiden speech I spoke of the importance of indexing the DFRDB and DFRB so that Australia's defence personnel entitlements better reflect the contributions and sacrifices they have made. I was disappointed to see that the Labor-Greens coalition, when in government, refused the opportunity to adopt a bipartisan policy of fair indexation of DFRDB and DFRB in a similar manner to the age and service pension models. By 2010 there had already been six parliamentary inquiries, all finding in favour of fair indexation. Instead, Labor imposed a carbon tax, driving up the cost of living with no compensation for our veterans. Shamefully, in June 2013 veterans received an increase of a mere 0.1 per cent.


I have had countless conversations, emails and letters from my constituents about fixing the deeply flawed and unfair Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme. Labor's plan created two classes of disabled veterans: those with qualifying service and those without. I have spoken to some of the most disabled veterans in my electorate who do not receive any assistance under this scheme and, as you could imagine, they are frustrated and angry. Nationally as many as 1,500 of our most disabled veterans are ignored under Labor's scheme. This is because they receive the special rate of TPI but do not have appropriate qualifying service as defined by the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. I am proud to be part of a coalition team with a real plan to fix this situation. Under our plan more than 80,000 disabled veterans would be provided with financial relief under a comprehensive Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme, where there will no longer be two classes of veterans and all veterans with a disability will have no out-of-pocket pharmaceutical expenses. Our plan reduces the unnecessary red tape surrounding veterans' reimbursements.


Politics has to move on from the focus-group and opinion-poll led decision making that characterised the last government. Some issues cry out for action. One of those is aged-care reform. Aged-care providers in my electorate tell me of their disappointment at the last government's neglect of their sector. After five years of that neglect, our aged-care system needs urgent change to meet the needs and financial circumstances of older Australians. Simply put, we owe those who have gone before us. Their contributions have been immense. They have built today's Australia. It is our duty to give yesterday's heroes—today's pensioners and self-funded retirees—a safe and secure retirement.


The increase in the cost of private health insurance, tax on superannuation, and the increased cost of living under the Labor government just made life more difficult for older Australians. Labor ignored many of the recommendations from the Productivity Commission's Caring for older Australians report of 2011. Aged-care sector workers have conveyed to me that they were fed up with resources continuing to be wasted and taxpayers' funds not being efficiently allocated due to clients having no or very limited input into choosing a provider. The coalition is committed to the most efficient, transparent and competitive superannuation system, and has pledged to the Australian people that there will be no surprise detrimental changes to superannuation under this coalition government.


While frontline service for aged care is important, so is research into the treatment of diseases facing our older population. The University of Queensland in my electorate is home to many world-class research institutes. Most recently I visited the Queensland Brain Institute, the leading neuroscience institute in the southern hemisphere, and their state-of-the-art centre for ageing and dementia research. Dementia, the greatest cause of disability in Australians aged 65 and over, is a broad term used to describe various medical conditions which damage brain cells and lead to a gradual loss of brain function. The Queensland Brain Institute's Clem Jones Centre for Ageing and Dementia Research aims to develop strategies to prevent or delay the onset of ageing dementia, as well as working to develop more sensitive and accurate diagnostic tools.


The previous Labor government failed to provide any further funding for the centre, Australia's only dedicated age and dementia research institute, at a time when, according to Access Economics, increasing funding from $23 million to $49 million per year could save Australia more than $4 trillion in the long term. I am delighted that the coalition has pledged $200 million over five years to dementia research, including $9 million to the CJCADR, demonstrating our commitment to this important work. I thank the Minister for Health, who is in the chamber now, for coming to the University of Queensland and recommitting that pledge for funding.


Papua New Guinea is one of our closest neighbours and I have strongly supported steps to improve maternal health there. Within my own electorate of Ryan local groups like the Moggill QCWA and Zonta prepare the much needed birthing kits for mothers in PNG and East Timor. During the April 2013 parliamentary delegation I met with AusAID and Sir Theophilus Constantinou, founder of the Theophilus Foundation, who is working in partnership with AusAID to improve maternal health at the Port Moresby General Hospital. The mothers in the new hospital wing spoke of the improved conditions for giving birth and the higher level of patient care they had received for both themselves and their new-born children. I am pleased to see that the Queensland government is also committed to supporting health care in PNG and will help in its fight to combat tuberculosis and other diseases by contributing support to the new hospital at Daru in the Western Province of the country.


Our region is where we live, it is where we have the most influence, it is where we can be a positive force for good. I have many good friends in Papua New Guinea, as I know you, Madam Speaker, do as well, and I have visited on many occasions over the last three years. On my visits I find a proud developing nation with one of the highest rates of growth in the world. PNG is a young nation sensitive to its place in the world, strongly committed to the nation state that is Papua New Guinea and to the building of its capacity in education and health, and to the growth of its physical infrastructure. 


The new government in PNG is focused on that infrastructure renewal and financial transparency to deliver better economic outcomes for their people. The challenge facing PNG is to translate its notable economic growth into real development. The challenge for Australia is to understand that it is only the Papua New Guineans themselves who can bring about lasting change and we must constantly re-evaluate our aid program to ensure that we are enabling that change and helping to build the institutional capacity needed to build this remarkable nation. PNG is a good friend to Australia. As good friends to Papua New Guinea we must open our ears to local input about their future directions. I know, from my many discussions with Prime Minister Peter O'Neill; Foreign Minister Rimbink Pato; Treasurer Don Polye, the current chairman of the World Bank; and many others in government and elsewhere, that together we have a window of opportunity to generate real and beneficial change. But we must actively encourage local input into our aid priorities. I particularly acknowledge the work of Foreign Minister Pato as he works assiduously to build broader multilateral engagement in our region. Importantly, I want to place on record my appreciation of the work of High Commissioner Charles Lepani as he strongly represents his country here in Canberra.


Our regional relationships are important because we are in many ways defined not only by our own character but also by our community. Australia's community—our neighbourhood—brings together a remarkable mixture of cultures, traditions and friendships. This mix brings challenges, but it also brings an environment that enriches all of our cultures. However, we must always remember that we can only benefit from that environment if we open our hearts and our ears to the sensitivities and aspirations of our neighbours.


I look forward to another three years serving the people of Ryan in government. I am absolutely committed to being their voice in this place. I am honoured to represent them.

Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide) (16:30):  I rise this afternoon to talk about the importance of education reform and to speak about how a stable needs based funding system is absolutely central to improving student outcomes.


The education reforms that Labor put in place were founded on evidence. They were founded not only on the evidence of why reform was needed but also on the evidence of why reform is so important to Australia's future. We know that students from disadvantaged backgrounds are up to three years behind their classmates. We know that one in 12 of them is not meeting minimum standards for reading, writing and maths. And we know that the impacts of educational disadvantage can be life-long, with the OECD finding that 60 per cent of all unemployed Australians are not literate enough to operate effectively in the modern global economy.


I am incredibly proud that our government acted and introduced important school reforms such as putting in place a system to deliver $14.65 billion of increased funding over the next six years, stopping state education cuts, of which we have all seen far too many, and making sure that needs based funding distribution provides the greatest assistance to those students who need it the very most.


The current Minister for Education spent the best part of three years railing against the extensive process that Labor undertook in government to reform our school system. Rather than confronting our declining educational attainment, the minister discredited the views of the experts who contributed to all of this hard work. And rather than backing reform to secure the high skill, high paying jobs of the future, he resisted improvement at every opportunity. He described the Gonski review as a con—as 'conski', which he no doubt thought was very clever. He stood by our broken school funding system on countless occasions.


Just this year the now education minister declared: 'The current funding model does work. It's not a broken model.' And as late as July, he said: 


The coalition does not believe the current funding model is broken. I'm not prepared to simply accept that it is broken because it isn't.'


But, luckily for all of us and lucky for the children and students of Australia, on 29 August, just nine days before the election, the now education minister stood beside the now Prime Minister and said:


You can vote Liberal or you can vote Labor and you'll get exactly the same amount of funding for your school.


The Prime Minister also stated that he would work to 'honour the agreements that Labor has made'. In that moment, the coalition admitted that the system they had defended for so long was indeed broken. They admitted that we must have a needs based funding system if we are to improve student outcomes. The coalition wanted their policy conversion to appear complete and unrestrained so the now Prime Minister assured the Australian public that he was 'on a unity ticket' with Labor when it came to school funding. I absolutely intend to hold the government to this commitment that was made by the Prime Minister.


I agree with the Minister for Education that reform is not just about money, although all the effort and good will in the world will not improve outcomes unless adequate resources are attached and reaching the students who need them. But it is all about how that money is used and ensuring that the agreement that the now government assured us that they would hold people to, and all of the requirements in those agreements, are enforced—that is, that this extra funding is needs based, and that we have reformed the funding system and the education model.


Our education reforms are about stopping further state cuts to the budget. There is no point in putting money in the front door just to have it disappear out the back door. There is no point in the Commonwealth government putting in extra dollars if state governments are allowed to continue to cut education funding. It is also about five key areas where we must achieve higher. They are: quality teaching, quality learning, empowered school leadership, transparency and accountability, and meeting student needs.


With less than a dozen weeks to go before the start of the 2014 school year, students in every school around the country are expecting to start seeing increased funding and needs based funding. Much of that extra investment must be targeted to students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, to Indigenous students, to small and remote schools, and to students with limited English skills. For the government to honour their commitment, this funding must reach schools in 2014 but it must reach schools in the manner in which it was structured in the agreement. This government must enforce that this is needs based real education reform.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs) (09:31):  Thousands of Country Fire Authority and State Emergency Service volunteers provide tremendous and selfless service to communities across Victoria. On 9 November I attended the Diamond Jubilee of the Chelsea Unit of the Victorian State Emergency Service. Joining with Phil Wall, from the SES, Ron Fitch, the unit controller, and the many volunteers and their family members, we celebrated the success of the unit and the great work that they have been doing in our community for 60 years. As well as responding to local emergencies, our volunteers give their time to assist with emergencies in other locations around Victoria, including at the Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday bushfires, and sometimes interstate.


The evening also provided an occasion to present long-service awards to members with five, 10 and 20 years of service. No matter how long our volunteers have served, each and every one of them deserves our thanks for their hard work and dedication. The unit's commemorative booklet Storms, Floods, Chainsaws and Sandbags was launched at the diamond jubilee and records 60 years of community service. The SES units around Victoria provide an invaluable service to our community as first responders during floods, bushfires and storms. They also assist police at traffic accidents, with their expertise and specialised hydraulic gear such as the jaws of life.


On the same weekend, I attended the emergency medical response vehicle commissioning and recruit graduation at the CFA's Edithvale Fire Brigade. Joining with Graham Fountain, the brigade's captain, and Craig Lapsley, the Victorian Fire Services Commissioner, I congratulated the new round of graduates. They recently completed their basic training and are now ready to protect and serve our community. The new emergency response vehicle gives the CFA the ability to respond to medical emergencies during fires and to assist with other incidents that are medical emergencies at other times.


There is a piece of folk wisdom on the website of the Chelsea SES which speaks of the value of our volunteers. It is relevant to the brave Australians who risk their lives assisting others in emergencies as well as all the volunteers who support our community in so many ways—in health, sport, schools, community care and too many others to list. The statement reads:


As a wiser person than me once said regarding volunteers, It's not that we don't pay them because they're worthless; we don't pay them because they're priceless, and why do we do what we do, I guess the simple answer is—someone has to!


I acknowledge and thank all of Australia's emergency service volunteers for their dedication to supporting the Australian community in times of need.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (10:01):  I rise today to speak about the schools that came to visit us yesterday here in Parliament House. I had the great privilege to welcome and speak with students of the following primary schools: Elmore Primary School; Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Elmore; Goornong Primary School; Drummartin Primary School; and Raywood Primary School. These were the first schools for me to receive here in Parliament House. Whilst they are small schools in the electorate of Bendigo and are at the very north of the electorate they are not small schools when it comes to school spirit.


The visit by these schools and by their community really embody regional Australia. I had the opportunity before they came to Parliament House to visit these schools during my campaign, particularly Our Lady of the Sacred Heart and Drummartin Primary School.


These schools try to do everything. They are a family and a community. Their community rallies around these small primary schools. They are meeting all of the challenges that all of our primary schools have. They have their fair share of students with special needs and their fair share of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. They have a larger than usual share in the electorate of families from farming communities. They also have long family connections to many of their primary schools. Their constant worry is: will their school be shut down? 


When I meet with these schools they talk about funding. They raise the issue of ensuring that they get their fair share of resources, which is why Labor's Better Schools Plan was very much a key topic of discussion when I met with these schools in my electorate. 


I would like to just highlight some of the questions that I asked of the students and their responses. When asked what they enjoyed about their visit to Parliament House, they said they enjoyed the role plays, and 'I got to meet our future Prime Minister and opposition leader.' Some also liked question time. However, some thought that the behaviour during question time was something to be questioned. When asked what message they would like me to pass on to the Prime Minister and other members of parliament, they very loudly and clearly said: 'Stop the bullying and be nice to each other.'


I spoke to the primary school students upstairs here in Parliament House. When I asked what message they would like to pass on to the government about schools and what they would like to see their representatives do, they said they would like better IT. For many of these smaller schools they have online virtual learning. In particular, they share the resources of a language teacher—Indonesian. Quite topical! Their access to broadband is continuing to be a challenge, so something like the National Broadband Network would help these schools.


They also said that they would like a vegie garden and the continuation of the Stephanie Alexander program. They wanted all schools to have access to that program—a successful program that teaches children from garden to kitchen. They said—and this did not come just from the teachers but also from the students—that they wanted increased funding so that they can have more books and more teachers. They—the primary school students—also said quite loudly and clearly that they support 'I give a Gonski'.


These children are right. Elmore was listed on the NBN rollout map earlier this year. The status is now unknown. For the vegie garden program and the Stephanie Alexander program, again the status is unknown. The status of the funding for Labor's Better Schools plan—where every child irrespective of where they live, which school they attend and their background would get the best possible education—is unknown.


The final question I asked the students was: who amongst them wanted to be the next member for Bendigo? Almost every hand went up. So, Deputy Speaker, I had better watch my back!
