"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,2001-06-28,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
The Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001 implements the government's commitment to make the legislative changes necessary to commence the food regulatory reforms agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments— COAG—on 3 November 2000. The bill will establish a new statutory authority, Food Standards Australia New Zealand—I will refer to it as `the authority'—to be based upon the existing Australia New Zealand Food Authority—ANZFA. The prime function of the authority will be to develop domestic food standards that will be adopted nationally. These standards will be developed based on scientific and technical criteria and in accordance with the objectives set out in section 10 of the Australia New Zealand National Food Authority Act 1991 dealing with protection of public health and safety and the provision of information to consumers.
The Senate made a number of amendments to the bill, some of which the government accepts and others we cannot agree to, particularly where they interfere with the rights of New Zealand and the states and territories, and consequently the government will be moving amendments to them. I understand that the opposition is concerned that the intergovernmental agreement on food regulation does not specify, except at the Commonwealth level, health ministers as the lead ministers. Consequently, the government will write to the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, asking them to consider the federal opposition's view that only health ministers should be lead ministers on the council. We believe that, once this bill is amended, all parties should be satisfied that the legislation will guarantee that public health and safety is the number one objective and that the new system will provide for national consistency in the interpretation, administration and enforcement of food regulation and ensure consumers have sufficient information to make informed choices. 
This is very significant reforming legislation. I wish to congratulate all those who, over a very long period of time, have had a role to play in bringing us to this point—everybody united in the objective of better serving the interests and, indeed, the demands of consumers in a very changing consumer environment. I particularly single out the Minister for Health and Aged Care, who not only has provided the leadership necessary to bring together officials from his department who have worked very hard and dutifully on this, at times, complex issue leading to necessarily complicated legislation reduced to its simplest form possible but also has been able to work cooperatively with the various state ministers across the political divide and to enlist the expertise that resides within their own health departments. Congratulations to all involved. It is legislation that the government is very proud of. It will have lasting benefits for consumers and for the community as a whole. We seek to enlist the support of the House for the bill, and I present the explanatory memorandum to this groundbreaking legislation.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—The Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001 started its journey through this parliament as yet another example of this government's disregard for the views and the interests of the Australian public. Today I am happy to support a bill that, as a result of Labor and Democrat amendments, while not perfect, more closely reflects the Australian community's requirement for a food regulator that is independent of political and industry agendas and firmly places the protection of public health and safety at the centre of its objectives.
The purpose of this bill is to implement changes to the way food regulation is dealt with in Australia following a review of food regulation and the signing of a food regulation agreement between the states, territories and the Commonwealth. The genesis of this change was a review of food regulation, known as the Blair review, that was conducted way back in 1998. The final recommendations of the Blair review were only seen by the public then in draft form before disappearing into a bureaucratic black hole for more than two years and reappearing as a piece of flawed legislation in February this year.
By its own admission, during the `black hole' years the department of health did not bother consulting in any serious fashion with stakeholders, and over the last five months there have been attempts by this government and the department to justify this lack of consultation by referring to what happened during the Blair process. Labor does not accept this excuse and nor do the stakeholders. What was recommended in Blair in 1998 and what was spat out of the bureaucratic process in 2001 were two entirely different proposals and, as we have seen as a result of the Senate inquiry instigated by Labor, the 2001 proposal was completely unacceptable to major consumer and public health organisations.
Briefly, the major issues and concerns were: the potential to have the board of what is supposed to be an independent scientifically based food safety regulator potentially stacked by food industry representatives; a proposal for the ministerial council to lose its power to amend proposals and applications put before it by the FSANZ board; a proposal to allow food standard applications to become law by default if the ministerial council did not respond in 60 days; a ministerial council that may end up being controlled by lead ministers from portfolios other than the health portfolio, which could result in real and perceived conflicts of interest with the regulator's objective of protecting public health and safety; restrictions on where public information would be made available; and lack of a precautionary approach to assessing food standards.
Further to the Labor instigated Senate inquiry and following additional stakeholder consultation conducted by Labor, a number of amendments were moved in the Senate, and I am pleased that the government has decided to accept most of them. The Labor amendments that strengthen the transparency, independence and science and public health focus of Australia's prime food safety regulator result in the following: the ministerial council will maintain its power to amend as well as accept or reject applications and proposals put to it by the FSANZ board; proposals and applications put forward by the FSANZ board will not become law unless a majority of jurisdictions indicate support in writing to the board; the precautionary approach to assessment of food standards as outlined in the WTO's sanitary and phytosanitary agreement has been added to the objectives of the act; members of the FSANZ board will now serve for a fixed term to provide certainty and to prevent any politically motivated attempts to interfere with board membership; strong conflict of interest provisions have been added which prevent either the chairperson of the board or the CEO from having worked for or having had pecuniary interests in a body corporate involved in food production or manufacture for the two years prior to the appointment; all board members must now agree to post any personal material interests they may have on the FSANZ web site; and public information must now be made available in major national newspapers as well as on the Internet. 
In addition, Labor and Democrat amendments have significantly improved the science and public health base of the board and have ensured that it cannot be captured by industry interests or its membership influenced by political preference. As a result, the new board comprises 12 members of which there are seven mandatory positions, including one from the National Health and Medical Research Council and a third New Zealand member representing an area of public health or science, five general positions of which three must come from public health, consumer and science areas and two from industry, government and regulation. The minister can appoint board members only from a pool of nominations put forward by relevant public and professional organisations.
Finally, I understand that the government will be making a commitment today and that, as I heard from the minister earlier, the Prime Minister will write to all state and territory heads of government proposing that the intergovernmental Food Regulation Agreement be amended to specify that the lead minister on the ministerial council will be the health minister for all jurisdictions. On that basis, Labor has agreed to drop its amendments in relation to disallowable instruments. It is Labor's belief that states will embrace this change—that has been the indication so far—and we would urge them to deal with the issue as soon as possible.
This is a major victory for all Australians, who can now be confident that our food safety regulator will continue to be guided at the highest level by health rather than industry, trade or agriculture interests. As Labor has said throughout this debate, at a time when Europe is in crisis over issues relating to food safety as a result of regulation that has been driven by agricultural and trade rather than health imperatives, we should be moving to strengthen rather than water down the health focus of our regulation. I think the legislation in its amended form does just that and will give the Australian public greater confidence in the food that they and their families eat. This in itself will have very positive flow-on effects to the food industry in this country.
In conclusion, while this amended bill is worthy of support, it is a sad indictment of this government that such substantive changes have had to be forced through. Had there been sufficient open consultation with stakeholders throughout the entire development process, we might have started out where we have now ended up, and saved a lot of time and energy in the interim. On the basis of the government's acceptance of the amendments put forward by Labor and the Democrats, and the agreement reached to support the amendments proposed by the government today, I am now happy to commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—I am pleased to speak to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001 even though to many people it might sound like a dry argument that is not going to excite the hearts and minds of all Australians. But this is a very important bill because it affects every person's life every day, so I am very pleased to be able to speak in support of it. The bill amends the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Act 1991. Of course, since 1991 lots of things have changed and we have new conditions to proceed under. 
The bill will change the process for the development of food standards in this country. It replaces the Australia New Zealand Food Authority with a new statutory authority and implements elements of the Food Regulation Agreement signed by members of the Council of Australian Governments, or COAG, in November 2000. The bill is the implementation of the government's commitment to make the legislative changes necessary to commence the food regulatory reforms that were agreed to by the members of COAG. It is a bill that recognises the need for public confidence in the health and safety of our food and the need for Australia to maintain its reputation for the highest quality of clean, green food products, for which we are known internationally. Because of this, it is a bill of vital importance to my electorate of Barker.
Barker could easily be described as part of the food bowl of Australia, Asia and indeed the whole world. We produce premium produce of every description, for both local and export consumption. From the grapes of the Coonawarra, Langhorne Creek, Kangaroo Island and Padthaway come some of the top-shelf wines that we all enjoy—in fact, I suggest many members of this House enjoyed a few last night. It is one of the great industries in this country, and its product does help us unwind. In Barker we also have abundant seafood, from the rock lobsters caught at Port MacDonnell, Robe and Kingston to the aquaculture which is a hugely growing industry off Cape Jaffa. There are lots of other areas in my electorate where, both on land and sea, the aquaculture industry has great potential. We produce great beef and export it to many countries around the world. And we have safe beef, which is pretty important these days when you consider what has gone on in Europe with foot-and-mouth and mad cow disease. We produce fantastic lamb—I am a proud beef and lamb producer myself—and we produce pork. There is every conceivable form of agriculture and horticulture in my electorate of Barker, with the possible exception of tropical fruit like bananas, which we will leave to the expertise of the Queenslanders.
The signing of the Food Regulation Agreement 2000 was the culmination of lengthy consideration by all governments of the recommendations of the Food Regulation Review Committee chaired by Dr Bill Blair OAM. The Prime Minister announced the review of food regulation in his March 1997 statement, More Time for Business. At the time, the Prime Minister said that the food industry had significant concerns about the burden imposed on business by inconsistent and unnecessary regulation, poor coordination of government agencies and inconsistent compliance and monitoring arrangements. He went on to say that significant issues included the costs of transport compliance, the costs of labelling compliance and the importance of the continued adoption of uniform standards. These are some of the very concerns that this bill seeks to address.
The Food Regulation Review Committee was tasked with making recommendations to government on how to reduce the regulatory burden on the food sector and improve the clarity, certainty and efficiency of the current food regulatory arrangements, whilst at the same time protecting public health and safety—a very important issue for all Australians. After considering the recommendations made by the report of the committee, COAG agreed to a package of food regulatory reforms that ensure that a nationally coordinated approach to food regulation applies across the whole food supply chain. The new food regulatory reform package will ensure that, firstly, public health and safety is strengthened and maintained; secondly, there is a national consistency in the interpretation, administration and enforcement of food regulations; and, thirdly, consumers have sufficient information to make informed choices.
The new food regulatory framework is designed to operate efficiently by reducing costs to industry, government and consumers. In particular, it seeks to improve the timeliness and responsiveness of the food standards setting process while maintaining the transparency of, and community confidence in, the food regulatory system. 
The agreement establishes a new ministerial council, the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council. The ministerial council will, among other things, develop domestic food regulation policy as well as policy guidelines for setting domestic food standards. Recognising the primacy of public health and safety considerations in developing such a policy, the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council will be based on the existing council of health ministers, the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council, or ANZFSC. Its membership may also include other ministers nominated by individual jurisdictions covering portfolios such as primary or processed food production, or trade. Each jurisdiction will have one vote with a lead minister for each jurisdiction being chosen. Most jurisdictions have already indicated that their lead minister would be from the health portfolio.
I think this is a very important amendment to the act. I did have a problem with the previous act in that only health ministers were involved when some of the decisions actually had international and world trade implications. So it is very important that we allowed the possibility of agricultural ministers or trade ministers of being involved in this process but retaining the one vote for each state and territory and, of course, one for Australia and New Zealand in the new council. The problem with the previous act was in trade negotiations and where there were international implications—and we saw that with the genetic modification debate where the world trade implications were not taken into account. Under these proposals, they will be able to be taken into account. Each jurisdiction will have the ability to send ministers and staff along to be involved in the process of decision making while still retaining that one vote with a lead minister.
The bill will establish a new statutory authority, Food Standards Australia New Zealand—the authority—to be based upon the existing Australia New Zealand Food Authority, or ANZFA, as it has become well known. The prime function of the authority will be to develop domestic food standards that are to be adopted nationally. These standards are to be developed based on scientific and technical criteria and in accordance with the objectives set out in section 10 of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991, dealing with the protection of public health and safety and the provision of information to consumers. This is retained and is very important because consumers demand to know what is in their food—and rightly so.
The authority will have a board. The board will approve standards developed by the authority and notify those standards to the ministerial council. The members of the board will be appointed by the Commonwealth Minister for Health and Aged Care, but only with agreement from the ministerial council. The board membership must include someone with expertise in consumer rights. So consumers will continue to be protected. The FSANZ chief executive officer will be appointed by the board.
The new food regulatory arrangements will strengthen ministerial authority and accountability. The ministerial council will develop and promulgate policies that are consistent with the objectives and other matters set out in section 10 of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 in order to give clearer guidance to the authority in its development of food standards. This will enable the ministerial council to direct, rather than react to, proposals by the authority. That is a very important difference. It will also have the capacity to direct the authority to review any standard—any standard—and can reject any proposed draft standard in accordance with the arrangements set out in the Food Regulation Agreement 2000.
The bill sets out the process for the development of food standards that takes into account these roles of the ministerial council. The bill also makes provision for the transition from the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, ANZFA, to the statutory authority, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, and other amendments that are consequential to the renaming of the act and the creation of the new authority. 
The new food regulatory framework is designed to ensure that food businesses produce food that is safe and suitable for human consumption. To be effective, it must apply across the whole food supply chain. The authority will therefore eventually be able to develop all domestic food standards that are to be adopted nationally and with New Zealand, including those that under current arrangements are or would be established by the ministerial Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand.
The arrangements for the development of these primary product standards will be developed by the new ministerial council and may require further legislation, and that is understandable. As we go on and learn a little bit more about the effect of this, it may require further legislation and amendment— and that is the role of governments and parliaments. New Zealand has indicated that it will not be adopting these primary product food standards because it has other systems in place for their development, and we could probably learn some things from them as well as their learning some things from us. The ministerial council will also determine the arrangements to provide for high level consultation with key stakeholders. Again, that is a very important process that we need to go through so that all those affected have a right to be heard and have the ability to argue for necessary changes that might be made by a future government.
The new arrangements are designed to enable food standards to be developed more quickly, if agreed by the members of the ministerial council. All standards, except those urgent standards that must commence immediately to protect public health and safety, will commence if the council has informed the authority that it does not intend to request a review of a draft standard approved by the authority, if a period of 60 days has expired without the council requesting the authority to conduct such a review, or, in relation to an approved draft standard that has already been reviewed twice, the council does not reject that draft standard.
Because of the proposed capacity of the authority to eventually develop all domestic food standards to be adopted nationally, the board will be able to have a wider range of expertise than does the present ANZFA. For example, the bill enables the appointment of members with expertise in primary food production and small business, and rightly so, because they are very much affected by this legislation, as are the consumers of Australia. As I previously said, there will always be someone appointed with a consumer interest in mind. It should be noted that consumer rights are protected in this bill. The amended act will require that the FSANZ board must have a member with that expertise in consumer rights. At the same time, the new regulatory model maintains the existing open and publicly accountable arrangements which allow input by all interested groups. Within the act there is a set process for FSANZ to follow when developing standards that requires public consultation through calls for submissions on the draft standard as it goes through the assessment process.
There are a few other key elements of the new food regulatory system that do not require legislative change. First, a food regulation standing committee will support the council. The membership of this committee consist of heads of health departments and heads of other government departments that reflect the membership of the council, as well as a senior representative from the Australian Local Government Association. As a person who had 11 years of experience in local government before I came into this place, I am very pleased to see this addition. They are often the groups that actually have to administer the food regulations, so it is important that they are involved at the highest level as well as the lowest level, as they presently are. In fact, they often have to do the important business of ensuring that our food safety is protected. The committee is to be chaired by the Secretary to the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care. Second, the council will establish a mechanism for the provision of stakeholder advice by representatives of the interests of consumers, small business, industry and public health. 
I conclude by saying I am pleased to be part of this motion before the parliament. The amendments are very sensible. There has been a lot of consultation. It is an example of where government and opposition members have worked together to come up with clear legislation which protects the interests of consumers and also looks after those businesses that supply us in the food chain throughout Australia. I commend the bill to the parliament and have been very pleased to speak to it.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—The Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001 is, I believe, the final response to the 1996 report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, in which a review was suggested of food regulations. The draft of the resulting Blair review, Food is a growth industry: the report of the food regulation review, appeared in August 1998. This initial process involved broad public and industry consultation. The objective of the review was to recommend to the government how to reduce the regulatory burden on the food sector and improve the clarity, certainty and efficiency of the current food regulatory arrangements while at the same time protecting public health and safety.
The government was supposed to respond in April 2000. It was to look at the review, develop a model food act and consider four food safety standards for inclusion in the ANZFA food standards code. But this has been dealt with piecemeal, and the public has been denied scrutiny through a series of bills that finally ended up with this one. Although some of the basis of the Blair review remains in the bill, it is a bit of a dog's breakfast and has been done without proper consultation or discussion. Many have been concerned about the details of it. However, there has been a lot of work done on amendments, and both sides of the parliament and the Democrats have been able to implement a few changes that will make the new authority less industry biased and more independent.
The bill was originally put together to do the following. The object of this legislation is to ensure a high standard of public health protection throughout Australia and New Zealand by means of the establishment and operation of a joint food authority to achieve the following goals: a high degree of consumer confidence in the quality and safety of food produced, processed, sold or exported from Australia and New Zealand, a pretty positive goal; an effective, transparent and accountable regulatory framework within which the food industry can work efficiently, also a pretty good goal; the provision of adequate information relating to food, to enable consumers to make informed choices, also a pretty logical goal; the establishment of common rules for both countries and the promotion of consistency between domestic and international food regulatory measures without reducing the safeguards applying to public health and consumer protection, to promote consistency between the standards in Australia and New Zealand with those used internationally based on the best available scientific evidence. With changes in food production, et cetera, those are very good goals to have.
The objectives of the authority in developing food regulatory measures and variations of those measures include the protection of public health and safety, the provision of adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices and the prevention of misleading or deceptive conduct. In developing food regulatory measures and variations of those measures, the authority must also have regard to the need for standards to be based on risk analysis using best available scientific evidence, the promotion of consistency between domestic and international food standards, the desirability of an efficient and internationally competitive food industry and the promotion of fair trading in food. 
ANZFA is to be restructured to form a new statutory authority, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, under a new and potentially industry biased board, allowing food standards to be developed more quickly at the risk of proper scrutiny, allowing the ministerial council to develop policy guidelines instead of principles that are disallowable instruments and decreasing the breadth and type of consumer notification. The Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001 and the Food Regulation Agreement are supposed to deliver a new food safety model. Unfortunately, this government was not prepared to accept the Blair review's recommendations to ensure that there was proper independent assessment. They have allowed interests to creep in and have also lessened the powers of the board to ensure independence. This new faster process for approving, reviewing or rejecting applications and proposals will mean that there is an increase in bureaucratic control of the food safety decision making process. In addition, the fact that decisions will now be made outside formal meetings will mean there is less transparency. Finally, proposed changes to the ANZFA board will lead to weaker consumer input and potentially increased industry input with no provision for increased scientific representation.
The only way we can make this more acceptable is to change the composition of the proposed FSANZ board and the way in which the board is chosen. The process by which the ministerial council sets policy and makes its decisions should be changed, and it is vital to increase consumer information and input. In making changes to the board to increase its consumer and science base, we need the involvement of agriculture, trade and other departments in the two major policy functions—the ministerial council and the standing committee—as well as the involvement of the Food Regulation Consultative Council, the stakeholder advisory group, to provide sufficient broad based input and expertise to ensure that board decisions take into account the needs of all major stakeholder groups.
I for one have some very serious concerns about the ability of this bill to ensure the safety of our products against those of some of our closer competitors. When I spoke on this bill in an earlier form in 1999, I expressed an opinion then that it was all very well to have a single agency for the development of a national food standard within your own agency but of concern is that we may adversely affect our own producers by lowering the standard bar. I do not think bringing down the bar to satisfy someone else is in our best interests or in the best interests of producers in Australia. So my concern is that the standard set is not the lowest common denominator that allows products to sneak through when we are unsure of them and where a company representative on a board assures us that it is all right.
We must make sure there is a distinction made between commercial and health goals. I am still not totally comfortable with our arrangements with New Zealand. There are certain aspects here that could have significance for my state. I believe the powers at this stage are not strong enough to prevent products heading into Australia that would be a health risk to our primary food producers. There are insufficient independent scientific professionals who can have a deciding influence on the committee and who are capable of properly judging risk when that decision is required. This has to do with quarantine and the overall problem of keeping our own produce free from disease. We just cannot afford to compromise this.
The amendments sought are vital and must be considered. We must ensure there is no conflict of interest with any persons that serve on the board to oversee these provisions. I think the previous speaker talked about consultation. The Labor senators' minority report pointed out where consultation was lacking and that most of the groups that gave evidence—including the Australian Consumers Association, the Dieticians Association of Australia and the Public Health Association—expressed a big concern about the lack of consultation on the new food regulatory model outlined by the government. Although they may have given evidence during the review process and for the Blair report, it has been two years since then and people were not given proper opportunities for consultation. So when people say, as the previous speaker did, that there has been a lot of consultation, it has been pointed out in plenty of evidence that that has not been the case. 
I believe it is at the government's peril if they do not listen to the Australian people on this, particularly those primary producers whose livelihood is in the hands of the decision makers. I certainly support the opposition's amendments, and call on the House to give them support.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"— This is the second time in a comparatively short time that the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001 has been before the House. The major bill went through at an earlier time. There have been consequent amendments and consultations, and now we are seeing what is basically a second go at the legislation. It is important legislation because with it we are trying to get a common food code that is beneficial for our exporters, our manufacturing industries and our food processors and maintains and lifts the standard of the quality of food in Australia.
Arising from one of the earlier reports prepared by this government on the way in which small business must meet compliance costs, the fact that regulations took so much of a small retailer's time was one of the reasons we have investigated the whole food regulatory environment. Of course, the health professionals had to come into it and have their say about whether you could do something or not. In my opinion, through Dr Bill Blair, they appeared to hijack the debate—which should have been, but was not for some time, a balanced debate on making life easier and simpler for administration but, at the same time, maintaining and increasing the quality of standards.
I am pleased that the government is making these amendments. I am pleased that we are now approaching something of a practical and workable solution, not to find a balance between competing forces but to find the best way of doing things for Australia's advantage. At one point in the process of the development of this legislation, I was told proudly by a senior person within the administration that we would have a set of regulations which was 10 years ahead of anything that the Germans are currently doing. That is very exciting from an administrative point of view but, from the cost point of view, we need to be able to think of Australia's exporting industries and the fact that the food exporting industry of Australia— relying on our clean and green image and on the high quality of hygiene and technical skill of Australian producers—is one of our fastest growing export industries. We therefore need to make sure that any decision making in regard to food regulation and labelling achieves the result of having the consumer knowing what they are buying and confident in the quality of what they are purchasing but, at the same time, is not so bound up with red tape that it makes it an uncompetitive exercise for Australia's primary producers and for our food processors.
This legislation has been through the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, which on a majority decision considered that the legislation is adequate—although I notice that the Australian Labor Party took a line which I find quite a mixed line, as the previous speaker indicated: `We want the best for our growers, but what about the consumers too?' There seems to be no effort to find the middle ground where consumers have confidence but producers can also carry on at a level of confidence and certainty. They are very confused in their outlook.
Figures quoted by various authorities say that Australia has a large number of food poisoning cases. That was a very general sort of study, as I remember it. It was commissioned perhaps by the minister for health, and it came out with some extraordinary figures, after collecting facts from hospitals around Australia. The one disappointment in all of it was that it never identified what the exact source of food poisoning was. It seemed to indicate that the fast food industry was the most dangerous industry in Australia. I myself would not hold that view. I think we have one of the best fast food industries in the world—but that does not mean to say it cannot be improved. 
What the study did not reveal was how many cases of food poisoning or problems related to food were created by lack of knowledge and poor hygiene within the homes of Australia—a factor which is a real shortcoming of that report. It would have been a valuable bit of information because it would not only allow us to initiate programs of health and hygiene through schools and parent groups and programs of support through community outreach programs from hospitals and community health centres but also help us to identify which sections of industry needed careful attention with regard to food regulations. A small retail outlet providing food on a busy Saturday morning for families out shopping has one set of circumstances it needs to deal with, a restaurant has another set of circumstances and a hotel another set of circumstances. Our exporters exporting food in bulk have yet another set of circumstances. All of these have been brought together in an attempt to make a simpler, more easily administered and lower cost process for food handling and processing in Australia.
The government, I believe, has made a valiant effort. The Australian Labor Party, by contrast, appears to be all over the place on this. They are trying to say, `We stand for the producers and we stand for the consumers, but nasty business appears to be in the middle of it.' The fact of the matter is that Australia needs to export its food products. We cannot possibly eat all the food we produce ourselves, and we need to have sensible rules that will make our products attractive to our customers and will allow us to meet those markets.
In the early stages of the development of this legislation, there were many complaints from industry groups about the cost of the new national food safety laws. There was also concern, of course, about the prospect of our dropping our standards, because we were in some way harmonising the Australian regulations with those of New Zealand, and it was felt—and is felt by some—that the standards for food preparation and food processing in New Zealand may be lower than those in Australia, and therefore the harmonisation process caused concern in a number of people.
There have also been remarks made, particularly during the period of the Senate hearings, by nutritionists and others that they are concerned that the industry bodies on the board are going to somehow or other diminish the effectiveness of the ANZFA. I dispute that, because the fact of the matter is that, unless we have sensible input from industry, trade and agriculture, we are going to make some really wrong decisions. I bring to the House the fears of some of my primary producers. They have fears about inspectors coming into their paddocks and onto their farms with draconian authority, forcing them to construct lavish buildings for the simple processing of vegetables or fruit; they have fears about then being unable to appeal through proper process to anybody who can help alleviate the costs of what they are doing. The small farmers in the electorate of Mitchell and other areas surrounding the city of Sydney produce some of the highest quality, freshest vegetables and fruit in the nation. Their product is much sought after and it is a hugely valuable commodity, approaching a value of $2.4 billion; it is very substantial indeed. It is taken up on a day-to-day basis by high-quality restaurants and high-quality food stores, because it is fresh and can be picked at a stage of optimum ripeness, freshness or maturity and quickly transported to homes or restaurants and other outlets and consumed.
So these growers, who are not large growers and are in many cases from non-English-speaking backgrounds, are hugely worried that somewhere here in Canberra there is going to be this horrific, monolithic monster, run by people who, although they have never been closer to a farm than a trip down the Federal Highway between here and Sydney, will be making decisions about their livelihoods and their incomes which, if put in context, could cause them severe economic damage. The paddock to plate concept run by Dr Bill Blair means that the food inspectors would come onto the farm to see how a crop is grown and producers would be forced to fill out forms about how the crop is grown, noting what date sprays are put on and becoming completely accountable every step of the way, rather than using the traditional method of testing the final product and saying, `Is this product sound and fit for human consumption?' Instead, we are supposed to start at the beginning and follow every step, and if every step is right then the final product must be fit for human consumption. That is a hugely costly process and it is one that, I am pleased to say, has been substantially rejected. We have reverted to the situation where the quality of the product itself is going to be assessed, and that is what is necessary. 
Much of this superfluous legislation was an effort by major chain stores such as Coles and Woolworths to absolve themselves from responsibility in the presentation of food. They were at a point where they said, `Is it fair for our buyers to be responsible for the quality of what they buy?' The concept originally contained in the ANZFA legislation was, `No, it is not. We cannot accept responsibility for what we sell through our stores. The grower who produces it or the farmer who grows the livestock or produces the vegetables or the fruit is the one who is responsible, not the retailer.' So this framework is an effort by the big retailers to push the responsibility down and get away from the prospect of litigation against themselves. It seeks to spread the responsibility down to the grassroots. Originally, it was meant to let those major outlets duck any unexpected litigation. That is part of the process, I have to say, because it was designed in that way. It was designed in such a way that the cost was spread to the small from the large. Instead of the large bearing a good part of the cost, as they should have been, the cost was spread down through the chain to the truckies, the yardmen at the abattoirs, the slaughtermen themselves and the farmers. Every step of the way, a person was going to carry some responsibility. However, it would seem to me that ultimately a buyer going to purchase something for a large food retail outlet has a responsibility to assess the quality of what they are buying, to make a decision on whether all the processes and steps have been gone through, and then to rely on their judgment and knowledge as to whether the product is fit for human consumption and whether the producer and processor have complied with all the appropriate state and Commonwealth laws.
I am pleased to say that we have a more balanced approach. I am pleased to say that some of the extraordinary writings I have seen over the last few days about how we are diminishing our food legislation and how we are throwing out the baby with the bathwater are hugely exaggerated and, I would have to say, largely rubbish. This is a step forward— and an important step forward. The goal that people set out to fulfil here, that is, to have a harmonised relationship on food quality throughout Australia and to bring together some unity in labelling laws and processing factors throughout the nation and New Zealand, will be greatly beneficial. To simplify is greatly beneficial, to have uniformity is greatly beneficial; but to complicate it in the process to something way beyond what it ever was before is not beneficial.
I refer members opposite to a publication prepared by ANZFA, Food safety standards—costs and benefits, and to a report, Overcooked: a study of food compliance costs for small business. I would ask them to consider where the balance lies between what was proposed at that time and what is a reasonable thing to ask of small business. The fact of the matter is this: if local government had exercised its responsibility to enforce the ordinances and laws that it is supposed to enforce, there would never have been any problems anywhere. And I do not think there are any problems. The fact is that local government has not done its job and will not do its job under the new legislation. There is no way it will. If anybody thinks that the form fillers and people who have a responsibility at a federal level to in some way reconcile all of these steps in the food chain for every producer and every product are going to do the job, I have great doubt that it will happen. The Australian Taxation Office has not been able to do it and neither will anyone else be able to do it. It is people at the workplace who have the responsibility who ought to be doing the job. 
This legislation does a few things. It prevents the ANZFA Council from making disallowable policy principles, and allows it to make only non-disallowable principles. That change will make it possible for the council to issue policy principles in relation to the development of food standards, and provides that they would be instruments that would have to be tabled and could be disallowed by the Senate or the House of Representatives. I have no problem with that. I would have preferred the former so that some proper decision outside ANZFA can be given on the proposals. The composition of the board is changed, as I have said, and there are some other changes to the way in which the ministerial council will meet. That is the council comprised of all state ministers for health and the federal minister. The House needs to understand that the federal minister in this instance was only an equal player; there was no way the Commonwealth could call what could be termed a national priority shot. The federal minister was just one of many. As a government we had put ourselves in the hands of others and, to me, there should have been some reserve capacity to disallow something or to not do something or to do something if it was in the best interests of Australia. That has changed slightly now with the change in the composition of the ministerial council and I am pleased to see that that has occurred.
The writings of people like Geoff Strong about the industry taking over food safety, and some of the writings of other journalists who tended, in my opinion, to not take into account the full benefit that can flow to Australia from this change and who have chosen to push the line of the nutritionists or the Australian consumer council without looking at the whole thing in a comprehensive manner, are unfortunate. I am sure the government has found the right balance. I know that my primary producers are going to have to do better and better under this legislation. They are going to have to be more accountable. But I know that the big chain stores are not going to be able to dump it down on others either under this legislation. I also know that Australia is going to get a fair go in the international forum, and we were not before. I know that the states were going to dominate us before, and they will not now. I think this legislation is a good compromise and I recommend it to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I rise to support the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001 with the agreed amendments. In doing so, I must say that I have some concerns through listening to the previous speaker. It really shows where the government came from initially: looking at reducing costs, abrogating government responsibility and being prepared to adopt a harm minimisation approach to food safety—something that governments cannot afford to do because we need to be assured that the food we eat is safe.
The Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001 demonstrates yet again how the Howard government tries at every opportunity to avoid proper consultation and how it disregards the views and interests of the Australian people. It is an arrogant government that is frightened of consultation and frightened of listening to people and accepting their views. The Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1999 demonstrated this fact most vividly. You would think that the government would have learnt from its attempt to forge ahead with legislation regardless of public concern. This legislation, as I mentioned earlier, is a vast improvement on the previous legislation, particularly with the amendments, and it is legislation that I feel comfortable supporting now that it incorporates these amendments.
I think it is important, though, to consider the background to the legislation, which backs up what I was saying about the government's failure to consult and failure to take the community with it willingly. Rather, the government is forced into a position where it has to accept some changes to its legislation. It first goes for the most draconian legislation that it can and, if it fails, it will accept amendments and modify its legislation. In 1997, the Prime Minister announced a review of food regulation, the Blair review. The objective of this review was to recommend to the government how to reduce the regulatory burden on the food industry. That was the number one point, how to reduce the regulatory burden; not how to ensure that the food that Australians consume is safe. To me, that is a great concern. I feel that the most important thing that a government can do is to work towards, ensure and legislate for the safety of the people of our country. The review was also to improve the clarity, certainty and efficiency of current food regulation; and then at the bottom, as if it were an afterthought, it was to protect public health and safety. I believe that health and safety is at the top. 
When we look at cutting red tape, when the Howard government was elected it said that it was going to cut red tape by 50 per cent. If we look at what it has done since it has been in power, we see that there has never been a government that has increased red tape to the degree that this government has. The amount of paperwork that small businesses are now confronted with through the government's GST legislation, where small businesses have now become the tax collectors of the government, is testimony to the fact that this government is not about cutting red tape; rather, it is about creating red tape. 
A formal response to the Blair review was expected to be made in April this year but, instead of the government responding formally in April, it has released it in a piecemeal approach. First of all, we had the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1999, then the government released the Food Regulation Agreement with the states—so it is a dribble here, a drop there—and finally we have the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001. All of this happened without the benefit of public scrutiny. We have a government that is frightened of public scrutiny, it is frightened of transparency, it is frightened of consultation and, more than anything, it is frightened of open government. It does not want the people of Australia to know what it is doing—not willingly. It has to be pulled, kicking and screaming, to inform the people of Australia of what it is doing, rather than tricking them into believing that it is doing something else.
The ANZFA Amendment Bill 2001 originally proposed to restructure ANZFA as a new statutory body under what we on this side of the House believe was a potentially biased board. We have all seen the kind of approach that this government has to boards. It stacks boards with its friends, with its mates, and people that will ensure that the government gets the outcomes that it wants. This was a great worry to us on this side of the House, because we really believe that the make-up of the board could jeopardise the safety of our food and our community, particularly if that board were loaded with representatives from the food industry. It also allowed food standards to be developed more quickly at the risk of proper scrutiny; it allowed the ministerial council to develop policy guidelines instead of principles that were disallowable; it decreased, in breadth and type, the type of consumer notification; and changes would lead to increased bureaucratic control and decision making being done outside the council meeting. The Australian Consumers Association called for the precautionary principle, as outlined in the Gene Technology Bill 2000, to be included. You can see why there are so many concerns.
I have already mentioned the composition of the board, the potential for that to be stacked by food representatives and how this will impact on our food safety. The setting of policy and the making of decisions—the proposal for the ministerial council to lose the power to amend proposals put forward by the ANZFA board—is a real concern, as well as that applications could become law if the ministerial council did not respond in 60 days. Of more concern than anything is that there was a proposal going around that the lead minister need not have a relevant portfolio. When we are considering matters that are going to affect the health of all our community, when we are looking at something that goes to the food that we eat, the minister in charge should be the health minister. There were limited avenues for consumers to have input, there was a restriction on public information and, as I have mentioned, there was a lack of the precautionary approach to assessing food—the harm minimisation approach. The government's original legislation had the potential to impact enormously on the evaluation of food safety and the quality and safety of our food. It had the potential to endanger community health. There was none of the protection that government legislation should provide the community so that the community knows that the food we eat is safe.  
The legislation before parliament now includes amendments that have been put up by the Labor Party and the Democrats and it is now acceptable, but it is important to note that the legislation the Howard government wanted to impose is the legislation that I just spoke of—not the legislation we are considering today. Let us consider these amendments and see how they have made the legislation workable. Firstly, the opposition has obtained a commitment from the Prime Minister to write to all state and territory heads of government to propose that the intergovernmental Food Regulation Agreement be amended to specify that at all times the lead minister of the ministerial council will be the health minister for all jurisdictions. That is appropriate. The health minister is the minister who should be looking at public health and safety issues. 
The second amendment is that the power of amendment be returned to the ministerial council. This is the same power that was used by the council to prevent the watering down of the genetic modification labelling standards. Under the legislation as it was originally, this could still have happened. It is a very important amendment. Under the proposed legislation, the ministerial council has 60 days to assess the application. The amendment now says that, if there is no response within the 60 days, the proposal or application will become law by default. Once again, this is very important. The precautionary approach to food safety has been adopted by adding the wording from the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement to the objectives of the ANZFA bill, which provide for a `precautionary approach to be taken in assessing all food standards'. 
The term for the board members will once again be a fixed term of four years. That removes the politics from the situation and enables members of the board to operate independently and not have to worry that any decision they may make could result in their losing their positions. The conflict of interest provisions are also very important. The members of the board will post their personal material interests on the Internet, and public information must now be made available in the major national newspapers. 
The final amendment I would like to touch on concerns the board structure. The board has been expanded from 10 to 12. There are seven mandatory positions now, including members from the NHMRC and three from New Zealand, most of whom come from a health-science background, which is important because it is health and science knowledge that we need in this area. There are going to be five other members. Three are to be nominated by public health and science groups—once again we have that health-science approach—and drawn from areas of expertise such as food safety, food allergy, human nutrition, consumer rights, microbiology, medical science, biotechnology, veterinary science and public health. Two are to be nominated by industry and public bodies and drawn from the following areas of expertise: food regulation, government, food industry, primary food production, small business and international trade. 
This legislation can now be accepted. It is not legislation that has been whisked through that will impinge on the health and safety of our community's food. The legislation now provides for a board that is not loaded with industry representatives. It is legislation that I sincerely hope will ensure that, without question, the food we eat is safe.

"Vaile, Mark, MP",NP,2001-06-28,"—In considering the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001, I ask the House to remember its antecedents. They are the new food regulatory reforms, agreed to by all state and territory governments, that are designed to achieve a more integrated and effective system of food regulation. This bill is only one part of these reforms but it is a very important part. It ensures that a body with science based expertise will develop and approve all food standards. It also ensures that a ministerial council comprising ministers representing all relevant portfolios will set the policy framework for the development of food standards and must also be completely satisfied with those standards. The bill demonstrates this government's continued commitment to the protection of public health and safety. It improves upon the already robust regulatory arrangements that protect the safety of food of all Australians. 
I note that the member for Bruce and the member for Shortland in their comments mentioned an agreement specifying health ministers as lead ministers. I am advised that the terms of the agreement that the government reached with the opposition in relation to this matter are that the government will raise with COAG ministers the federal ALP's wish that the Food Regulation Agreement be amended to prescribe health ministers as the lead ministers for each state and territory and that in return the ALP would support the removal of the Senate amendments in relation to disallowable policy principles. It should be noted that the Commonwealth minister for health will chair the ministerial council and is the Commonwealth's lead minister. I thank all members for their contributions to the debate on this important bill and commend the bill to the House. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001 has been introduced by the government in a further effort to undermine and attack the operational effectiveness of Australia's trade unions and the operation of collective organised labour. The bill seeks to amend the freedom of association provisions in the Workplace Relations Act to prevent the inclusion of provisions in certified agreements which would require the payment of fees for the provision of bargaining services. That is, the government, having taken out of awards a range of entitlements that existed in those awards and having said to the Australian work force and employers of Australia that they should go separately and negotiate agreements, is now saying, `You can negotiate an agreement as long as we like what is in it,' notwithstanding the fact that it may have been adopted in that workplace.
This bill seeks to go beyond the measures of the government's past efforts in stripping back what the commission was allowed to insert into awards. It now seeks to strip from the entitlements of workers and employers the entitlement to decide what they can include in their collective agreements. When the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business introduced this measure, he sought to justify it by making these comments in his second reading speech: 
An important characteristic of Australia's reformed workplace relations system is the opportunity it has given for workers, union and non-union alike, to fully participate in the formal processes of the system, particularly in making collective or individual workplace agreements.
What the minister really meant to say, on behalf of the government, was that the opportunity for workers, union and non-union alike, to fully participate in making collective agreements existed only if the government liked what was in the collective agreement. The parliament is now being asked to tell workers, union members and non-union members, and employers that there are certain things they are not allowed to agree on. So not only can they not have them in awards, and not only can the industrial commission not include them in awards if the commission believes that is desirable, but also we are now saying to people in the workplace, `You cannot make the judgment about whether these things should be included either.'
The government has sought—and no doubt will seek in the course of this debate— to justify this on the basis of other comments that the minister made in his second reading speech, which were a tamer version of outbursts made by his predecessor, the now Minister for Defence, some time last year. I recall a couple of dorothy dixers in this parliament when he sought to blackguard the entire trade union movement, as is his wont. On this occasion, the current minister said this in the second reading speech:
The coercive nature of the compulsory fee demand is highlighted by the fact that it is typically made without the consent of the relevant employee.
The minister—if he understood his act and if his department had given him advice— would know that that is not true. We are talking here about collective agreements which are required by the minister's own act of parliament to be endorsed by a majority of the work force. Let me quote to the House section 170LR(1) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996:
The agreement must be approved by a valid majority of the persons employed at the time whose employment will be subject to the agreement. 
This is the Howard government's law. It requires a vote in the workplace of all workers, whether they are in a union or not. They all have to vote. If they are going to be affected by the agreement, they must vote on whether or not they want it. We have a situation where, if a clause is proposed to be inserted into one of these agreements, the workers have the full agreement put to them— whether they are in a union or not, they are entitled to know what is in the agreement; they are entitled to vote—and if a valid majority vote for the agreement with that clause in it the government is now saying that they have no right to do that.
What really annoys me is that, whilst that is clearly the law—this government's law— the government comes into this parliament and pretends, as the minister did in his second reading speech, that it was a compulsory fee which the worker concerned had no opportunity to consent to. That is untrue. That is a lie. It is not the case that workers are going to have anything imposed upon them that they did not prior to that have an opportunity to make a determination about. The government's own legislation guarantees all workers, union and non-union alike, a vote on whether or not those clauses should be in the agreement and whether or not that agreement should be adopted. That is the fact.
So what we have here is not a protection of some group of workers or an individual worker from having things they have no say in imposed upon them, but a view that, notwithstanding the democratic process that this government put in place, notwithstanding the operation of the act as it now stands, notwithstanding the democratic vote in the workplace, they should still not be able to include that. Why? Because this government has an ideological obsession about unions. It has, since it was first elected, done everything it can to undermine the role and the authority of the trade union movement in Australia. I might say that it has not been alone in that. This government has attacked a whole range of community groups. It has even attacked its own Industrial Relations Commission and its own courts. So the trade union movement need not feel too lonely being on the receiving end of divisive and aggressive attacks from this government. But here we have a very clear example where the government is seeking to undermine the very principles that it says underpin its legislation, and for a very obvious reason. 
This point was understood by the Democrats when this matter was first raised. I want to quote to the House a press release issued by Senator Andrew Murray of the Democrats, who is their spokesperson on these matters. He said:
The fee can only be charged if the majority of employees in the workplace vote it into the enterprise agreement itself.
He understood that point—of course he did. I assume that the minister understands that point. I cannot be confident about that but I assume the minister understood that is what his legislation did, which makes you wonder why he would say the things to the parliament that he did in his second reading speech, because clearly that does not reflect the legislation. But Andrew Murray understood that in his press release of 13 February. He went on and said:
That is appropriate as the workers in a workplace who are paying union fees should not be carrying those who do not.
Senator Murray said:
Unions would need to be accountable to both union and non-union members for their performance. That accountability exists through the workers voting to approve the agreement.
He went on to say:
... But I would want to ensure that the union was fully consulting union and non-union members in all stages of negotiation leading up to such an agreement.
And fair enough. So Senator Murray understood that what I have just said is the case and he understood that what the minister has said is false. The principle at stake here is whether or not, in a situation where a union negotiates a collective agreement which includes in it benefits for all of the work force, those people who gain by that agreement should make some contribution to the costs involved in securing that agreement. That principle is fair enough, I would have thought. It is a principle this government and indeed the community apply in a whole range of other areas. We have often heard the government talk about user pays. We have often heard the government talk about mutual obligation. Let me give you a few quotes from the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Tony Abbott, who is at the table. He said:
The HECS system is a good system. It is a good system because it combines in a rather ingenious way elements of user pays with social equity.
What the minister was saying was that people who benefit from the system make a contribution to the system. The minister thought that was a very good thing to do with university students. He just does not like doing it when the beneficiary of the system is a trade union. Let me quote the comments of the Prime Minister. He said:
We've respected and introduced the principle of mutual obligation. A principle that says that a humane society has an obligation to look after the disadvantaged and those who can't look after themselves but it also has a right to say to people who get the help of others that if you are able to do so you should put something back to your community in return.
A fine principle, Prime Minister. I just want to read that again:
... that if you are able to do so you should put something back to your community in return.
That is exactly the principle at stake here which the government wants to remove from the workplace—that is, a worker gets the benefit. They are able to make a contribution in return for that benefit and, as the Prime Minister said, if that is their situation, they should do so. Well, of course they should. The Prime Minister says that is a good thing when he is talking about unemployed people but, when it comes to trade unions and workers, of course he has a very different standard—a double standard. Let me quote again from the Prime Minister. In March this year he said: 
And when I talk about mutual obligation I don't only talk about the people who are on unemployment benefits, if they're able to do so, to do some work in return, I also talk about corporates who've done very well out of a strong economy to contribute something back to help their fellow Australians.
So the Prime Minister extends this principle from the unemployed to others such as the corporate world. They gain benefits from the society in which they prosper; they should put something back into it—a fine principle, Prime Minister. Why don't you apply it here? Again, in November last year, the minister at the table said:
The third point I'd make is that policies and principles such as mutual obligation again accord with traditional Christian teaching that for every right there's got to be a corresponding responsibility.
You might recall that comment, Minister. I would be interested to know why the minister at the table thinks that there should be a mutual obligation and that it is an important Christian ethic when applied in other areas of government activity, particularly when it involves the government helping others such as the unemployed or the homeless—it is a good principle to apply there, because it means the government does not have to put its hand in its pocket as far; that is a good principle the minister likes—but not when it is applied in a workplace to say to the worker who is going to gain increased pay, conditions and protection of a union negotiated agreement, that they have an obligation to make a contribution to that union. Why? Because it is a union. That is the reason—because it is a union.
Explain to me, Minister, and explain to the House why it is that those principles you espoused on a number of occasions in those other areas of policy have no relevance to the bill before the House. They clearly do. Not to be outdone, I should quote the former minister for workplace relations. He is, after all, a favourite of ours. Mr Reith said this:
... if you are to continue to receive a benefit, then you should perhaps be doing something in return for that, so that's the principle of mutual obligation ... But the basic principle that I have advanced there is that after a certain period if you are paying somebody an unemployment benefit then they should be providing something in return ...
Again, we have another senior minister happy to say that mutual obligation exists only when it benefits this government, only when the people who have to make a contribution are those in less well-off circumstances.
The principle is fine. It should be applied evenly. It should be applied fairly. But this government has myopic vision when it comes to industrial relations; it has the blinkers on. You cannot have a sensible conversation with this government in which references are made to trade unions, because you get the pavlovian dog response: it salivates and goes for it. It cannot help itself when there is reference to trade unions. Here we see that again. Here we have a situation where it is clearly a case of mutual obligation. If you like, it is a case of user pays, but it is not even applied to everybody. So there are two fundamental principles here that this bill seeks to undermine. The first is the principle of mutual obligation to which I have just been referring. If you are a worker and you get the benefit of the agreement, there is a reasonable obligation on you to make a contribution to the costs of getting that protection, and that is a fair thing; that is mutual obligation. But that is not what actually happens. Unlike the other mutual obligation, which this government imposes across the board as it sees fit, here we are talking about mutual obligation occurring only where those workers themselves vote for it to occur. A union may in fact want non-union members to pay it a fee for the work it has done in securing them better benefits, but it cannot get it. It may want it as much as it likes, but it cannot get it under the current arrangements. It can only get it if a majority of the workers in that workplace—union and non-union unlike—vote for it. 
The government are fond of telling us how union membership has declined to around 20 per cent, depending on which figures you look at—say, 20 per cent in the private sector. So we are talking here, if you take the typical workplace, where only 20 per cent of the workers may be in a union. Yet a majority of the workers—that includes a hell of a lot of people who are not in the union—accept their obligation that I have just been referring to and vote for an agreement that includes in it a requirement that they make a payment for the services that have been provided in securing that agreement. That means that non-union members in just about all of these workplaces are going to have to vote for this. If the non-union members do not want it, it will not be carried in most workplaces.
The government cannot have it both ways. On the one hand they cannot say that we have all these union heavies out there dominating workplaces, resulting in majority votes in favour of these fees, and then, on the other hand, immediately say that union membership has declined to the point where it is pretty insignificant, it has been sidelined and there is less than 20 per cent of the private sector work force in a union. The statistics tell us that there is about 20 per cent of the private sector work force in a union, so apply that to this situation. The mathematics of it are clear. A whole lot of non-union members have got to vote in favour of imposing this payment on themselves and on their fellow workers; otherwise it does not get paid.
So, under the provisions of this government's act, the two principles are, firstly, that there must be the mutual obligation established and, secondly, that people freely have to vote for it. So I do not want to hear during this debate the minister or any government members talk about any fees being imposed on anyone. Nothing has been imposed on workers to make payments for bargaining fees. The workers are required to vote for it themselves. If they vote for it themselves, including a very substantial number of non-union members, what makes the government think it should intervene and tell those workers that they are not allowed to strike such an agreement, that they are not allowed to accept that mutual obligation that this government is so fond of quoting?
There are some interesting parallels that could be drawn in the work force when it comes to payment of fees. This parliament is pretty overpopulated with lawyers. The legal profession is an interesting profession when it comes to payment of fees. It is not the only profession which requires people to make payments of fees in order for them to be able to practise a livelihood, but it is a pretty good one to start with, and one in which the government is well represented. Let me go through the list. These people I am about to mention have all practised in the legal profession and have all been required to make a payment. They had no vote about this. Unlike the workers who vote to make a payment to the union, these people had no choice. If they wanted to work, they had to pay the fee to the professional body. I refer to the Prime Minister, John Howard, who was a lawyer and had to make a compulsory payment in order for him to be able to practise; the Treasurer, Peter Costello; the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Robert Hill; the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Richard Alston; the Minister for Defence, Peter Reith; the Minister for Finance and Administration, John Fahey; the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, David Kemp—although I am not sure that he actually practised, but he does have an LLB, so I may stand to be corrected there; the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Nick Minchin; the Attorney-General, Daryl Williams; the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock; the Minister for Family and Community Services, Amanda Vanstone; and the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Tony Abbott, the minister at the table; again, I am not sure if he has practised, but he has an LLB. He shakes his head, so he obviously has the piece of paper but did not practise. There is also the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Ian Macdonald; the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Joe Hockey; the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, Peter McGauran; the Minister for Aged Care, Bronwyn Bishop; the Special Minister of State, Eric Abetz; and the Minister for Sport and Tourism, Jackie Kelly. She practised in the Defence Force, so I am not sure whether she had to make the payment; she may be exempt from this. There is also the Minister for Justice and Customs, Chris Ellison, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, Peter Slipper. 
All of these people are lawyers. They cannot work in their profession unless they make a payment to their professional body. They have no vote about whether they want to make that payment. They have no choice. The government, the law of the land, determines that they receive certain privileges, that certain standards are to be met and that they must make a payment, whether they like it or not. Contrast that with the workers. The workers do have a choice about whether they make a payment. They have a vote in their workplace and every worker is entitled to exactly the same say. How more democratic could that process be? All of these people who think that workers should be able to skate through on the backs of others, get the benefit of other people's contribution and make no payment for it themselves, have no qualms about forking out dough in order for them to practise their trade.
Of course, they are not the only ones. There are doctors—medical practitioners—in the parliament on the government benches. They are not required to be in the AMA, although it is a pretty strong union, you have got to say—as the Minister for Health and Aged Care is currently finding out. Not strong enough for some: I notice the surgeons do not think the AMA is quite up to the task for them, so they have set up their own organisation. I love the acronym, the SAS—every time I read that my old defence days come back to me and I think of the Special Air Service; but, of course, that is not the Special Air Service Regiment, although I suspect they might market themselves among surgeons as being a bit like that. They are the Society of Australian Surgeons. So we have got the SAS out there chasing the minister for health because they think the AMA is not up to it. As for the rest of doctors, they do not have to be in the AMA, though it is a pretty tight union, but they do have to be in the royal colleges if they want to practise their trade as a medical practitioner. I could go through other professions where the same sorts of restrictions apply.
The government has no qualms about those compulsory fees—none at all. And I am not suggesting it should have. What I am doing is highlighting the double standards which are applied whenever reference is made to trade unions. The reason the government has brought this here is that the courts have found that these agreements are lawful, much to the chagrin of the government. There is a case on foot that is under appeal. My advice to the government is to withdraw this bill, have a look at what goes on in the courts and see whether or not the appeal succeeds. But, no, in typical fashion this government has taken the view that it does not want the normal processes of the courts and the law to unfold; it wants to tread over the normal processes, halfway through as they are, and proceed with this bill in parliament. I make it clear that we will be opposing this bill and we will be opposing the second reading. And I think it is plain from Senator Murray's press release—part of which I have read during this debate—that the Democrats have a similar view.
The government are wrong on this. They will seek to build a political argument about workers being set upon. They will try and put the political spin on this that workers are going to be forced to pay money to unions that they do not want to pay. They will repeat the things that are untrue that the minister said in his second reading speech, that people will be required—coerced, he said—to make compulsory fee payments without the consent of the relevant employee. Either he does not understand his own act or he is not telling the truth knowingly. It is one or the other, and I am quite happy for him to explain which it is. It is clear that the current act prevents a situation that the minister described occurring. There has to be a vote of those workers. 
If mutual obligation means anything in the Australian community, it means that, if you gain a benefit from other people's work and you are able to make a contribution to the effort of those other people's work, you should do so. That is what various ministers have said in relation to a range of social security payments. The same principles apply here. Workers in a workplace who gain the benefits of higher wages, better employment, better working conditions and more secure employment have a moral obligation to make a contribution to the efforts that produced that outcome. Clearly, in a work force situation, they are able to do that. Where you have a mechanism that guarantees them a free vote to decide whether or not that should apply, I find it hard to understand how anyone can take objection to it. The government certainly does not object to it when the levy is being imposed upon professional groups.
The government is clearly going down the wrong path here. It is a bill that is going to be doomed in this parliament. I do not think there is much doubt about its fate. The government will want to play the politics of it, along the lines I just mentioned, as much as they can. They should do so knowing that the statements of the kind I suspect they will make are lies; they should do so knowing that the legislation in place now protects workers against the things they claim are happening. But that, I guess, is to be expected a few months out from an election in which the government are in desperate straits. I do not for one minute think that telling lies of that kind will either enhance their standing or convince anyone in the workplace because the people in the workplace actually go to those meetings and they vote. They know it is not true. So as a political tactic, it, too, like this bill, is doomed. We will oppose the second reading and we will divide on it.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—I am very pleased to rise to support the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001 and also to follow on from my electoral neighbour, the member for Brisbane. He has painted a very pleasant picture of very friendly atmospheres of union conduct in every workplace around Australia, where every person, whether or not they are a union member, is afforded an opportunity to pleasantly discuss matters and to make a decision in a democratic environment. And that of course we know is not true. It is a simple matter of fact that, until the union movement in Australia has the courage of the stated convictions of the member for Brisbane to allow Australian workers a secret ballot in which things are conducted in a proper and formal way, in which all members of a particular workplace are afforded the opportunity in the privacy of a ballot box to mark a piece of paper on a proposition, and there is no coercion, no standover tactics, no verballing, no abuse and none of the difficulty we all hear is inflicted upon honest Australian workers who are part of unions in workplaces all around this country, the aspirations painted with such syrupy affection by the member for Brisbane simply will never be realised in the Australian workplace.
What the government is doing here is simply trying to enforce the right of people who are employed and who have a contract by arrangement, agreeing to be part of somebody's work force, to get on with the job and not to feel as though they have to make some compulsory contribution to a union which does nothing for them. The fact is very clear—even the member for Brisbane has conceded it—that 80 per cent of workers in Australia see no point in being part of the union because the union has done nothing for them.
The member for Brisbane has also painted the picture that unions themselves have provided the range of benefits that are enjoyed in employment contracts. We all know that in the real world—outside the Trades Hall world—workers make arrangements directly with their employer and they agree to certain conditions. There are minimum standards that are set—not by the unions but by the Industrial Relations Commission. Every worker in Australia, through the taxation system, makes a contribution to the maintenance of that system. If you want to take the philosophy and the theory that was espoused by the member for Brisbane to its absolute, workers every week pay tax, making a contribution to the minimum standards that are set—not by joining a union by compulsion but by paying taxes, which of course help to run the Industrial Relations Commission. 
In fact, non-union workers do union workers a huge favour, because non-union workers do not seek to negotiate certain conditions that are below those of union workers. In other words, we end up with a circumstance where non-union workers agree to terms and conditions similar to, or more expensive than, those of union workers. They do not undercut them. If we had the situation that the member for Brisbane was describing where non-union workers—and he did not use the four-letter word `scab' but that was the concept he was trying to put forward— were really impacting upon union workers, they would be trying to undercut them and bid them out of a job in a competitive marketplace. We know that that does not happen, because all people in the paid work force contribute towards the maintenance of basic standards through the Industrial Relations Commission. That is a position that this government has always supported and this government, through all of its various efforts in trying to liberate this compulsion fixation that those opposite have about union membership, will continue to support—that is, the right of people to organise themselves and become part of a union balanced with the right of people to disassociate. I do not see anything fundamentally incorrect with that—no-one is sponging off another. It is just that some choose to negotiate through a union and I defend their right to do so. The fact that others choose to negotiate through other means is, of course, a right I also defend.
But the Australian Labor Party have set again a scenario where, should they win government, we will see the hard hand of compulsory unionism brought down on average workers and the impost of that applied through every small business operating throughout Australia. What a sad set of circumstances that would be as we go into our second century of nationhood. We have had in this past 100 years people fighting for this country under our flag—and long may it fly in its current form—against this sort of despotic concept of compulsion. People have died defending the rights of people in nations far from our shores and near our country as a result of despotic regimes forcing people to be part of them or they are out. We have had people come to this country from those nations—I have such people in my electorate from all parts of South-East Asia, from the Middle East, from Europe and from the horn of Africa—to flee compulsion, to flee a circumstance where they were told that they must be a member of the ruling party or they would get nowhere.
So when you hear those opposite get up and say that you must be a member of a union what they are saying is, `After the next election, we're going to be the ruling party and we want people to be members of our party.' It is not hard to work out why, because the Australian Labor Party is not just a creature of the union movement but the delegate of the union movement in this place. Given that only 20 per cent of workers are in unions, they represent a significant minority in Australian society. But the hold that the unions have over individual opposition frontbench members in this place and the hold that they have over opposition backbench members is enormous. The opposition's refusal in this debate to rule out compulsion—it has been knocked off by the Labor Party in the Senate before and it will be knocked off by the Labor Party in the Senate again—is a desperate tactic by the Labor Party to try and stop freedom, freedom of association and disassociation, being practised in this country.
It is, of course, indicative of the sort of government that those opposite would deliver to the Australian people if they were to win the next election. The Labor-union nexus is pronounced. I have five million reasons to say this, based on the 1999-2000 level of contribution from 23 unions into the Australian Labor Party coffers. It was $5 million in that year alone, a non-election year—heaven knows what they will contribute in this an election year. Of the $22 million that has gone from unions to the Australian Labor Party in the past decade, not one cent has gone to the National Party or to the Liberal Party. That money has gone directly to the Labor Party. On not one occasion has the union hierarchy sought the views of their members—and the member for Brisbane was trying to suggest that there was great democracy practised in Tammany Hall and its various octopus arms out in Australian workplaces—and on not one occasion have we seen a ballot of union members about where that money that is collected as fees should be directed. These are fees which, apparently, the member for Brisbane believes are justified because of the standards workers enjoy, but they are in fact fees directed to one side of politics in this country. It is a side of politics that knows no shame about how they waste taxpayers' money and that clocked up $96 billion worth of debt by the time they left office—in fact, $80-odd billion of that in the last five budgets. It is a party that built a building here in Canberra and then rented it out to a government department on a long-term, never-can-get-out-of lease—we all know about Centenary House—yet here we have them taking, and wanting more, fees out of the hands of non-Labor Party voting workers and compulsorily sending them off to the Labor Party. 
That is really what their opposition is about. It is about ensuring that they have a greater cash flow next year. It is about ensuring that workers, regardless of their political viewpoints, have no say at all about the money that they pay as fees being sent off to the Australian Labor Party. It is worth putting on the record the 10 largest union contributions to the Labor Party in 1999-2000. Topping it is the shoppies union, Queensland Senator John Hogg's union, which put in $732,713.05.
—How much?
—$732,713.05, Parliamentary Secretary. The Metal Workers Union—which wants to stop CHOGM, which will be held in Brisbane in October, which wants, at the Labor Party's behest, to create all sorts of turmoil to stop the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting taking place and assisting Third World countries within the Commonwealth with their debt problems and their poverty problems—contributed $680,771. That is what they put in to the Australian Labor Party. The AWU, Australian Workers Union, contributed $653,285.52. Is it any wonder those opposite spent so much time last year trying to stop proper debate about how the AWU was rorting the electoral process in Queensland? Is it any wonder, because $683,000 worth of contributions in 1999-2000 went to the Labor Party? Countless members in this place—the member for Lilley, the member for Rankin, the member for Griffith and Senator Ludwig—are beholden to that organisation. The plumbers' union, CEPU, contributed $628,149. The Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, which has 11 members in this place, contributed $456,000. The CFMEU contributed $402,000. The Transport Workers Union contributed $376,000. The ASU, Australian Services Union, which has 14 members in this place—
—14?
—14. The ASU contributed $258,310. The Health and Research Employees Association of New South Wales fleeced their membership and sent dues to the Labor Party of $234,806. The National Union of Workers, the NUW, contributed $201,625.90. Not one donation to the Liberal Party, not one donation to the National Party, but plenty of donations to the Australian Labor Party, and plenty of influence in the Australian Labor Party, of course.
What we have here, again, is a speech from the delegate from the QTU, Queensland Teachers Union—the member for Brisbane's union—about why we need to have compulsory acquisition of workers' money to prop up the union movement so it then finds its way through the well-established chain into the coffers of the Australian Labor Party. Why not? After all, it is all about the Labor Party paying for their election using workers money to do so, despite whether or not the workers actually vote for the Labor Party and in fact support the Labor Party. 
Let me tell you about the Queensland Teachers Union, because it is worth noting some of the other priorities of the Queensland Teachers Union as an organisation. Earlier this year it was exposed that they spent $10,000 of their hard-earned workers' dues, taken from teachers across Queensland, to prop up the defence fund of a man who was the richest man in the Queensland parliament until he resigned as a result of accusations of paedophilia, Bill D'Arcy. The former member for Woodridge is long gone from the Queensland parliament—he is in jail; he was found guilty of that—but the Queensland Teachers Union decided that a priority expenditure for them was to give 10 grand to the Bill D'Arcy defence fund. Their bond to the Labor Party, their loyalty to Labor Party members, knows no bounds, and you can bet your bottom dollar that that loyalty is demanded back, and some.
The problem is that if the Labor Party win the next election we will have operating at the federal level the same thing we have operating at various state government levels, and that is a Labor Party minister who does what the union of that portfolio sector wants them to do—not what is good for the community, not what is good for the majority of Australians, not what is good for all but what the union wants them to do. I know that it is a cash for comment system that is operating across the Australian Labor Party.
—Government by the union, of the union, for the union.
—It is government by the union, of the union, for the union. As we have already heard, even from the member for Brisbane, a significant minority of Australians only are serviced by that approach. On this side we are attempting to govern for all Australians. We are attempting to get it right for all Australians. But on that side their first priority, because of the cash for comment concept that the Australian Labor Party operates under, is by the unions, of the unions, for the unions; the parliamentary secretary is quite right.
What we have operating in Queensland currently is the Queensland Teachers Union being happy to use children as young as five to deliver partisan propaganda home to mums and dads to support the Australian Labor Party on the dishonest campaign they are conducting about Commonwealth education funding. Commonwealth education funding is at record levels into Queensland: $416 million. The Queensland Teachers Union are letting off the Queensland government scot-free and not complaining about the Queensland government not meeting dollar for dollar the level of increase that this government has achieved. The Queensland Teachers Union say absolutely nothing about state cuts in funding. The Queensland Teachers Union pick on the Commonwealth for partisan reasons—and what we are going to see of course is more of this if the Labor Party are elected at the federal level.
We have the Minister for Education in Queensland, Anna Bligh, attending the Queensland Teachers Union conference the other day, attacking the federal government, backing the union's attempts in newspaper and radio advertisements, spreading untruths at the expense of average workers in the teaching sector, suggesting that the union mount an attack on the member for Herbert, the member for McPherson and me and adding up union dollars into a Labor Party partisan campaign. The Queensland Teachers Union did not put any pressure on Anna Bligh over her failure to put more money into education to match the dollar for dollar increases that the Commonwealth has provided to the sector.
What we have here is Minister Bligh plotting her own mutiny on this education bounty—the bounty of the GST that has gone to state governments to prop up additional expenditure for schools, police and so forth—by trying to lever more students out of state schools in Queensland. On 4BC in Brisbane yesterday morning she forecast that more and more non-government schools would get more and more money from the Commonwealth. The only way they can do that is if more and more students leave the state system. 
So we have the Queensland minister in bed with the QTU and not having any criticism levelled at the fact that she knows that people are leaving the state school system to go into the private school system and is doing nothing about it. We have the union doing nothing about it and we have the minister doing nothing about it, and what we are seeing now is just how tied the Australian Labor Party would be to the union movement— should they happen to actually fall across the line and win at the next federal election.
I support the right of individual workers to join a trade union of their choice. I have never walked away from that. What I challenge those opposite to do is to prove to me that unions can rise to the challenges that are evidenced by the fact that only one in five workers actually bother to join a union—and not by compulsorily demanding that workers pay fees but making unions must-join organisations. If unions spent more of their time trying to get out of the way of government initiatives to decrease unemployment— like if the Labor Party were to pass the unfair dismissal laws to free up that particular part of our economy so that small business could hire more people—and if the trade union movement delegates in this place would get out of our way, we would have more people in jobs. That would be good for the union movement. There would be more chances for them to prove to workers that they are a relevant organisation.
But instead what we see is a lazy approach of demanding compulsion, a lazy approach of coercion and a lazy approach that does not say, `We have to earn your membership.' It is just a lazy approach that says, `We demand your membership.' Labor in opposition have shown in this place the style of government that they would deliver if they were elected—a style of government that does not trust average people to make these decisions and is full of coercion and compulsion.

"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—We have just heard the typical song of hate as those opposite spew out their hatred of the trade union movement. You hear the same speeches all the time—they spew them out every time. I note from the list that there are four more speakers on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001. I do not know why they bother, because they are all going to say exactly the same thing as they demonstrate their hatred of the trade union movement.
The honourable member for Moreton agonised about why the trade union movement did not make a contribution to the Liberal and National parties. Talk about funding your own demise! They know what you crowd deliver to them every time you are in power. Why should they; why would they? As a card carrying member of a trade union, I would be outraged and I would even think of resigning from my trade union if I thought one cent of trade union funding was going to the Liberal Party and—God help us—the National Party.
The honourable member for Moreton, as those on the other side do, trotted out the litany about the various contributions of unions to election funds. They are very, very selective: we never hear about donations from G.J. Coles and we never hear what HIH Insurance put into the Liberal funds, or even about individual donations. I do not know but maybe a shonky nursing home proprietor may have made a donation. We never hear any of this. All we hear about is the contribution that the trade union movement has made. As a card carrying member of a union, I have no difficulty with the unions making a contribution. In fact, I would be a little bit surprised if they did not.
The other point we should realise is that those on the other side say the mantra all the time about the declining membership of trade unions and about how many workers are in a trade union and how many are not. Let me tell you one thing, Madam Deputy Speaker, and you probably get this in your office, and I certainly get it in mine: people come to me all the time about deals that have been done against them, about pay that they have not received or about how they have been kicked out of their work without their entitlements—and I have had some of those business collapses in my area. The first thing I always say to them is, `What does your union say?' They say, `I'm not in a union; I wasn't allowed to join a union.' When the member for Moreton talks about compulsory unionism, what about those firms where there is compulsory non-unionism—where people are forbidden to join the trade union movement? 
The tragedy is that people never realise how important the trade union movement is to them until they actually need it. Then, in so many cases, it is too late. But in the area that I represent—the South Coast of New South Wales—the South Coast Labor Council usually takes those cases on. I have had literally hundreds of people come to me complaining about what has happened in the work force and how they have been disadvantaged, and they have not been a member of the trade union movement. The trade union movement is there to protect workers' rights and get them better conditions. You hear the honourable member for Moreton saying that the member for Brisbane was talking about this wonderful world of kind trade unions. I tell you what: the bosses are not terribly understanding or sympathetic either!
There has been no advance in working conditions or pay conditions in this country over the past 100 years unless it has been fought for, tooth and nail, by the trade union movement. Of course those who are not members of the trade union movement always put their grubby hands out when those who are in the trade union movement have done the hard yards and have got those conditions for them. So let us have a little even-handedness here. I would be the last to say that everything in the trade union movement is wonderful. Of course it is not. It is a collection of individuals and groups, and I might not always necessarily agree with some of the attitudes, but as a member of a trade union—and I always have been one—I am proud of what the trade union movement has achieved and will continue to achieve. This society would be much worse off if it did not have the trade union movement.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001 seeks to amend the freedom of association provisions in the existing Workplace Relations Act, preventing the inclusion of provisions in certified agreements requiring payment of fees for the provision of bargaining services. That is great, isn't it! There is a certain amount of hypocrisy there, I would suggest. All the high-sounding rhetoric in what we have heard from the member for Moreton and in what we are going to hear from the other government speakers and in what we hear from this government all the time about freedom of choice and freedom of association does not disguise the fact that this bill represents yet another attack on the trade union movement. Why, I wonder, do those opposite so hate the trade union movement? What is it in their psyche that they so hate the trade union movement?
This bill is a response to a resolution of the June 2000 ACTU Conference—which, incidentally, was held in Wollongong—supporting the policy of trade unions including, in certified agreements, clauses requiring a payment by non-union members that are the subject of such agreements. The policy basis for the resolution is simple enough: cost recovery—and don't we hear about that from the other side—for the time and resources expended by trade unions in negotiating agreements that flow to all workers. I honestly cannot understand why the government is so perplexed by the ACTU resolution that it has had to introduce this bill, which we will be opposing.
This government certainly never cares too much about imposing cost recovery measures on the community when it so desires. Yet it acts with shocked outrage and has to introduce this hypocritical bill into the parliament. I have never had an argument with the proposition put up by the ACTU about cost recovery from non-union members for the benefits of agreements reached. I have always taken the view that workers who, for whatever reason, do not wish to join a union—and that is their decision—but are among the first to stick their hand out and get the benefits of better pay and better working conditions won by unions and their members are, as far as I am concerned, freeloaders. If they exercise their democratic right not to be a member of a trade union, they have no right to claim the benefits that are won by a union struggle. It seems quite simple: they do not want to be in the union, okay, but they should not take the benefits that the unions get for them. 
Why shouldn't these non-union members—who get increased pay and better working conditions because of industrial action undertaken by their union colleagues or because of the negotiations undertaken with the employer—make a contribution to the union for the time and resources spent obtaining the agreement? If workers get a pay rise and better working conditions because of their union involvement and the direct involvement of their workplace colleagues in negotiations or disputes, what is so terribly unreasonable about those non-union workers making a contribution for those benefits? Why does the government find that to be such a reprehensible policy that it is forced to react and introduce this hypocritical bill?
Usually the government has a partner when we are dealing with an industrial relations matter, but on this occasion the Australian Democrats are not supporting the government's intentions. Indeed, the Australian Democrats have given support to the idea of bargaining fees being collected from non-union members. The Australian Democrats have supported the inclusion of such clauses in certified agreements. The government is out on its own on this bill and does not even carry the usual support in industrial matters of the Australian Democrats in the other place. We have the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business saying:
There can be no doubt that a compulsory fee demand that is not accompanied by the genuine prior consent of the relevant employee is an affront to that employee's individual rights to freedom of association.
He says further:
The government does not accept that employees should be the subject of such direct and indirect coercion.
These really are desperate arguments from a desperate government. What coercion does the minister refer to? Just what is he talking about? Is he talking about putting vicious, half-starved dogs on the wharves, accompanied by balaclavaed thugs wielding batons, chasing workers out of their place of work in the middle of the night? Is that the sort of industrial relations that those on the other side mean? The minister is getting all upset about a piece of paper, a receipt, being put to the non-union members enjoying the benefits of union members' work and about them being asked to make a contribution for the time, effort and resources put in to get the benefits of increased pay and better conditions. Even the Australian Democrats do not support the minister's version of so-called coercion. On 13 February this year, Senator Murray in the other place said:
The fee can only be charged if the majority of employees in the workplace vote it into the enterprise agreement itself.
One is forced to ask again: what `coercion' is the government referring to? You have it explained to you in a simple sentence by Senator Murray: workers in a majority vote have to support the charge being included in the certified agreement.
The bill goes even further by attacking again the role and powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Ever since 1996 the Howard government has been attacking the independence, role and responsibilities of the commission, and we have another attack piled into this bill. This arises because, once again, the commission every so often, in the very limited way it has been allowed to operate under this government's legislation, shows slight flashes of independence. The minister confirms this in his second reading speech: 
In a decision earlier this year, a senior member of the AIRC found that such fees are in fact designed for coercive purposes. It was however concluded that, upon a construction of the current terms of the act, they were not prohibited from inclusion in certified agreements ... 
I am actually going to look at this particular decision by the AIRC, because what I have read into the record is in fact the minister's own interpretation of it. But even the minister, in his highly subjective interpretation, confirms that the bargaining charge or fee is not against the law as found by the commission. For making the finding, the commission has also earned a backhander from the government.
I said at the outset that this bill is hypocritical, because the dominant philosophy of the government is cost recovery and user pays. It is a philosophy the Howard government has championed with an unprecedented degree of relish. This is the government that claims it introduced into the Australian community the mutual obligation principle— the concept that, if one benefits from a service provided, there should be a contribution towards the provision of that service. Of course, under the general double standards of the Howard government, mutual obligation only extends so far. We can throttle social security beneficiaries under mutual obligation, but under no circumstances are we to impose a bargaining charge for non-unionist freeloaders. People who cannot find work because of this government's GST can be forced to work for the dole, but heaven help us if we ask non-union freeloaders to contribute a cent towards the better pay and working conditions obtained for them through the work of unions and union members working side by side with them. The minister even went so far as to say that mutual obligation is part of Christian teaching. However, we can never extend it to non-unionist freeloaders in Australian workplaces.
We had the member for Moreton in here earlier talking about the flag: you are really desperate when you have to bring the flag and the role of veterans into a speech. The honourable member for Moreton also told us about the number of people who have come to Australia escaping coercion and tyranny and things like that. I represent one of the most multicultural areas in Australia and I also represent one of the most unionised areas in Australia, and I find that the people who come from the countries talked about by the honourable member for Moreton—people who are often escaping tyranny and looking for a better life—are among the first, when they are in the work force, to join the trade union movement, because they know that only under the protection of the trade union movement are their rights to a decent job and to decent pay guaranteed. I thought the honourable member for Moreton was on extremely shaky ground: the last refuge of a scoundrel is to wrap yourself in a flag, and the honourable member for Moreton should be ashamed of himself, coming in here and trying to attack the trade union movement while wrapped in the flag.
The government's double standards reek with a disgusting smell. The hypocrisy in this bill is really astounding. The government that introduced this bill, complaining about coercion and freedom of association, has coopted, without anyone's consent, every man, woman and child into Liberal Party election advertising in nearly every newspaper, and on nearly every radio and television station. The honourable member for Moreton said that the Labor Party knows no shame by taking donations from the trade union movement for election funding. This crowd has brought shame to new heights by spending $20 million a month of taxpayers' money—up to $150 million—on the Liberal-National Party re-election fund. The honourable member for Moreton has the audacity to come into this parliament and talk about shame! All of them in the crowd over there should be hanging their heads in shame.
—What about the HIH money too?
—Yes, there was HIH, which made that general contribution to Liberal Party funds, which we did not hear a word about from the honourable member for Moreton, and we will not hear about from the other four speakers. But $120 million is to be spent on Liberal Party advertising, paid for by the taxpayer, with no consultation either with me as a taxpayer or with anyone else, and certainly with no agreement. The greatest freeloader of all in Australian political history is the Howard Liberal government.  
The greatest hypocrisy of all is that the members of the Howard cabinet are subject to compulsory professional association fees. Although I would not call Dr Nelson, the parliamentary secretary at the table, a hypocrite, he is in a professional association and pays a professional fee. You can run along the whole list of the cabinet, and nearly every single minister is forced to pay a compulsory charge to a professional organisation. Most of the Howard ministry are lawyers or barristers, and they all pay a professional fee, as do doctors and others. From the Prime Minister to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, they all pay a compulsory fee to the law society. Those who are in the medical profession, as the parliamentary secretary at the table knows, pay union fees to the Australian Medical Association. Even the Minister for Health and Aged Care—who, I suspect, hates that organisation with a passion—is not baulking at paying compulsory fees to it. If the government would introduce a bill which smashed those professional organisations' compulsory fees, I would take this debate a little more seriously. If it is good to try to smash the trade union movement, it is good enough to try to smash the professional organisations that most members of the cabinet belong to. Unfortunately, the government will not, because it is timid and frightened of the law society and of the doctors' union. But it never has any difficulty taking the stick to trade unions, union members and their independent umpire, the AIRC.
I support a charge on non-union freeloaders and absolutely condemn this hypocrisy. This government constantly spouts mutual obligation in every way. As I have said, surely this too is a form of mutual obligation: if you are going to take the benefits the trade union movement achieves for you, then it is good enough to be a member of the trade union; if you are not a member of a trade union, you should not take the benefits that a trade union gets for you.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Vale, Danna, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—When the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001 first came to my attention, I asked myself the question, `Why is it that, in an era so dominated by individual rights, the right to freedom of association in the work force is under so much threat?' I asked myself that question because the enforcement of compulsory fees paid to a union, for whatever reason, is an attack on the right to freedom of association.
On the question of rights, and the right to freedom of association, there is no greater document or authority than the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It was completed by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in June 1948 and adopted, after very few changes, by the General Assembly in December 1948. It was adopted by a unanimous vote—except for eight abstentions, six of them being Soviet bloc countries. One of the champions of this declaration at the United Nations was Dr H. V. Evatt, a former Australian minister for foreign affairs, or external affairs as it was then known. Dr Evatt was a cabinet member of successive Labor governments, and a former Leader of the Opposition in this House.
The declaration of human rights contains 30 articles, and I would like to draw the attention of the House to article 20, clauses (a) and (b). They state, firstly, that everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association and, secondly, that no-one may be compelled to belong to an association. That is all they say—just some simple brief words—but they have a lot of meaning. I am sure that members opposite and the trade union movement en bloc would leap to the defence of article 20, clause (a), which gives everyone the right to freedom of assembly. But when it comes to the second half of article 20, they support a tricky little device to subvert the intention of clause (b). The so-called bargaining fee is a ruse. It is a sneaky way of forcing non-unionists who do not want to be associated with the union's bargaining tactics to pay a bargaining fee for a service they did not ask the unions to perform on their behalf, nor did they want them to do so. Not only that; it is a fee for service that is set by a monopoly. There is no marketplace, and therefore it is open to abuse. Non-union workers are exposed to exploitation, as the amount of some of the proposed bargaining fees clearly reveals. The fee that some of the main unions have been proposing is higher than the membership fee that they charge. It clearly is exploitative, and is no more than a device to impose a fine on workers for not joining a union. In trying to enforce a compulsory fee, the unions wish to completely subvert the intention of article 20 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The bargaining fee will compel people to join unions. Those who support compulsory bargaining fees imposed on non-unionists deny a basic human right that is enshrined in the declaration of human rights, and that right belongs to non-unionists as much as anyone else. 
It is interesting to stop and consider for a moment one of the driving forces behind the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As I referred to earlier, it was Dr Evatt. He is such an icon figure of the Labor Party that they named the Evatt Foundation after him. But when the comrades in the trade unions began to pull the strings for some unprincipled gain, the members of the Labor Party in this place disown one of the greatest achievements of Dr Evatt—his support for the United Nations and its declaration of human rights. Like graffiti vandals, they want to take a spray can to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and try to spray over article 20, clause (b), put there as a result of the hard work of one of their secular saints.
The achievement of the declaration of human rights is as significant today as it was when first adopted by the United Nations 50 years ago. It has been a byword in international affairs since its adoption, and one of the pillars of principle upon which the United Nations stands. The fact is that clauses (a) and (b) of the declaration are the two sides of the one coin. You support them both or you oppose them both.
Dr Evatt was no run-of-the-mill Leader of the Opposition, nor was he a run-of-the-mill lawyer. He was a High Court judge and a federal Attorney-General. He helped to draw up the United Nations Organisation's charter and, in doing so, succeeded in writing into the charter a stronger commitment to full employment than was originally planned. He appointed prominent Australians to the UN commission that drew up the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He would have known, for sure, that, as a matter of principle, if you support clause (a) of the declaration of human rights you must support clause (b). He was a champion of the right to peaceful assembly and association and therefore a champion of the right not to be compelled to belong to an association.
Social progress and better standards of life, as the preamble to the declaration notes, are not achieved by denying rights. Freedom of association is a fundamental right and is not an idea on a shelf that you can walk past, or take down when it suits you. It is an integral part of our law and it was derived from our long history of seeking rights, such as the rights to life, liberty and security of person, freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. It is freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and freedom of peaceful assembly and association. It is part of the historic non-negotiable package.
As I alluded to earlier, when the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in 1948, only Saudi Arabia, apartheid South Africa and the Soviet bloc countries chose to abstain rather than vote for it. At the time, the Soviet Union was under the control of Joseph Stalin. Stalin died decades ago, but unfortunately there still appear to be some Stalinists around who still believe that the end justifies the means. 
Only a few weeks ago in Jakarta there was justifiable outrage when a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Labour Solidarity Conference, a union meeting attended by about 20 Australian supporters of trade unionism, was violently broken up and some of the Indonesian participants were assaulted. The conference appeared to be a peaceful assembly and the participants had a right under the UN declaration, article 20, to associate in that way. We heard a lot then about democratic rights and the freedom of assembly. That is one side of the coin. In the same way, Australians were appalled when the peaceful assembly in Tiananmen Square in Beijing was brutally broken up by the People's Liberation Army. Now, just as people have the right to assemble peacefully, they also have the right not to assemble, or not to associate with a group of other people, if they so choose. That is why the Howard government put into the Workplace Relations Act 1996 provisions to prohibit compulsory unionism. It was fully in accord with the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and yet the trade unions and the Labor Party want to take away that right by backdoor stealth.
The Howard government supports both clauses (a) and (b) of article 20. It believes that workers should be free to join a union, and they should be free not to join a union, whichever they choose. They should not be compelled to join a union, either directly or indirectly. But they will be indirectly compelled to join a union if the alternative means they will have to pay what amounts to a fine in the form of a bargaining fee. It is the freedom of choice to disassociate from a union, and the upholding of article 20, clause (b), of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights that is at the heart of this bill.
From the media, I notice allegations by unions that some workers have been pressured into signing Australian workplace agreements. The allegations have been rejected by the Employment Advocate and are being pursued in the courts. Setting aside who is right and who is not, the point is that workers have a right not to be compelled to associate with Australian workplace agreements if they choose not to be. That is what the law says, and quite rightly so. That is just the same, in principle, as choosing not to be associated with unions. The opposition should be supporting the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001, because once you start to undermine half the rights contained in article 20 you set about the slippery slope of endangering the other half, and nobody wants that either. This bill defends human rights, it defends democracy, it defends the right of conscience and it repels an attack on these fundamental principles. The predators are union controllers, greedy to increase the spoils of office that give them power. They want to do this by getting their hands into the pockets and bank accounts of every employee in the Australian work force.
I have read news reports recently, for example, that members of Qantas's highly unionised work force have a membership fee of $238 per year but that the Transport Workers Union wants to charge a bargaining service fee of $400 a year. I understand that membership fees can be much higher than that; they can be in the $350 range for some unions. In February, according to news reports, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ruled in favour of a $500 service fee proposed by the Electrical Trades Union. That is a lot of money for the average Aussie worker, so what is the bottom line? There are about 7.6 million employees in Australia— that is, employees eligible to be in unions if they so choose—of whom 2.5 million choose to be a union member, according to the ACTU web site. That leaves 5.2 million Australian workers who are not union members. If we take from the 2.5 million union members on average union fees of $250 per head per annum, it would generate $625 million per year in revenue to the union movement. If the 5.2 million workers who are non-unionised are coerced into paying a $500 bargaining fee, it will produce revenue of $2.6 billion. Even $1 billion is a lot of buying power. With multibillionaire unions at stake, we can see why human rights are being flushed down the unions' drain. 
There is a lot of money at stake here. Just taking Australian workplace agreements and looking at the revenue question, about 10 per cent of the 150,000 agreements already signed have been struck without union involvement. That 10 per cent at $500 each would generate revenue to the unions worth $7.5 million. These agreements are being signed at the rate of 5,000 a month, so that would be $2.5 million a month. That is akin to having your own printing press to print money, except that the money printed will come out of the take-home pay of Australian workers. Australian workers should be aware that, if ever the principle of compulsory bargaining fees were enshrined in practice, they would lead the field in regular and frequent upward adjustments.
The compulsory bargaining fees that the unions and the ALP are trying to entrench are nothing more than compulsory unionism by the back door. They are also a regressive and camouflaged form of taxation imposed by the unions and flowing straight into union coffers. Incredibly, this thinly disguised tax is being proposed by those who cry crocodile tears in this place over the GST and by those who have spent a fortune in union membership fees and in advertising campaigns, crying wolf over the GST and the new tax system. Unions are forced to resort to the device of imposing bargaining fees, because most of the work force does not believe they get value for money from the unions. That is why they do not join unions anymore. For one thing, most of the work force does not like the constellation of minority protest groups upon which the unions spend their money. Most of the work force does not like the way some powerful unions raise money or exercise their power. Industrial action can cost industry heaps, and some businesses give in to industrial intimidation rather than commit commercial suicide.
We have all read of this kind of corruption in some industries, with bribes, secret commissions, standover tactics and gratuitous strikes. I read in the Financial Review of 28 May this year that 56 per cent of the complaints from all building workplaces to the Office of the Employment Advocate in the past five years have been on the issue of freedom of association. That is the very issue at stake in this bill and it is an indication of the support in the work force. The Financial Review report goes on to say that evidently some union organisers are in regular receipt of builders' bribes of up to $140,000 a year, and gifts of property. In the Daily Telegraph of 26 May, there is another report arising from the Office of the Employment Advocate, saying that sometimes union officials force builders to use contractors nominated by the officials and in some cases these companies are run by ex-union officials. In the light of these reports, is it any wonder that a majority of the work force have a conscientious objection to paying any money to a union, on whatever pretext? Is it any wonder that the membership of unions has declined so steeply in recent years?
Before this government had begun to put its industrial relations reforms in place, union membership had begun to fall from over half to a quarter of the work force. This fall occurred against a background where the work force had increased in size by 800,000 workers since March 1996, with more than 400,000 being in full-time jobs. The answer of the union movement to this problem is to try and make union membership compulsory and enforceable by law. Compulsory union fees, which this bill opposes, is about preventing the unions enforcing their self-appointed right to enforce a monopoly over workplace bargaining. It is about preventing de facto compulsory union membership for every Australian worker.
The principle behind the government's industrial relations policy is employers and employees talking to one another and reaching agreement, rather than employers and union controllers doing deals over long lunches and behind the employees' backs, and ripping off commissions from the workers. It is about giving employees control over their own earnings. Above all, it is about upholding the universal human right that no-one should be compelled, either directly or indirectly, to belong to an association, which in this case is an industrial union. As every Australian knows, this is an election year and I say to every Australian, especially to every Australian worker: be very mindful of the role of the Labor Party in their strong support for this union initiative. This would be a very tricky effective tax upon Australian workers. We all should be in absolutely no doubt that, if Labor found themselves in government, the unions would be granted the power to impose this very tricky tax—otherwise known as a compulsory union fee— upon every Australian worker and that employers all over Australia would also wear the impost of having to collect this tricky union tax. Every Australian should be alarmed at this union initiative and every Australian should be alarmed at Labor's support for this initiative. I support this bill and strongly commend it to the House.

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—In rising to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001, I say that I do not think that members opposite are in much of a position to talk about tricky taxes. Tricky taxes are a specialty of the Liberal and National parties. When it comes to talking about mandates and people in workplaces being forced to do something which they might not like to do—that is the suggestion from members on the other side—we should put that in context. The context in which people should think about that is the fact that this government did not win 50 per cent of the vote at the last federal election, but they still saw fit to introduce the goods and services tax. 
Interestingly, as it stands under the proposal, this bargaining fee, so-called, would be applied only in those situations where it was approved by a valid majority of workers at the workplace. Given that non-union members also get to vote in that decision making, that is not a bad system at all. It is certainly a fairer system than the situation we saw in relation to the goods and services tax, where, with around 49 per cent of the vote— not a clear majority, not a valid majority— this government saw fit to apply its fee, its goods and services tax, to everyone in this country. We all know how unfair that taxation system has been. 
It is nearly one year since the goods and services tax was introduced. What are the results of that in the electorate of McMillan? Unfortunately, the direct result of the goods and services tax has been the closure of the Givoni clothing factory in Moe. As people know, Moe has particularly high unemployment, around 18 per cent, and these 42 people at the Givoni clothing factory have now lost their jobs. Just to make clear the cause and effect, I will quote Mr Brandon Givoni, who is the chief executive officer of the Givoni clothing company. He is reported in the La Trobe Valley Express of this week as follows:
According to Givoni chief executive officer Brandon Givoni, the decision for the closure and the reductions was made by management and attributed to the post-GST downturn in apparel sales and the continuing pressure of the trend to source finished garments offshore—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: whilst all of these issues are indeed relevant, they are not relevant to the bill that is before us. 
 (Hon. D.G.H. Adams)—The honourable member may be building a case in relation to people being made redundant and company failure, so I will allow him to continue.
—This bill is about workplace relations, and I am talking about workplace relations. There is probably nothing more important in the area of workplace relations than when people lose their jobs. In this case, they are losing their jobs at the Givoni clothing factory in Moe as a result of the GST. That has been made very clear indeed. In fact, Brandon Givoni goes on to say: 
The effects of the GST and resultant slower retail sales have had a major adverse effect on our business and others in the sector. A number of businesses, both at a retail and manufacturing level, have basically failed due to these factors.
There is nothing more basic, when you talk about workplace relations, than when people lose their jobs as a result of a plant closure or a business having to shed staff in a restructure because that business is not doing well. These are the circumstances that we must consider in regard to this legislation.  
We must consider this legislation in the context of people in high unemployment areas like the Latrobe Valley fighting hard to hang onto their jobs—to keep what they have got. In that context, you need to have good negotiation, you need to have tough negotiation, so if things go bad you are able to hang onto your entitlements and get some sort of justice out of the workplace relations system. In places like the Latrobe Valley you do not have much choice when you lose your job. You do not have a great many options. This is why in the context of workplace relations we have to make sure that workers are given the opportunity to negotiate with some strength. In the Latrobe Valley we have seen a number of situations emerge where those negotiations which are effective and which protect the rights of workers and provide them with some security are those negotiations which involve unions. That has been our experience. 
When a union is out there doing the work on behalf of people who are often very low paid, like those workers who lost their jobs at the Givoni clothing factory, it is not unreasonable for other people who are perhaps not in the union to be expected to pay a small fee. As I mentioned before, these people will only be expected to pay this fee when it is approved by a valid majority of workers at the workplace, as approved by the Australian Industrial Relation Commission, and union and non-union members get to have a vote in making that decision. I do not think it is an unreasonable request at all. In the type of electorate and district that I represent, we understand the importance of having a strong negotiating position when you are a worker in some companies. It has been our experience that there are some companies out there now who are prepared to do everything they can to take away workers' entitlements and job security and the conditions for which they have fought so hard for many years to get in the first place. We know how important that is.
We have the case of G & K O'Connor in Pakenham, where we have seen barbaric behaviour by the company in its approach to its work force. It locked out its work force for more than nine months—the longest lockout in Australian history since the Depression. This is the type of industrial relations context that we are seeing more and more of under the industrial relations legislation introduced by this government. It is lowest common denominator stuff, and in that type of environment you need to have good workplace representation. You need to have people on your side. So when the likes of G & K O'Connor meatworks employ all of their thugs, all of their lawyers, all of the resources of the department of workplace relations and all of their effort to try to casualise the work force to try to take away people's hard-won rights and conditions, then you have something to fight back with; you are not on your own. You are not by yourself. 
Mr Deputy Speaker, you know yourself—probably better than most people in this chamber—how hard it is in those meatworks. It is a tough place, a tough industry, and you have to have decent conditions because things can go awry very quickly—you lose a finger, you lose a hand, you get yourself a disease; you get any of those things that are associated with that tough industry. There is a risk, quite often, of suffering an injury in those workplaces. 
Thankfully in most workplaces in the meat industry there have been enormous steps forward over the past five, 10 and 15 years in improving occupational health and safety. But that does not mean that we need to become complacent, or we need to assume that that has been attributed to progress. It is not progress; it is agitation, organisation and collective action being taken by the workers in those workplaces. That is what has led to that progress. We need to make sure that workers in these types of environments continue to have a strong voice, continue to be in a strong bargaining position when it comes to dealing with the likes of G & K O'Connor. 
These people have involved themselves in thuggish acts. There was a substantial program on the Sunday program on Channel 9 a couple of months ago in which we saw substantial allegations made against this company and its use of hired thugs to try to intimidate and stand over people to try to create situations where people would either resign from the workplace or be sacked after being encouraged to involve themselves in illegal activity. It really is amazing to imagine that we have a company like G & K O'Connor involving itself in those types of operations. But we do, and that is the point. This is why we need to have strong unions in these workplaces, strong workplace representation, so that people in these circumstances can have a strong voice and stand against the type of behaviour that the likes of G & K O'Connor are involved in right now.  
It is worth noting that this is not just my view. Justice Spender of the Federal Court when this matter was before him referred to the antics of G & K O'Connor as a `baseball bat lockout', and being `like Pinkertons Incorporated'. For those of us with a bit of an understanding of industrial relations, we know what that means. Pinkertons are, of course, that notorious American union-busting, thuggish company which was involved in a number of murders in the United States, a number of vicious attacks on unionists and a number of illegal activities in pursuing the objective of destroying collective organisation of the work force over there. Justice Spender is not a stupid man. He understands exactly what he was describing and, in making that comment he made very, very plain what he thought about the behaviour of the likes of G & K O'Connor. 
So this is the environment that the federal government has created when it comes to industrial relations. It is lowest common denominator stuff. Their approach has been to strengthen the hands of thuggish employers like G & K O'Connor and, through this legislation, they want to weaken the hands of employees. They want to weaken the hands of workers by taking away the workers' ability to collectively organise to stand against that sort of behaviour. It would be laughable if it was not serious just how naked the objectives of this government are. It is a horrible sight and it is really something that is as transparent as anything can be in the federal parliament. 
So this is the context that we are in. We have a federal government that wants to strengthen the arm of the likes of G & K O'Connor and its behaviour—its use of the lockout, its use of people basically involved in illegal operations to try to entrap workers and to get them sacked. We know that this is the environment that we live in. The workers at Givoni, who are in a high-unemployment area in Moe, who have lost their jobs understand the value of good organisation as well in the workplace. They understand the virtue of having someone in their corner when things do not go right. Those people are concerned about their entitlements—just like a lot of people, unfortunately. 
This is something that seems to characterise the textile, clothing and footwear sector more than any other industry. When companies go under in the textile, clothing and footwear sector, all too often it means that workers who have worked there and toiled and struggled and made sacrifices for the company do not get their proper entitlements. I certainly hope that the company, Givoni, does right by its work force. These people have worked hard for this company and they deserve their full entitlements. For my own part, I will not accept anything less than full entitlements for these people at Givoni, who have worked so hard over so many years for that company. That is my expectation, that is the expectation of the workers and that is the expectation of the union. We would expect Givoni to meet in full its obligations to those 42 workers there, because they do not have much in the way of choice when it comes to finding another job. 
In relation to this legislation more specifically, it presents itself as just one more part of the anti-worker agenda of this government—one more part of the activities that this federal government has involved itself in to try to weaken the position of workers in their negotiations with employers. Unfortunately, whilst so many of us are looking to government for leadership in industrial relations, this government has provided only partisanship. They have provided no opportunity for workers and employers to come together to effect workplace agreements, to provide for negotiation in a sensible and reasonable way that meets workers' objectives in terms of job security and wages and conditions at the same time as meeting employers' wants in terms of productivity improvements and steps forward in terms of workplace flexibility. The federal government has provided no leadership at all in achieving these objectives. It has involved itself as a partisan player in the industrial relations context, which is not what the Australian people want.  
What the Australian people want is for the federal government to encourage discussions and negotiations in good faith. We want to see bargaining in good faith. We do not want to see people move away from the negotiating table and move into the courts of this country and resolve their problems by using industrial relations legislation. We want to see people sit around the table, discuss what can be achieved in terms of meeting workers' objectives and discuss what can be achieved in meeting the company's objectives as well. This is what the Australian people are crying out for. What they get is shocking partisanship. We have some very good examples in my electorate in the Latrobe Valley of two very different approaches of a company's negotiations with its work force. In the case of Yallourn Energy, it has been involved now in a protracted industrial dispute for getting on to two years. It is now in compulsory arbitration. That dispute involved a threatened lockout by that company. It also involved power shortages in the state of Victoria and really did enormous damage to the industrial reputation of the Latrobe Valley. 
By comparison, just 15 minutes up the road from Yallourn Energy at the Hazelwood Power plant, they have been able to secure a new enterprise bargaining agreement in nine weeks. New CEO Ken Teasdale and the people from the single bargaining unit sat down around the table and talked about the company's objectives and what the workers wanted to see in the EB, and they came to an agreement in nine weeks. There were no lock-outs, no threats of lock-outs, no antagonism, no hostility, no industrial action and, importantly for the state of Victoria, no power blackouts. A good outcome was achieved at Hazelwood Power. 
At Yallourn Energy we have seen two years of industrial disputation, two years of hostility and two years of eroding goodwill between workers and the people who manage that company. What has it achieved? Nothing. The losses to the company have been enormous, the workers feel awful about the circumstances and morale is at an all-time low—and all this because the company was determined to get 100 per cent of its agenda. The company wanted to have it all its way. Up the road, Hazelwood Power was prepared to have a negotiation and achieve a good outcome for the company and for the work force. 
Cooperation such as occurred between Hazelwood Power and its work force is exactly the sort of thing we want to encourage in the Latrobe Valley. We do not want a reputation as an industrial relations hot spot. Many of us worked very hard throughout the 1990s to turn around the image of the Latrobe Valley being an industrial relations hot spot. Unfortunately, the actions of Yallourn Energy have contributed, through widespread exposure in the state and national newspapers, to presenting the Latrobe Valley as an industrial relations hot spot once again. People in the Latrobe Valley are practically minded. We want to see agreements reached. We want to see cooperation encouraged. I appeal to the parties involved in the Yallourn Energy dispute to cooperate, to come to the bargaining table and to try again to find an agreement, rather than having a situation where someone gets 100 per cent of their agenda or nothing. 
We need to see more cooperation in industrial relations. That is what people want to see. In places such as the Latrobe Valley, where people have struggled for many years and gone through hardship, we understand how important it is to have a strong voice for workers, and unions have provided that strong voice for many years. It is not an unreasonable thing to expect people who benefit from trade union activity to pay a small fee towards that effort. (Time expired)
Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—The theme of the contribution to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001 from the member for McMillan was that the government is anti-worker. Those fair-minded people in the gallery this afternoon might like to consider this. If the government is so anti-worker, why is it that the tremendous strides in reducing unemployment are not recognised by the Australian Labor Party? In the 13 years of Labor in government it created 27,000 new jobs. In its first five years this government has created 825,000 new jobs. That is not bad for the workers of Australia. Workers would really have to ask themselves why they would go back to the Australian Labor Party when the general election is called if that is its record in reducing unemployment. 
What about interest rates? Under the Labor Party in government what did we see? I think interest rates reached 17 per cent. They are now down to a little over six per cent. What does that mean to the ordinary worker who has a home mortgage? What would workers prefer? Would they prefer interest rates of around six per cent or interest rates of 17 per cent? I do not think there is any doubt. I do not think that shows a government that is anti-worker.
What about wages? In the 13 years of Labor in government real wages fell. Of course, under the current government real wages have risen. Why would workers go back to the Australian Labor Party when it has that kind of a record on wages? Of course, it is the same situation in relation to disputes. Industrial disputation has fallen under the workplace relations provisions of this government. We have a very good record and we are certainly not anti-worker.
One of the very definite achievements of the Howard government has been the commitment to improve our workplace relations. We have been building a system that aims to magnify, to join together, common interests between employer and employee. Rather than taking the opposition's path of class ideology and conflict, we want to make workplace agreements the primary focus of the system, allowing small businesses and their employees the right to choice and the flexibility to decide what agreements are best suited to their own localities, their own work forces, their own lifestyles and their own family responsibilities, free from centralised, industry-wide, rigid award regulation. Surely that is sensible. Surely that is in the interests of the workers of Australia. Certainly, I do not see that as being anti-worker.
The government's Workplace Relations Act makes provisions to prohibit compulsory unionism. That has worked very well. There are still some warts in how it operates in workplaces and maybe some coercion, but in general it is working very well. Of course, we have seen a reduction in the number of people who are members of unions over the last five years. It is quite frustrating sometimes to sit in the chamber and listen to members opposite as they blindly follow the unions that they owe. I think that is a key point. In recent years an emerging trend has been identified whereby some trade union leaders have attempted to coerce non-union employees into joining a union by making a demand that all non-unionists pay a service fee on account of union participation in agreement negotiation in their workplace. The coercive nature of the compulsory union fee demand is highlighted by the fact that it is typically made without the consent of the relevant employee and may not even be made until after the so-called services are rendered. The quantum of that fee is of the order of $500.  
What are the underlying issues in this matter? Really, there are two. First, the unions see this as nothing more than a device to get more members. They do this by setting their service fee marginally above the union fee so that there is an incentive for employees to join a union rather than pay the service fee. I think unions have been concerned that their relevance has been falling. The reason it has been falling is that they forgot who their customers were, who they were supposed to be representing. That is why their relevance began to wane. 
The second underlying issue is that the Australian Labor Party sees this as a cash cow. The more union members there are, the more dollars that will flow into ALP campaign funds. That is the issue. It is sad that employees who do not want to be members of a union are forced to join a trade union so that their membership fees can go to the Australian Labor Party, whose philosophies they oppose. If ever there were an injustice, that is it. We have heard members on the opposite side claiming that the government's legislation we are debating this afternoon is an injustice. How do they explain the injustice of an employee being forced to contribute, through a union, to a political party that they do not want to contribute to? That is disgraceful.
I refer to a point made by a number of opposition speakers that nobody is being forced and that this is a free vote in a workplace. There is something those members did not say. What they do not tell you is that in workplaces where there is militant unionism about 80 per cent of the workplace is unionised. So what do they do? They have a free vote. Some 80 per cent are unionists; 20 per cent are not. The unionists vote yes and the non-unionists vote no, but of course the non-unionists have no hope of winning that so-called free vote, because it is not a free vote. It could not be called a free vote by any stretch of the imagination. Freedom of association does not work in that instance. That 20 per cent who are not members of the union are denied their democratic right. The Labor Party has to answer that claim, but I do not think it can, because it is clear that those 20 per cent are outweighed in numbers by militant unionism.
I notice that in the course of the debate this afternoon the Labor Party has been very cocky. It says, `What's the point of having this debate? We know that the Democrats are not going to support it. We know that the Labor Party won't support it in the Senate. The bill's going to get knocked down, so why are we having this debate? We're going to beat you.' It is not so. This issue will come up in another place. I will give the House a scenario to consider and then tell it how it will come up in another place. What happens if an employee refuses to pay the union service fee? Of course, the union then goes to the employer and says, `You have to make your employee pay or he has to face disciplinary action.' The employee might then say, `I'm not going to pay. I don't want to support the Australian Labor Party through a trade union.' Is the employer then going to say, `There's the door; you're sacked'? Is the disciplinary action that the union seeks the sacking of an employee who refuses to pay the service fee? What a terrible position to put the employer in and what a terrible position to put the employee in. It is most unfair.
There is a fundamental rule of law in this country that a person cannot be signed to an agreement against their will, yet that is what the union is trying to do. It is trying to say: `You can stand aside and we'll do the negotiation. We'll tell you what you can do, whether you like it or not.' There is a thing called the Trade Practices Act that says that that kind of action is unlawful. If the Labor Party and the Democrats vote this down, the Trade Practices Act will be invoked and the matter will be dealt with in that way. 
A precedent will also be established if this bill does not get through the parliament. Just think of all of the other scenarios where a group works on an issue and then wants to charge a service fee to somebody else who benefits. Let us take the Australian Consumers Association magazine Choice, a magazine which does a lot of good work on behalf of consumers right across the country, giving them advice on what they should buy. Would they then say to all the consumers of Australia, `We're going to charge you a service fee because we've done the work and incurred the cost'? Is that what is going to happen? Would we see chambers of commerce around Australia, which are advocates for their community, charging a service fee for everybody who is not a member of that chamber of commerce? Would we see peak development bodies like Townsville Enterprise Ltd, which is supported by major companies and government as the peak development body in the region, charging a service fee for everything it does for the North Queensland community?
Would we see employer groups which work on behalf of their employees charging a service fee to the employees? Would we see employer advocates who work in the industrial relations system in this country charging a service fee to businesses who are not members of those industry associations? Would it get down to the level where progress associations, which do good work in our communities, charge a service fee to all of the ratepayers of the community? If this bill does not pass, that would be the precedent set if this arrangement is allowed to stand. The government is determined not to allow this arrangement to stand. We are determined that workers should have freedom of association. We are determined that each individual worker in this country should have free choice as to whether or not they want to be members of a union. That is a fundamental view, yet the Labor Party says that the government is anti-worker. I do not think that follows. I would have thought that allowing a worker to have absolute freedom of choice is good for every Australian.
This bill makes it clear that the Workplace Relations Act should prohibit non-consensual fee demands. Although we had planned that the current terms of the act would prescribe such provisions in certified agreements, the fresh activism of trade unions in advancing these demands and the legal uncertainty now cast over the issue make it a persuasive case for specific legislative action. That is the bill we are considering in the parliament this afternoon, and I strongly support the bill.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I rise to speak in the second reading debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001 and to urge this House to oppose this legislation. In doing so, I would like to answer some of the clear factual errors and astonishing remarks that have been made by members on the other side during this debate. As this debate unfolded this morning, one would have thought it would be best described as a very ill-informed debate. I think we really need to get some of the facts right. However, it should not surprise members in this House that we would have an uninformed debate in this place on industrial relations in circumstances where the debate is being led by a Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business who clearly knows very little about his portfolio.
When this minister first made an outing as the newly appointed workplace relations minister, who can forget that his first contribution as minister was to talk about the system of ambit claiming in the Industrial Relations Commission, a system of which he said:
... this kind of behaviour brings the system into disrepute and it is the job of officialdom generally to massage away this kind of perversity.
That was one of the first statements he made as the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. Clearly, at that point no-one had briefed this minister on the nature of constitutional power for the Commonwealth government in the area of industrial relations and the fact that ambit claiming—the process by which unions serve logs of claims to create an interstate industrial dispute—is one of the technical features of our system flowing from the limited nature of power that the Commonwealth has in the industrial relations area. So we have a minister who, from the first day he ever uttered a statement about industrial relations, clearly showed that he did not even have a school economics kind of understanding of the nature of the portfolio. From some of his contributions in this House, one suspects that very little has improved in the intervening period. 
Apart from the minister's difficulties in dealing with this portfolio and this bill, some members who have made contributions to the debate this morning are also clearly struggling to come to grips with the details of this legislation and what it means. The member for Hughes gave a contribution about the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights. All I can say to that is that I concur and good on her, but that ought to be a speech that she gives to the party room of the Liberal Party rather than in this place, given that the articulated view by the Howard government of the United Nations and its human rights committee system is that it does not want to be involved in it, at least at the level that Australia used to be involved in it. So we have seen displayed this morning the kind of laughable conundrum where a member of the government came in here spouting a lot of moral cant about the United Nations human rights regulations—a member of a government that clearly does not accept the nature of that system and has sought to downgrade Australia's participation in it.
—Including the ILO.
—Including the ILO, as I am reminded by the shadow minister at the table. Perhaps even more breathtaking than the member for Hughes clearly forgetting the Howard government's opposition to the United Nations human rights committee system was the contribution by the member for Moreton, who decided that this piece of legislation was the newly created face of communist totalitarianism in our world. Clearly no-one had explained to him that a comparable system exists in the United States of America—yes, this system exists in the home of the brave, the land of the free, where the Prime Minister is going in September to get some tips on conservative party campaigning.
So we have seen the member for Moreton come in here and decide that this legislation really is the face of some sort of new communist order. If that is right, I trust that the Prime Minister is going to explain that to President George Bush when he meets him in September. I suspect that the Prime Minister is not going to explain that to President George Bush in September because the person who is wrong about this is of course the member for Moreton, who clearly has not understood this legislation, clearly has not done any research in relation to it and does not understand anything about industrial relations systems in Western democracies. I suggest that the member for Moreton might like to do a little bit of research.
Constantly in this place we are urged to embrace the labour market flexibilities that pervade the industrial relations system in the United States. Certainly the former Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, constantly came in here to berate the opposition and say that the United States had a great system, a freer system and a system that led to better employment outcomes. That has been the line put by this government. I have not heard Minister Abbott say any of those things, but then he talks about his portfolio very infrequently. Perhaps that is why I have not heard him on those questions. The line from this government is that the United States model is one to aspire to. If we were going to embrace the United States model, we would be opposing this bill; we would be embracing a system that allowed levies on non-union members who have benefited from collective agreements. 
I will come back a little later to the details of how the system in the United States works, but at this stage I would like to go through a few of the facts in this debate to try to rebalance where we have been this morning, which is around the world and back again but nowhere near the foundations of this bill. Fact No. 1 that needs to be acknowledged in this debate is that unions are good for workers and good for workers' wage outcomes. That is an undeniable truth. If anybody in this House is a bit confused about that question, I refer them to the August 2000 Australian Bureau of Statistics publication entitled Employee earnings, benefits and trade union membership. You do not need to be a statistician, an accountant or an economist to flip through that publication to see clearly displayed that the wage outcomes of unionists are better than the wage outcomes of all employees. On average, union members earn more than the full class of employees. If we turn up the table entitled `Mean weekly earnings in main job of populations by state or territory of usual residence', we find that the mean weekly earnings in the main job of all employees is $651 a week, whereas the mean weekly earnings for employees who are members of trade unions is $733 a week. That is absolutely rock solid and clearly displayed: unions are good for the wage outcomes of workers. 
Fact No. 2 is that when unions achieve outcomes for workers, which under the current industrial relations system is generally done by way of collective agreement, then the benefits achieved through those agreements flow to all workers covered by that agreement, whether or not they are members of the union. Under our industrial relations system, it does not have to be like that. It would be possible to make a collective agreement where the wages and conditions outcomes within the agreement flowed only to union members. Historically in the Australian industrial relations system, unions have not gone down that path and we do not need to think about it too long to see why that is the case. Clearly, if unions went down the path of making collective agreements exclusive to union members, that would send a clear price signal to employers in the workplace that non-union members are cheaper labour. So, if there is a wage differential between unionists covered by the agreement and non-unionists not covered by the agreement, a profit maximising employer making a rational decision would obviously prefer to employ non-unionists. If that employer had unionists within their work force, then they would seek over time to persuade those persons to no longer be with the union because that would give the employer a cheaper wage outcome.
If the minister is briefed—if he is not briefed when he replies to this bill he could say anything—when he replies to this bill, I am sure that he will say something like discriminating against unionists is illegal and a person who was not hired because they were a unionist would have an ability to take that up as a matter of law. We all know that that might be right as a matter of law, but we also all know that in workplaces around Australia employers in a variety of subtle ways can send messages to employees and to prospective employees about whether or not the employer would prefer that person to be in the union and that those signals are sent in a way which makes it completely impossible for the worker involved to found a legal case on the basis of that conduct. We all know that that very subtle manoeuvring happens in workplaces. If unions started on a stream which sent a clear price signal to employers that union labour was more expensive, I think we would find employers manoeuvring to employ non-union labour.
What do unions, who are good for wage outcomes, then do? Of course they do what they currently do under our system: they negotiate collective agreements, the benefits of which flow to everybody covered by the agreement irrespective of their union membership. That ends up meaning that you have a free-rider problem: you have non-unionists who get the benefits of the wage and conditions outcomes negotiated by unions and consequently financed by union members, but the free-riders—the non-unionists—get access to those benefits as well. It seems to be a matter of fairness—nothing more, nothing less—that if you are getting free access to a good, meaning you get a benefit where others are effectively supporting it— so some people are putting in money and others are not—there should be a mechanism to square that up so that everybody supports the effort being made. That would simply be a fair outcome. That is what some unions have sought to do. 
Faced with the free-rider problem, the unions have said that the fair thing to do here is for everybody who gets the benefit of the advantage of the collective agreement of the new wage outcome, of the new conditions outcome, to in some way support obtaining that outcome and that that should be done through the payment by non-unionists of some sort of fee which supports the making of that agreement. If that proposition were put in any setting other than the industrial relations setting and if that proposition were put about any other service than the provision of industrial services, then everybody in this House would say, `Sure, that sounds right, everybody who gets a benefit should pay.' Indeed, our whole governmental structures rely on that. We all pay council rates, irrespective of whether or not we put the bin out every week. We do not have people saying, `I should get a deduction on my council rates because I put out less rubbish than my neighbour,' or, `I don't drive on the road as frequently,' or, `I don't walk on the beach, which is cleaned by the council, as frequently as someone else.' No, we all proceed quite happily from the proposition that everybody who gets a benefit in some way pays for that benefit. The proposition of unions collecting money from non-unionists to support collective agreement outcomes is no more than that proposition. So it is not the kind of insidious, evil proposition that it has been characterised as during this debate; it is just a simple matter of fairness. That simple matter of fairness and the need for that kind of system has been historically recognised in the United States industrial relations system, which is always being held up to us as a model to follow. 
I refer members of this House to an article on this question which they might find illuminating. It was published in the Australian Journal of Labour Law in May 2001 and entitled `Agency shops in Australia, compulsory bargaining fees, union insecurity and the rights of free riders'. It is a piece published by Graham Orr, who is at the School of Law at Griffith University. Graham Orr details in this article, amongst other things, the experience in America with these kinds of agreements. He does note, of course, that these kinds of agreements, where non-union members are asked to make a financial contribution to the making of collective agreements, do not exist only in America. He refers to Canada and South Africa as other countries that had them as a feature of their industrial relations system. In this article he predominantly refers to the American example.
Of course, people who have looked at the American industrial relations system would know that the foundation of it is the Taft-Hartley act of 1947. That is the basis, if you like, of American industrial relations law. That act outlawed what are referred to as pre-entry closed shops. That is, it made it unlawful for a union and an employer to agree that the employer would not hire someone who was not a unionist. So there could not be a pre-entry closed shop. The Taft-Hartley provision, though, did allow post-entry closed shops, and it was possible for unions and employers to make an arrangement that after the expiration of a period of hiring it would become necessary for the worker involved to become a member of the union. So post-entry closed shops were allowed by the Taft-Hartley legislation.
As I think is fairly commonly known, the subsequent history of judicial review in America of the meaning of the Taft-Hartley legislation undermined that ability of unions to negotiate post-entry closed shops. There is a long and somewhat convoluted legal history involved in that. But that left unions in America with the same sort of problem that unions in Australia have. That is, they were organising for and getting collective agreement outcomes for mixed workplaces— workplaces that had some union members and some non-union members. They had, to use the terminology I used earlier, a classic free-rider problem. Faced with the free-rider problem, the unions sought to negotiate what are referred to as union security, or in some cases union insecurity, agreements. Those agreements were that there would be some sort of fee levied—exactly the situation we are debating in this House today—on non-unionists who benefited from a collective agreement struck by a union in a workplace. That was the American unions solution to the free-rider problem. 
That was upheld as a completely valid approach in the 1950s in a Supreme Court decision entitled Radio Officers Union v. National Labour Relations Board. In that case the Supreme Court held that, although congress had recognised the validity of union concerns about free-riders and the right of a majority to bargain for union security at a particular shop, it had intended to prevent utilisation of union security agreements for any other purpose than to compel payment of union dues and fees. So the decision upheld that, whilst a union could not enter a union security agreement which required the payment of union fees direct, it could enter a union security agreement which required the payment by non-members of some form of fee to defray the costs of having entered into a collective agreement. 
That is the first in a fairly long line of cases, all of which dealt with these questions. There was the decision of National Labour Relations Board v. General Motors Corporation in 1963, which dealt with what were being referred to then as agency shop arrangements, which is the same thing—that is, requiring some payment of moneys. Then there was the Retail Clerks International Association decision a little bit later. It also upheld an arrangement for defraying the costs in connection with the union's legal obligations and responsibilities as the exclusive bargaining agent of the employees in the unit. That decision went on to find that the fees had to be capped so that they were no greater than the actual union dues. 
So we have this long history of regulation and court decisions in the States where the United States courts have said that they understand the free-rider problem and they understand that unions should be able to get some contribution from non-unionists in order to support the making of collective agreements. If this bill ultimately is not passed by the parliament, what we would have in Australia is a system where such agreements could exist, because such agreements do exist now. Such an agreement was first struck by the ETU in Victoria, where a collective agreement was upheld which required a fee to be paid by non-unionists who had benefited from the agreement.
It may be said that that kind of system might require more regulation than commission decisions to date have given us, but of course we are in a situation where the commission has not fully explored and ventilated this issue. Instead of allowing a body of industrial relations law to develop around it, the Howard government has rushed into this place with this bill. This bill is ill-conceived. It is unnecessary. It is not a bill that will advance industrial relations in Australia. It is not a bill that is required to make an industrial relations system work. The American system works and allows for the payment of these kinds of fees. All in all, we think this bill should be opposed.

"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—I acknowledge the contribution of the member for Lalor, her long involvement in the trade union movement and her well-argued case for a lost cause. Obviously she supports the closed shop, but those on this side of the House are arguing vigorously against that proposition. I note that the member for Throsby is also a very strong supporter, in view of the background he gave into the freeloader concept, of the position that non-members of the union should pay and support the union. The member for McMillan, on the other hand, is blaming the GST for every possible problem that faces Australia. I suppose he would blame the GST for the fact that he did not come into this House and vote against the RFA legislation. That is the type of argument he put forward, as the shadow minister at the table would understand. 
This bill is a fundamental argument by those of us on this side of the House against the collective spirit of those opposite in relation to freedom of association. Most Australians agree that people are entitled to join a union, and I respect that right. However, people also have the right not to join a union. During the 1980s I very strongly argued the case, along with the Prime Minister, that in Australia, with its long history of industrial relations, workers and employees should have the right not to join a union when confronted in the workplace by a no ticket, no start syndrome. As we all know, that is prevalent on the building sites in Victoria. There is no way people can work on those building sites without a union ticket. We on this side of the House introduced legislation in 1996 supporting the ability of hardworking Australian workers not to join a union because we knew that since 1904 there had been a preference clause for union members—that is, they received preferable treatment, they were considered in the award fixing process, because they were members of unions. We had a long tradition that it was important to join a union and be part of that collective set of arrangements.
A proposition has emerged that those people who are members of the union are now demanding that non-unionists pay a service fee. The argument goes that union members have paid for the negotiated outcomes of improved wages and conditions, including those of the so-called `freeloaders', as referred to by the member for Throsby. This position has been reflected in the headlines. The Age of 14 February carried an article entitled `Unions target free riders: non-union labour faces service fee'. The Financial Review of 13 February carried an article entitled `Non-union workers face fees for pay rises'. A more thoughtful article in the Sydney Morning Herald carried the headline `Why it's fair to make freeloaders pay for their due', an article written by Mr Michael Costa, Secretary of the New South Wales Labor Council. Michael Costa makes it quite clear what the argument is on the other side of the parliament, and states further:
Non-union workers who happily accept pay rises won by others should be prepared to help meet the cost. 
He goes on in his argument to make the following couple of comments: 
Sometimes members of the trade union will impose bans or strike to reinforce their claim. 
He is mooting that to bring about coercive action. He continues:
In such cases, trade union members bear a direct cost through wages forgone. 
...			...			...
Critics say this amounts to compulsory unionism. Wrong. 
I am saying that is quite right. He continues:
The non-members do not have to join anything, just pay for a service from which they benefit. 
This is compulsory unionism by the back door. We have a problem in that the ACTU are in some doubt as to where they might stand. I quote the following from Workplace Intelligence of April 2001: 
The ACTU 2000 congress endorsed a broad policy of fee for service bargaining, but the policy has left individual unions with the discretion to pursue the policy or not. 
So the ACTU has some concern about whether they can philosophically and within the law pursue this policy. Some members are aggressively pursuing this policy to get a fee for service; others are being a little bit more careful about that. 
This situation of attacking the freeloaders was challenged in the Industrial Relations Commission. The commission member, in giving his finding, said that he considered them to be coercive, and I will mention that again in a minute. But we have a situation where a group of mainly small employers were not able to withstand the pressure of these bigger unions. What was being suggested was that the fee be one per cent of the annual income, or $500. The unions concerned were the communications and electrical and other trade unions—the ETU. The fee was for new employees. This whole situation was challenged by the Employment Advocate, who in fact is a supporter of both the workers and the employers and acts in an independent manner. The matter was sent to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The Employment Advocate, under a technical ruling, made an application to remove these provisions and claimed them to be objectionable under section 298Z of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The clause could be found in the Accurate Factory Maintenance Labour Hire Enterprise Agreement. I will read this particular agreement, for the information of the House, in terms of the bargaining agent's fee. The agreement read as follows:  
The company shall advise all employees prior to commencing work for the company that a `Bargaining Agents' Fee of 1% of the employees gross annual income or $500 per annum which ever is the greater is payable to the ETU on or prior to the 16th December each year. 
The relevant employee to which this clause shall apply shall pay the `Bargaining Agents Fee' to the ETU in advance on a pro-rata basis for any time which the employee is employed by the company. By arrangement with the ETU this can be done in two instalments throughout the year. 
The company is not responsible for the collection of such fee. 
If ever I have seen it, this is compulsory unionism. They are saying that it is just a fee. They are saying that it will cost people $500 and that they have to pay twice yearly. If that is not a clear indication of what the real thrust of it is, I do not know what is. 
The Employment Advocate challenged this situation. Vice President McIntyre, having viewed all the evidence, made a fairly lengthy statement. I will just quote one of his comments: 
I agree, as submitted by the applicant, that subclause 14.3 should be looked at in a realistic and practical way. In my opinion, it is there to persuade new employees to join, or to coerce new employees into joining, the ETU. The minimum fee of $500 per annum is substantially more than the ETU membership fee. Further there is little doubt, I think, that the ETU would waive the fee in respect of persons who are or become members. The obligation to pay the fee is therefore unlikely to be required by the ETU of anyone who is a member of the ETU. 
There we have it from an independent person from the Industrial Relations Commission. As the shadow minister at the table would understand—he has been a strong supporter of the centralised wage system all of his life—we have the umpire saying in a clear situation—
—The member for Bendigo would understand this quite well, too.
—You always go union bashing when you are on the back foot.
—We are absolutely on the front foot. The member has been in the trade union movement. He understands quite clearly that the independent umpire has put it clearly on the record that this is a coercive situation. 
The Labor Party are remaining fairly silent on this. They are not too sure whether they are going to support this position or whether they are going to remain silent like they do on most other policies, because they have not got any policies. The member for Bendigo understands that. They have no policies on any issue at all. In this area that is close to their heart they are in a bit of trouble. The ALP industrial relations `policy', adopted last year, in clause 44 reads: 
The legitimate role of trade unions and their right to organise, to take action on behalf of their members and on behalf of workers generally and to bargain collectively should be enhanced and recognised and defended. 
So the question is whether the federal Leader of the Opposition has the ticker to oppose these fees or whether he is in fact prepared to see that this is a coercive situation. Even his own good friend the Premier of Western Australia is on the public record—and the member for Bendigo should note this—in an article in the West Australian of 7 June headed `Gallop attacks $400 fee for non-union nurses'. What has the Leader of the Opposition, who is in the chamber now, said to his good friend the Premier of Western Australia? The article states:
Dr Gallop said unions should win members on the basis of the services they offered. 
Not through coercion. That is the Premier of Western Australia saying that. Then the Minister for Labour Relations, John Kobelke, said: 
We think unions need to get out and provide services to their members and attract new members on what they can offer. 
I see the shadow minister walking into the chamber. He should hear these words of wisdom. He should listen to the West Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry operations director, Mr Brendan McCarthy, who said that the proposed fee was unethical. He went on to say: 
“In any other form of operation that would be totally outlawed,” he said. “They are saying you have got to pay us regardless of how we have performed and regardless of whether we informed you beforehand. It's just a guise for compulsory unionism.” 
So we have an interesting situation in Western Australia. The West Australian editorial comment titled `Forced unionism in ANF plan' goes on to say: 
In effect, this amounts to a clumsy attempt to achieve compulsory unionism—a denial of the principle of freedom of choice. It would be a more honest (and honourable) course for the ANF to ask itself why nurses choose not to join it, than to continue with its demand for money in a manner that suggests vindictiveness. 
What a surprising situation we have in that Labor state of Western Australia. Another article states `Nurses oppose bargaining fee'. Even their own union is a bit upset about it. It states:
More than 100 nurses have signed a petition against a proposal to charge non-members of the Australian Nursing Federation a $400 fee ... 
So in Western Australia the union's own people do not support this coercive action. The Labor Party do not support it. The shadow minister is a bit ambivalent about it. They will continue to encourage the Democrats to vote against this sensible legislation which gives freedom of choice to individual, hardworking Australians and gives them freedom of choice in the workplace so that the concept of no ticket, no start can be outlawed on building sites in Victoria. This legislation should be passed by this House and passed by the Senate because it is sensible and because it reflects an Australian value of a fair go in the workplace. I strongly support it and would encourage the Democrats and others in the Senate to support the bill also.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, are you aware that the chief of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr David Murray, said yesterday that, although his bank had banked for all Australians to date, `I can tell you on current trends we may have to review that decision in future years if we can't get a fair price for service'?

If my recollection also serves me correctly, it was under the watch of the Leader of the Opposition in government that the process of privatising the Commonwealth Bank was commenced—not a process, incidentally, that we opposed. In fact, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, if it had not been for our support in opposition, it would never have occurred. But, of course, I take the opportunity to remind the Leader of the Opposition that he had two Commonwealth banking policies when he was a minister in the Keating government, and they were completely contradictory. One of those was when one of his colleagues wrote to the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association and promised them, before the 1990 election, that there would be no privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. Without going back to the Australian people for endorsement of a change of policy, the other policy was to decide to proceed with the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank.
Let me say, in relation to the reported remarks of Mr Murray—I use the expression `reported remarks'—that I did not think they were particularly sensible remarks. I think banks do have social obligations. Banks in this country are very stable, they make very big profits, they operate in a very benign economic climate, and they have social obligations. That, incidentally, is a view that I have had for a very long time. I hope that Mr Murray was misquoted, because I think he is a bank executive of very great ability. But I think that everybody who runs a large organisation in this country has social obligations to the more needy in the Australian community. The other observation I would make is that I think that what he was probably saying to the Leader of the Opposition was: if you start interfering too much in the operation of corporations, you will end up producing the wrong result.
Opposition members interjecting—
—Well, I simply remind those who have any recollection of the history of banking policy in this country that there was a time when, in the name of helping the needy, we maintained a regulated interest rate regime in this country. The direct result of that system was that people stopped depositing their money with banks because they could not get a market rate of interest. We had a situation where people could get a loan from the bank only if they took a small loan from the bank and topped it up with what was called `the rest of the cocktail' from a finance company. The point I simply make to the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit opposite is that the best policies to help the needy in the Australian community are policies of low interest rates, low inflation, low taxation, high employment and strong economic growth. Those things, more than regulation, will deliver benefits to the poor in the Australian community. The thing about banking policy of which I am most proud and every man and woman who sits behind me is most proud is the current level of interest rates. When Labor was in office, we had 17 per cent housing interest rates. I take the opportunity again to remind this parliament that the last time the Labor Party held the seat of Aston bank interest rates for housing loans were at 17 per cent. And mortgagors were paying something in the order of $700 or $800 a month more than they are now paying for their mortgages from the Commonwealth Bank and indeed from other banks. The best banking policy is a low interest rate policy, and the best side of politics to deliver a low interest rate policy in this country is the coalition.

"Fahey, John, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—by leave—I move:
That this House censures the Leader of the Opposition for failing to order the renegotiation of the Labor Party's Centenary House leases and depriving the Australian community of $36 million.
Nothing is more evident in public administration in this country today than a building called Centenary House in the parliamentary triangle, a short distance from Parliament House, where there is a lease in existence that has the highest rental per square metre in Australia. That lease is a lease between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian National Audit Office. That government agency was requested to enter into that lease back in 1993. The base rental then was way above the Canberra base rental, the Canberra comparable level, for commercial leased space. But the conditions of that lease required a compound interest rate each year of nine per cent to be added to the lease price. So, year after year, since 1993 through to the present time and through to the conclusion of this lease, there will be an increase in the cost to the taxpayers of this country of a figure in rental terms way above anything in this city, way above anything in the other capital cities, way above the most expensive commercial property lease in Sydney—and way above what any Australian taxpayer would regard as a fair thing. 
What happens to all of this? It is siphoned immediately into the coffers of the Australian Labor Party for purposes of campaigning or otherwise. Maybe they are using it for such things as sending Laurie overseas. It does not matter. What does matter is that this compounds into a figure over the 15-year term of this lease of $36 million more than ought to be a reasonable rental. What we are seeing here is a lease which is a straight-out scandal. We look from time to time to the emerging nations around us. We do not pass judgment, but we wonder how these sorts of things can happen; how public administration could allow the sorts of practices to develop which are not fair to the people of those countries. We never think that that sort of practice could in fact occur here. It has and it is going on right now.
Time and again, the Audit Office have gone to their landlord and said, `Look, this isn't a fair deal. This isn't right. This isn't something that ought to be allowed to continue. Could we please renegotiate this lease in a way that will allow us to pay what could be considered as a reasonable sum of money?' And what happens? It is a dead end time after time. The simple fact is that the Australian Labor Party does not want to let the Australian taxpayers off the hook. It wants to tighten the noose in the rental that is paid, so that the Australian Labor Party can be a beneficiary of this scandalous lease. This will continue on under the terms of this lease for some time to come.
What does it mean? It means that a rental that started off at $367.95 per square metre in 1993, before you took into account parking, has now grossed up with parking to $717 per square metre per annum. When you multiply that by the 6,297 square metres of this particular rental, you see that a sum of somewhere in excess of $4½ million has been paid in rental for one reasonably small agency of government here in this city. You know that that is going to go up next year. In fact, it goes up on 23 September every year, and this year it will go up again. That base figure this year will in fact be $733, and grossed up with parking approaches something like $800 per square metre. In 2004, per square metre it will be over the $1,000 mark.
I do not know how any member of the Labor Party can sleep at night when they are ripping off the taxpayers of Australia to the tune of $36 million over and above what is a fair thing over the life of this lease. It comes down to what occurred back in 1993 and what the current Labor Party leaders are prepared to do about it. As I indicate to the Australian taxpayers this monumental rip-off, I call again on the Leader of the Opposition to renegotiate this lease and pay back the money. Show some leadership. Show your true credentials in what you want the Australian people to consider is a fair thing. If you want to be considered as an alternative Prime Minister in this country, stop ripping off the taxpayers and do something about this disgraceful lease that has your party benefiting at the expense of every taxpayer in this country. Not just the people of Canberra but the people in your own electorate are paying more than they should simply so the Australian Labor Party can be the beneficiary.
I indicated before that when it came to a question of what was and was not available in the way of property, this government, when we came in in 1996, found an absolute mess. It was not that the Audit Office did not have some choices, because in 1996 we discovered that there was commercial accommodation available for rent, owned by the Commonwealth in this city alone, of seven hectares—70,000 square metres of office space unoccupied. If you take that back to 1993, the Audit Office had plenty of choices where they could have gone. Any responsible leader, at that time or subsequently, would have said to the Audit Office, `You are an agency of government. You should get value for money when you pay your rental and you should pay a fair rental.' And you would be squeaky clean, you would expect, if you want to have any credibility in financial management. You would not ask any agency of government to pay what is not a fair thing, what is way above the normal, what is way out there when it comes to rental prices in this country, let alone in this city. But, no, the current leadership of the Australian Labor Party back then, inside this parliament and outside this parliament, effectively forced an agency of the government to go in there. They had choices. Why did they end up there, paying above market value? Because that deal was done back then by their political masters. Subsequently we have seen this perpetrated, and we see it going on year after year to a point where this particular bill mounts up. 
You will never have any credibility in financial management till you fix this lease up. And every year that goes by will be another reminder to the people of Australia that there is a monument called Centenary House, owned by John Curtin House Ltd, that is in fact a monument to the ineptitude in financial management of this Leader of the Opposition because he fails to do something about it now. If he does not do it, every year that reminder will come forward, particularly on the anniversary of the lease—23 September. Every year, nine per cent compounding up to a point where, when it gets towards the end of the lease in 2007—not too far away—it will be somewhere over $1,300 per square metre per annum. All I can say is that there is probably going to be no lease in the world to compare with that on a per square metre basis.
—World's best rorting practice.
—Throw in New York, throw in Tokyo, throw in London, throw in any city you want to, and I doubt that you will find any rental comparable to the one that the Australian National Audit Office is forced, under a legal agreement with the Australian Labor Party, to pay in the case of Centenary House, in Barton in this city.
The Leader of the Opposition deserves to be censured by the Australian people—not by the coalition, by the Australian people— for his failure to do something. It is just another example of a weak, prevaricating leader who fails to take hold of what the real issues are when it comes to proper management. He fails to lead his own party and say, `Let's put a bit of discipline in the way we do business. Let's give an example to the rest of Australia as to what is a fair thing. Let's simply sit down with the Audit Office and renegotiate this lease and let it pay what might be fair but not above what is fair.' Anything above what is fair when it comes to this lease is simply a rip-off of the Australian people, and that is what we are seeing happening in the case of this lease and what we see happening every year this lease exists.
It is fair to acknowledge that this has been the subject of considerable conjecture ever since the beginning. It should not have been because, firstly, it should never have happened and, secondly, those that have got current responsibility for the Labor Party have the capacity to fix it. They can do that very quickly. You can do that today. I am sure you can negotiate today a way of bringing this particular problem to an end simply by indicating quite clearly that you are prepared to pay a fair rental and you are prepared to renegotiate the lease. As I have indicated, unless the Leader of the Opposition takes action here, it will be just another example of the weakness of his leadership.
—It's a test.
—Of course it is a test. It is a test which has so much significance attached to it, because this goes to the very heart of the Labor Party's existence. This goes to the fact that some $4½ million a year gets paid in rental, at the moment somewhere about $2½ million above a fair thing. God only knows how many millions of dollars above a fair thing by 2007.
—Yes, at nine per cent compound.
—Each year it goes up at nine per cent, compounding the whole time. This is a question of integrity. I do not know how any member of the Labor Party can sit back on this one. I do not know how anybody can sit back on this one and indicate that they are prepared to sit here and take taxpayers' money for their own party's benefit. I do not know how you can see a situation perpetuated in the manner that this has been all of this time. If the Leader of the Opposition has not got the capacity to make the decision, if he is too weak to do it of his own volition— call caucus together and say, `Let's put an end to this charade. Let's call the scandal quits.' No more scandals, surely. Do the decent, right thing. Don't expect the people of Australia to believe that you can manage their dollars when you are channelling so much money—$36 million of their money at the moment—into your own party's benefit. That is the judgment that will be passed. Every day that goes by before the Leader of the Opposition takes some action in this particular area will be another indication of the Leader of the Opposition's failure to show leadership, failure to show strength. It will be an indication of what a weak leader he is. 
I regret that the Audit Office did not use it as a case study. I know that it is an embarrassment to it and has been time and time again. I know that it has endeavoured to get some commonsense into this equation. I think it carries with it a stigma that the Audit Office does not need. It is an arms-length body fully supported by this government in all of the examinations which it does and yet it has hanging over its head a cloud in the form of a lease with the Australian Labor Party which puts its own credibility at risk. It is not its fault—I acknowledge that up front—but at the same time it gets no satisfaction. It makes a request—and that is all it can do—and it gets a simple reject every time. It does not get any proper hearing when it asks time and again, as it has, to get this lease renegotiated, because there is greed over there. They have set up a system of funding which is without parallel in this country's public administration. This is a one-off system for a political party that, unfortunately, carries with it all of those things that are bad. It is a rotten deal—there is no other word for it—and the Australian people know that it is a rotten deal, and yet they have to continue to put up with it.
This is the opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition to get to his feet and say: `Enough is enough. Let us put this charade to an end. Let us call it quits. Let us do something about it and stop ripping off the Australian people.' If the Leader of the Opposition fails to do that, he deserves to be censured, the whole Labor Party deserve to be censured and all those associated with this particular lease deserve to be censured—and I suspect that there are many on that side that had a bit to do with it back in 1993. This is his chance. If not, the consequences of censure are well deserved in this case. It is a test of leadership once again and, even more so, it is a test of integrity. If the Leader of the Opposition does not show some integrity on this occasion, then the Australian people will make that judgment and they will not forget, because I can assure you, Mr Speaker, this side of the parliament will continue to remind them.
I have been thinking about what we should do on 23 September this year—the anniversary, the day on which the price goes up again. The old cash register goes, `Click, click, click,' and it goes up again with a big increase channelling into the coffers of the Australian Labor Party. I think we should mark down 23 September this year, and every year that this lease is in existence, and maybe call it the `Day of Shame'. Maybe we should have a rally or something on that day that draws attention to the Australian Labor Party. I assure you, Mr Speaker, if we do have a little get-together down there that day, we will not block any member of the Labor Party from getting into Centenary House. We will not stop the Australian National Audit Office from doing its work either, but we will bring it to the attention of the Australian people.
I look around and I see the member for Fraser and I know that it must be a huge embarrassment to be a member in this city and to know that the party that he belongs to is getting such a benefit out of a shonky deal, out of a deal which should never have been put together in the first place and which continues to take dollars off the Australian people in a most detestable way—there is no other way of describing it. However, there is an opportunity to do something about it. Perhaps the Deputy Leader of the Opposition might like to do something about it. He might like to give some advice to his leader as to what he should do about it. Maybe he is embarrassed about it. Maybe the others are embarrassed as well. The chance is there to do something about that now and to call this whole shameful episode—this scandal— quits, to bring it to an end. Do it now, because if you do not you will be judged accordingly, as you deserve to be. 
I believe without the slightest doubt that this House should censure the Leader of the Opposition for his failure to bring to an end this shameful, disgraceful lease which is a rip-off of the Australian people and which will continue to be just that until 2007 unless commonsense prevails, unless decency prevails, unless leadership prevails, unless weakness disappears and strength returns and unless there is some backbone—some ticker—displayed by the Leader of the Opposition and his team. This is not just a censure of the Leader of the Opposition, this is a censure of every member of the Australian Labor Party in this place, because it reflects your standards. It reflects what you are prepared to do—set up a simple process to get easy money siphoned through a supposedly legitimate lease into the coffers of the Australian Labor Party. There has been no issue more deserving of censure than the motion before the chair at this time and I call on all members of the House to support the censure motion.
Honourable members interjecting—
—There are members on both sides of this House who would not be occupying their seats, including the Minister for Trade, if I were to exercise the standing orders.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—Everybody who listened to this fellow, the Minister for Finance and Administration, knows that for 10 minutes he had nothing more to say on this motion. I will tell you something, Mr Speaker. I will tell you what I did about Centenary House: I put a royal commission onto Centenary House. There is no royal commission on you and advertising—not $36 million over 15 years but $20 million a month ripped off the Australian taxpayer. There is no royal commission on that. There is no royal commission on the advertising that we saw on the GST, those chains ads, and all of the other stuff that has gone into the $200 million plus on that. There is no royal commission on that. There is no royal commission into the Greenfields contributions to the Liberal Party. There is no royal commission on that. There is no royal commission referenced to the $700,000 received from HIH by the Liberal Party while they sat on recommendations for proper supervision powers for APRA when the royal commission was set up on that—no reference to the conduct of ministers and no reference to the $700,000 received by the Liberal Party. There is no royal commission on that.
But we did put a royal commission in on Centenary House, under Justice Morling, a well-respected judge and a commissioner under you, a person appointed by you. Shall I tell you what the findings of Judge Morling were in the royal commission put in place? The findings were these:
The terms of the lease of Centenary House are reasonable and not unduly generous to the lessor. The terms of the lease were the result of arms-length negotiations between the lessor and the Australian Property Group. The advice of the Australian Valuation Office was sought before the terms of the lease were finally settled.
Elsewhere in the findings of the royal commission into the Centenary House arrangement, the independent royal commissioner, whose services as a royal commissioner have been used by the other side, said:
No party to the lease of Centenary House obtained unfair or above market commercial advantage from the lease.
No matter what might now be argued about the justification of the lease, the royal commissioner found that on the basis of comparison with other agreements, other arrangements, being discussed and being arrived at at the time by the Australian government. So we are entitled to ask the question in these circumstances as to why this is occurring. I am going to move an amendment to turn the censure motion into a motion dealing with the lies that were told about the GST. But before I get on to moving that amendment, as Mr Fahey, the Minister for Finance and Administration, went on I began to detect a different motive involved in all of this. At first I thought this was an attempt to embarrass the Labor Party—absurd, given that we had put a royal commission in on ourselves. I now believe—and the tip-off came about 10 to 15 minutes into his speech—that this is actually an attempt to intimidate the Auditor-General. This is saying to the Auditor-General, `Listen, your predecessor struck a mug's bargain here.' This is pique for several reasons: firstly, pique from a minister on whom the Auditor-General has found $1 billion worth of waste on IT. 
—You have not had to answer questions in this place on these matters.
—You have been found wanting in your administration by the Auditor-General to the tune of $1 billion.
—More immediately, what provoked this pathetic minister for finance was a report that we see here today produced by the Auditor-General about the Public Service wasting $100 million a year on office space. This is not something that governments like to hear from auditors-general.
—We listened to you in silence. You just maintain your silence while your record is dealt with. Okay, sport, maintain your silence. You were dealt with with complete courtesy, and you can operate on the same basis. You are attempting to intimidate the Auditor-General for further reasons. There are reports yet to come, and one of those reports is going to be on the Australian sales group, and I would not mind betting that that will be coming out perhaps a bit closer to that September date that the finance minister was speaking about. In just the same way that the government have mulled the Public Service in this country, destroyed and discredited it, what they are now doing is the ultimate in the parliamentary process, and that is intimidating the Auditor-General of this country.
The government know there was a royal commission. They know the royal commissioner found that the leasing arrangement was fine. As far as practice was concerned, everything was above board. They know that. So the question arises: why do they want to drag the Auditor-General across the table in this set of circumstances? This is their blind, but it is more sinister than that. It is one thing for oppositions to complain about the behaviour of auditors-general, but when governments are firing warning shots across the bow of the Auditor-General you know that it is time to scream for their protection.
—It's a cover-up.
—You know what is under way is a massive and substantial cover-up. In this case the cover-up is tainted with additional concerns for revenge. We all lamented it—and we still do, and we will not pursue it because we are concerned about the health implications of it—but were it not for the fact that you were, unfortunately, detained earlier this year, for the first half of this year we would have been discussing the Auditor-General's report on IT outsourcing, your direct responsibility. The Auditor-General found incompetence worth billions, hundreds of millions, of dollars in costs to the taxpayer—a complete shambles. That is the only significant policy that this minister has been responsible for in five years in office.
And he moled it comprehensively, just as he moled the State Bank sale in New South Wales in which he claimed $540 million value to the New South Wales taxpayer but did not tell them in the fine print so beloved of the Liberal Party that they had also taken over debts associated with the State Bank which meant that the real net value was not $540 million but somewhere between $200 million and $270 million. He also builds on that magnificent record in IT outsourcing, which has savaged the Commonwealth taxpayer to the tune of $1 billion, the railway air link from Central to Mascot—not supposed to cost the taxpayer one red cent but which cost them $750 million. 
So what are we up to now? Let us add them all together. We have $750 million on the railway, we have $250 million in relation to the bank, we have $1 billion on IT and now, apparently, we have $100 million a year on office space. That makes $2.1 billion from the minister for finance in incompetent public administration and on value for money. No wonder he wants to intimidate the Auditor-General. No wonder he wants to ignore the fact that a royal commission by an independent royal commissioner found, regarding the agreement that was ticked off by the then Auditor-General through the Australian Property Group with the Australian Labor Party at the time it was negotiated:
The terms of the lease of Centenary House are reasonable and not unduly generous to the lessors. The terms of the lease were the result of arms-length negotiations between the lessor and the Australian Property Group. The advice of the Australian Valuation Office was sought before the terms of the lease were finally settled.
You do not have to take the government's blackguarding of the Labor Party. You do not have to take any alleged self-interested defence by the Labor Party of itself. Just go to the royal commissioner and have a look at what the royal commissioner had to say about it, and then understand why this is being done to the Auditor-General. Understand what is at stake here: a government that makes an art form of abuse of the Public Service, that evades accountability at every point and that is guilty not of $36 million over 15 years, which is your allegation, but of $20 million a month of public funds— corruption on a massive scale in this country of $20 million a month—going to government advertising basically devoted to the Liberal Party.
You are deserving of censure. I have spent most of my 15 minutes actually talking about the issue that is before us—which is more than I can say for the Minister for Finance and Administration, who spent approximately two minutes stating the case and, after that, another 13 minutes reiterating, `Please explain, Leader of the Opposition, what you are doing.' I have done his motion the courtesy of a lengthier discussion than he himself managed to do, but I am entitled to do a few things on my own part and so I move:
That all words after “that” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“the House censures the Government for breaking each of the following promises in relation to the GST:
(1)	everyone will be better off;
(2)	no small business will go to the wall;
(3)	the Tax Act will be smaller;
(4)	there will be more jobs and less unemployment;
(5)	the black economy will disappear;
(6)	the GST will not be a tax on a tax;
(7)	all over-60s will get $1,000;
(8)	pensioners will get a 4% increase, without clawback;
(9)	health and education will be GST-free;
(10)	the Australian dollar will be worth more;
(11)	nothing will go up by the full 10%; and
(12)	petrol prices will not increase.
As every Australian now knows, you can tell it to the marines on all of that. Every Australian now knows they were lied to repeatedly. They were lied to at the outset on the never, ever promise. They were lied to on each one of those promises made to them. They are not better off and the Australian economy is not better off. This economy was growing under Labor at four per cent per annum. The growth rate has been halved, and the best that is expected of the economy is to return to the growth rate that was put in place by Labor before this government came into office. That is the best that can be expected of the GST for the economy—that Australian business, Australian consumers and Australian workers will struggle over the hump and resume a level of growth that they experienced before they had the handicap of a ball and chain tied around their ankles, the ball and chain of the goods and services tax. 
But the government is Churchillian to one extent. Churchill used to say that, in wartime, truth has to be surrounded by a smokescreen of lies. The essential truth here was that the government intended to put in place a tax to shift the tax burden to pensioners and ordinary Australian families. That was the truth. The smokescreen of lies started with a promise that it would never, ever be done to them and was followed by every piece of obfuscation that I have pointed out in the amendment that I have moved to this pathetic censure motion.
We will have a chance to vote on the government's lies. We will also have a chance, although the numbers in this parliament will determine the outcome, to draw attention to the blind being drawn across their dispute with the Auditor-General for his virulent findings on the competence of this government. But know this: there is a sinister attempt going on here to intimidate the Auditor-General, both on what he has produced on the government's management of property now and, more importantly, on what he is going to produce in the next few weeks on the sales of government properties. Don't be fooled. This is butcher's hook, big time. We have had a royal commission into our particular activities. The time has come for a royal commission on yours.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—The begetting of this lease was indeed a sorry plot. It was an attempt, which turned out to be successful, to supply a permanent stream of income to the Labor Party's coffers which would not have to be subject to disclosure and would be paid out of the taxpayers' pocket. It began with the Labor Party acquiring for free a block of land in Barton, known as lot 22. That then became the subject of an application, but hidden from the Auditor-General, for it to become a purpose-built facility for the Auditor-General's office and for the government to pay the rent, with this money to be paid to the ALP via the vehicle of Centenary House.
—The member for Grayndler will excuse himself from the House under the provisions of 304A.
—Centenary House is owned by John Curtin House—
—The member for Grayndler will excuse himself from the House under the provisions of 304A.
The member for Grayndler then left the chamber.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: could I put to you that the member for Grayndler was leaving the chamber. He did not say anything—he was on his way out of the chamber. You might like to revisit your ruling, but I can assure you that he actually said nothing.
—I can assure the Chief Opposition Whip that I was in the prime position to witness the member for Grayndler's gesticulations as he left the chamber. I call the Minister for Aged Care.
—Mr Speaker, as I said—
—Mr Speaker, on a further point of order: I am placed in a difficult position, but should members want to wave their arms around as they walk out of the chamber it is going to be very difficult for all of us if that is going to be something for which they will be ejected—
—The Chief Opposition Whip will resume his seat or I will deal with him. I have dealt with the member for Grayndler, who has left the chamber. I have also exercised a great deal of tolerance on both sides of the chamber, and I do not intend that this grace should be extended any further. 
—As I said, this began as a plot. There was a plot by the executive of the Labor Party to create a lease whereby the Auditor-General and the rent that was paid for his accommodation would supply a perpetual flow of money to the Labor Party over a period of 15 years. It was fought tooth and nail by the Department of Finance and Administration. The department of finance gave evidence in estimates that it was prepared to see a one per cent escalator in any agreement for lease. But, no, the government of the day, which of course was the Labor government, insisted that it be a nine per cent escalator.
The point about this clause that makes it such an aberrant lease is that there is no provision in the lease at all to ever review the rent downwards. It can only ever be reviewed up, and the nine per cent annual increment is in fact a perpetual and ongoing increase for 15 years. This chart indicates what happens to the rent. The dark line on this chart indicates the amount of money that the increase in the rent will provide to the coffers of the Labor Party.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: you have ruled frequently that it is improper for members to use—
—The Chief Opposition Whip will resume his seat. The actions of the minister have been entirely consistent with actions taken on both sides of the House during question time.
—There is a second chart that shows very well precisely where the money is going. The reason that I am presenting these charts is that they were prepared by the Australian National Audit Office themselves. There was so much anger, because at the time this site was being developed—and understand how the market works with regard to this—the land was given to the Labor Party for free by the then Labor government of the ACT. They then went ahead and signed this agreement for lease, the details of which were kept silent from the parliament, despite the fact that the Lands Acquisition Act required that the government table this agreement before the parliament. Despite the fact that I and many other people asked for it, the document was never tabled.
The problem with the Lands Acquisition Act was that, even when it was finally admitted in estimates hearings that the document should have been so tabled, there was no penalty for not having done so, and they were able to keep it secret for months and months. But the effect of signing that agreement to lease made it a bankable document. It then meant they could go to the bank, which they did, and they got a $50 million loan. With that $50 million loan, they then built a building, which cost them in the vicinity of $17 million. Immediately that tenant agreement was entered into, the capital value of that building escalated to around $34 million, because at any time it had a valid and unbreakable lease lasting for 15 years.
The rent that the Labor Party is receiving at the present time is in excess of $4 million a year. Understand this: in the period between the last election in 1998 and the next election due this year, the Labor Party will receive in rent more than it has received through public funding for election funding. That is double the amount, out of taxpayers' pockets. By the time we get to 2007-08, it will be receiving around $8.9 million a year. This is in respect of a building in Barton, just down near the National Press Club, which has caused the Auditor-General to be unable to pay his rent. He gave evidence in estimates hearings that he was forced into this lease, which he signed without being told that the Labor Party was the landlord and, indeed, his co-tenant—they are housed in the same building—and that he had to go to the Department of Finance to ask for top-up money, because otherwise he could not have carried out his audit function, because the money that was given to him would go in rent to the Labor Party.
The result of this has been that the Audit Office has now had to sublet, and it is now sharing with another department. It is now sharing with the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, so the taxpayer is still paying, but that relieves the Department of Finance and Administration of the bill where it has to top up the rent because the Auditor-General's allocation is not enough to do his work of auditing the Commonwealth's agencies and departments and to pay the Labor Party their rent. 
At the time that the Department of Finance finally entered into that binding agreement to lease—and here is the document—the ministers included Mr Beazley. Mr Beazley was then in a state of conflict of interest, because he was then a member of the national executive of the Labor Party, and the memorandum and articles of association of John Curtin House said that the members of the executive are the only people who can be members of the company. When all this was made public, what did they do next? They changed their memorandum and articles of association, because they knew that there was a vulnerability under section 44 of the Constitution.
But it does not end there. We used to be able to get their accounts. We used to be able to get them from ASIC. They used to be required to report because they were a related entity and they had to show that the money went to the Labor Party. Indeed, if you go back through the old documents, you will find that they guaranteed the campaign fund of the Labor Party. It is there in the documents. But they were not satisfied with that, because later on they actually moved to change the standards of accounting so that they fell into the group of people who were excluded from being a related entity that had to disclose. And guess who moved that? Paul Keating. He was also, of course, a member of the executive.
This was a plot from go to whoa. At the time that they entered into that agreement to lease, Price Waterhouse showed that the rent being paid was then excessive. The more important thing that the Minister for Finance and Administration has shown today is, of course, that the rent that is being paid now is way above the top rent paid in the most prestigious building in—and I hate to say it for Victorians—the top city in Australia. This means, very simply, that this is a lease which was always going to be one that was unfair to the taxpayer, which is truly unconscionable, if you think about it, and it is a lease which is delivering money straight from the taxpayer via the Auditor-General into the Labor Party's pocket, into a corporation which is entirely under the control of the Labor Party and which guarantees their campaign fund—and it was designed to do that.
In excess of $13 million has been received between elections. There is no way in the world that anyone would be able to outspend the Labor Party in the next election. There is no way. So this whole sorry, shoddy mess has resulted from the following: a block of land was given to the Labor Party by a Labor Party government in office in the ACT; the then Labor Party ministry entered into an agreement with themselves to put the Auditor-General in the invidious position of being a source of money to the Labor Party and a co-tenant in a building owned by the Labor Party. They built into this agreement an escalator clause the like of which does not exist anywhere else in Australia. There is not a lease like this anywhere else in Australia. It is a 15-year lease with a built-in nine per cent compound increase, resulting at the end of the day in rental of $36 million over that 15-year period being paid above what would be a fair rental.
This motion was designed and moved by the Minister for Finance and Administration, because he asked that that $36 million be repaid or, at the very least, that the Labor Party have the decency to enter into negotiations to make it a fair lease and pay back from this point of time what has been excessive. There is nothing to stop them doing it now and, if there is a shred of ethics in the Labor Party, that would be entered into now, in order to see that the taxpayer is not funding the Labor Party's total operation.
I would like to table these tables that I have drawn attention to. I would also like to table the agreement to lease. I remind people that at the end of this debate, no matter if the Labor Party do not have the decency to renegotiate the lease, if the Labor Party got back into office what is to stop them doing another one? What is to stop them doing a second one? And, in the interim, what is to stop them using part of the $4½ million in rent they will receive this year to pay for the Aston by-election? The fact of the matter is this: the people who are aspiring to be ministers should they win the next election are the same people who did this dirty deal and will not renegotiate it.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—Two pathetic propositions have come before us today: a minister that was given the hospital pass and could not even spend the time completing his attack; and you knew the hospital pass was complete when we end up with the Minister for Aged Care seconding it. We were prepared to give consideration to this minister for his botched handling of the department, but not you—you have put him right in it.
—Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.
—Mr Speaker, that comment directed to the Minister for Finance and Administration is highly offensive, and I ask for it to be withdrawn.
—If the minister himself finds it offensive, I withdraw it.
Government members interjecting—
—The House will come to order. I will deal very quickly with members on my right. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has withdrawn the comment. He will proceed.
—This is a government that comes in here arguing a case for $36 million that has been cleared by the royal commission, and it has a political advertising campaign going on around the country for $360 million, and rising at $20 million a month— and it does not have any inquiry into it. What sheer hypocrisy. The Labor Party has been cleared by a royal commission, and this government on the last day of the parliament, just before the anniversary of its botched GST, moves this pathetic motion to avoid scrutiny of the GST. We have here the Minister for Aged Care, who has the gall to talk about political patronage when she has been stacking key positions with political appointments associated with her. That is the standard of this government: hypocrisy and political patronage. And it is driven by it.
But let us not be distracted from what the real issue is today. Sunday, 1 July, will see the GST one year old. But who is going to be celebrating? Many happy returns—again and again and again. Every time you put your hand in your pocket to pay a bill, John Howard and Peter Costello have got their hands in behind it taking out 10 per cent. So many people have been hurting from this GST, and they will not be thanking the government come 1 July. Even those who were prepared to support the government in relation to the GST are turning against it because it is not the tax they voted for. Its implementation has been botched, and it is being administered by a government increasingly out of touch— broken promise after broken promise.
You would have thought that the last government in the world to adopt a goods and services tax would at least get it right, but not this government. It has been led by a prime minister who has had only one vision all his life—a vision for a new tax. He has had only one idea all his life and he still could not get it right. They thought that all they had to do was get the new tax into law and then sit back waiting for Australians to all become relaxed and comfortable. What did the Prime Minister say last year: `Once it is in and people have got used to it—in a few months, perhaps by October or November— people will say, “What was all the fuss about?”' We are well past October and November. At the end of the day small business has borne the brunt of the tax adventure folly; ordinary Australian families and our senior citizens have been squeezed; the economy has been slowed ahead of the rest of the world; and the budget has been blown away as policy panic has set in. To shore up their base, we have had a government spending like a drunken sailor to try to buy the next election. I say this to the Prime Minister: trust is not for sale—it cannot be bought; it has to be earned—and advertising the past is no substitute for a vision for Australia's future. 
While we are on the issue of advertising, so deceitful has this government's selling of the GST been that it is now being parodied in public advertising. We saw two interesting ads for Panadol in the last couple of weeks. This is the quote: `Petrol and diesel prices need not rise as a result of the GST—new Panadol gel tabs are a lot easier to swallow.' We have: `There's no way that a GST will ever be part of our policy, never, ever; it's dead—new Panadol gel tabs are a lot easier to swallow.' Then we have some other advertising for the Diners Club that talks about the GST nightmare and then talks about the dream—their solution, not the government's solution. What we have is the government having so deceived this nation that it has now gone into folklore; it is now being parodied in advertising.
There are 12 particular promises that stand out and they are contained in the amendment that the Leader of the Opposition and I have moved. We call them `the dirty dozen', because in 12 months of the GST every one of them has been broken. I go to the amendment and I ask people in this House: does anyone really believe that everyone is better off as a result of the GST? Have they kept the second promise that was made, that no small business would go to the wall because of the GST? The third promise was that the tax act would be smaller because of the GST. I ask this House: is the tax act smaller?
—I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of the conferences that have been had between the Manager of Opposition Business and me over rhetorical questions.
—Let us go through the promises. They said that unemployment would fall because of the GST—it has not. They said that the black economy would disappear—it has not; just look at the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald. They said that everyone over 60 would get $1,000— they did not deliver on that. Then, in this last budget, they gave pensioners $300 and thought they could buy them off. That is 30 cents in the dollar. Even the HIH creditors are getting better treatment than that, but not the pensioners of this country from this government. They also said that pensioners would get a four per cent increase without clawback, and it was clawed back. They said that education and health would be GST free—they are not. They said that the Australian dollar would be worth more—it has gone down since the GST came in. They said that nothing would cost more than 10 per cent—there is a litany of prices that have gone up by 10 per cent or more. They said that petrol prices would not increase because of the GST, but we know that that sneaky little trick of not giving the deduction in excise that they should have given as a result of the GST coming in resulted in motorists being slugged by this government. The final promise that they made was that there would not be a tax on a tax. Ask anyone who has to pay an insurance premium; ask anyone who has to pay for petrol. There are taxes on taxes by this government on everyday items. It is a continuing deceit. It is no wonder that they want to avoid this debate today in this parliament. It is no wonder that they want to come in with a sham excuse to try and move a censure, and expose the Minister for Finance and Administration, who himself has presided over a department that has seen $1 billion of supposed savings disappear because he has botched the implementation of the IT outsourcing.
It is also true that this government wants to rely on the fact that it is a better economic manager. Let us go to the impact of the GST, because not only has it hurt ordinary Australians and not only has it hurt the economy— it has mugged the economy and it has cut the growth rate in half since the GST came in— but it has also hurt the budget. The scrutiny of the economic commentators shows that this is a high taxing treasurer who has presided over the worst fiscal deterioration in Australian history. The government is not only doing damage to families but it is doing it to the budget. When you damage to the budget, you take away choices. Budgets are about choices. Surpluses are about deciding whether you invest in the schools or the hospitals. This government has eroded the capacity for that. Six months ago, this government was forecasting that the cumulative surplus to be able to be spent over the next three years was $27 billion. When the budget came down, it was reduced to a mere $7 billion. What sort of a spending spree is that? That is $20 billion blown in the space of six months to shore up the GST—not because of any conviction. Remember how they fought to stop our attack on them on petrol prices? They said it could not be done. They were forced into the backflip. They said the same about beer excise. This is a government that does not do these things by conviction, it does them to save its political hide. 
Their preferred modeller Chris Murphy has already shown that the impact of the government's budget is that interest rates are around one per cent higher than they otherwise would be, because of their poor fiscal management. Now we have heard the minister, who has led this censure today, talking about the Labor Party being into shonky deals. He is into the `rainy day fund'—the contingency reserve, his hollow log, to fund the promises that they keep making on the run. This is 1982 all over again. This is Prime Minister Howard doing to Treasurer Costello what Prime Minister Fraser did to Treasurer Howard back in 1982.
Over the last few months, $20 billion has been blown—wasted in a pathetic and totally unsuccessful attempt to get back public support—and we have the economic writers now seriously attacking this government's economic record. We hear the government of the day saying that they have a better economic record than we do. That is not the conclusion of Stephen Koukoulas of the Financial Review, who conducted an exercise recently and concluded that Labor was the superior economic performer in government. That article of his stimulated much feedback, so he wrote another one on 25 June saying:
... the bulk of the feedback suggests that macro-economic management at the government level is mainly about economic growth and job creation, aided by a vibrant business sector. On these counts, the record over the past 25 years suggests that the ALP delivers significantly stronger out-comes than the Coalition.
How out of touch can this government be when it boasts of paying off the nation's debt while the debt burden on Australian households just keeps growing? The policies of the Howard-Costello government and its economic management have resulted in greater household indebtedness. Under the economic watch of this coalition, household debt has climbed to over $480 billion, an increase of 75 per cent. The household debt ratio—that is, the debt as a proportion of household income—has climbed to over 110 per cent. What does that mean? It means that Australians, on average, now owe more than they earn. Credit card debt has climbed by more than 165 per cent under this government; not to mention foreign debt, which is now over $315 billion, up by nearly 65 per cent under the treasurership and prime ministership of this government. The foreign debt to GDP ratio is now at a record high.
Whilst this indebtedness has been skyrocketing, the Australian Statistician recently revealed that the rate of household savings— an indicator of what John Howard used to say enabled people to put food on the table— has hit a record low. When Labor left office, Australians on average saved $5 in every $100. Today it is just 70c. So when they hear the Prime Minister and the Treasurer ranting about how good things are, how the GST is behind them, how we are living in a time of economic prosperity, is it any wonder that these people say, `Why am I being hurt so hard?' It is because they have been forced into debt by the economic mismanagement of this government imposing upon them a GST that it told them would make them better off and which they are increasingly finding makes them worse off. This is a government that is seeking to avoid this crucial issue as we approach the anniversary—(Time expired)
—I call the honourable member for Calare.
—Thank you, Mr Speaker—
—I remind the member for Rankin that he does not yet have the call. In fact, I have given the call to the member for Calare.

—If anyone has priority, it would be the Manager of Opposition Business. I call the Manager of Opposition Business. 
—Mr Speaker, I seek clarification from you of the circumstances. I respect the rights of Independent members to speak, but I am trying to clarify the circumstances in which the member for Calare has been given the call. Is he speaking in support of the motion and therefore, in effect, taking a government spot in the speakers' list, or why was he otherwise called in advance of an opposition member? We have here a motion of censure of the Leader of the Opposition, and therefore—
—The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Manager of Opposition Business is perfectly well aware that, as the occupier of the chair, I know not whether anyone is going to speak for or against a motion, regardless of which side I call them from. The member for Calare, as an Independent member, rose and it therefore seemed entirely proper for me to call him. No-one had risen on my right, and so I took the action that the chair is obliged to take and called someone rising on my left, in this case the member for Calare.

—The member for Calare has the call. 
—Thank you, Mr Speaker. My apologies to the opposition. I did not realise you had another speaker, and I would have liked to have somehow summed up this debate by listening to all sides. That was certainly my intention. 
The Curtin House lease is a disgrace. These graphs that have been given to me by the government and everything that they indicate are disgraceful. So the public should be rightfully outraged by them, but no more outraged than they should be about the hypocrisy of this very debate and the abuse and misuse of public funds over many years. The scramble for the high moral ground in this debate would be laughable if it were not so serious. How any side can honestly debate the use or abuse of public funds leaves me absolutely flabbergasted, given the election funding rorts that operate in this country, the pork-barrelling politics on both sides, the abuse of public money in the so-called government advertising that occurs—whether it be by the last government or this—and the use of staff and ministerial entitlements for blatant political campaigning. 
Out of today's newspaper we have the story—which could apply equally to either side of politics—that the federal government has again been accused of using taxpayers' money to send out party propaganda in a mail-out to an electorate for next month's Aston by-election. Victorian Liberal senator Kay Patterson used part of her $28,000 communications allowance to send letters to electors in Aston advocating a vote for the Liberal candidate in the by-election caused by the death of Liberal member Peter Nugent. The allowance is intended to cover the cost of printing and postage to carry out electoral and parliamentary business. It is not supposed to be used for party business. The multiple abuse of entitlements multiplied by the past 20 years I believe would even exceed the cost of this lease arrangement that the former government entered into with the Audit Office. As I said, the sort of situation detailed in today's newspapers applies equally to either side of politics. So let us get real. 
The hypocrisy of both sides in their handling of the age 55 superannuation bill for members of parliament, due to be rushed through the Senate this afternoon, cementing in place the use of public money to top up superannuation by a factor of 69 per cent, underlines the hypocrisy of this whole debate. This debate is hardly worth, I would suggest, the two or three minutes that I have given it.

The schedule is to be made available by 12 noon on each sitting day to the Manager of Opposition Business and circulated to members at the first opportunity.
As I understand it, the list of papers to be tabled in the House is provided by the Table Office to attendants and is placed on members' seats along with the daily program—the blue—prior to the House sitting each day.

—May I interrupt just briefly to ask whether the member for Brisbane received the correspondence I referred to yesterday.
—Yes, yesterday afternoon after question time. I was going to thank you. It was hand delivered to my office and I thank you for that. My question follows on from the information contained in your response. I noticed that only nine out of 18 of the staff who wished to continue in employment apparently have been able to do so. I did earlier seek advice, and I think it would be desirable for the parliament to be informed whether staff conditions have been maintained and whether or not those people who are serving us and fellow occupants of this building in the staff canteen are being paid less money this week than they were last week for doing exactly the same job.
I noticed also that some of the staff who have quite extensive years of service, including up to 18 and 20 years of service, are not able to transfer their previous employment entitlements across. They are required to resign their previous employment and therefore, in some cases, they may lose entitlements or, in other cases, have them paid out. Mr Speaker, I seek your advice, as Presiding Officer in the chamber and on behalf of the parliament, as to whether or not that is regarded as a fair and proper way in which to treat staff who have served the occupants of the parliament very well for a very considerable length of time.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—This is a debate that we should have had earlier in the day, except for a stunt by this government that has completely backfired on them—a Minister for Finance and Administration who was dragooned into moving a censure motion against the leader of the Labor Party in relation to a matter that has already been cleared by a royal commission, a minister for finance who is merely trying to cover up what we understand is a damning Auditors-General's report of his own administration of property sales and property rentals.
Before I get to the issue of the GST, the opposition calls on the government to immediately release the Auditor-General's report so that the concerns that we have and that we have been informed about since this debate was raised this afternoon can be tested. We understand that this minister for finance has been not only completely responsible for a botched $1 billion hole in terms of IT outsourcing but also presiding over botched practices in the sale of government properties. But the government are sitting on that report. They are sitting on it because we understand it is damning of them. We call on the government to immediately release that Auditor-General's report so that the parliament can be given the opportunity to consider the botched handling by the minister for finance. He has raised this issue; he cannot scurry away from it. This government has sought so much to hide and deceive that we want it to finally be accountable. We want it to come clean.
This MPI is on today because the parliament rises today for some five weeks and next Sunday is the first anniversary of the GST. Members might recall that when the GST was first introduced by the Liberal Party, by John Hewson, in a program called Fightback they had a birthday cake for it after 12 months. They had a birthday cake for their GST, which the Australian electorate then went on to reject out of hand. There will be no birthday cake this weekend—none at all—because there is no cause for celebration in this nation for this government's botched GST and the deceit that it has used to get it in. The fact of the matter is that the GST has caused enormous hurt to ordinary Australian families. It has caused pain and suffering to the small businesses of this country, it has dudded the pensioners and it has mugged the economy.
Let us just go back 12 months when this government was heralding the introduction of the GST. It promised that everyone would be a winner, but the polls consistently show that very few Australians feel they are better off under the GST. The government also promised that no small business would go under. In question time today we had question after question about small businesses struggling under the weight of this GST. We have on the member for Rankin's desk something we are seeking to get tabled in this place—this government's tax act, the tax act perpetrated upon this nation due to the GST. When the GST was introduced the government promised that they would halve the Income Tax Assessment Act, that small business red tape would be halved—they would cut it by 50 per cent—and the volume of tax legislation, which has become a tidal wave, threatens to overwhelm small business.
When the Prime Minister made that commitment the tax act was 3,000 pages long. It is now 8,500 pages long. Not only have they not halved the red tape but they have more than doubled the tax act. If it was a tidal wave at 3,000 pages, Minister, it is a tsunami now. That is what it is, and that is what you have done to the small businesses of this country. You promised them that you would halve their red tape, you promised them that you would reduce the tax act; all you have done is drown them in red tape. On the question of small businesses going under, there has been a 25 per cent increase in bankruptcies in the March 2001 quarter. 
—That's wrong.
—It's wrong, is it? Let us hear you. You deal with it, but go and talk with the Statistician. You say that everything is wrong. You said this GST was going to be good for Australians. You said it would produce more jobs. But since the introduction of the GST the rate of job growth has more than halved. You said that the black economy would disappear, but tax experts agree that the black economy has increased.
—What about the barristers?
—`What about the barristers?' he says. What have you done in relation to them? Have a look at the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald today, Minister. It says that, far from shutting down the black economy, your GST has encouraged a massive growth in the black economy, with consumers increasingly using cash to pay for goods and services. It includes a statement by a professor of tax law, Professor Rick Krever, who said:
... we just have to accept that an inevitable and known consequence of adopting a GST is a dramatic increase in the cash economy, perhaps in the order of many billions of dollars.
Rather than celebrating the GST crackdown on tax avoidance and the black economy, they are flourishing and at the same time the government are punishing ordinary Australians with a new slug of a 10 per cent tax. Another promise they made was that there would be no tax on a tax when the GST was introduced. But you have only to look at the fact that taxes, levies, fees and charges that can and do have GST added to them include stamp duties, petrol excise, tobacco excise, alcohol excise, import duties, fire levies in some states, camping fees, national park and swimming pool entry fees, sporting field and community hall hire from local councils and library fees. Some commitment to no taxes on taxes!
And then they made the promise about every person over the age of 60 getting $1,000. Forty per cent of Australians over 60 got nothing, and 10 per cent of Australians over 60 got less than $50. The government tried to buy them off in the last budget with a $300 settlement for them—30 cents in the dollar. You cannot buy your way out of this broken promise. This is absolutely the most outrageous broken promise of the lot when it comes to poor people struggling to make ends meet.
As if dudding the pensioners of this country is not enough, they were also dudded with the four per cent that they were promised with the GST. The promise was that the pensioners would get a four per cent pension increase, but two per cent of that four per cent was clawed back in 2001. We know that was the clawback that happened after the Ryan by-election. But, as the member for Lilley demonstrated in this parliament yesterday, there is another clawback that is going to happen after the Aston by-election. This will be from the people who will incur debt through the family payments circumstance that we have exposed in this parliament—but they will not get, until 16 July, the letter that says they have to repay. Some coincidence! The by-election is on 14 July and the government will not send out the letter until 16 July. I tell you what: we will be campaigning in the seat of Aston to make sure that people get the message—the letter, if you like—that John Howard will not send them before 14 July. The Prime Minister has been deceitful all the way through and he is perpetuating that deceit in the Aston by-election. Not content to claw back on the pension, he is now going to claw back on the family payment as well.
The government also promised that health and education would be GST free, but education costs such as school uniforms, shoes, public transport, books, schoolbags, et cetera have all got the GST on them, as have health items such as skin creams, denture repairs, sanitary products, vitamins and minerals. All of them attract the GST. We can keep going with this litany of broken promises, but I want to go to another point in the context of this debate. 
All I am saying is this: 12 months on, the GST has been exposed as the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on the constituents of the Australian economy. They were promised what has not been delivered. We were peppering the Prime Minister on this case today, and he was up there effectively saying, `You've never had it so good, and the GST is behind you.' Struggling Australian families, struggling small businesses and the pensioners of this country cannot put it behind them. They have a circumstance in which the GST applies every day that they go out to make a purchase, and they are hurting.
To try and shore up their stocks, the government have resorted to massive fiscal vandalism. I referred earlier in the debate to the fact that, six months ago, the cumulative surplus for the next three years was close to $27 billion. When the budget came down in May, that $27 billion had been reduced to $7 billion. This was a massive fiscal deterioration in the space of six months to save this government's hide. And they have not stopped there. We have had the Minister for Finance and Administration telling us that these other proposals which they announced, which are not funded in the budget, will be drawn out of the contingency fund—a hollow log, something that should be there for exceptional circumstances like the outbreak in Timor, not for funding projects that should be accommodated under normal investment activities in the department of industry and commerce, for example. Very interestingly, we now have the economic writers of this country waking up to the fact that this government is economically irresponsible. This is what Ross Gittins had to say after the budget:
What those papers do—
the budget papers—
is to take a Budget of blatant political expediency and try to rationalise it as good economic management.
He further went on to say on 25 June:
On rereading this year's Budget papers, I've been gobsmacked to discover the Government boasting about the `sound and responsible macro-economic policy framework' it has established and claiming that it helps create `strong potential for a further wave of productivity growth'. Talk about brazen!
Ross Gittins said on 26 May of the government:
It's been spending like a drunken sailor in the hope of buying votes. But, more than that, it's been appropriating future Budget surpluses so they won't be available for Labor ...
What sort of economic vision is that for the nation? You do not use a surplus to build schools, hospitals or infrastructure to connect the nation—not this government. That would be a legitimate spend of the surplus. They are only spending it to stop us spending it. Their sole intent, in terms of their fiscal discipline at this stage, is to erode the surplus so that Labor does not have choices. They are brazen about it. The Treasurer crows about it.
I might also observe this: where is the Treasurer? Is he in this House today to answer this debate? We see him up there with that smirk, asking about when he is going to get the question asked from us. Well, I ask him: when is he going to answer an MPI? When is he actually going to come in and debate his economic management, instead of getting out there in all his arrogance, smirking and gawking and trying to vent his spleen against us on this side? It is about time the Treasurer was accountable, because he will not turn up in this place to have a debate. It is not only Ross Gittins who says that. Gittins analyses the figures and gives us the conclusions. He says:
The label `big spending, big taxes' fits the Howard Government like a glove.
His headline was `Big spending, big taxing? That's Howard'. You hear them talk about us being the big spenders and the big taxers, but they have done it in spades. Ross Gittins says: 
Total taxation revenue is the highest for—wait for it—13 years ...
And this government wants to masquerade as low taxers. How can they be low taxers when they have introduced the grandmother of all taxes—an indirect, unfair, regressive tax that we are just going to experience the first birthday of come Sunday. The government have perpetrated a fraud on the Australian public. They should be condemned for it. There will be no celebrations on 1 July, but we will be reminding people of that fraud, that deceit. The government do not deserve the capacity to continue in office. They do not know how to govern; they know only how to deceive. The sooner we get honesty back in government the better—and you will only get that from a Labor government.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—I was hoping the member for Hotham would be a little more generous than that. We have a stunt on the other side of this place in an attempt to portray a large pile of paper as somehow indicative of the extent of the tax reform measures that we have undertaken since coming into government. In fact, I have in my hand a book that is no more than 10 centimetres wide. It represents all the GST acts and regulations, including ministerial determinations. It also covers the luxury car tax and wine equalisation tax legislation, the ACCC price monitoring rules and Australian business number legislation. It totals about 1,000 pages and that includes the index. This book, this piece of paper not more than about five or 10 centimetres wide, is the new tax system for Australia.
The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asks us what we have done. The tax reform undertaken on 1 July last year was more than the GST. We do not apologise for the GST. We believe it was inevitable and it had to be done. It was time that Australia had major taxation reform. No new tax is popular, but that does not mean it is not right. It is right. It is right for Australia and it is right for the long-term benefit of Australia. And at the same time that we introduced a GST we lowered income tax rates by $12 billion a year so that 80 per cent of Australians are paying no more than 30 cents in the dollar. As part of that package, we are lowering company tax. From 1 July this year, it will be 30 cents in the dollar, down from 36 cents in the dollar two years ago. 
We also abolished wholesale sales tax, and today exports are about $4 billion—$4,000 million—cheaper than they were around a year ago. As the Minister for Trade said in question time, exports are up 24 per cent. So Australia as a nation is exporting its socks off whilst the rest of the world is going through an economic downturn. Australia keeps defying all the doomsaying in the Labor Party. Remember it was the Labor Party that was saying that we were going to go into recession after the growth of the December quarter was revealed in January-February. It was saying, `The world is at an end, Australia is going into recession.' Well, we did not. One of the reasons why we did not is that Australia is exporting its socks off. The main reason why we are exporting our socks off is that our exports do not have embedded taxes in them any more. So thanks to the GST we are exporting more today.
The Deputy Leader of the Opposition raises the black economy. I do not think you need any better evidence about our success in cracking down on parts of the black economy than the example of the barrister Mr Cummins, who was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald as saying that, after not paying tax for a number of years, he was caught by the GST because of the introduction of the GST and for the first time he starts paying tax. I think there was justifiable public outrage about the behaviour of some barristers in relation to income tax.
At the same time we have delivered to the states the GST revenue in full, and that is delivering benefits in very real terms. Every teacher in Australia is paid from the money of the GST. Every policeman in Australia is paid from the money of the GST. To the teachers and the policemen of Australia: when you receive your wages cheque that is the GST paid by other Australians and you as a contribution to the nation. I have said before in this place that the most significant benefit of that is the states no longer have to go looking for more gambling taxes or insidious little taxes such as bed taxes in order to fund their police, their roads, their schools and their hospitals. Today they have a revenue stream that actually enables them to deliver services to consumers and to deliver services to Australians. 
From 1 July this year, we are abolishing financial institutions duty and we are abolishing stamp duty on the transfer of shares. Financial institutions duty is a tax on bank accounts. It is a tax on mortgages. It is a tax on leases. We are abolishing it from 1 July this year—another real benefit for Australians. Diesel fuel is cheaper because of the GST. For every small business in Australia, your petrol is significantly cheaper to you through the introduction of the GST because of the input tax credit. No small business in Australia that pays tax should be in the business of paying extra for their petrol above the market prices. They do not because they get the input tax credits as a result of the introduction of the GST.
In the couple of minutes remaining, the member for Hotham challenged me when he said that the number of bankruptcies has increased. This is patently incorrect. I am advised that the official figures published by the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia indicate that for the financial year to date— that is, since the introduction of the GST— business related bankruptcies have actually fallen by nine per cent when compared with the same period last year. So, despite the lower December quarter performance, bankruptcies have actually fallen by nine per cent since the introduction of the GST. That is little known. I am quite happy to provide that information. That means that apart from the economic benefits of what we did a year ago, which in some cases flowed through immediately but more particularly will flow through in the years ahead, Australia is a stronger, more robust, more vibrant and more successful economy as a result of the tax change that we made.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"— Ever since the Prime Minister broke his promise that he would never, ever introduce a GST, the yellow brick road of his great tax adventure has been littered with the wreckage of broken GST promises. He was joined in the tax cart by the Treasurer who, in a moment of candour in 1996, declared that the GST had taken on `snake-oil qualities'. The reluctant Treasurer, nevertheless, jumped into the cart and became one of the duo pressing ahead with this great tax adventure. 
On the first anniversary of the GST, I want to assess the impact of this so-called streamlined new tax system for a new century on small business, the economy and the living standards of Australians. The shadow Treasurer, in his earlier contribution to this MPI, outlined the `dirty dozen' broken promises, and I want to start with the promise that was made by the government to simplify the tax system. In 1996 the Prime Minister said:
It is time to get government off the back of small business and to unlock their true job creating potential. A coalition government will slash the burden of paperwork and regulations on small businesses, with our aim being a 50% reduction in our first term of office. 
So what he said was that he was going to cut all the red tape from this—the Income Tax Assessment Act as it was in 1996. Let us have a look at what happened subsequently. They realised that there was a problem, because in 1997 the Prime Minister said in the parliament:
The volume of tax legislation has become a tidal wave which threatens to overwhelm small business.
And how right he was. Then one year later:
JOURNALIST: Will the number of pages in the tax act be reduced by the introduction of a GST? 
HOWARD: Yes it will.
That was the progress report in 1998. In 1999, a journalist asked the Treasurer this time:
JOURNALIST: [The] Tax Act ... it's unreadable and unintelligible, there's a massive GST program that's going to overtake us ...
COSTELLO: Well I think that's right. And that's why we've got to get the number of pages of the Tax Act down. That's what we're working on right at this moment.
This is what he was working on in getting the number of pages of the Income Tax Assessment Act down. This is the legislation as it exists to this day and the changes that are all ready to go through the pipeline will take this to a total of 8,500 pages of the Income Tax Assessment Act alone—8,500 pages of this simplified, streamlined new tax system for a new century! But on top of that, of course, never forget the GST. Remember that the GST was supposed to replace the Botswana style, outmoded, 1930s wholesale sales tax. So here I present to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the people of Australia the government's effort at producing a so-called streamlined new tax system for a new century.
The government said that the GST is a simple tax. How can this be a simple tax? This GST legislation itself has been amended on no less than 1,865 times and yet the Treasurer, coming back to work earlier this year after the Assistant Treasurer made a mess of Coca-Cola and other GST details, was asked, `Does that mean no more changes?' and he said: 
Well, it does mean that we're not changing the legislation, that we've got it right. 
Yet 1,865 amendments later and still going, because there are more GST amendments in the pipeline for this so-called streamlined new tax system for a new century.
The only serious effort at simplifying the tax system has been made by the Labor Party, because a proposal was unveiled by shadow Treasurer Simon Crean about three weeks ago at the National Press Club. It is a proposal which involves getting a ratio of net GST payable to GST sales and applying that ratio for small businesses in subsequent years. We think that is a pretty good idea because it will dramatically simplify the GST paperwork—this massive burden—that has been inflicted on small business. But what does the Minister for Small Business say in response to that? We were getting calls from journalists, one after the other, saying, `I have obtained a copy of a leaked memo from the department which really criticises Labor's proposal for simplifying the GST.' It became pretty obvious that the leaker was none other than the Minister for Small Business. We got a copy of it—it was not all that tightly held I must say—and he had put asterisks and underlines on a couple of queries that were raised which we had fully anticipated, but what he did not highlight was the main point, which says:
A ratio by turnover method is a reasonable option for calculating GST ...
Here is the department that was asked to do a hatchet job on Labor's genuine simplification proposal and it comes to the conclusion that this is a reasonable method. The only people who are actually involved and committed to simplifying this monster of a tax is the Labor Party. The Minister for Small Business, who is supposed to be sticking up for small business, says: `You can't simplify this, this is as simple as it gets. We've done a really fine job.'
The government, you might recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, promised to abolish 10 taxes and replace them with the GST. Of course, it did not abolish income tax, nor did it promise that, but it did promise to abolish 10 taxes. Do you know how many taxes it ended up abolishing? Four out of the 10. So the GST is a tax on a tax—another broken promise. The government said, `No, we will not be having a tax on a tax.' It is a tax on a tax in so many cases that I do not have time to outline them all here today. What was a fundamental promise of this government in relation to the economy? The government promised that the GST would be good for the economy and good for small business. In fact, the Treasurer said in the lead-up to the last election when he was promoting the GST that the GST package would create `bigger exports, more trade, more jobs, more growth'. 
What has happened to growth? Growth halved under the GST. In fact, there was a quarter where the economy actually contracted. It is not as if the government received no warning of this. I produced an opinion piece for the Australian Financial Review a year earlier headed `Honey, I shrunk the economy'. It was based on work that I had done and, more importantly, work that was done by Professor Peter Dixon of Monash University. We predicted that the economy would contract under the GST. This was very clearly predicted and forecast in economic modelling—and what happened? It contracted under the GST—surprise, surprise! The GST was supposed to be good for the economy and it led to a contraction in growth for the first time in a decade.
Remember that the GST was supposed to create jobs. The Treasurer said `bigger exports, more trade, more jobs, more growth'. What happened to jobs? The rate of job growth halved under the GST, and unemployment has gone up under the GST. We ask this simple question: how can a $24 billion new tax create jobs? The government said, `Give us this GST, and we will create jobs with the $24 billion monster of a tax.' The government goes to the small business community and says: `You've never had it so good. You'll thank us for this one day.'
 (Mr Nehl)— Order! Member for Rankin, we did discuss earlier, before the dinner break, the possible danger of that pile of legislation swaying on your desk. I would hate to see the member for Lalor damaged—
—You have reminded me, and I am remiss in forgetting. You did outline the workplace health and safety issues associated with this, so we might just reduce it slightly.
—Thank you, Member for Rankin.
—There may be medical claims tomorrow by the member for Braddon and the member for Lowe here, who have helped me with that. The GST was inflicted on small business, and do you know what the Treasurer said about that? The government had this incredibly complex business activity statement, and the Treasurer said:
I don't think anybody will go to the wall as a consequence of the GST.
He said that in Perth on 18 May last year. What has happened? Bankruptcies were up 25 per cent in the March quarter compared with the preceding quarter, obviously related to the impact of the GST. So how is the GST good for the economy? It was supposed to attack the black economy, but we have experts saying what, again, is commonsense: the incentive to get into the black economy is greater under the GST, because you get to avoid all this legislation that I have here, and a range of other taxes. The incentive is so great to avoid them, and that is what has happened.
The Aussie dollar was supposed to go up under the GST. Remember that the Treasurer said, `The GST is replacing this outmoded wholesale sales tax—Botswana and Swaziland have got this terrible wholesale sales tax, and we have got this streamlined GST.' What happened there, with the Aussie dollar? It fell against the currencies of Botswana and Swaziland—but not just those two: it fell against 150 out of 161 currencies. This GST was supposed to drive the dollar up. It has driven it down. It is probably quite a good thing that it did, because the only thing holding up growth now are some net exports from an absolutely world competitive Australian dollar down around US50c. But it was supposed to go up. 
The GST was supposed to boost national savings. What happened there? When the Prime Minister came to office in March 1996 Australians were saving $5 in every $100; by March 2001, they were saving 70c. That is what the GST has done to savings. The government is saying: `You are all wrong. The GST is good for the economy.' How many people believe that now? Only 18 per cent of Australians believe it is good for the economy. Australians know best. They know a lot more than this government does.

"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,2001-06-28,"—Allow me to read out the words of the MPI. It reads:
The government's failure to keep its promises to Australian families and small business that everyone would be better off and no business would go to the wall as a result of the GST.
We have just had the shadow minister for regional development saying to the House that business bankruptcies have fallen by nine per cent since last year, which is most encouraging. That is very helpful. I will get to the member for Rankin shortly. I would like, firstly, to share with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the House some letters from my electorate. This is a letter that Alan Mann, who lives in Bucasia, sent me recently. It reads:
Dear Mrs Kelly,
You may recall me writing to you in September of last year commenting on my pension increases in proportion to the increase in the cost of living.
Mr Mann actually has a price watch, similar to that of the member for Lilley. But, of course, Mr Mann can actually add up, which is a bit of a problem for the opposition because his figures are very good. He says:
I enclosed a “price watch” comparison on what I regard as a typical weekly shopping list for my wife Zelda and I.
He goes on to say:
Accordingly, I decided to see how things would go over the ensuing year.
Of course, I then thought that the result of another review would then give me some ammunition to again confront you with allegations that the coalition Government's fiscal policies had further impoverished us.
However, I now stand humbled. In fact my shopping list has only slightly increased from a 1998 total of $128.37—
a week—
to an amount of $130.03 today. Just $1.66 or 1.3% ... Actually we are better off ...
This is a remarkable result and I must admit that the Government's policies have worked—and worked well.
—What's his address? I want to write to him.
 (Mr Nehl)—I warn the member for Braddon!
—He continues:
I enclose this year's comparison for information—and, yes—
—Order! I just interrupt the member for Dawson. Let me make it quite clear to the member for Braddon and anybody else in the House that, having been warned, the next time is out. Right?
—I must say, when you look through Mr Mann's shopping list you see that it is meticulous for every item. He goes on to say:
I realise that the only group to significantly increase, produce, is subject to seasonal effects of weather.
This is one for the Treasurer:
So, well done. I feel a lot happier now.
With best wishes,
Alan Mann
I hate to say it, but I trust Mr Mann—a pensioner who is obviously a meticulous and thoughtful man who has gone to a great deal of trouble to detail all of his shopping over a period of time—more than I trust the member for Rankin. In fact, the member for Rankin unfortunately brings to mind one of those childish sayings we had as acronyms at university, that PhD stood for `piled higher and deeper'. Of course, I am referring to his files.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am shocked and dismayed at the member for Dawson saying such grievously offensive things regarding me. 
—Resume your seat. The member for Dawson has the call.
—I was simply referring to sayings from old university days. I myself, of course, would never make such a comment. I know that this has been referred to a great deal today but I cannot help mentioning an article headed `One year on, most are better off: study', which reads in part:
The study by Econtech director Chris Murphy said income earners in this group—
he refers to voters in the $50,000 to $60,000 group—
had received a 5 per cent increase in their pay packet, after inflation ...
The article goes on to say: 
At first glance, the average wage rise of 3.7 per cent did not appear to be enough to shield workers from GST increases but when the change to the income tax scale and the $12 billion worth of tax cuts were included, workers were better off.
So it is not just Mr Mann on his pension: workers were better off. The article goes on:
Mr Murphy said a person on the average wage of $40,000 a year paid $10,400 in tax last year. If they received the average wage rise of 3.7 per cent, once the new tax scales were applied to their new wage of $41,500, it meant a tax cut of almost $1000, lifting their after-tax wage by 8.2 per cent.
Let me say this, for the member for Rankin. Mr Murphy went on to say:
The only group actually worse off is those earning over $230,000 a year, but I don't imagine that people would be too worried about that ... 
He did mention age pensioners:
Mr Murphy said the age pension had risen by $30 a fortnight or 8.1 per cent. `So pensioners are actually around 2 per cent better off, although you wouldn't know that from most media reports,' he said.
Most of us would not, either. We have someone with absolutely impeccable credentials saying that all Australians earning less than $230,000 a year are actually better off, so I think we have dealt with that. Let me talk very briefly about hard decisions. It is very easy to come into the House with stunts. We can all come in with stunts, like the member for Rankin, but what about solutions? The reality is that people in my electorate on average weekly earnings—and there are many of them—would have been paying 43 cents in the dollar in the future. What was your answer to that? They are now paying 30 cents in the dollar. We took the hard decision.
What were they going to do on the other side of the House, not only about giving hard-working people on average weekly earnings a fair go but about our ageing population and the need for services? Borrow, borrow, borrow and push up interest rates. Your record is very clear. So do not come in here with stunts. We want to hear solutions. If you are going to go to the people in my electorate and the rest of Australia later this year, you had better have some hard solutions. Piling it higher and deeper will not do you any good, I can tell you.
Let us talk about the little we have of what the opposition fondly refer to as policies. What is roll-back, how much is it going to cost and where is the money coming from? Again, we have an independent expert in the form of Chris Murphy, and he has determined that, if roll-back costs $4 billion, that equates directly to an extra one per cent in interest rates or, for my people in Dawson with $100,000 mortgages, $80 a month. You are going to pay for roll-back by taking money out of the pockets of my hard-working constituents to the tune of $80 a month to start with. Am I just going on? No, I am not, because we have form.
—We have form, and you, more importantly, have form.
—Order! The member for Braddon will excuse himself from the service of the House, under standing order 304A. 
The member for Braddon then left the chamber.
—At the end of the year Australians, who are known for their shrewdness and commonsense, have a decision to make. Will they risk interest rates of 17 per cent again, or will they stay with a responsible coalition government delivering them 6.8 per cent interest rates? Will they risk again the Labor Party's unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent, a blight on our children, or will they follow a responsible coalition government delivering 6.9 per cent unemployment? Are they going to look again at the big spending, big promise breaking Labor government with taxes of 43 cents in the dollar on average Australians, or will they stay with a responsible coalition government delivering 30 cents in the dollar and more to come? 
What about roll-back? Is it going to be a roll-back of the rebate on private health insurance, as your shadow minister for health foreshadowed a few months ago? Is it going to be a roll-over on the apology to indigenous Australians and a big compensation package? We know that Labor has promised that for the first week of a government under Labor. Are they going to roll back on fuel indexation, on the 1.5 cents per litre, on the diesel fuel rebate that gives our primary producers a go or on the fuel and alternative grants scheme? Do not risk Labor. We know their form. They make promises, they pile it higher and deeper, but they do not deliver. What they do deliver is hard times and hard pains for people in Australia.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—I move:
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of new Law Courts Building, Adelaide.
The government has approved the provision of $76.6 million for the development of the new Commonwealth Law Courts in Adelaide, subject to the normal Public Works Committee processes. The project budget has been revised since the referral motion in February. The Acting Minister for Finance and Administration recently approved additional funding for indexation costs to the completion date of December 2003. 
In 1987, the government endorsed a program to provide clearly identifiable and purpose designed Commonwealth law courts buildings in each capital city of Australia to accommodate the courts and their associated staff and facilities. Adelaide is now the only state capital without such a building. In Adelaide, the Commonwealth jurisdictions, other than the High Court, operate from leased office premises which have been adapted for court purposes. The High Court does not currently have dedicated premises in Adelaide and uses the Supreme Court of South Australia.
The leased accommodation does not adequately provide for the operational and growth requirements of the courts. In addition, the level of security achievable in the building does not provide acceptable protection for judges, staff and the public. Investigations have been undertaken into the options to resolve the long-term accommodation needs of the courts, including the availability of alternative replacement space and potential development sites for a purpose-built Commonwealth courts building. Those investigations conclude that there is no existing building in the Adelaide legal precinct which would permit the conversion of space to establish a facility that would meet the long-term accommodation criteria of the court, and the Angas Street site is the most suitable site for a purpose-built Commonwealth courts building. The site for the proposed development is adjacent to the Magistrates Court on Angas Street in Adelaide. It is subject to a land swap agreement with the government of South Australia. The existing improvements on the site will be demolished by the government of South Australia as part of the agreement.
The proposed work comprises the development of a purpose designed Commonwealth Law Courts building with a net area of about 12,000 square metres to accommodate the High Court of Australia, the Federal Court of Australia, the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Magistrates Service of Australia. The building design provides for flexibility in court operations and the increasing use of new technologies. In its report the committee has recommended that this project proceed. The Department of Finance and Administration agrees with the recommendations of the committee. Ongoing consultation with the Australian Heritage Commission and the Adelaide City Council will continue in relation to the heritage and access matters.
Following the demolition of existing improvements on the site and the transfer of the site to the Commonwealth, subject to parliamentary approval, it is planned to commence construction early next year and be completed by the end of 2003. I would like, on behalf of the government, to thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—I move:
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of new Law Courts Building, Adelaide.
The government has approved the provision of $76.6 million for the development of the new Commonwealth Law Courts in Adelaide, subject to the normal Public Works Committee processes. The project budget has been revised since the referral motion in February. The Acting Minister for Finance and Administration recently approved additional funding for indexation costs to the completion date of December 2003. 
In 1987, the government endorsed a program to provide clearly identifiable and purpose designed Commonwealth law courts buildings in each capital city of Australia to accommodate the courts and their associated staff and facilities. Adelaide is now the only state capital without such a building. In Adelaide, the Commonwealth jurisdictions, other than the High Court, operate from leased office premises which have been adapted for court purposes. The High Court does not currently have dedicated premises in Adelaide and uses the Supreme Court of South Australia.
The leased accommodation does not adequately provide for the operational and growth requirements of the courts. In addition, the level of security achievable in the building does not provide acceptable protection for judges, staff and the public. Investigations have been undertaken into the options to resolve the long-term accommodation needs of the courts, including the availability of alternative replacement space and potential development sites for a purpose-built Commonwealth courts building. Those investigations conclude that there is no existing building in the Adelaide legal precinct which would permit the conversion of space to establish a facility that would meet the long-term accommodation criteria of the court, and the Angas Street site is the most suitable site for a purpose-built Commonwealth courts building.

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—Every individual in our great Australian society has an equal right to the protection of government. That premise informs the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001 and should embolden the commitment of this government and of the Liberal Party of Australia to the right of free association and the protection of citizens from the intimidation, coercion and violence that is woven into the very fabric of the red flag of socialism that resonates so evidently in the trade union movement in Australia.
For too long in this country we have been inclined, as citizens and as legislators, to excuse actions, including threats and bullying, that would be reviled in any other circumstance than the workplace. With the foundation of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 by the now Minister for Defence, the Hon. Peter Reith, Australia began steady progress towards the realisation that crimes and other acts of infamy ought not to be excused on the basis of their perpetrators' class consciousness or enthusiastic zeal. It is to our nation's shame that the preceding history of workplace relations in Australia is littered with a hundred thousand examples of men and women subjected to harassment, intimidation, violence and threats by common thugs in trade union clothes. Too often these crimes, petty or heinous, were excused by recourse to `social justice'—an imagined justice by which the rights of the individual were sacrificed to the rights of the mob. If this apparent justice necessitated depriving the conscientious objector of his or her livelihood, and their family of their security, so be it. How chillingly close is such thinking to the twin ideologies of national socialism and international socialism that stalked the century past.
Edmund Burke was right to dismiss out of hand the notion of cleaving justice away from liberty, for, as he said, `whenever a separation is made between liberty and justice, neither is safe'. Fundamental to our liberty as a nation and as private individuals is our freedom to associate or disassociate. That freedom is enshrined in the Workplace Relations Act and in the Office of the Employment Advocate. Nonetheless, it is a freedom that has been subjected to unceasing attack over the past six months as the trade unions and their parliamentary delegates in this place have sought by subterfuge, bluff and coercion to reverse the trend against union membership. The vehicle for that attempted reversal has been a compulsory fee applied to workers who are not members of the trade union concerned. 
In January this year, non-union workers at Telstra were served with a $400 bill by the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union in Queensland. The CEPU was most cunning in taking this action. They did not specify that the payment—allegedly related to past pay negotiations—was voluntary or compulsory, although they did specify that the `invoice' could be paid by credit card, automatic deduction or single payment. ACTU Secretary Greg Combet was even more opaque in his comments, describing the letter as an `invitation to think about the issue'. The following month, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission released its judgment on the case brought by the Office of the Employment Advocate against a similar $500 fee levied by the Electrical Trades Union. Senior Industrial Relations Commission Vice-President Tony McIntyre found that such fees were clearly designed for coercive purposes; however, they were not prohibited from inclusion in certified agreements. As with the CEPU claim, this fee was significantly in excess of the annual fees charged by the union concerned.
The following day the Australian Services Union indicated that it would begin similar tactics aimed at non-union employees of Ansett and Qantas. The leadership of the National Tertiary Education Union made similar public comments. So did the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Union, the Australian Workers Union, the Victorian Public Service Federation and the Municipal Employees Union, amongst others. By the end of that week, the Health Services Union was implementing another compulsory fee as a companion piece to their disruption of health care services across Victoria. Last month, the ASU was joined by the Transport Workers Union in again threatening non-union staff at Qantas with a compulsory fee—$400 for the TWU, $500 for the ASU. 
To some extent, it is refreshing that the most sensible response to date has been from my state of Western Australia. This appalling behaviour has been experienced in Western Australia, for earlier this month the WA branch of the Australian Nursing Federation announced that it would slug non-union nurses with a $400 fee. This irresponsible action brought upon the ANF the outrage of not just the public and the other health professionals but even of the state Labor government. Premier Geoff Gallop referred to the fee claim as a `red herring' and `not desirable'. He said that unions ought to win members on the basis of the services they offered. Indeed! The West Australian editorialised that the claim was `bizarre' and amounted to nothing more than:
... a clumsy attempt to achieve compulsory unionism—a denial of the principle of freedom of choice ...
It would be a more honest and honourable course—
the paper suggested—
for the ANF to ask itself why nurses choose not to join it, than to continue with its demand for money in a manner that suggests vindictiveness.
Just four days later it was revealed that about 150 nurses had signed a petition of outrage at the ANF's fee, including many current members of the ANF. In fact, it was common knowledge that a majority of the ANF delegates present at the meeting at which the fee was decided thought the whole idea was a joke.
Unfortunately, the proliferation of these intimidatory fees is far from funny. And it is right and just that this bill will amend the Workplace Relations Act to prohibit unions and employer organisations alike from requiring non-members to pay fees for `bargaining services' except where an employee has individually agreed in writing, in advance of the bargaining services being provided, to pay the fee. Understandably, given that such an agreement would be a private matter on behalf of the individual involved, the bill prohibits a certified agreement from including any provision relating to the payment of fees for bargaining services. Furthermore, the bill will also amend the act to prohibit discriminatory action against a person who refuses to pay, or refuses to agree to pay, one of these fees. Both unions and employer groups will not be able to encourage or incite others to take discriminatory action for these same reasons.
We have heard much from the trade union movement and from the opposition in this debate about the rationale for these fees— that is, the rationale other than the boosting of union membership levels, the victimisation of non-union labour and the accumulation of a confiscated nest egg for industrial and political expenditure by the unions and the ALP. Of particular import has been the argument that the fee represents a remedy to a `free-rider' problem. That is, it is suggested that non-union members benefit from union action. Some, including the shadow minister earlier in this debate, have suggested, darkly, that this is a version of user pays. Leaving aside the temerity with which unions—and I include in this category the university student guilds—compare their position to that of the states and the Commonwealth, this free-rider argument does not stand up to reasonable critique. As Mark Paterson, from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, noted on 14 February this year:
... unions negotiate agreements on behalf of their members, and have a clear interest in applying the outcome to non-members to ensure that their members are not undercut by other employees. This has been the traditional approach of unions to awards, and they are now using the same technique with agreements. In short, they act to prevent competition.
So in fact, far from being a free-rider problem, there is an abject opposition on the part of organised labour in this country to the differential remuneration of union and non-union workers.  
Worse still is the suggestion that this intimidation can be excused on the basis that a majority of employees support its imposition on a minority. That has been the case in the examples I cited earlier, Qantas and Telstra, and is quite a shocking proposition. I am reminded of James Fenimore Cooper's statement that it is:
... a besetting vice of democracies to substitute public opinion for law. This is the usual form in which masses of men exhibit their tyranny.
Australia is a liberal democracy. In a liberal democracy, tyranny is not excused by majoritarian support. That a majority of employees in one place might want to persecute a minority of their fellow employees is neither here nor there, so it would seem. But the proper question is that of the persecution.
Some defenders of the compulsory fee have gone even further, suggesting, in the words of New South Wales Labour Council Secretary Michael Costa, that:
 ... non-members do not have to join anything, just pay for a service.
That is an incredible statement, for the payment in question is one demanded of someone with whom the union does not have a relationship, for services that they did not request or agree to, at an inflated rate and often some considerable time after the alleged service. Outside of workplace relations, such behaviour is regarded as plain extortion, but that extortion should be wielded as an industrial weapon should come as no surprise. As I have already suggested to this House, the compulsory fees for non-unionists is not a perversion of trade unionism; it is a distillation of the intimidation and thuggery that is fundamental to the union movement and its governing ideology.
Western Australians are well aware of the degree to which trade unions and their personnel operate outside of the law and outside of common decency. I have previously mentioned the current Premier of my state in a positive light with regard to the demands of the ANF. His performance with regard to other renegade unions in Western Australia is far less worthy. Since February, Western Australian employers and non-union employees have been subjected to extraordinary behaviour that would be dealt with under the fullest extent of the law were it not cloaked in the garb of unionism. Just weeks after the state election, building sites across Perth were visited by union thugs who intimidated employers and employees alike, destroyed property, glued locks and stopped construction work. Within two months, `no ticket, no start' signs appeared on numerous building sites across the city, including the new Woodside headquarters on the corner of Milligan Street and St Georges Terrace and the residential apartments site on the corner of Victoria Avenue. The obvious intention was to intimidate workers and their employers and openly flout freedom of association protections. CFMEU boss Kevin Reynolds denied that these signs, visible across the cityscape, were indicative of compulsory unionism. `Perish the thought,' said Big Kev, `our policy for years has been to achieve full union membership in the industry. These sites are 100 per cent union members by choice.' Quite how the particular phrase `no ticket, no start' represents persuasion rather than coercion is not readily apparent. 
Since these developments, subcontractors have been refused access to building sites and the situation in Western Australia has become embroiled in the wider crisis facing the CFMEU across Australia—a crisis apparently still founded in a split between those union militants whose sympathy is with the dark side of the defunct Soviet Union and those whose sympathies lie with their counterparts in Beijing.
It is also worrying that the building industry task forces established in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia in the early 1990s to fight corruption in the building industry have been victims of political persecution by the ALP. Once the Carr government was elected in 1995, the New South Wales task force was disbanded. Likewise, the Queensland task force was wound up the week after Peter Beattie was elected Premier in 1996. Unfortunately, this has also come to pass in Western Australia. In April, only two months after the state election, the Western Australia task force members were issued with redundancy notices. 
There is a very real threat to our civil society from violence excused by politics. I have already expressed in this place my disdain for, and concern about, the violence and destruction of the S11 riots in Melbourne last year. I add to those comments my further concerns about the May Day riots in our capital cities last month. We seem to have reached a point in our political and civil discourse where we can define the assault of police officers, the intimidation of the public, the destruction of private and public property and the robbing of workers of their livelihoods as `peaceful protest'. This parallels the accommodation of violent picketing, mass assaults and vandalism as part of `normal picketing'. These deceits cannot be allowed to continue. A crime is a crime whether or not its perpetrator sports a sloganeering T-shirt. Political crimes should carry no more moral weight than street crimes. A worker is robbed of their livelihood whether or not their assailant is a lone criminal or a picketing mob.
As governments, state and federal, we are obliged to protect Australians from these deceits. This bill represents one step in that direction. It will prevent unions from using compulsory fees to deceive and intimidate workers who choose not to join a union or who wish to leave a trade union. I acknowledge the particular and principled contribution of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business in fighting for fundamental Australian fairness in our society. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1,speech
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—in reply—I thank all members who have participated in this debate, starting with the shadow minister, the member for Brisbane, and concluding with an excellent speech from my friend and colleague the member for Curtin—a speech which certainly should be well reported and which I hope she is about to submit to the West Australian for its attention.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001 is essentially about freedom of association. It is about ensuring the fundamental right of Australian workers to freedom of association in the workplace. It is about ensuring that we do not have a return to de facto compulsory unionism through the device of what the union movement calls `bargaining agent fees' but what are more properly known as compulsory union levies. 
I can understand traditional unionists being rather concerned about the state of the union movement because over the last couple of decades we have seen union membership in Australia drop from over 50 per cent of the work force to under 25 per cent of the work force. Union membership is now under 20 per cent of the private sector work force for the first time, and for the first time it is under 50 per cent of the public sector work force.
In response to this long-term, dramatic decline in union membership, the ACTU last year adopted a policy of trying to force non-union members in otherwise unionised workplaces to pay what they described as `bargaining agent fees' but which, as I said, are more appropriately likened to compulsory union levies set at or above the level of union fees. This was rightly challenged by the Employment Advocate, who has the duty and the charge of defending freedom of association principles under the Workplace Relations Act. Unfortunately, even though the Industrial Relations Commission—a single deputy president of the commission— held that these fees were in fact designed to coerce people into the union movement, for a host of technical reasons he decided that they were not unlawful under the act. While the advocate is appealing this decision, with the full support of the federal government, it is also a fact that that appeal may fail. This government is determined to ensure that, come what may with that appeal, the principle of freedom of association in the workplace is maintained. 
This government is opposed to industrial conscription. We are opposed to industrial conscription for some of the reasons I have already indicated, but we are particularly opposed to industrial conscription because, under the relationship that exists between the union movement and the Australian Labor Party, industrial conscription is also political conscription. People who are conscripted into trade unions are also conscripted into a relationship, a financial relationship, with the union movement, and this is the last thing that the Australian people would like to see—people being effectively press-ganged into union membership and, by extension, effectively press-ganged into association with a political party which they may have absolutely no wish to be associated with.
The effect of these compulsory union levies, if this bill is not passed by the parliament, will be that the six million non-union workers in Australia could be forced to pay about $500 a year in these fees. If this bill is not passed by the parliament, six million non-union members in Australia could face a $500 a year union tax, thanks to this activity of the ACTU, which the shadow minister has indicated will be supported by the opposition. Even though the shadow minister has indicated the opposition's support in this parliament for this outrageous state of affairs, the Labor Party is obviously very nervous about it. As the member for Curtin pointed out earlier, Premier Gallop of Western Australia has attacked a $400 compulsory union fee for non-union nurses in Western Australia. He said in the West Australian of 7 June:
It complicates the matter and I think it's not desirable to have that on the agenda at the moment.
The paper reports:
Dr Gallop said unions should win members on the basis of the services they offered.
On this matter Geoff Gallop is absolutely right. On this matter so is his Minister for Labour Relations, John Kobelke, who said, and again I am quoting the West Australian of 7 June:
We think unions need to get out and provide services to their members and attract new members on what they can offer.
Unions should get members on the basis of what they can offer. Unions should be no different from any other organisation in society—any business, any lobby group or any political party. They should attract members on the basis of what they can offer, not because people are being compulsorily press-ganged on board. As I said, this is industrial and political conscription that we are opposing with this legislation. It is not just about compulsory membership of unions, it is not just about coercing people to join unions; it is about coercing people to contribute to the Australian Labor Party.
In his contribution earlier today the shadow minister, the member for Brisbane, had underpinning his remarks two fundamental points that he was attempting to assert. The first point was that people are not in fact coerced to pay these fees. The second point he tried to make was that people are free to make these arrangements. Both of these contentions from the member for Brisbane are false. In situations like this, the union goes along to the employer and attempts to negotiate a certified agreement. No-one other than the union officials is involved in these negotiations with the employer.
The government is aware of one instance involving a manufacturing business in Minto, New South Wales, where non-union members nominated a non-unionist to represent them in negotiations because the non-union members were very concerned about a log of claims served on their employer by the Metal Workers Union including, as it happens, the $500 bargaining agent's free. In this instance, union representatives refused to negotiate with the employer if the non-union representative was involved in the negotiation process, and the employer, I am afraid, subsequently told the non-union members that they could not be represented and that the agreement would be solely negotiated by the Metal Workers Union. The fact is that non-union members in these workplaces do not have the freedom to engage in negotiations, as the member for Brisbane asserted. Even if they did have that freedom, why should 49 per cent be coerced by 51 per cent? Why should 51 per cent of the workers in a workplace have the right to force the other 49 per cent to pay a fee or, in effect, to join a union? 
The member for Brisbane said that we should not restrict the ability of people in the workplace to put what they wanted into a collective agreement. The legislation, as it stands, prevents many things from going into certified agreements if those things are unconscionable or contrary to public policy. It would be absurd, ludicrous and against the law for people to include in a certified agreement restrictions, for instance, on whether pregnant women, older people or younger people should be employed in a workplace. This bill simply seeks to enshrine in that list of things that cannot be done by certified agreement something else which is contrary to good public policy—that is, coercion of people in breach of ordinary freedom of association principles.
The member for Brisbane talked about the so-called free-rider argument, an argument that the member for Brisbane thinks has been supported by Senator Murray of the Democrats. There is quite an easy solution to this problem. If the union officials or the unionists at a particular workplace deeply resent the fact that non-union members may be covered by an award or agreement that the union has negotiated, do not cover them. Say that the award or agreement is going to cover only certain workers. The reason for that is that the unions want the award or agreement to cover everyone. If they want the award or agreement to cover everyone, they cannot complain and use this free-rider argument.
What the unions want is nothing more than a scam. If a private business were trying to do what the unions want and what the Labor Party is supporting, it would be rightly denounced as an absolute rort, a rip-off and a scam. If someone walks past my house and decides that it is looking a bit shabby and that I need the garden fixed, the door replaced and the front fence painted and proceeds to do that without my permission and without seeking agreement in advance and, when I come home, attempts to present me with a $500 bill, that would be nothing but a scam and a rip-off.
The principle that members opposite are attempting to establish in the case of unions has very interesting ramifications. They say that the union allegedly helps people and therefore everyone who is allegedly helped by the benefit that the union provides must be forced to pay a fee or a compulsorily membership fee. No doubt, on the employer side, employer organisations negotiate agreements and awards. Should they be able to charge everyone, whether they are a member or not, a compulsory fee? Political parties help the whole community. The Liberal Party certainly helps the whole of the Australian community. Some might even argue that the Labor Party helps the whole of the Australian community. Does that mean that people should be forced to pay a compulsory fee to the Liberal Party or the Labor Party? Of course it does not. Yet at the heart of this notion of industrial conscription, which members opposite are trying to support through their opposition to this legislation, is the even more insidious principle of political conscription, because of the relationship between the union movement and the Labor Party.
The member for Brisbane tried to draw a link between the government's mutual obligation policies and the situation that he wants to see in the work force: namely, people forced to pay service fees or compulsory levies to the union movement. The essential difference is that people to whom the government applies mutual obligation asked for the benefit. They asked for the benefit and they are paid to the benefit. The people to whom the Australian Labor Party wants to apply its version of mutual obligation do not ask for the benefit. And then you ask yourself: what is the benefit? As speakers on this side of the parliament have pointed out, the so-called benefit of union membership in many industries is the benefit of being on strike when they do not want to be, the benefit of being coerced by union organisers when they do not want to be or the benefit of not being able to enter into Australian workplace agreements, despite the far better pay and conditions that people receive on average under these agreements. 
The member for Brisbane also likened this to the registration fees that lawyers and doctors pay. There is a fundamental difference between a registration requirement for the practice of a profession or the plying of a trade and being forced to join an association like a trade union. The fact is that what members opposite are perpetrating is nothing but a scam on the ordinary workers of this country. The member for Brisbane accused the government of trampling on the normal processes of the courts by not permitting the Industrial Relations Commission to decide this matter prior to bringing legislation into this House. In case the member for Brisbane and his colleagues opposite have forgotten, it is this parliament which determines the law of the land. All the courts or commissions do is interpret the law as it stands and as it is set by this parliament. If this government or parliament is not happy with the state of the law, it has every right, and indeed a duty, to change it. And that is exactly what the government is going to do with this bill.
Political parties are not allowed to press-gang people into membership. Business is not allowed to press-gang people into being customers. Trade unions certainly should not be able to press-gang people into membership. This is an important bill, a necessary bill and a bill in defence of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Australian people. It should be supported by this House. It is to the eternal embarrassment, shame and disgrace of members opposite that they are not supporting this bill. It is to the eternal embarrassment, shame and disgrace of members opposite that they want to levy a $500-a-year union tax on the five million non-union workers in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.
Question put:
That the bill be now read a second time.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1,speech
"Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—The Patents Amendment Bill 2001 amends the Patents Act 1990 to implement changes to Australia's intellectual property framework, particularly in respect of the filing and treatment of patents and patents applications. The government's bill is based largely on the recommendations of both the Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee's report, Review of intellectual property legislation under the competition principles agreement and the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property's review of enforcement of industrial property rights.
The bill makes the following broad changes to the existing patenting regime in Australia. It firstly expands the scope of the information that an invention can be compared against to ensure it complies with the novelty and inventiveness test of the Patents Act. It replaces with a more stringent test the requirement that a patent applicant be given the benefit of the doubt in relation to those tests, and it introduces a requirement for applicants to provide the Commissioner of Patents with the results of any searches that may be relevant to determining whether an invention meets the novelty and inventiveness tests. The bill also makes a number of minor and technical amendments to the Patents Act. This includes an amendment to better protect the interests of third parties, where they have begun to use an invention before the patent owner has sought protection for that invention.
The government has argued that the amendments to this bill are consistent with the patenting requirements in many other countries and will prevent patents being granted in Australia for inventions that would not be patentable in those countries. While this view is generally agreed by patent attorneys and other relevant parties, the bill also contains provisions which some commentators and legal practitioners believe may be prejudicial to Australia's inventors and researchers. These are the features that concern me particularly.
The bill contains two further amendments that are designed to make the provisions of the Patents Act 1990 conform with the conditions currently proposed for the international patent law treaty, also known as the PLT, in anticipation of Australia's possible future accession to that treaty. The PLT is intended to make it easier for patent applicants to obtain patent rights in a number of countries by standardising the formality requirements associated with the patent application process. Once fully implemented, the provisions of the treaty will make applying for patents in several countries easier and potentially cheaper as patenting rules will be consistent across all member states.
In this case, one of the attendant amendments introduces a period of time, also referred to as a grace period, during which the inventor or developer of a patentable object may publish or otherwise discuss the object without jeopardising the right to patent the object. In the laws of most countries, with the exception of the United States of America, Canada and Japan, any publication which occurs before a patent application is filled will irrevocably constitute a bar to the obtaining of a patent for the invention so published. The grace period provides a formal mechanism for early publication to occur.
As is often the case with such agreements, early adopters of the treaty conditions may in fact be penalised by the fact that other jurisdictions where there is equal access to material published elsewhere under a grace condition will not protect the right of the creator or developer to patent the object in that jurisdiction after publication, regardless of the country of publication. Clearly, this would disadvantage Australian innovators, as they would not be protected in some key markets, including the European Union and some parts of South-East Asia. The recent Ergas committee which reviewed Australia's intellectual property laws, while supporting a period of grace per se, made the following observation: 
... in the event that moves to introduce such a grace period are made by the European Patent Organisation on an expeditious basis, in the context of the European Patent Convention, then the introduction of a grace period in Australia should be coordinated with an introduction in Europe.
Several other patents attorneys have made this observation to us too.
In addition to the dangers to Australian applicants discussed above, patent lawyers have raised other potential problems associated with the introduction of a grace period which may affect Australian industry. In particular, such a proposal may attenuate the time in which a state of uncertainty would exist as to whether or not Australian industry could make use of material that was publicly available in Australia. The premature adoption of a grace period could therefore most prejudice those whom it is allegedly designed to benefit: in other words, those in the academic community who are likely to publish their work in the mistaken belief that the grace period provisions of the Australian legislation will protect them from self-anticipation in their most important international markets. It is this point that creates the greatest concerns with this bill.
Australia is already at a comparative disadvantage internationally in respect of our performance in developing new ideas and innovative products and services. This bill may risk leaving us further behind. That is why we hope that members in the Senate will actually take some time to look at the specific provisions of the bill which may jeopardise Australian inventions, because patents, of course, are a very important indicator of the character of national innovation and patents may be issued for any invention that is novel. We certainly do not want Australians to be penalised. As I have already suggested, at a time when the number of patents applied for and granted in other parts of the world can be seen to be accelerating, we have seen a relatively sluggish performance in Australia. We do not want to jeopardise that even further. Indeed, the CSIRO undertook a recent study on the subject and found that, based on our GDP and comparing us with like nations, the number of patents listed should have been 1,350, and not 800 as it was, for example, in 1998. That is a very significant deficit when compared with other nations.
As Simon Marginson and his colleagues point out in a recent paper on Australia's performance as a knowledge economy, Australia is falling well behind most of the major developed nations in investing in knowledge. As a result, Australia is putting its future position in a knowledge based world seriously at risk. We simply do not want to add to that risk without further examination.
Marginson and his colleagues argue that the net result of this growing disparity is a reduction in our national capacity to engage in, and capitalise on, innovation and the continual improvement and refinement of our performance as a knowledge economy. The further we fall behind, the harder it will be to catch up with our trading partners and international competitors. Ironically, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, argue that the reverse is true. They see Australia's growing trade deficit in some key areas—for example, in information and communication technology—as evidence of Australia's success as a new economy. Nothing could be further from the truth. As Marginson and his coworkers explain: 
Australia's outstanding recent record of investment in fixed assets actually marks us an obsolete economy. In a global knowledge economy, investment in knowledge increases in relation to investment in fixed assets. In Australia in the 1990's, and especially after 1995, the ratio moved sharply in the opposite direction.
They go on to describe Australia as having:
... squandered the opportunity presented by the long period of economic growth.
Hardly the intelligent island of TV watchers advocated by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. In fact, our innovation performance now appears to be well below that of comparable economies, and shows little sign of recovering soon. The same is true of our patent performance.
Despite a long period of significant improvement in our research and development performance between 1984 and 1995, the share of GDP devoted to research and development has declined dramatically since 1996-97, mainly due to reductions in business sector R&D, which is a direct result of the cutbacks to Commonwealth contributions to private sector R&D made by the Howard government. As Marginson notes:
While a sample of comparable OECD countries increased their R&D expenditure by 4.2% between 1995 and 1998, and US expenditure increased by 5%, Australian R&D expenditure fell by 15.4%.
In some market sectors where innovation is of critical importance—for instance, in high-tech industries such as electronics and software—our innovation performance, or lack thereof, has manifested itself in some very dramatic ways. For example, Australia's comparative position in the manufacture of communications and information equipment has declined significantly in recent years, while in terms of the direct contribution of the information industries—known broadly as the flagship of knowledge industries—to the national economy Australia ranks last of those OECD countries for which information is available.
Even the Prime Minister's own Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, in a report late last year on Australia's IT performance, found:
While Australia has been a good user of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), it has not captured the major benefits of being a producer of ICT goods and services. This is demonstrated in Australia's export and patent performance.
So, again, we do not want to jeopardise an already fragile patent performance. They go on:
By comparison with most OECD countries Australia has failed to position itself to participate in the benefits from the many opportunities offered by ICT.
Despite receiving this advice, the Prime Minister insists on relying only on his convenient usage and `take-up' statistics, which again is ironic, given that his council also found:
Government efforts to stimulate the development of new ICT intellectual property have been inadequate, and have led to a focus on using ICT rather than creating an environment for ICT innovation.
The Prime Minister at present is the one who has been found guilty as charged of attempting to cut off the debate on this point. He simply refuses to see that we must measure ourselves against global benchmarks— technological change and the maturation of international markets will require it. There will be no hiding our heads in the sand in these international fora. After all, our trading partners and competitors are already performing well against such measures, and they, if not we, will surely judge us by their performance, so why not the reverse? As Marginson and his colleagues point out: 
Between the mid 1980's and the mid 1990's, exports of knowledge intensive goods increased faster than imports, but after 1995 the reverse occurred. Because of the nation's failure to invest in knowledge and in knowledge based industries, Australia is now experiencing a growing trade deficit in knowledge intensive products such as pharmaceuticals, computing equipment, telecommunications and road vehicles. This deficit in knowledge intensive products alone is sufficient to explain the negative trade balance overall, and the dramatic growth of foreign debt, and arguably has played a significant role in global perceptions of Australia as an old economy—which have fed into the weakening market position of the Australian dollar.
Because of our concern about the current state of innovation in Australia and our concern, too, about this legislation potentially placing Australian inventors at a further disadvantage in the international market, we will, as I say, be attempting to have these matters further examined in the Senate. In the meantime, I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“the House notes concerns expressed in relation to the bill and the circumstances of its introduction, in particular: 
(1)	the absence of a proper Government response to the ERGAS Committee report and the consequent failure of the Government to allow a full and proper public debate on the issues before settling the measure, and

"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—This measure before the House implements a number of recommendations which are drawn from the government's innovation action plan for the future, Backing Australia's Ability. This is not a mere slogan. It is a comprehensive suite of policies across a broad range of government portfolio areas that is intended to tap and harness the characteristically inventive and ingenious quality of the Australian people. In particular, it stems from the recommendations of the Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee's report Review of intellectual property legislation under the competition principles agreement and, secondly, the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property's review of enforcement of industrial property rights. As I mentioned, the foundation document Backing Australia's Ability involves a commitment of $2.9 billion in Commonwealth funding over the next five years. I would suggest that that represents the most significant individual commitment of resources to innovation that has ever been witnessed in Australian history.
The specific measure before the House strengthens the process of patent application and seeks to bring the Australian process for registering patents into line with what takes place in the rest of the world. This is a critically important objective because of the fact that knowledge is a global phenomenon. Australia has to place itself in a position both to harness the knowledge generated in other countries around the world and to ensure that Australian inventors are not disadvantaged— that we give them a platform from which they can project Australian innovation to markets around the world. We seek here to actually strengthen the requirements for registering a patent in Australia by a number of means, firstly, to ensure that the tests for inventiveness and novelty are strengthened by allowing the registrar to consider a wider body of material on inventiveness and, secondly, to submit a more stringent test than the benefit of the doubt test which previously prevailed. The amendments are consistent with requirements in other countries and will prevent patents being granted in Australia for inventions that would not be patentable in other countries.
The objective here is, as I said, to draw out, to harness and to develop the great Australian ideas. Many of us will have had the experience of constituents coming to see us with concerns about Australian ideas being lost to the rest of the world, of Australian inventors having difficulty accessing capital, registering their patents and developing them in Australia. In fact, the Prime Minister pointed out in his own introduction to the Backing Australia's Ability package a number of those inventions which we have seen go offshore. Among them, for example, is the black box technology in aircraft, which was invented here in Australia but was developed overseas; likewise, the gene technology process, which was invented in Australia but was developed overseas. We are looking to ensure, through this measure and through the entire Backing Australia's Ability package, that more of those good ideas are developed commercially here. There are two things that we are seeking to achieve: firstly, we want to retain the benefit of commercial development of the ideas in Australia; and, secondly—and this is a critical objective—we want to retain the brains in Australia. We want to retain the best and the brightest people in Australia. We do not want to see a situation where our most brilliant postgraduate students, for example, cannot find places in Australian institutions— 
—Brilliant students like the member for Parramatta.
—The minister at the table is overly generous—but certainly brilliant students like those in the member for Parramatta's electorate. For example, my electorate has the most concentrated health research precinct of anywhere in Australia, with two teaching hospitals, Westmead Hospital and the New Children's Hospital. Around them is a concentration of medical and biotechnology research, such as the Children's Medical Research Institute and the Westmead Millennium Foundation. I might add that the Westmead Millennium Foundation, in the last two years alone, has registered 12 new patents in critical areas of diagnostics in particular, which are making the world safer, which are saving lives and which are also keeping the 300 medical researchers based at those two centres here in Australia, under intense pressure from competitive institutions in other parts of the world. That is the objective.
It is not just rhetoric on the part of the government. We have backed our verbal concerns with a concrete allocation of resources. The Backing Australia's Ability statement includes an R&D tax concession rate of 175 per cent for additional labour related R&D expenditure, it gives $535 million over five years to continue the research and development start grants and it doubles funding for the Australian Research Council grants over the next five years. For what it is worth, I am currently pitching to the Prime Minister and the minister that, under the Backing Australia's Ability statement, we now have a capacity to create world-class centres of excellence in information and communications technology and to create major national research facilities to undertake large-scale research of national significance. There could be no more appropriate place to make that investment than in this health research precinct that we have at Westmead. 
There are two, if you like, competing challenges in this task of the creation and dissemination of knowledge. The first is to give sufficient incentive and reward to the individual inventors to encourage the process of invention, and the second is to do that in a way that does not unduly inhibit the dissemination and use of that newly created knowledge. They are the two interests which we are attempting to balance in the measure before the House.
The member for Fremantle mentioned a concern about the grace period. The grace period is intended to ensure that an inventor who comes forward seeking a patent and who is unsuccessful in the first instance is given an opportunity to address the defects in the original application. It is a matter of natural justice, if you like, that you should not be faced with a precipice situation where you either completely succeed or completely fail, with just a one-off opportunity to present your case. The legislation rightly allows this grace period so that the inventor might have an opportunity to meet with the registrar, to go through individually the concerns raised with the registrar, if necessary to contest the questions raised in relation to inventiveness and novelty, and if possible to rectify those defects before all of that work in generation of the original application is wasted. The concerns about the grace period have been specifically addressed by the government in this measure. The Backing Australia's Ability statement clearly announced the government's intention to introduce a grace period. The Patents Amendment Bill 2001 does not contain amendments to implement the grace period, but the grace period will more appropriately be implemented by making amendments to the Patents Regulations. There is still ample opportunity for any interested groups to provide input into the details of its implementation. 
The bill is consistent with the exhaustive and rigorous process of consultation which has taken place since the government fulfilled its undertaking in the 1998 election to have a National Innovation Summit. This document arises out of the recommendations which were conceived at the Innovation Summit, were further considered by the Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee and subsequently by the Advisory Council on Industrial Property. We hope that the intellectual property community—if I can describe it in that way—will continue to grow and flourish. That community has warmly welcomed this commitment of $2.9 billion in funds for this legislation and has had an extensive input to the development of the legislation.
This capacity for invention, innovation and novelty is a uniquely human capability. It is one of the things which, I suggest, distinguishes us from the rest of the animal kingdom. We are not beings that respond purely by instinct. We are not creatures of the jungle who act entirely on the basis of our genetic code. We have been given this unique, some might even say divine, capability to imagine a world different from the one in which we exist today. Management consultants, when looking at the difference between companies that flourish and those that wither away, have identified a concept described as latency. Latency is the question of how effectively an organisation recognises a good idea, promotes it through the decision making hierarchy and then acts upon it, producing some positive outcome, some change in culture. We as a nation must recognise this tendency to latency, to inertia, the tendency of human beings to be conservative, reactionary and to resist that which is new and different. For example, in this parliament we need to have a capacity to encourage debate, to nurture new ideas and to lift up those who are providing a fresh perspective.
Recently, I mentioned the great sadness that many of us on this side of the House have felt, for example, when the member for Werriwa—clearly a person of significant intellect, who has been widely published— came forward, having spent months and months in consultations developing a new education policy, but that policy was simply too startling, too innovative, too refreshingly different to survive that little cadre of nameless powerbrokers within the ALP who usually occupy the advisers' desks over there. Although not elected, they seem to be the ones who wield the real power in the organisation. So we saw, in the case of the member for Werriwa, a crushing of innovation and a statement by the Australian Labor Party that that sort of fresh thinking could simply not be tolerated; that, while Great Britain was capable of producing New Labour, it would be very much business as usual here. I do not want to make a purely partisan point. All of us need to have the capacity to tolerate difference, to be appreciative of the new. This bill is a step towards that in this patent registration process.
The question of prior art is really the basis upon which novelty is established. An inventor has to be able to demonstrate that the idea which he or she is promoting as new has not been thought of by someone else, either in Australia or somewhere in the world. Fairly exhaustive searches of the prior art take place before any particular patent is submitted for consideration. The bill now requires the searches undertaken by the patentee to be disclosed to the registrar. This is an important new safeguard in the legislation. It is important because it means that we do not have Australian inventors who go through all the work of preparing a patent and believe their intellectual property to be adequately protected, only to find, when they seek to exploit the patent in some other jurisdiction, that a court finds that basic principles of novelty have not really been established. 
What you see, contrary to the assertions of the member for Fremantle, is not Australia falling behind the rest of the world in this measure; it is specifically designed to ensure that Australia can participate as peers with the rest of the world. As I say, it follows an extensive period of consultation and has had the input of the legal profession specialising in intellectual property and of the inventors themselves. I regard it as a sensible compromise between those two goals, providing incentive and reward to the individual patentee while allowing the dissemination and exploitation of new knowledge. I think it is a thoroughly worthy measure and I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>PATENTS AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,51,1,speech
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"— The Patents Amendment Bill 2001 proposes amendments to the Patents Act 1990. As outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, these are by way of, firstly, expanding the scope of the information that an invention can be compared against to ensure that it complies with the novelty and inventiveness test of the Patents Act; secondly, replacing the requirement that a patent applicant be given the benefit of the doubt in relation to these tests with a more stringent test; and, thirdly, introducing a requirement for applicants to provide the commissioner with the results of any searches they have carried out that may be relevant in determining whether an invention meets these tests. The bill also makes two minor amendments to bring the provisions of the Patents Act into line with the proposed patent law treaty, pursuant to Australia's possible accession to that treaty.
In his second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources indicated that these amendments will increase the scope of the information the commissioner can take into account in deciding whether an invention involves an inventive and innovative step and will more closely align our practices with those of Europe and the United States. Therefore, it is an opportunity to talk briefly about the global context in which we see our patent law developing and the protection of intellectual property.
Globalisation means that the issues of patents and intellectual property have in turn become issues that require global solutions. The days when an invention or piece of innovation could be protected by the laws of one jurisdiction and required protection to be lodged in each individual jurisdiction are gone. Technological advancement and the needs of modern society have meant that a streamlined, faster system is required and that the laws of one jurisdiction are simply inadequate to protect intellectual property.
The example of the European patent system is one that has proved the best example of multijurisdictional arrangements. It is an example of successful economic and political cooperation between the states of Europe. It provides patent protection in up to 19 European countries on the basis of a single patent application and a single grant procedure. The patents can be extended to additional countries by the signing of agreements with the European patent organisation. The significance of the European Patent Office is that it represents this shift to a bloc of jurisdictions making their own arrangements. Of course Australia is not exactly analogous in this context because ideas as to the way in which we can embrace blocs are not so immediate. But, as has been indicated in the second reading speech, we would in turn look to perhaps Europe and the United States as two of the most powerful blocs of patent law.
Since Federation, Australia has had a fine history in developing its protection of intellectual property and patent law. It has set about—and I have had the opportunity to debate previous amendments to the Patents Act—doing things of its own volition where it sees that as being in the national interest. Australia can fast-track its own acceptance procedures and approvals for items such as pharmaceuticals when it deems that it is in the public interest to do so as quickly as possible. If substantial work has already been done overseas, in some cases that work does not need to be repeated here in Australia before approval occurs. I acknowledge that pharmaceuticals are a special case, but it is still important to look at them in terms of the way in which the patent law applies to them. 
This debate gives us an opportunity to look at some of the more controversial issues of drug or pharmaceutical patents which have been in the news in recent months in a global context. There has been international outrage at the use of drug patents to deny developing nations access to cheap AIDS drugs, for instance. This issue has generated so much controversy that last week the World Trade Organisation devoted one day of its three-day meeting in Geneva to the issue. The issue is that, under WTO rules, developing nations are obliged to protect international patents, including those on new drugs. This means that cheaper generic versions are unavailable to developing nations and they too must pay what the pharmaceutical companies demand for them. This makes these much needed drugs virtually inaccessible for the vast majority of developing nations.
There was a much publicised court case which collapsed in April where 39 pharmaceutical companies attempted to deny South Africa access to the cheaper drugs. It was a public relations nightmare for the companies involved and made them look as though they were putting their patent right ahead of one of the most serious public health issues in the world today. No-one disputes these companies' right to make profits for their shareholders, but surely there must still be some sort of altruism in today's world in the sharing and commercialisation of intellectual property. This is particularly the case when we are dealing with issues of public health.
The very first modern wonder drug, penicillin, was never patented. The British government in 1928 decided that such a discovery with such great benefit for the whole world should never be a monopoly. That is perhaps the dilemma about some of the developing technologies that we have, where the commercial interest perhaps overrides some greater public benefit that can be had by the sharing of the intellectual property.
In the case of this piece of legislation, the opposition has moved an amendment to the motion that the bill be read a second time. The first item of the amendment goes to the fact that there is not at present a proper government response to the Ergas committee and, therefore, we have the failure of the government to allow full and proper public debate of the issues before settling on measures, some of which are contained in this bill.
The second item in the second reading amendment goes to the potential problems with the legislation, including elements of uncertainty in the application of the regulations. The honourable member for Parramatta has already raised his contention on the point made by the honourable member for Fremantle about the grace period—that this is all going to be solved by the regulations under any act that comes from these proposed amendments. The point we make is that we have not had a discussion of the type that is required. That brings me to what is described even in the explanatory memorandum as a minor amendment for the purpose of trying to make the Patent Act itself more in line with the proposed patent law treaty. It is interesting that this parliament has developed a committee whose main aim is to look at treaties that Australia enters into. I would have thought that at some stage the patent law treaty might need to be thoroughly considered in the context of what is happening.
One of the things that intrigues me is how we can harmonise our patent law with the laws of the two largest global blocs, that is, the United States and Europe. How can we reconcile our law—and some might say only subtly—with the laws of those blocs when they appear to have a different attitude to the grace period? As I understand it, Europe is only slowly moving towards the type of measure that is being proposed. What we would want to have in Australia is some certainty that, if the intention of government is to bring us into line with the way in which the global community is moving and the way in which it looks at the protection of intellectual property, we will be able to do so. 
In a lot of these issues to do with globalisation, sometimes it is a bit difficult for not only the general public but some of the practitioners to be sure that there has been proper discussion and debate about the issues at hand. In fact, in the context of other debates that go on about globalisation, it is always a point of contention about whether the processes in which we involve ourselves are truly transparent. I think that in an area such as this, where the government claims that it is trying to promote Australia's ability to be innovative, that it is trying to promote businesses no matter what size they are and institutes of research no matter where they are to be confident that they can develop intellectual property and get it properly protected, the processes that we go about in setting the law and the regulations that pertain to those things should be seen to be completely transparent. We should be able to see and have the fullest of consultation.
So here, very late in a session, we are seeing this piece of legislation go through. As the honourable member for Fremantle has indicated, the opposition will be pursuing through the Senate system a number of the matters that have been raised in the very brief and short debate that we have had here in the House of Representatives. We hope that that will enable a fuller and greater discussion of the issues and will ensure that those who have a particular interest in this subject are able to put their case; that, in our manner of developing Australia's response to what is going on globally in relation to protection of intellectual property, we are perceived to be not leading the field in order to get gold medals as the first to be approaching full globalisation about everything but rather actually putting in place measures that truly do encourage innovation; and that, whilst acting as global citizens, we are able to protect our national interest. I hope—and I know that you personally would appreciate this, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick—that, in our overriding intent of protecting the uses of intellectual property in the national interest, we do not go too far in ignoring the way in which we can apply many of the innovations to assist in many of the things that are happening in the world where Australia can show a great deal of leadership. I support the second reading amendment. I hope that the government is able to find its way to seriously address those matters that have been raised in the debate.",REPS,<title>PATENTS AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,51,1,speech
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—In summing up the second reading debate on the Patents Amendment Bill 2001, I would like to thank all of those members who contributed to the debate on this bill. In particular, I would like to thank the member for Fremantle, who raised issues relating to consultation leading up to this bill and to grace periods.
In addressing the consultation process, I would suggest that this bill picks up the results of a very extensive consultation process with a wide range of interest groups, including the Innovation Summit in February 2000 and culminating in the Prime Minister's launch of Backing Australia's Ability: An Innovation Action Plan for the Future in January this year. The government's intention to strengthen the examination of novelty and inventive step was featured in the Backing Australia's Ability statement. The Backing Australia's Ability statement made it clear that these initiatives were to be fast-tracked ahead of any formal government response to the recommendations of the Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee and of the Advisory Council on Industrial Property review of patent enforcement. The amendments in this bill implement the BAA commitment.
Both the IPCRC and ACIP consulted widely in the preparation of their reports. All of the IPCRC recommendations that are implemented in this bill were in their interim report. Therefore, interest groups had the opportunity to provide comments on these issues before the final report was released. The government, in progressing the BAA initiatives, has also consulted widely with representatives of all major interest groups, including the Institute of Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys of Australia. 
With regard to the grace period, the member for Fremantle suggested that there are only three countries that actually have the grace period. I do not know where she got her information from, because the reality is that there are 38 different countries around the world already recognising a grace period, including the United States, Canada and Japan. The fact that most EC countries do not recognise a grace period has not prevented these 38 countries from offering patent applicants the benefits associated with a grace period. The government has decided that immediate introduction of a grace period will improve the present situation. At least those who inadvertently disclose their invention will not be disqualified from subsequently obtaining patent rights in Australia. At present, any future patent rights would be lost. In reaching this decision, the government has consulted widely with representatives of all of the major interest groups while progressing the BAA initiatives and considering its response to the IPCRC review.
The member for Parramatta properly noted this government's commitment to innovation, most recently exemplified in our Backing Australia's Ability statement. He spoke on how this bill will contribute to innovation by strengthening Australia's patent laws. This will assist Australian inventors and help good ideas to be developed commercially. Any patents developed from these good ideas will be stronger and therefore provide the owner of the patent with more certainty in enforcing those patents.
The member for Scullin spoke about the importance of having a system akin to those of our major trading partners, including Europe and the US. In fact, this bill, by strengthening the patent system, brings it more in line with Europe and the US. While he was concerned about the disparity between the US and Europe in relation to the grace period, I should point out that Japan, our major trading partner, also has a grace period.
The coalition government is committed to fostering innovation and maintaining a strong and effective intellectual property system in Australia. Our commitment is reflected in the innovation action plan, Backing Australia's Ability, announced in January this year. This action plan is worth $2.9 billion over five years and builds on the $4.5 billion the government has spent on innovation in this financial year. The Patents Amendment Bill is a key part of the innovation action plan. It demonstrates the government's commitment to providing a patent system that meets the needs of all Australians and highlights our ongoing efforts to improve the scope of intellectual property protection in Australia.
In this age of globalisation, patent protection is invariably required in more than one country. As I outlined in my second reading speech, the amendments in this bill will strengthen the examination of patent novelty and inventive step to more closely align those criteria with international standards. These amendments will result in stronger patent rights and mean that patent owners can expect greater certainty in enforcing their patents.
In addition, the bill makes the necessary minor changes to the Patents Act to bring it into line with the proposed patent law treaty. If Australia accedes to this treaty, filing a patent application in more than one country will be easier because it harmonises the formality requirements for patent applications. This bill does not, for good reason, include the other major patents initiative announced in Backing Australia's Ability—the introduction of a 12-month grace period to help prevent the loss of patent rights through disclosure of an invention prior to the filing of a patent application. The grace period will more appropriately be implemented by amendments to the patents regulations, and its introduction will be timed to coincide with the commencement of this bill. The government is committed to consulting with interest groups in developing the grace period regulations. To ensure that the grace period is meeting its objectives, it will be reviewed two years after its commencement. The improvements to the patent system made by this bill will benefit Australian inventors and promote innovation in this country. They emphasise the government's commitment to ensuring Australia prospers in today's knowledge based economy.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—In commencing my speech on the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001 and related bills, I indicate that I have received a great deal of assistance from Senator Stephen Conroy and his office, in particular Diane Brown, in preparing the opposition response in the House of Representatives to this legislation. Labor support the objectives behind the Financial Services Reform Bill. We were keen to see the detail, and now that the bill has been introduced we are doing our best to assist the minister as much as we can in having this bill debated. We are not slowing down this bill—there has been a bit of scuttlebutt about from the government to that effect—rather, we have assisted wherever we could. We stated early our intention to have a parliamentary committee inquire into this bill. The joint parliamentary committee resolved to inquire into the bill and placed an advertisement calling for submissions almost immediately upon the bill being introduced. They have since held a number of meetings and are moving at a quite rapid pace through that process. That process will, of course, help Labor and the broader community to develop their position and form their views on the bill.
Our task is not made any easier by the fact that the bill keeps evolving. We see today a number of substantial policy amendments by the government. ASIC is issuing policy proposal papers as quickly as it can and has, since the introduction of the bill, issued two sets of policy papers, and nine policy papers overall. It is suggested that another three sets of policy proposal papers are still to come. Also, we are yet to see the regulations. This is not a minor point because the structure of the bill, the philosophy of the bill, is to include only the principles in the bill and include all the details in the regulations. Industry and consumer groups are also seeking confirmation of what is going to be in the regulations.
Industry is asking for time to consider the bill, and there have been quite a few submissions to the joint parliamentary committee to that effect. This is understandable, given the size of the bill, the great change that it is intending to make to the financial services industry, the absence of detail from Treasury, the changes in the legislation coming from the minister and the quantity of material coming from ASIC. I urge the minister to provide draft regulations so that industry and others can gather and develop confidence in the bill. On the substantive issues, Labor welcomes the improvements that this bill promises to bring in the level of disclosure to consumers and the maintenance of competence and expertise in the financial services industry. If consumers are to be provided with extra information that will enable them to make better financial decisions or to obtain better financial advice, these reforms are to be welcomed. 
I mention two areas of concern. The first is the question of the recording of telephone conversations in relation to takeovers. We would be interested in some advice from the government at some point about the origin of this proposal. No-one, including the Australian Shareholders Association, has indicated to the parliamentary committee that there is a problem which requires such an expensive solution; and a number of business organisations—the SIA, the IBSA, the Law Council and so on—believe that it is unnecessary and will inhibit takeover activity in Australia. The proposal appears to have been made without any consultation—not unusual from the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation. But this proposal does look suspiciously like a minister for financial services special—no-one is owning up to having suggested or supported it at any stage.
The second concern is the one I want to spend a bit of time on. Having opposition responsibility for superannuation I know a bit about this area and it is something which relevant groups have expressed some real concerns about, and that is the issue of superannuation and the possible impact of this bill on trustees. Most members of the House will be aware that superannuation is regulated under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which recognises a system of superannuation with trustee representation. I want to stress the importance and relevance of that system to workers, and the job that it does in lowering costs to superannuation fund members. I want to bring to the attention of the minister the concerns of organisations such as the Corporate Superannuation Association that the Financial Services Reform Bill may damage and could even ultimately destroy corporate superannuation, and to express my own view that that would not be a good thing.
There has been a submission from Freehills on behalf of the Corporate Superannuation Association suggesting a partial carve-out of not-for-profit superannuation from the Financial Services Reform Bill. The basis on which they make that proposition is, firstly, that not-for-profit superannuation is different from other financial products. And by `not-for-profit' superannuation we are talking about corporate funds operated solely for the employees of a particular employer. We are also talking about industry funds operated for the employees of employers within a given industry and those funds which are not public offer superannuation funds within the meaning of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act.
The things about those funds that differentiate them from other financial products are that they are subject to equal representation requirements—that is, half of the trustees are appointed by the employer and half are elected or appointed on behalf of members; they have voluntary trustees; the funds are run by members for the members, with no profit motive; the costs are low; and either their operation is subsidised by the employer or they have alliances and can use their collective bargaining power to keep costs down. They exist primarily to receive the mandated employer contributions to superannuation guarantee or contributions coming under an industrial award or agreement. In this sense, they are instruments of the government's retirement incomes policy. The point is made by Freehills that uniform regulation is only appropriate for products with similar underlying characteristics and that not-for-profit superannuation is functionally different from other financial products and is best regulated under tailored legislation like the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. The Financial Services Reform Bill regime, with its Corporations Law focus, represents a significant regulatory shift for these funds. The issue here is: is there a coherent, proper policy rationale for such a change?
On the other hand, for-profit superannuation is readily compatible with other financial products. We would include public offer superannuation funds within that kind of assessment category. Public offer funds must have an APRA approved trustee; hence they are already subject to indirect licensing under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act by virtue of the APRA approval processes and the stringent terms of those instruments of approval. The SIS legislation, with its tiered approach to regulation, already imposes quite onerous disclosure and conduct requirements on public offer funds. So public offer funds are more functionally similar to other financial products and, hence, there is a more compelling argument for uniform Corporations Law regulation in their case. For these funds, the regime does not represent a particularly radical change in regulatory focus. 
The next point that is made in relation to the not-for-profit superannuation funds is that the recommendations in the Wallis report simply do not apply to them. The bill that we have before the House is based on the financial system inquiry report, but the recommendations in the report for uniform regulation of the financial sector do not appear to contemplate not-for-profit superannuation. The references in paragraph 2.7 of the explanatory memorandum talk about the report having recommended a single set of conduct requirements for investment sales and advice, a single licensing regime for all advisers providing investment advice, laws covering financial markets and so on. The trustees of not-for-profit superannuation funds do not fall within those sorts of recommendations and that structure.
It is also noted that the functions represented in the concept of financial products are not performed by not-for-profit superannuation and that the trustees of not-for-profit superannuation funds do not carry on a business for profit. It is noted that the licensing regime being proposed here is a substantive change in regulatory focus for not-for-profit superannuation and it is argued that the Financial Services Reform Bill licensing regime unnecessarily increases costs of not-for-profit superannuation funds and negatively impacts on their members. It is a matter of some concern that, in the case of not-for-profit superannuation, there would be substantial costs in moving to the FSRB licensing regime, mainly because the licensing requirements will be completely new. The additional costs are almost certainly to be borne by fund members.
It is suggested and argued that the licensing regime could have such an impact on not-for-profit superannuation as to lead to its demise. It is noted that applicants for a licence under the bill must have adequate financial resources, relevant competence, skills and experience and adequate systems for training and supervision of representatives. It is likely that many trustees of not-for-profit superannuation funds would be unable to meet those requirements. It should be remembered that the Financial Services Reform Bill requirements are based on the current Corporations Law regime designed for the regulation of agents, intermediaries and advisers. Therefore, they do not readily translate to the administration of superannuation funds by elected trustee representatives who rely heavily on outsourcing specific functions to qualified service providers in order to meet their responsibilities. The SIS legislation endorses a trust law model of delegation to carefully selected agents with adequate supervision and ultimate control by the trustee. Replacing that sort of model with the Corporations Law model could have a very adverse effect on not-for-profit superannuation which, I would argue, is unwarranted.
Is also argued that the licensing regime over-regulates not-for-profit superannuation, that many of the disclosure obligations attached to FSRB licences are irrelevant to not-for-profit superannuation and that licensing of not-for-profit superannuation has adverse consequences for employers. To give the House a bit more detail on that concern, because of the broad definition of `dealing', it is possible that employers would need to become authorised representatives of the trustee in order to enrol employees in their own employer sponsored fund. In such a situation, the trustee might require an indemnity from the employer. These are a series of quite serious concerns which have been expressed on behalf of the Corporate Superannuation Association regarding the impact of this bill on not-for-profit superannuation and we would certainly urge the government's further attention to, and consideration of, these issues as the bill is developed. 
Let me now turn to some of the detail of the bill. The bill deals, amongst other things, with the authorisation of financial market operators and clearing and settlement facilities. It introduces a harmonised regulatory regime across the financial services industry. By adopting a functional definition of `financial product' and `financial advice', the bill introduces a single licensing framework for all financial service providers, replacing the differing licensing requirements currently imposed for dealers and advisers in securities, futures, banking products, managed funds, superannuation and insurance. It introduces minimum standards of conduct for financial service providers and enhanced disclosure of financial service products when dealing with retail clients and it introduces various other amendments to the Corporations Law, including amendments to the market misconduct provisions and amendments to the continuous disclosure provisions. There is also the introduction, as I mentioned before, of the recording of telephone conversations during takeovers.
The bill will replace chapters 7 and 8 of the Corporations Law, repeal the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act, repeal provisions in the Insurance Act and Retirement Savings Accounts Act and amend the Life Insurance Act, the Insurance Contracts Act, among other acts. It is quite a substantial piece of legislation by any yardstick. It is currently being inquired into by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities and, as a result of some of the evidence received, we have seen quite a few changes being made to the legislation on the way through. I want to comment on some of the specific provisions and the stage that they are up to.
First, there is the authorisation of financial market operators and clearing and settlement facilities. For financial market operators, a person or corporation must be licensed to operate a financial market. For example, the ASX and SFE—the Sydney Futures Exchange—are currently licensed to operate a securities market and futures market, respectively. There are number of changes to occur in this respect and the more significant ones are as follows. A licensee will be licensed to operate a financial market, removing the current distinction between securities markets and futures markets, subject to any conditions on the licence. A licensee may list on its own market if it has entered into such arrangements as ASIC requires for dealing with possible conflicts of interest and for the purpose of ensuring the integrity of trading in the licensee's financial products. So ASIC's role in relation to the ASX will now be explicitly set out in legislation. Licensed markets through which participants provide services for retail clients must have compensation arrangements where the participants hold property on behalf of those clients.
The current Corporations Law does not distinguish between retail clients and wholesale clients. The compensation arrangements can be provided through the National Guarantee Fund—that is, the existing scheme; or, in a change to the existing law, the licensee may make their own compensation arrangements, for example, a fidelity fund, an insurance arrangement or an irrevocable letter of credit. The obligations of licensees are still to be fully examined. The regulations, which have not yet been released, will have to contain a lot of the obligations currently specified in the Corporations Law. 
There are also provisions concerning clearing and settlement facilities. Currently, there are only two approved clearing houses: the SCH, which is associated with the ASX, and the SFE clearing house. Competition in relation to the clearing and settlement facilities is discouraged at present by significant advantages conferred on the SCH under the existing provisions, such as its unique access to provisions which facilitate electronic transfer of legal title. The bill attempts to enhance competition in respect of clearing and settlement facilities by extending the ability to carry out electronic transfers of trades to all prescribed facilities, ending the SCH competitive advantage in this regard.
There is next the question of limits on involvement with licensees. The FSRB introduces a 15 per cent limit, or such higher limit set by the minister if it is considered to be in the national interest, on any person's voting power in a market licensee, a clearing and settlement facilities licensee or a holding company of such a licensee. Presently, the ASX is subject to a five per cent shareholder limitation, so a move to a 15 per cent limit would be clearly a substantial change in terms of the likely ownership structure of the ASX. This bill gives ASIC the power to disqualify someone involved in a market or clearing and settlement facility—a director or an executive officer or similar—if they are an `unfit person', having regard to the fame, character and integrity of that person. A licence will not be granted where a disqualified person is involved, and a licensee has an obligation to ensure that no disqualified person becomes involved in the licence. 
There are also some new provisions concerning the licensing of financial service providers. Any person who deals in a `financial product' or gives `financial product advice' will now be required to be licensed. Currently, only dealers in securities, derivatives and managed investment funds and persons who provide advice in relation to those products have to be licensed. Under the SI(S) Act, certain superannuation trustees must be `approved trustees'. There are going to be some substantial changes in this area. A licensee will be required to satisfy a number of obligations in order to be licensed. People who are currently licensed will be largely unaffected, but people who have indicated that they might be affected by the changes include the trustees of not-for-profit superannuation funds—and I have discussed their case earlier—lawyers and accountants, media, and multi life and investment advisers.
Lawyers and accountants are currently exempted from the requirement to be licensed where the provision of investment advice is merely incidental to the practice of their profession. This exemption has been removed in this bill. There are lawyers and accountants arguing that the broad definition of `financial advice' will curtail their ability to give commercial advice. For example, in the context of a construction contract, it would be financial product advice for a lawyer to warn a client about the need to insure. Lawyers have been given a partial exemption such that advice given by a lawyer in his or her professional capacity about matters of law, legal interpretation or the application of the law to any facts is not financial product advice. Lawyers have, however, stated that this does not solve their problem. Advice by accountants is not addressed by this partial exemption either. So those issues have been raised.
In addition, the media is currently exempted from the requirement to be licensed where the advice is published in a newspaper that is generally available to the public other than only on subscription and whose sole or principal purpose is not to advise other persons about securities or to publish securities reports. That exemption has been removed, so journalists reporting corporate affairs on that basis would arguably be required to be licensed. ASIC has proposed to grant an exemption for newspapers and other media on a journalist-by-journalist basis and article-by-article basis. It does strike media groups, and me as well, that this is unworkable, that it interferes with freedom of the press and will curtail information available to the public. I would have thought that more information generally available is a desirable thing.
Multi-agents and single agents currently are not licensed but are appointed representatives of licensees. The problem that has been identified for agents is that their approval as representatives will be revoked upon commencement of the bill, and they will be no longer able to operate their business. Their options then are to either obtain a licence or seek appointment as an authorised representative of a licensee under the act. The government believes that a previously approved representative seeking reappoint-ment as an authorised representative should not be problematic. We are going to watch this more closely and see whether this issue can be resolved following further consideration.
There are some other issues in relation to licensing that I want to briefly touch on. The first is the question of `efficiently, honestly and fairly'. Currently, the Corporations Law provides that a licence will only be granted if ASIC has no reason to believe that the applicant will not perform `efficiently, honestly and fairly' the duties of a licensee. The bill replaces this requirement with an obligation on the licensee `to the extent that is reasonably practicable do all things necessary to ensure that the financial services covered by the licence are provided competently and honestly'. That is something that we certainly intend to have a closer look at. 
There is also the question of limits on ASIC's powers. Generally, ASIC acting alone can impose conditions on a licence and vary or cancel a licence. But, if a licensee or a related body corporate is a body regulated by APRA, ASIC must consult with APRA before imposing a condition, varying or revoking a condition on the licence, or cancelling, suspending or revoking a licence. This potentially raises some issues as well.
With regard to disclosure and conduct requirements, the bill will introduce uniform disclosure requirements, which will involve the provision of up to three documents to retail clients. These documents are a financial services guide, which will include key information about the types of services being provided by the financial service provider; a statement of advice, which will include the advice, the basis on which that advice was given, and any commissions and other benefits received that might reasonably be expected to be capable of influencing the provision of that advice; and also a product disclosure statement.
In the area of disclosure of commission, one issue which arises is whether the disclosure should be as a dollar amount or as a percentage. It is Labor's view that dollar disclosure is more meaningful to consumers. There is plenty of information to suggest that disclosure by way of percentages is often not understood. We are not all mathematicians, and it is better to provide this sort of disclosure on a dollar basis. There are also issues in relation to the disclosure of commission on risk products, cold calling, basic bank deposits, work ordinarily done by cashiers and clerks, and some issues involving other amendments to the Corporations Law, market misconduct provisions, continuous disclosure provisions and so on.
As I indicated at the outset of my remarks, we are not opposing this legislation. There are quite a number of features in it that we see as desirable in improving disclosure, transparency and consumer protection arrangements. We are certainly not in the business of delaying or holding up the legislation in any way. We have in place the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities doing work on the legislation. The government has continued to amend the legislation on the way through. We look forward to it providing more details in terms of the regulations as soon as it possibly can, to provide both the opposition and the wider community with a better opportunity to understand exactly what the impact of the legislation will be. We are happy to speed the passage of this legislation through and into the Senate, with a view to having these provisions put into place as soon as is reasonably practicable.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,53,1,speech
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—The Financial Services Reform Bill 2001 demonstrates once again the commitment of the government to greater efficiency in administration across all portfolios. Nothing could be more complex than to undertake the range of adjustments that are being sought under this legislation. In the past, there has been a range of differing systems administering all those different financial institutions: banks, insurance companies, superannuation, life assurance, cash and credit cards, and foreign exchange transactions. This bill seeks to bring all those together, streamline them and put them all under one system of operation.
Looking at, for example, financial markets, I am told that currently there are seven different categories of authorised stock and futures markets. However, the FSR legislation includes just one set of provisions for the regulation of financial markets. That is obviously a huge advantage to anyone operating in that range of services provision across all of our financial institutions. Of course, these days we are seeing more crossover organisations, more of these companies operating in an all-finance model. When they do that, having streamlined systems of administration is of course very desirable. I would like to get on to that a little later on. 
Looking at the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Bill 2001, which is one of the accompanying pieces of legislation we are looking at tonight, the amendments that are being sought are looking at APRA and its operation. On establishment, APRA inherited a variety of data collecting tools and analysis systems. These tools and systems were tailored to meet the data needs of APRA's predecessor organisations. Problems have been identified with this inherited data collection network. Firstly, the existing data collection framework is fragmented, cumbersome and in some cases outdated. The bill again seeks to bring those disjointed and dysfunctional tools that are there for the administration of this very important sector of our economy, take from them their current dysfunctional status and bring them together so that they can serve an organisation as important as APRA and serve our community well in the process.
At the outset I would like to turn to a couple of the points that were raised by the opposition spokesman. One thing that is apparent is that the government has gone out of its way to consult, consult and consult again on this issue. It is so complex. We have so far seen an exposure draft that was issued, which was preceded by a position paper in December 1997 and after that a consultation paper in March 1999. Those papers have been out there in the business community. Working its way through this process, the government has listened at every step to what the industry has had to say and has taken these things on board. 
As that feedback comes in and as people look at this complex legislation from different directions and the feedback continues to flow, of course amendments such as the latest ones will be necessary. It is obvious that the amendment to include the Reserve Bank in regulating, clearing and settlement facilities, in setting financial stability standards, in monitoring the compliance with those standards and in ensuring that licensees do everything practicable to reduce systemic risk is a laudable amendment that is entirely appropriate. As the feedback and the system move into place, those kinds of amendments will be necessary.
This government has demonstrated that it is not frightened to address these kinds of complex, massive questions that in the past have burdened our economy. When you think about the walls that have been built up between various different types of financial institutions, built up on the back of these dysfunctional and incompatible systems of regulation, that is a tremendous burden to be putting on our business community and on our financial sector. It is entirely appropriate that the government should address that burden. I believe that, once again, the government is demonstrating that it is prepared to go the distance, to do the hard yards and to take on complex questions that are really of concern to the business community.
I noted what the member opposite had to say about telephone recording during takeover occasions. This is an example of trying to come up with a regime to increase accountability. Along with the streamlining of the process, there is also a need to improve accountability. There have been many particularly recent examples of cases in which there has been less than acceptable practice going on out there in the corporate sector, and we need to find ways to make it more accountable. Members opposite criticise what they see as corporate excess in various areas, yet when something comes along proposing to improve accountability within those sectors they jump ship and go in the other direction. What we had from the member opposite was just straight-out criticism of this proposal but, if he had something better to offer, we did not hear it. If the way to go is a telephone recording of conversations during takeovers, and if that were necessary to provide greater accountability, I for one would be happy to see that in place. But, if the members opposite do have a more effective alternative, I would like to hear about it. It was not in evidence in the shadow spokesman's speech, so we can only assume that what he was doing was sledging the scheme without coming up with something to replace it. 
Another comment that he made was in relation to a proposal to carve out not-for-profit superannuation from the bill. I do not see that as being a desirable outcome either. I would like to give an example here, because in recent times we have had many examples of small superannuation funds that have got into difficulties. One of the big reasons that they get into difficulty is precisely the reason that the member opposite seemed to be so attracted to them; that is, the people who are administering a lot of these funds are not experts. You have a group of people representing the employer who may be involved in some pursuit that has nothing whatsoever to do with superannuation and might know very little about it. Then, on the other side, you have people representing the employees who also have probably had no experience of superannuation whatsoever. 
Just to give an example, in my electorate is the Borallon prison, and that prison has had in the past a superannuation fund based on that model—a not-for-profit superannuation fund with representatives of the operator of the prison and representatives of the employees together running a superannuation fund. They had no experience in the superannuation fund and they have got into great difficulty because, after some concerns that they had with the way the share market was operating at the time, they put all their faith in the property market. They took all the value of their members' superannuation and put it all into property. You can imagine what happened when the operator of that prison suddenly, because of a decision by the Queensland state government, lost its contract to operate the prison. The moment that happened, all that superannuation money had to then become available to those members to be rolled over, to be put into whatever funds they were going to in the future. These inexperienced people who were running that scheme were put into a situation where they had to suddenly roll it over, so they made a massive loss on behalf of their members.
This parliament should be setting out to protect the superannuation of people in that circumstance. These funds should not be run by a bunch of enthusiastic amateurs. They should be subject to the same strict prudential supervision as any other part of the industry. People are relying on this system of management to support their own workers' superannuation and to conserve their workmates' money. It is important that we get out of a system that just encourages some less than acceptable practices and move on to a more professional operation on behalf of members. This bill certainly does lay out a framework within which that will happen. 
Just because a superannuation scheme is operating not for profit does not mean that it should not have the same level of prudential supervision of its operation. We definitely need to still have the same level of prudential supervision. It is not appropriate to have something less just because it is being run by the employer and the employer's representatives, who may know nothing at all about superannuation, and by the employees and their representatives, who may also know nothing about superannuation. If you followed the course of the Borallon prison super scheme, you would be very concerned about anything that enabled the current system to continue to operate.
Looking at the impact of the Financial Services Reform Bill, I would like to take some time to highlight what has happened in Queensland with Suncorp Metway. The reason I am doing so is because this is precisely the type of financial institution that will be massively encouraged by this legislation. Suncorp Metway is what is called an all finance institution. It spans a range of activities almost as wide as those I read out at the start of my speech when I was discussing the breadth of this bill. It is a leading institution in Queensland but, at the time Suncorp Metway was formed, the Queensland government—which at the time owned Suncorp—was faced with quite a difficult situation. At that time the operators of Suncorp, under government ownership, came to the government and said, basically, that they wanted hundreds of millions of dollars of Queensland taxpayers' money to invest interstate to offset some of the risks that were associated with Suncorp being overexposed, particularly in areas of North Queensland subject to cyclones. If you think about it, an insurer such as Suncorp had all of its eggs in one basket there in Queensland. There had just been a report produced which identified a great risk to insurers from the potential for cyclones in particular to cause massive damage in towns such as Mackay and Townsville. So here we had an insurer such as Suncorp being grossly overexposed to that form of risk. They came to the government and said, `What we need is hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars to invest in, say, Victoria so we can lay off some of this risk that applies in Queensland.' Of course, there was no way that Queensland taxpayers' money would be appropriately spent in investing in a state such as Victoria—it is something that just would not go down very well in Queensland. The government at the time rightly rejected it.  
Instead, the government set about creating a new private entity and moving those Suncorp resources. But if you cannot raise capital from Queensland taxpayers because the money you are seeking is to be spent somewhere else, where else can you get it? Obviously the government found that source of money in the private sector. In the end the Suncorp insurance operation was merged with the Metway Bank in Queensland. The Metway Bank itself at the time was under some threat. It was a small bank, and we have seen what can happen to small banks—the Colonial State Bank, for example, and there have been many other examples of small banks being gobbled up within the system. Suncorp needed a partner that could help it spread its investments much more widely than before, and of course the opportunity to merge with Metway was definitely the way to go. In fact, the government in Queensland at that time went so far as to consider merging Suncorp, as well as Metway, with the St George Bank in New South Wales. That proposal got quite advanced. It got to the stage where they went down to discuss it with the St George Bank in Sydney. I went along on that particular occasion. It ended in quite some uproar because apparently the thought of moving St George Bank headquarters to Queensland was such a shock for the chairman of the St George Bank at the time that he upped and had a heart attack in the middle of the meeting. It was a significant occasion. I suppose it might sound as though I am making light of it, but at the time it fell to me to give the guy mouth-to-mouth resuscitation for 10 minutes. I must say that, at the end of it, he survived quite well.
—He's dead!
—Well, he is now, but he was not at the time. He lasted for quite some time afterwards, thank you. So the final structure that evolved was Suncorp Metway. It is an effective all finance institution, and it needs this legislation to maximise its returns. Suncorp Metway has grown rapidly since it was set up. It is a big insurance operator and a regional bank put together, and the two have become much bigger as a united whole than they were as individual parts. Now we hear that Suncorp Metway is once again expanding its business and getting into more insurance business through AMP, and that is an amazing endorsement of the decision by the Queensland government all that time ago to set up this all finance institution. As I said, this institution will be mightily assisted by this particular legislation because it will bring together all those differing systems of administration which this very diverse company has to operate within under the current scheme, so that with one system of operation they will be able to be much more efficient. I note that currently Suncorp Metway shares are up to $14.60.
—It's a good organisation.
—Definitely. It is an excellent organisation. Shares have more than doubled since it was initially floated by the Queensland government all that time ago. I can recall at the time of Suncorp Metway being floated there was quite some opposition, particularly from the Financial Review. The Financial Review was not real happy about the structure. I think they thought the idea of Queenslanders going it alone on something like that without the big boys down in Sydney was something they could not handle. I think if they were to honestly face up to it today they would have to say that it has been an outstanding success. I would dearly love to see those Financial Review editorial writers reviewing the progress that Suncorp Metway has made and giving it a great big tick. In saying all that, obviously there are great benefits to Australian financial institutions from streamlining the financial services sector in this way, and I compliment the minister on undertaking such a very complex and difficult undertaking, and for doing it so well. 
Friday, 29 June 2001",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,53,1,speech
"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I also rise to speak on the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001. 
—We were told there were no other speakers.
—I am sorry to cause distress to the minister. I am sorry arrangements were not discussed with him. I will speak for only a brief time on the bill. As the previous speaker has informed the House, the bill introduces a harmonised regulation regime across the financial services industry by adopting a functional definition of financial product and financial advice, something that is needed within the sector. The bill introduces a single licensing framework for all financial services products, replacing the differing licensing requirements currently in place by dealers and advisers in securities, futures, banking products, managed funds, superannuation and insurance. It is in respect of banking products that I wish to speak this evening.
This bill is yet another part of the great Wallis adventure that the government are taking us on. They are saying that this will be the age of great new reform in the industry. I hope that this introduction of change will be better than the introduction of the APRA change which recently has been slammed left, right and centre, most particularly in the outcome of HIH. In a recent report, the audit office has condemned APRA for its failure to actually conduct regulation of the banking industry—something we should all be very concerned about. There is gross concern in the community that our banks are not being regulated appropriately. If we saw something happening in one of our banks as we have seen happen in HIH, the whole community would be screaming out. There would be a great deal of concern. The recent audit report tabled in April, called Bank prudential supervision—Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, goes into how APRA is so understaffed that it actually cannot conduct audits of banks. It cannot go into premises and do the in-depth investigation that is required. APRA is so understaffed that it actually does not have a complete complement of 25 staff to conduct visitation programs. They do not conduct visitation programs to offshore premises of our own banks. People do not realise that a bank such as the National Australia Bank actually has more offshore business than onshore business. Our regulator is not conducting reviews of their offshore products, of their offshore licences. This is a great concern, as has been revealed in this recent audit report.
In particular tonight I want to speak about banking products. I want to respond to the comments made by Mr David Murray, the chief executive officer of the Commonwealth Bank, in his speech to the press gallery yesterday in Canberra. It was a rather wide-ranging and astounding speech that Mr Murray gave yesterday at the National Press Club. The upshot was Mr Murray's very thinly veiled threats that he may consider not providing banking services to customers who do not return a fair price for services. This is just an astonishing announcement and claim. He said in his speech:
Since privatisation we have made it abundantly clear that we are a bank for all Australians. But I can tell you, on the current trends, we may have to review that decision in future years if we cannot get a fair price for services.
He went on to say:
If you deal with a local store and you know they run a loss on every transaction you run there every day, you know that it is only a matter of time before there will be no local store. 
I think it is going to be an awfully long time before there is no Commonwealth Bank. They are not exactly going down the tube. Their net profit result for the half year was $1.135 billion. This comes on top of their reported profit last year of $2,700 million. This is not a shop that is about to be shut up. This is an astonishing claim that somehow people out there are not making enough profits for these banks.
At what point is it enough? At what point do these banks think they actually are making enough money? Isn't $1.135 billion in the half-yearly profit for 2001 enough? I would have thought it was enough. We could all live on that quite comfortably, but it is not enough for these people. This is an increase from $840 million in the previous year. When is it enough? How much do these banks want to earn? Isn't the Commonwealth Bank's return of $2,512 million in non-interest income for the year 2000—that is, $2,512 million from fees and charges that the Commonwealth Bank earned last year—enough? It is just astonishing; the absolute audacity of these comments just outrages me, and I think they should be drawn to everyone's attention.
The far-reaching range of Mr Murray's speech was very revealing and indicates that the Commonwealth Bank was not necessarily interested in `your money, Ralph'. For those who do not know it, the State Savings Bank ran a very successful campaign in Victoria with the catchphrase `But it's your money, Ralph'. Obviously the Commonwealth does not want your money, Ralph, because that is what he has told us today. The Commonwealth Bank has the largest share of transaction accounts held by low income earners and social security recipients.
The banks are always telling us, if anybody has sat through as many meetings with banks as I have, that about 80 per cent of customers do not earn them any profits and only 20 per cent of customers do earn them profits—and they like that 20 per cent of customers. Yet they do not concede, and they never tell you, that their bottom line comes from that 80 per cent of customers. They are the ones who are paying the fees and charges, and they are the ones who are depositing the money in the banks in the first place, so they can lend it to the 20 per cent of people who earn the profits for them. If it was not for all us depositing in banks, they would not have money to lend. So those claims they make are just outrageous.
Mr Murray does not want to subsidise these customers, but he is happy to be subsidised. He is happy to be subsidised to the tune of $2 million—$2 million is his take-home pay. He has received a staggering 272 per cent increase in his pay since taking his job in 1994. I would like to achieve that outcome for the bank workers that I represented, but, never mind, Mr Murray has achieved this for himself. He earns $2 million in take-home pay but, in addition to that, he has shareholdings as at 30 August 2000 of 50,387 plus two million options. In early March this year, Mr Murray collected a personal profit of around $8 million on the sale of his 500,000 shares gained through exercising his 1997 options. He also has a further 250,000 options and 42,000 shares following approval of a bonus share scheme at the bank's AGM in October 2000. Just in case you think Mr Murray is out there alone, at the ANZ Mr McFarlane has shares worth—
—A different Mr McFarlane.
—A different Mr McFarlane—John McFarlane, Chief Executive Officer at the ANZ. He has 1,182,888 and 750,000 options and, if he exercised them on his share value today of $11.49, he could realise in excess of $3 million. Mr Murray can realise about $9 million. At the National Australia Bank, Frank Scicutto has 500,000 options from which, at the current share price of $21.29, he could realise $6.5 million. At Westpac, David Morgan, who got no option this year—but let us not cry for him— is taking home $2.3 million in pay, but last year he got three million options with an excess price of $10.83. That means he could have walked away with $10.5 million. And these people do not have enough! They do not have enough money; they are not earning enough money! ANZ profit for last year was $1,747 million, the Commonwealth Bank's was $270 million, NAB's was $323 million and Westpac's was just a measly $1,715 million. But it is not enough. They cannot afford to have low depositors in their bank; they cannot afford to have pensioners coming in and withdrawing money. It is an outrage, and I think everybody in this place should jump up and down and say, `It isn't good enough.' 
The ALP have been criticised for saying, `Yes, we think these banks should have a social obligation; we think these banks should have a social conscience.' Banking is an essential service. You cannot survive in Australia nowadays without having some form of banking product. You, as a social security recipient out there, cannot actually access that without having a bank of some description to have that money deposited in and then be able to withdraw it. The ALP believe, and so does the community—survey after survey has demonstrated that the majority of individuals believe—that banks do provide an essential service and that they should provide what have been called `no frills accounts'. They should be provided for free. There should be a bottom end of the scale where you get a no frills, fee free account, and the ALP have supported this.
Interestingly enough, in March this year the Australian Bankers Association also announced an initiative to introduce fee free accounts for pensioners. This is highly entertaining given Mr Murray's comments, because Mr Murray has recently been appointed as chairman of the Australian Bankers Association. He does not even know what his own association, his own bank and his own industry are saying and signing up to. They are agreeing to actually care. They are agreeing to adopt a social charter, but he is not prepared to sign up to it. This is an outrage.
The Australian Labor Party are saying that it is not good enough. We have put forward a banking social charter, and we call on these banks to sit down and discuss this with us. We call on these banks to come to the table and talk these things through. The Australian Bankers Association has accepted the principle. It should now be something that we all sign up to. Mr Murray's comments yesterday were an outrage. They were an insult to the people who have relied upon his bank—who have given his bank great custom and service over years and years. He is demonstrating that his Gordon Gecko greed outweighs everything. In concluding, I call upon the banks to look inside themselves and say, `Enough is enough.'",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,53,1,speech
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—in reply—I would like to thank those members who have contributed to the debate on the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001 in the early hours of this morning. There was a danger there for a moment that we could have kept going for some hours. Thankfully, all members of the House saw the great wisdom in this bill and decided to progress it through, so I can now give my summing-up speech. I am also proposing to introduce a large number of amendments which will assist in the House's final deliberation before the bill goes on to the other place.
I will address a number of issues that were raised by the member for Wills. The first is his suggestion that we should be carving out the industry superannuation funds and the not-for-profit funds. I advise the member for Wills that we do not have any intention of providing any carve-out. There are some special treatments in relation to this bill for not-for-profit superannuation funds and industry funds. The bill accommodates the passage of the choice of superannuation legislation, and that is taken into account.
The member for Wills also raised the issue of taping of phone calls. I am not afraid to advise the House that we have put this provision in the bill to protect consumers. I, as the minister, received a large number of complaints from everyday shareholders who had received telephone calls during the proposed takeover of GIO by AMP. In that situation, both the AMP and the GIO were using what was reported to me as fairly outlandish reasoning to convince in many cases first-time shareholders that they should or should not sell their shares to AMP. The phone taping matter is not intended to cover institutional or wholesale activity and it is not meant to cover the relationship between a broker and their client. It is simply about mass marketing during a takeover, where some fairly extreme tactics may be used by one party or another. It provides the evidence to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that will ensure that, if people have been acting improperly, they are prosecuted accordingly. I view that as a very important initiative to protect consumers. I understand a number of institutions are concerned about this measure. I think their concerns will be addressed when an amendment is placed before the Senate that will clearly indicate that this is not meant to cover institutional or wholesale activity. 
We certainly have ASIC and the Commonwealth Treasury working overtime to provide some appropriate indication of the way the regulations will go in relation to this bill. ASIC has issued a number of papers as well, which will assist in the better understanding of the implications of this bill. It is the first of its kind in the world; it takes Australia to the forefront of the interface between consumers and financial services companies. What we are building here is a framework that can accommodate new technology and the changing demands of the Australian community. The Institute for Management in Switzerland produced an annual report titled the World competitiveness report, which was released in June this year. It indicated that Australia is ranked No. 1 in the world for financial skills among the population. In part that is because we have a very sophisticated financial services industry, which now represents seven per cent of the Australian economy. That is more of the Australian economy than agriculture and mining combined. Many Australians are sophisticated investors who are looking for diverse products to provide for their retirement, in many cases, or to improve their quality of life in the course of their years. This bill has the capacity to deliver to Australian consumers better quality products, more easily understandable products and products that are more closely suited to their needs.
I am sure the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Securities is going to report in the near future. I expect that that report will have some impact on the bill in the Senate. It is not a finalised piece of work. However, it is a vital piece of work. I commend the bill to the House and foreshadow that we will be introducing a number of amendments.

"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"— Firstly, I will inform the House of the arrangements as the Leader of the House advises me. We will have this extended adjournment debate because there are still some bills to come back from the Senate, after which we will have a proper adjournment called `going home'. 
I want to speak tonight about two issues, the first of which is the appalling abuse of privilege by Senator Heffernan in the Senate the other night. Parliamentary privilege is very important and needs to be protected by all who care about the future of parliament. If you have evidence that any Australian has broken the law and that the courts are not dealing with it properly, you should take that evidence to the police, but Senator Heffernan provided no evidence, took no action, as a responsible citizen would, before he came into the parliament and abused the rights of Terry O'Shane. None of us, including Senator Heffernan, know the facts of this matter. But I know this is an appalling abuse of privilege. There is no way in which this can be justified as an attempt by a member of parliament to deal with the abuse of executive power; this is an abuse by a parliamentary secretary, by a member of the executive, of parliamentary privilege and of the rights of Mr O'Shane.
What we want to think about is why this happened. I believe it was not a coincidence, and I will quote a little more evidence to back this up in a moment. I believe it is a deliberate attempt to divide the country over indigenous issues. It is part of a continuing campaign such as that being conducted by the member for Kalgoorlie through comments which have just gone on the Internet and which are going to be in the Age tomorrow, comments which I will quote for the interest of my Labor colleagues. It is very enlightening; you will be pleased about it! He said:
We should not have allowed them the equal rights we gave them in 1967.
Now we have two extremists loose in the Liberal Party—Senator Heffernan and Mr Haase. I want to know what the Prime Minister is going to do about a member of his party saying:
We should not have allowed them the equal rights we gave them in 1967.
Where are the progressives in the Liberal Party who used to stand up for equal rights? Where are the progressives in the Liberal Party who used to stand up for indigenous people? Where are the progressives in the Liberal Party who used to speak up on these issues? There is a deafening silence. We have had an appalling abuse of privilege, and everybody knows that it is so. It has been made clear by every independent commentator.
Everybody knows that Senator Heffernan did the wrong thing, but nobody will say it. I am prepared to say it, and I am prepared to say it right here and now, and I am prepared to back up the remarks made some time ago by my colleague the member for Werriwa, when he said that previous activity by Senator Heffernan made him unfit to serve in his role as Parliamentary Secretary to Cabinet. I absolutely say that that abuse of parliamentary privilege, that abuse of the rights of Mr O'Shane, that appointment of himself as judge and jury of a person without any skerrick of evidence, makes him unfit to hold that office. Mr Haase's remarks, if they go unresponded to by the Prime Minister, cast doubt upon the whole attitude of this government and of the Liberal Party, which once used to stand for equal rights, to the issue of indigenous rights.
We need to acknowledge in this House of Representatives the statement made by Terry O'Shane that was read into the Senate today as a response to the allegations by Senator Heffernan. We need to recognise that when privilege is abused each of us as a member for parliament is lowered in the eyes of the Australian people, this institution of parliament is undermined and the standing of this great institution, which we are all pledged to uphold, is undermined. Every Australian member of parliament—Liberal, National Party, Labor—should be standing up and condemning this abuse of privilege.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—The Labor Party will be supporting these amendments. We believe the Medical Training Review Panel has done a good job. We welcome the government's about-face to accept the amendment that will retain the panel instead of seeing it being extinguished as the government previously planned. We are disappointed that the government and the Democrats have combined to remove the sunset clause, which young doctors around Australia had firmly wished to retain. The young doctors have been consistently ignored by this government, who have treated them as cannon fodder to solve shortages by forcing them into unsupervised rural vacancies without the necessary support. The Democrats have now joined the government in turning their backs on young doctors and signalled that they are happy with the current arrangements. Labor is not happy with this situation. Postgraduate medical training is a mess. Labor will make it a high priority after the next election to sit down and properly negotiate a satisfactory set of programs that address the concerns that have been raised. 
In particular, we will ensure that the long recommended community terms for postgraduate doctors wanting to do prevocational GP training will be opened up in urban areas of work force shortage, as well as ensuring that the existing schemes are abolished, as recommended by the government's own inquiry, and replaced by supervised schemes. The other amendments are supported, although I would highlight the difficulties raised by the timing of the review, which must report to parliament by 31 December. Given the timing of the next election, I urge the minister in setting up this review to consult with the opposition to ensure the review is comprehensive and provides a basis for the next minister to act regardless of which party is successful at the election.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—Labor agrees to this amendment, which is indeed something that we proposed in the Senate and have been pursuing for the past two years. It would have been far better had the government agreed to this in the first place. The situation with the legislation was that people who had quoted for buildings, contracts and so on on the basis that they would be sales tax exempt found themselves hit with a retrospective amendment. That was really quite unfair. So we fought for this schedule to be omitted. We are pleased that the government has supported this position and will support this amendment accordingly.

(2)	that:
	(a)	Senate amendments Nos 1 and 3 to 5 insisted on by the Senate,

This government is looking to ensure that the Child Support Scheme is fair and balanced for all parents and children. That has been a philosophy articulated and pushed by the Liberal and National parties for quite some time. Unfortunately, the contact measures have not been recognised in this bill. If they had been, they would have recognised the important contribution of non-resident parents who care for their children on a regular and ongoing basis. Unfortunately, the opposition has been unable to agree with us on this proposal, which I strongly believe would have put more fairness and equity into the scheme.
We are mindful that the opposition has already delayed important measures in the bill. We do not want to delay these anymore, and for that reason we are accepting the amendments. But we will continue to fight for the proper recognition in the child support formula of the contributions that all parents make to their children's lives, and I am particularly glad that there are amendments in this legislation that will help families, and of course there are now the FTB measures that we have introduced, which will certainly help payees if payers are not meeting their responsibilities.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,63,1,speech
"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—We are pleased that the government has decided to push ahead and pass the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000. It means that two beneficial measures for second families can be passed immediately. The first of these measures helps second families in which a parent takes a second job or works overtime to assist their new family. The second ensures that money paid in child support by a parent with a second family is not taken into account as income in determining the amount of family payments the new family receives. This will be of financial benefit to many second families. 
While I am glad these positive reforms are to be passed, another remains gridlocked because the government is unwilling to pass an amendment put by Labor to make shared care a reality. Labor's concern with the shared care provision in this bill is that the way it has been drawn up by the government is not fair. Labor has twice proposed an amendment to make shared care fair. We have proposed an amendment to the maintenance income test for family tax benefit to make sure that shared care does not take from one parent to give to the other. Our amendment would give non-resident parents financial recognition of the cost of caring for their children while making sure this does not result in a loss of income to resident parents. Unfortunately, the government would not support us on this. However, they have indicated that they are committed to working with us to achieve reform in this area, and we welcome that.

"Sercombe, Bob, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I have spoken on previous occasions in this chamber about the situation in Macedonia. This is an issue that is increasingly of concern to a substantial number of Australian citizens. The Australian embassy in Belgrade tells me that they wrote yesterday to some 1,500 Australian citizens registered as residing in Macedonia warning them of the deteriorating security environment and saying they believe there are another 3,000 Australian citizens within that country. 
Apart from the interests of Australian citizens more directly involved, there are some also some very important reasons in principle why the Australian government needs to take a closer interest in events in this part of Europe. Macedonia is a successful multi-ethnic democracy. It is a country that certainly by the standards of south-eastern Europe has had an excellent record on human rights and on democratic development. It is a country, however, now under attack from terrorist activity and, in that respect, it needs the support of the whole world, including Australia. It is a country that has included members of ethnic minorities within its government members, including the quite large Albanian minority.
President Trajkovski visited Australia last year in the context of the Olympics. He is an excellent leader in that country. Yesterday he made an excellent speech on the situation. He called for a reinvigoration of the political dialogue with all legitimate parties in Macedonia to find a solution to the problems there. But he concluded with these very important words where he was assuring his citizens: 
... every inch of the Macedonian territory will be under the control of the Macedonian security forces and that Macedonia will have a civil order whose stability will be the result of joint efforts of all citizens of the state. That we will achieve our objective of becoming a member to the EU and NATO ...
Apart from the interests we all have, particularly in the Western world, in protecting democratic institutions wherever they may lie, there are important additional considerations that apply here and which really ought to lead the Australian government to take a closer interest. As I said, we all have an interest in democratic institutions. We also have an interest in ensuring that the control of extreme nationalism and the maintenance of a secure environment are achieved in all parts of the world. It is simply not acceptable for people who believe in democratic institutions in any part of the world to stand idly by and see a situation where a few extremists, who have in some respects benefited from the NATO operation in Kosovo in the interests of their particular ethnic community several years ago, actively involve themselves in the armed destabilisation of a neighbouring democracy. We all have an interest in avoiding that situation, and I call on the Australian government to take an interest.

"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I am delighted to be able to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Concession Cards) Bill 2001. When I saw it listed, I thought I was suffering from the first stages of Alzheimer's disease. Surely, I thought, we must have already discussed an issue that was the subject of a House of Representatives inquiry in October 1997. Looking at the committee membership, I noticed that I was lucky enough to be the deputy chair of that committee and that the honourable member for Canberra, who is sitting to my right, was a member of that committee. I honestly cannot believe that the minister responsible back in the 38th Parliament was so slack that it has taken until the dying stages of the 39th Parliament for this bill to get a guernsey.
In so many ways, this government is aloof, out of touch and very opportunistic. To my mind, it is now using the structure of the various House committees to try to serve its own and not the people's ends. With another report that this committee handed down, on indigenous health, I know that the government's response took close on a year. The government's response normally takes three months, I think. Their report was dated March 2001, and we finally got copies in the House in June 2001, I think, and they did not even acknowledge the committee on the cover.  
As I said, I well remember serving on the committee that produced the 26 recommendations, and good recommendations they were. It was a totally unanimous report and I am still proud to be serving on this great committee—the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. The second reading speech of the minister responsible stated:
Since its election in 1996, this Government has sought to implement its commitment to a simpler and more coherent social security system that more effectively meets its objectives of adequacy, equity, incentives for self-provision, customer service and administrative and financial sustainability.
That is wonderful departmental gobbledegook. One of the things that we recommended back in 1997 was a mindset change. The first recommendation was a major overhaul of the concession card system. The second was:
To this end the Committee recommends that there be a single concession card, entitled the Commonwealth Concession Card ...
We recommended that it be issued under a certain number of conditions. Back in 1997, in the last century, when information technology was about to burst into bud, before it even bloomed, we were talking about smart card technology. The committee was presented with numerous examples of smart card technology—revolutionary stuff, where you could have a card and phone in money to the card, and you could put the card in and do wonderful things and swipe it at various outlets and the like. 
So we thought, `Let's be revolutionary. We have got half a dozen cards in social security, and no-one really knows what their entitlements are. We have two veterans' cards'—the gold card and the white card, I think—`and people aspire to one and they do not particularly like the other. State agencies accept various cards from the Commonwealth and they do not accept others. When you go and pay your rates, if you have got a particular card, you can get a concession, and if you do not have that card, you cannot. There is great confusion.' We came up with what I thought was a rather enlightening statement, that we should have one Commonwealth concession card. It said:
3. The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card should continue to be issued separately, until smart card technology enables full integration with other concession entitlements onto a single card ... 
4. The committee recommends the conduct of a concession smart card trial—
which governments love to do—
involving the Commonwealth and selected State/Territory governments, within the next six months. 
This was back in October 1997. 
5. The Committee recommends that the concession smart card not require a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to access concessions.
6. The Committee recommends that smart card technology be gradually introduced in a matter conducive to enlisting the co-operation of cardholders. 
Four years ago, people were wary of cards, but if I open my wallet now I probably have 20 of these things with a black strip on the back, and you can swipe them at almost every conceivable place, not only in Australia but overseas, and somewhere there is this massive computer that puts words up on the screen that say, `Yes, you can,' or `No, you cannot.'
What has this government done? In the second reading speech, the minister said:
The law currently covering concession cards issued by Centrelink on behalf of the Department of Family and Community Services is highly fragmented.  
We told them that four years ago. Under Senator Jocelyn Newman's stewardship, nothing happened. Our recommendation 8 was:
The Committee recommends that before and during introduction of concession smart cards, there should be an extensive education campaign informing the target populations, particularly older people, how the new technology will affect them and how they gain access to concessions. 
Recommendation 9 was:
The Committee recommends that the Department of Social Security and other agencies involved with design, implementation and information dissemination of the smart concession card take particular account of the importance of individual privacy, including the guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1988.
The whole issue of privacy was thrown up to us continually: `If we do this, and we have one concession card issued by the Commonwealth, the big issue of privacy is going to be the thing that raises the hackles of all the people who have got concession cards.'
I honestly cannot understand why, four years later when we have this bill, all that has happened is basically that we have, in part 2A.1, `Concession cards, Division 1—Qualification for, and issue of, pensioner concession card'; a bit further on in the bill we have `Division 2—Qualification for seniors health card'; and then `Division 3—Qualification for health care card.' We still have three cards—no smart cards, no quantum leap from the department. All of us in this place are constantly badgered by people who have to go through the system or who have their information lost. We, and our staff, quite often have to go through the harrowing process of ringing someone in Centrelink and saying: `Can you bring someone's record up on the computer? I have Mrs So-and-so sitting next to me. She knows for a fact that she went to centre A and gave this information. What is the problem?' And so on.
 When computers came in we were supposed to have a paperless society. I would imagine that Centrelink is absolutely overwhelmed with the information that they receive on a daily basis. As I said, four years ago we thought we could change a lot of this and put it all on a smart card. Four years later nothing at all has happened, and all the bill has done is go through, in great DSS detail, subsection and clause, qualification rules, residential requirements and a copy of assessment of taxable income to the secretary, duration of waiting periods, and all that. All they have done is finesse the guts—if I may use such a nasty word—of the thing. That is all they have fiddled around with. We have still got three cards. People are still battling to get from one to the other and, basically, all the hard work that this committee has done is for nought. And when the minister responds I would like to think that he, in the dying stages of the 39th Parliament, will have gone and had a read—because I do not think he has—of this excellent report, Concessions—who benefits?Report on concession card availability and eligibility for concessions.
Some of us were revolutionary enough to say that the DVA should be on the card as well. But, as expected, the veterans put their hands up, lobbied, and said, `No, we are a special little group.' I admit they are, but in this day and age those who are still alive—and there are not all that many of them, 22 from the First World War, a declining number from the Second World War, and even the Vietnam diggers are ageing—have got countless plastic cards in their wallets and are used to swiping them, at the garage to pay for their petrol, at the Greek shop to get something through EFTPOS, and even for something as simple as their groceries at Coles. So the great phobia has changed. I would like to think that, at the end of this year when we have had an election, the new minister will look at this report and accept some of the recommendations because, as I say, we are now in the 21st century, we now have the technology, people are now accepting of some person sitting behind a screen saying, `Yes, Mr Quick, you can,' or `I am sorry, Mr Quick, the card does not let you do this,' or staring at a bank screen that says `Unavailable funds', and so on. The whole privacy thing has gone out the window. The only touchy bit is about doctors and doctors' records. 
The minister said in his second reading speech that we now are aiming for a simpler and more coherent social security system. I think that is a load of absolute codswallop because, as I said, all they have done is finesse the guts of the thing. We still have got two DVA cards, three seniors health cards, the health care card and the pensioner concession card. As someone who is happily celebrating his 60th birthday today and able to get a seniors card if I lose my seat at the next election, I for one would love to have one smart card that enabled me to avail myself of not only Commonwealth concessions but also concessions at local government level and state government level.
In conclusion, one of the things that we discovered as we wandered around Australia was that we still are in the rail gauge era: each state has its own concessions and entitlements. So, although a person with a disability who lives in Tasmania has access to transport in Tasmania, if they wander over to Victoria people will say, `I'm sorry, you're a Tasmanian, not a Victorian.' The small amount of money they are able to get as a travel bonus in one state does not equate to what they are able to get in another state. People still are saying, `You're a Tasmanian,' or, `You're a Victorian,' or, `You're a Queenslander.' All this would be eliminated if we had one Commonwealth concession card. I ask the minister to address in his response—after all the speakers have made their contributions—what we recommended in the report. We are Australians. We have a Commonwealth entitlement. We should have one card—a smart card—and then we would not have the situation where, four years after these excellent recommendations were put forward, the government has come up with the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Concession Cards) Bill 2001 but does sweet nothing.
 (Mr Nehl)—I thank the member for Franklin. I am sure the committee will join me in wishing him a very happy 60th birthday.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—As has been said by previous speakers, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Concession Cards) Bill 2001 consolidates the administrative provisions relating to concession cards in one part of the Social Security Act. The measure aims to simplify the administration of concessions cards granted by Centrelink. As has been said, the changes result from the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, Concessions—who benefits?, dated October 1997 and tabled in November 1997. I am very pleased to say that I was a member of that committee. In fact, it was the first inquiry in which I was involved as a member of this place.
The consolidation of the provisions relates to the pensioner concession card, which is called the PCC; the health care card, which is called the HCC; and the Commonwealth seniors health card, which is called the CSHC. The bill gives effect to these changes by making amendments to four acts: the Social Security Act 1991, the Social Security Administration Act 1999, the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953. These cards amongst other things provide access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits under the National Health Act 1953. They may also be used to access a range of other benefits provided by state and territory local government and many businesses. These legislative changes reflect, in particular, recommendation 24 of the committee's report. As a member of that committee, I welcome them. The inquiry was referred to the committee by the then Minister for Social Security in June 1996, and the committee report was, as I just said, tabled in November 1997.
It is worth looking at the report, in particular the beginning of chapter 8 which deals with the legislative and administrative framework part of the inquiry. The committee was moved at the time to include at the beginning of this chapter a quote, which I would like to share with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and other members. The quote reads: 
At the moment it is a fairly tortuous route for the legislation to be changed.
That was a quote from the transcript of evidence from the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services at the time. How prophetic could a quote have been?
At the moment it is a fairly tortuous route for the legislation to be changed. 
Here we are almost four years later debating that very issue. Given that the government's response to the committee report was to accept recommendation 24, it has taken an inordinate amount of time to get to the stage we are at today of actually debating the legislative changes reflecting the recommendation. On 7 December, in the second reading speech of the bill, the minister said:
The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Concession Cards) Bill 2000 is a further step towards meeting the Government's objectives to achieve a simpler and more coherent social security system because it represents a major simplification of the law relating to concession cards.
Yes, it does. But it is sad that it has taken so long to get to this point. If, in fact, this issue were a life support system then those with concession cards would all be dead by now. We need to question the government's timetable and priorities, particularly when, as I just mentioned, this bill was presented in December. That is almost seven months ago. It took three years to get the bill to the House and it has now taken, after it has come to the House, another seven months to get it from a piece of print on the Notice Paper to actually being debated. I am a bit sad about that, as are other members who have reflected on this. It took three years to get the bill to the parliament and six months to get it to this point after it reached the House.
I refer to the government response to this committee's inquiry and report and, in doing so, hopefully add thoughtful comment as to exactly where we are with the progress of simplification of bureaucratic requirements through the government administration. I take up and agree with what the previous speaker, the member for Franklin, said in relation to the single card issue. There would be, as the committee—if I recall correctly—considered at the time, some questions to be thought through and some issues to be dealt with, particularly those of privacy and the process of streamlining the massive amount of information by collating it and putting it into one card system. By the same token, there is no question in my mind that it is both possible and acceptable to the majority of the community to now go down that sort of path. We have the technology, we have the know-how and we have the ability to handle the privacy issues. I think it is a bit sad that we are bypassing something that could have been rather exciting to delve into.
The response by the government to the recommendation of a single concession card is also interesting to think about. I share it with the House today:
The government will examine the benefits and the developmental requirements involved in introducing a single concession card. The use of a single concession card would be dependent on the ability to use the card to differentiate levels of entitlement.
Sure, that is incredibly obvious. The response continued:
In supporting the introduction of a single concession card the Government notes that it impacts mainly on State and Territory Governments as the major deliverers of concessions and that the concession system operating in each State and Territory will differ.
Yes, that is why we had the inquiry. It concludes:
Therefore any plan to introduce a single concession card would require full consultation and ongoing operation with these jurisdictions.
In that response, the government says that it would examine the benefits and the developmental requirements. I would like to know what the outcomes of those inquiries have been. I would like to find out from the minister whether that work has been done and, if it has, to what degree it is now ready for some form of consideration—be it done within the bureaucracy, by parliamentary committee or by public comment. It is interesting that we are celebrating the Centenary of Federation this year, and yet a lot of the things that we are discussing in this report and in this consideration keep bringing us back to federation: the reasons we cannot do things are state and territory government roles. 
I would like to think that, in celebrating the Centenary of Federation, we could be modern enough to look at the ways we could develop the next step of federation—in fact, a collegiate one. Let us be brave. Let us actually look at a new federation. Let us see what is possible. As the member for Franklin said, do we have to be forever gummed down in the rail gauge mentality in this country? Are we going to use forever that sort of reasoning as the excuse for never advancing anything? Well, you never know; it might be quite possible after the next federal election, should we be fortunate enough to be endorsed by the Australian people—and that is yet to be seen—with a majority of Labor state and territory governments and a federal one, that a new federation may be able to be examined, with a bit of collegiate agreement.
The other recommendation which rings very loudly in this vein is the one to which the member for Franklin paid regard very briefly; that is, recommendation 23, which relates to the disabled taxi transport subsidy. The recommendation was for the Commonwealth to initiate a negotiation process among all state and territory governments regarding a disabled taxi transport subsidy with a view to establishing a national scheme of reciprocity. Nothing could be better for those folk out there who need this sort of transport than to see that sort of innovation. 
The response was that the recommendation had been noted; that the Commonwealth supports the principle; and that any initiatives towards interstate reciprocity of taxi services were the responsibility of those governments. That is true, but can't the Commonwealth have an overall view of how the country operates? Is it enough for a Commonwealth government of any political persuasion to say, `If you live in New South Wales, you'll get X number of taxi rides; if you live in Western Australia, you'll get a different number, and if you live in Victoria, you'll get another number, and we don't really care because it's up to all of them to do that'? Is it sufficient for us to sit as a Commonwealth parliament and for the Commonwealth government to adopt that and be happy with it, or should we in fact be more active? Should we be more inventive? Should we start pushing a few envelopes and see whether or not we can start to invent a new form of federalism which gets rid of the rail gauge mentality? I do not think it is good enough. It is predictable and easy. It is probably very difficult to understand how we could do that. I do not know whether we could achieve it. Unless we try, we will never know. In the meantime, we still have this theme of what you get depending on wherever you are and wherever you live. I think it is a bit sad if we are going to sit back and take it and not have any wish to change things. 
I welcome recommendation 24 of the report, which has led to the introduction of this piece of legislation. I would have welcomed it a long time ago, if it had come up any earlier. I fear that the indigenous health report will be treated in the same the way as this one has been treated—that is, slowly and tortuously, if at all. I happen to be a very strong supporter of and am totally addicted to the committee work of this parliament. I believe in it very strongly. I believe that the parliament to which these committees report is forever enriched by the work that they do. 
The work of these committees offers enormous potential based on a very high degree of experience and input from members of all parties in this place. I think it is very sad if we sometimes see, probably a little more often than we need to—and not just by this government, to be fair, but by governments—a reluctance to grasp the nettle when these reports come out. Sometimes they come up with things that do prove difficult to implement—for instance, getting rid of the rail gauge mentality in relation to concession cards. But so be it. If the people who are working on these reports raise unanimous considerations after a great deal of work and after having the opportunity to speak with a wide range of people, they are not being fanciful. They are in fact producing information based on very good evidence that things can sometimes be done. I would like to think that any government of the day would have the intestinal fortitude to try to see how many edges can be pushed aside. 
I would like to finish by again welcoming this and saying that I am sorry this is as far as we seem to be going at this stage. That is not in any way denigrating this bill but I wish there had been a bit more to it. I wish that we had in fact seen a little more innovation come from it. I was under the possibly naive impression—as a new member of this place in 1996—when this reference came to this committee, which I was a brand-new member of, that at the end of the day we would have seen some action. We are seeing some, but very slowly and very selectively. I would like to think that at some point in the future we will see some more action come from this and also some more serious consideration being given to how much better we can make the concession card system around this country operate for everybody—for government, for the consumer who holds that card in their hand, and for the people who are providing services to that cardholder—so that the bang we get for our buck is better all the way around and we really do get a great deal of benefit from those processes.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONCESSION CARDS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,68,1,speech
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—I am pleased to rise to support the measures contained within this Social Security Legislation Amendment (Concession Cards) Bill 2001 and would like to acknowledge the contribution of the previous speaker, the member for the Canberra. I am very well aware of her commitment to this general area and appreciate so many of the comments that she has just made in support of this legislation. I share a lot of her frustrations too but I will put a different edge to the way I express my concerns. I see what is before us as part of the incremental process of government of change for the good. It is change for the betterment of average Australians.
Like the member for Canberra, I often want to see quick changes and things happening in a faster way. The way federation operates—and the rail gauge mentality which is restricting changes through all state jurisdictions—is certainly pathetically alive and well 100 years after the founding fathers created this country. Of course, part of the problem is that this, in itself, is a strength. Federation brings the best sets of ideas to the fore. One would hope that, with federation working properly, if the best idea was out of Western Australia all states would want to grab it.
If you want to talk about the rail gauge mentality, the best set of railway tracks laid anywhere in Australia are in Queensland. I am not saying that because of my partisan affection for the greatest state of Australia and the fact that State of Origin is on this Sunday night—go the Maroons—but because the simple facts are that the non-standard gauge in Queensland is the best laid track anywhere in Australia. It is simply true. The great impediment to rail travel is in the state of New South Wales which has the standard gauge. Every time the Commonwealth lays any more track to try and help with exports, what ends up happening is that the New South Wales government railways throw their city trains onto the Commonwealth laid track and simply clag up the system further. We have a rail gauge mentality, to use that terminology, operating not just in the railway systems where we have 13 types of signalling systems and seven types of safety standards for fire jackets—or it may be the other way around. But 100 years later, it is awfully frustrating, as the member for Canberra said, to see how slow the pace of change can be.
This legislation is a step forward in the process of trying to simplify by standardising the treatment of concession cards. We are taking a bunch of cards that are in one department and putting them into another department. If the aspirations of the member for Canberra and the member for Franklin for a single smart card—using technology imprinting the data associated with that cardholder on it—were ever to come to bear, you would need to go through this stage. The lament of those opposite for progress is being more than met by this government. All this is borne out of fine work done by the House of Representatives standing committee which looked at who benefits from various concessions that are being offered around Australia.  
There are competing standards. There is a huge jurisdictional problem. I have only to look at what goes on in my own area to note that we now have the Brisbane City Council unable to fix roads and footpaths and blocked drains and other council type problems in an efficient manner, yet they want to embark upon social welfare and drug rehabilitation programs and assisting people who need welfare housing. This is yet a third level of duplication of work done by state governments and the Commonwealth government. It is, if you like, a further step away from the aspirations of most sensible members in this place: to try to meet some reasonable standard level of expectation for concession card holders around the county.
The concept of the new federation was talked about by the member for Canberra. It is frustrating to note, across all portfolio areas, the way various state Labor governments work so hard to frustrate Commonwealth reforms—such as those in industrial relations to help create jobs, by insisting that workers be tied to state industrial relations awards. You can look at the way literacy and numeracy reforms were frustrated by state governments as the Commonwealth tried to bring in a standard, and you can look at the varying levels of fuel taxes, with Queensland essentially having none and New South Wales having a massive one. 
I hope those opposite are not suggesting that in Labor's new federation, if they are elected at the next election, we will see a standard fuel tax collected by all states. I hope Labor are not suggesting that. I hope they are not suggesting that, in fact, there will be an imposition of centralised rule across all states to do with those sorts of matters—and any other matter for that matter—because in a federation there has to be cooperation. That is what has made this country so democratic and so free. Democracy is a pretty frustrating process sometimes but it is miles better than all the alternatives we have seen in the past 100 years—that is for sure.
This particular legislation is to consolidate within the framework of the social security laws all the rules which relate to the issue and holding of three types of concession cards issued on behalf of the Department of Family and Community Services: the pension concession card, which is issued under the National Health Act, the health care card and the seniors health care card. There is actually a legislative basis for only one concession card, and that is the seniors health care card, and the issue and holding of pensioner concession cards and health cards is governed by administrative rules. All of this is covered by provisions in the National Health Act of 1953 and the Health Insurance Act of 1973. There are, of course, consequential amendments to the National Health Act to provide that a person holding a pensioner concession card, a seniors health card or a health care card, under social security law—or a dependant listed on such a card—is a concessional beneficiary for the purposes of that act. Under the health act a person's status as a concessional beneficiary gives them and their dependants an entitlement to various pharmaceutical benefits and similar concessions.
This government, in this particular area of concessions, has widened the range of possibilities for people, provided practical assistance to those who need it and imposed additional burdens on some who may not need it—and there is nothing easy about that. It is beholden upon everybody who gains access to various concessions and benefits to stay in touch with the Department of Family and Community Services, and with Centrelink and other agencies, because while we, in this place and on this side of the chamber especially, have been very innovative over the years in the way we have brought new benefits and concessions forward to Australians in need, we also demand that people understand that right is balanced by a responsibility to deal honestly and to concede exactly what their income circumstance is and what their property circumstance is, in order to not mislead and therefore cause a misallocation of important resources in the form of concessions and benefits. 
There will be a bit of pressure in a few families over coming months as this government attempts to ensure that the brand-new and broadened level of family payments is properly applied and that we see families in need getting access to—or greater access to—more payments, balanced by the fact that some families whose circumstance changes and income stream improves have to be prepared to hand those sorts of benefits back. It is a reasonable expectation that the relationship is not just one way; it is not a right to receive concessions and benefits. They also have to understand that they have a responsibility to keep in touch with the issuing authority.
Mr Deputy Speaker, if you look at what we have done for people who are in receipt of these sorts of concession cards during our time in office, you will see that we have provided a guarantee that the pension will remain at 25 per cent or more of average weekly earnings. That is the first time that has occurred. We have increased pensions and we have indexed them ahead of inflation every six months. That means those on a pension receive the pay rise before the price rise instead of having to continually play catch-up, watch the prices rise and wait for an increase in benefit from the government. We have raised the tax-free threshold for retirees, cut income tax rates, increased the seniors tax rebate and raised the threshold for pensioners and part pensioners. Financial institutions duty and stamp duty on shares have been abolished and the Medicare threshold has been increased to $20,000. We have allowed excess imputation credits to be claimed, we have extended the health care card to an additional 50,000 Australians and we have increased overall expenditure on health and aged care. 
Those measures must be coupled with the fact that there are fewer people unemployed and therefore fewer people having to claim access to these sorts of cards. At the same time we have decreased the Commonwealth debt that Labor clocked up over their last five budgets by over $60 billion. So this area of concession cards can be amended and applied in a far more beneficial way to those who truly need access to it. We believe very strongly in providing the sort of support that is contained in this measure—the streamlining of arrangements which bring together in a consolidated way these various concession cards to make them easier to administer. We will, in time, be including other cards and concessions within its framework, provided that various state governments want to cooperate and do not want to place a unique stamp across the concessions and range of benefits that they offer people who receive these cards.
Whilst I certainly accept the proposition from those opposite that there are further things which can be done as far as using technology is concerned, for those who want to opt for a one card, smart card kind of concept, the point is that this government is working very strongly towards making it easier for those who receive concession cards to understand what their entitlements are and, moreover, what their responsibilities are. I commend these measures to the chamber.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONCESSION CARDS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,68,1,speech
"Morris, Allan, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—The government, in its second reading speech on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Concession Cards) Bill 2001, placed great emphasis on bringing coherence to the social security system, the objectives of adequacy, equity, incentives for self-provision and so on. The Minister for Community Services stated that the bill was an ongoing process to ensure that the social security system achieved a simpler and more coherent outcome. They are all very fine words and it all sounds terrific, but like most things this government does you have to look below the surface, and then you find the worms—and they are particularly bad with respect to the system of concession cards. 
I want to ask the government, including government backbenchers, why on earth they let this happen with the transport card. We now have a system under which people are being breached if they fail to keep an appointment. Whether that is justified or not is another issue. The way the government interprets those breaches imposes a second punishment of a substantial nature. We need to recognise that the breaching provisions impose a penalty that is vastly greater than any normal court would provide. The penalty for social security breaches is probably greater than for driving under the influence, burglaries, assaults and robberies. We are talking about taking away something like 18 per cent of a person's income for six months. That is a pretty substantial amount for anybody.  
What then happens is that, because the person is no longer receiving in their hand the full benefit, they lose their entitlement to a concession card and a transport card. The government punishes them for not complying with its requirements that they seek employment and the like, and then removes their capacity to look for jobs. For them to have to pay full fare is another punishment. It is hard to follow the logic of this, other than to say that the government constantly is about punishment. This is a very mean and nasty exercise. The government now says, `It's not our fault; it is the state government's fault.' There is a stream of occasions where the government is mean on the one hand and then tricky on the other in saying, `It's not our problem. It's the state government's problem, because the transport card is their problem.' 
I say to the minister and to the government members that it is not the fault of the state governments, it is your fault. You are taking the breach as a fact of income, not as a fact of garnisheeing. I will explain what a breach really is. A breach occurs when a person is fined or punished for particular behaviour. Their entitlement, as such, still should be to the full amount. But a portion of that entitlement is being taken off them before it is paid into their account—which is fairly common in the case of fines and garnisheeing—as a form of penalty. The government are saying, `No, it's not; their entitlement is actually being reduced.' The misuse of these words gives quite a different meaning from the meaning most of us would expect. If I ask people, `Is a garnishee a loss of your wages or a lowering of your wages?' they would say, `No, it's not. You get your wage and money is taken out of it before it gets into your bank.' The government say that breaching is a reduction in the payment system. 
Those security payment systems are in tiers. There is the full payment system entitlement and there is the part payment system entitlement because you have a breach. In other words, the government are saying that the breach affects your entitlement. But the percentage is on the payment made. If you get only two-thirds of a normal social security payment, the breach would affect that two-thirds payment. But the government are saying, `No. Because the payment they are getting is less, they are not entitled to full provisions.' The obvious reason for all this is that if a person normally does not get a full entitlement it is because they have other income. If they are earning income and their entitlement is reduced because of that income, that is the entitlement process. The entitlement is itself reduced because of the other income. This means that, if they then lose their transport card, they have other income to help make up the difference. In other words, they get less income from social security, because they are earning more in a part-time job, but their capacity to pay the full transport cost is therefore reasonable or sustained.
The government now is equalling the experience of a person losing income from a breach with that of a person getting extra income. The government is saying that the entitlement therefore is different. The fact is that the entitlement of a person on a full payment system is the same as the entitlement of a person who is in breach; they still are notionally entitled to the full payment. But the government is taking 18 per cent of the payment away after it is effectively awarded. To work out the 18 per cent you have to have the payment first, not afterwards, whereas in the case of the person with income, the entitlement is worked out taking their income into account. It is quite different. It is really interesting. I got a letter from Minister Vanstone—I do not know how some of these people sleep at night—following a representation from me on behalf of a Mr Cockroft: 
I note Mr Cockroft's concerns that he has been made ineligible for a transport concession card because he is not in receipt of his full Commonwealth payment, Newstart Allowance. The eligibility criteria for the New South Wales Half Fare Transport Concessions Card are set by the New South Wales Department of Transport.
The fact is that he is entitled to the full fare. This government is taking away part of it. The man is entitled to the full payment. The fact is that he is not getting it because he has been fined. Traffic fines—or any other fines—should not be taken into account as part of a person's income system. This government does so. This government says that this situation destroys his entitlement level. The government likens his entitlement, his payment, to the entitlement of a person who has a part-time job. I find the hypocrisy and contradiction of this so distressing.
I do not know whether many of my colleagues have come across this to date. If they have not, they will, because it is being enforced all over the place. When people who are being breached go to renew their concession cards, they will find they cannot get them; they are no longer eligible because they are not getting the full payment. That is what the federal government says. The federal government is interpreting their breaching as reducing their entitlement. The New South Wales transport system works on the basis of entitlement. It would not give a damn whether a person is being fined or whether the money is being garnisheed. Just think about it: a supporting father, a sole parent, in receipt of a full benefit, who is required to pay $5 a week towards the maintenance of a non-custodial child, would lose their transport card because they have been fined. That is what this means. 
I wonder whether people opposite have actually thought about what they are doing. I wonder whether Senator Vanstone read her own letter and thought about what it actually meant. As I said, the taking away of $5 a week from a non-custodial parent for child support effectively removes their entitlement to a transport card. What on earth are you people up to? What on earth are you doing? You wonder why Shane Stone called you mean and tricky. What kind of deceitful, deceptive nastiness is that? You are knocking off people's entitlements and benefits—and for what reason? I fail to understand it. We get mealy-mouthed words about equity, fairness and coherence in speeches from ministers and backbenchers in order to show their benevolence. It just makes me ill. It really makes me angry. I do not know where I can turn to when governments act like that.
When I write to the minister and say, `Minister, do you understand this is what you are doing? You are treating a breach as a change in the entitlement rather than a removal of part of the income,' the minister, in answering my letter, does not even address the question. The minister flicks it to the state government and says it is all their fault. The fact is that breaches have gone on for a long time. This stuff has only just started, so what on earth are you up to? It is a shame that the minister is not present in the chamber in order to respond to these matters, because nobody can get away with this nonsense about being fair, equitable and coherent when those kinds of anomalies not only exist but are defended by a minister who completely ignores the implications.
The fact is that people receiving reduced payments because of breaches have not had their entitlement reduced; part of the money is just being taken from them. It is a fine; it is a garnishee. But the way it is now being interpreted means that their entitlement has changed, and because they are not entitled to the full payment they are not entitled to a concession card. If one thinks about what that means, one realises that there are tens of thousands of people in the community affected by breaches. There are non-custodial parents paying $25 a week towards their child, all of whom will be affected. When you write to the minister and say, `This must be a mistake. I'm sure you understand that this isn't really what you intended,' the minister writes back, `None of my business, it's all to do with the state government.'  
We know that it is not. We know that, years ago, we negotiated with the state governments about concession cards. We tried to get a uniform system across the country for concession cards. The Commonwealth pays the state governments a lot of money to top up concession cards for part pensioners and the like, so that we can have a uniform, coherent system. It used to be coherent. As I said, I find the words in the second reading speech about coherent systems hypocritical. The fact is that it was coherent; it was uniform. People could see the transparency of it and they could see how it applied. 
Increasingly, this government has made the system incoherent, contradictory and divisive. It is actually picking on the people who are least able to defend themselves, and it is punishing them a second time. The 18 per cent breach for 26 weeks is a huge punishment for people. Often it is for a very minor infringement. Many of these people have quite substantial personal problems. If they miss an appointment because they are involved in a difficult set of circumstances, or for whatever reason, the punishment imposed on them is massive. It is now being imposed by the Job Network providers almost as part of a bonus system for them—the more they breach, the better pay those networks get. So there are now incentives in the system to breach people. Having breached them, having wiped out one-fifth of their income for six months, the government now says, `By the way, you can't get transport concessions now. You're not getting the full payment, therefore you're not entitled to a transport card.' We all know that that normally means there is other income; in other words, a person has got more money coming in than they would normally have. So to equate breaching with having a part-time job, and therefore extra income, is worse than deceptive; it is quite malicious.
I am bringing these things to the parliament's attention yet again but, to be honest, not with much optimism. I wrote to the minister, and that should have solved the problem. We write to ministers to bring things to their attention. We expect them to think about what we put forward and to respond with some form of depth. To get a three- or four-paragraph response which basically ignores the issue, flicks it to the state government and blames the state government for what the Commonwealth is doing is absolutely reprehensible.
This government does not deserve to be in office; it does not deserve the confidence of anybody. A community would not consciously do that to its most disadvantaged people. This government does not represent our community; it does not act on behalf of all Australians; it does things almost daily which are nasty, divisive and on the personal agenda of members of the government. I am bringing this matter to the attention of the parliament in the hope that other members may pick it up, particularly in the hope that there are a lot of people on the government benches who are good, honest citizens who would share these concerns.
I am asking members of the government backbench to recognise what their ministers are doing and to start holding them to account. Unless someone starts to take action, thousands of Australians are going to be even more disadvantaged, even worse off and even more alienated. What do people do when they are alienated? If no-one cares about them, why should they care about anybody else? What we are doing is breeding anarchy and divisiveness in the community, which will have enormous consequences, and we know it. The government cannot plead ignorance, because we know it is happening. Today I call on all government members outside the cabinet to take up this issue. To lose a transport card because you have been breached or are paid child allowance or some other benefit—where the loss of the benefit is punishment rather than because you have other extra income—is incompatible with the system. It is incoherent and it hurts those who most need our support. ",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONCESSION CARDS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,68,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I am pleased to rise and make a contribution to this debate. As we know, this Social Security Legislation Amendment (Concession Cards) Bill 2001 consolidates the administrative provisions relating to concession cards in one part of the Social Security Act. The measures aim to simplify the administration of concession cards granted by Centrelink, and the changes result from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs 1997 report entitled Concessions—who benefits? Report on concession card availability and eligibility for concessions. 
The consolidation provisions relate to pensioner concession cards, health care cards and the Commonwealth seniors health card. The bill gives effect to these changes by making amendments to four acts, including the Social Security Act 1991, the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953. These concession cards provide access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits under the National Health Act 1953. They may also be used to access a range of other benefits provided by state, territory, local government and many businesses.
The House of Representatives standing committee to which I referred recommended that the legislative framework be rationalised to include the bulk concession entitlement provisions in the social security law rather than in legislation administered by the then health and family services portfolio. I think it is a good thing that there should be only one card and, doubtless, those who have access to these cards will benefit. What I am concerned about, though—apart from the arguments which my friend the previous speaker referred to, which I think are relevant arguments—is the number of people who do not get access to these cards, not necessarily because they are not entitled to them but because they are not in the system.
I refer to my own electorate, where I know, as a matter of fact, that very large numbers of people are not within the system. The thing that concerns me is that, because they are not within the system, not only do they not get access to these cards but they do not get access to other income support. I commend the government on an initiative contained in the last budget to extend the number of Centrelink offices in regional areas, particularly in communities around my own electorate. I say that because I had the experience of visiting one of them, at Maningrida. Maningrida is a community which services an area containing 2,200 to 2,500 people on the northern Arnhem Land coast. It is very isolated during the wet season, when road access is not available. The only access is by plane or barge.
The reason I raise this matter is that a Centrelink office has been opened at Maningrida and, as a result of that, an additional $54,000 per fortnight is coming into that community. What this tells me is that a large number of people were not accessing their entitlements, and they were not accessing their entitlements for a whole range of reasons. But it also tells me that there are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of people in the Northern Territory alone who are not accessing their appropriate entitlements under various pieces of Commonwealth legislation. There are a number of reasons for this, and I will come to those in a moment.
I will give another example. In Alice Springs, there is an organisation called Tangentyere Council. When they started their CDEP program—currently their CDEP program has about 300 participants, maybe slightly fewer or slightly more—the average income of town campers was $3,000 per annum. Let us contemplate what that means. This represents income for adults in these town camps around Alice Springs of $60 a week. 
I want to talk about these matters because, whilst I endorse the proposal for a single card, you have to be able to access the card. To access the card you must be in the system. And to be in the system, you have got to make application. In the case of Tangentyere, they have a financial counsellor who is funded by the Commonwealth. There are five financial counsellors around the Northern Territory. The financial counsellor based at Tangentyere assists with tax returns. As a result, these people are now in the system. They are getting access to their benefits and entitlements—but only fortuitously, because of the employment of this financial counsellor, which was an initiative of the previous Keating government. 
It makes me very concerned about the large numbers of people who currently do not have access to a financial counsellor and have probably not filled in a tax return or had a tax return filled in for them for many years, if at all. I know for a fact that many people, especially those who live in outlying communities, who receive pieces of official correspondence, such as the correspondence they might receive from Centrelink, cannot read or write. In many instances they will not have people to assist them in interpreting the information which is contained in that documentation. This is an important matter. 
The point I wish to make is that, in Central Australia alone, very large numbers of people have English as a second, third or fourth language. They have no literacy skills in English, let alone in their own languages and, if they are lucky enough to have it in their own language, a lot will not have it in English. In the case of Central Australia, there are a large number of language groups: Central Arrernte, Eastern Arrernte, Western Arrernte, Warlpiri, Wurrumungu, Kaytej, Alyawarra, Anmatjere, Pertame, Luritja, Pintubi, Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra—just to name a few. Then there are the Top End languages—Gunwinggu, Gunavidji and Gupapuyngu. 
These people live in isolated communities away from Centrelink offices and away from the assistance of financial counsellors. They are falling through the net. As I said for the benefit of the minister, I support the initiative of the government to expand the number of Centrelink offices. I think it is a very important initiative, but I want to highlight to the government the fact that, regardless of what they believe, very large numbers of people are getting no access to their proper entitlements or benefits. In relation to this legislation, they will not access these cards. They will not access these cards because they cannot make an application and they will not even be aware that they are entitled to the cards. 
As was mentioned yesterday, the coalition is clawing back family tax. How are the large numbers of people who, as I assert, have English as a second, third or fourth language, and many of whom are illiterate, supposed to come to terms with the government's requirements for their entitlements or obligations? If those people are lucky enough to be in the system, they live in a community where there are financial advisers—of which there are only five around the Northern Territory—or they live in a community where there is a Centrelink office—and there is currently only one outside Darwin in an Aboriginal community, and that is at Maningrida. Unless they have a community council or a local government council which has the resources to provide them with the sort of advice they need, then they will inevitably fall through the net. 
I know of a number of communities which have people under contract to the social security department to provide services, but they do not provide the full range of social security services. Unfortunately, despite their best will and best intentions, they are not able to cover the field. I know that, in some instances, the contractual arrangements with Centrelink are such that communities have said to Centrelink, `We will no longer undertake this obligation for you because we are not being properly remunerated. The cost that you are imposing on us is an unreasonable burden on our organisations, on our council and on our community.' That is not reasonable. 
I say to the minister that, if he is not aware of it, he should make himself aware of it. It means that the people who are most in need in our community are suffering as a result. These are the very people who, if they happen to have made a wrong estimation of their income—if they have actually made an estimation of their income in the first place, which is unlikely given that they will not have accessed the system—will be most damaged by the clawback under the family tax arrangements. Lest you think that what I am saying bears no relation to reality, let me give you an example. Willowra is an Aboriginal Warlpiri community 330 kilometres north-west of Alice Springs. The next closest community is 150-odd kilometres away at Ti Tree, which is on the Stuart Highway, and from there it is a further 180 kilometres to Alice Springs.  
Willowra has a population of around 450 and it has 50 dwellings. A large proportion of those dwellings are regarded as unfit for habitation; nevertheless they are occupied. None of the indigenous houses has a telephone. There is a mail service once a week. There has been no CDEP in the community since ATSIC withdrew funding in 1999. To phone Centrelink, residents of Willowra use a limited number of public phones or they use the phone at the council office. Madam Deputy Speaker, can you imagine being a person in this community—perhaps a young mother with limited education and young children in tow—in a crowded council office, talking to a call centre based Centrelink officer in another state and in a language that you have learnt third-hand? Also, you would not know your birth date, you certainly would not have access to a birth certificate, and you would not have a driver's licence or other forms of personal identification. This is a certainty that faces many indigenous Australians wherever they might live, but it particularly faces people who live in remote communities.
It can be argued that indigenous call centres have been set up especially to assist indigenous clients. But how many of these call centres have available to them people who can speak one of those languages that I referred to earlier—Warlpiri, Arrernte, Anmatjere, Pitjantjatjara, Ngaanyatjarra, Gunwinggu, Gunavidji—or any of the plethora of languages across Northern Australia? The truth is that these people are being discriminated against—unwittingly perhaps, but nevertheless discriminated against—and extremely disadvantaged. This leads to people effectively being an underclass in our community. I ask the minister to contact the call centre in Darwin and ask them how many languages they speak. Ask them whether, if someone rings up, they will be able to respond to them in Warlpiri, Gunavidji, Gunwinggu or in any number of the plethora of languages that operate up there. The fact is, they will not be able to do that, although they might have a limited knowledge of some languages. 
—They do a great job.
— Let me make it clear, Madam Deputy Speaker, through you to the minister, that there is no doubt about the hard work that Centrelink officers do. Let me make that very clear. I am not arguing about that—I am arguing about the nature of the service that is provided and the lack of resources. Ignorance does not help the minister. Until he understands the nature of what I am talking about, I suggest he close his trap. 
The other thing that comes along with this poverty trap that people are in, partly as a result of not having access to these entitlements, is the issues that arise out of the extreme poverty that many indigenous Australians suffer. I note with interest the various discussions which have taken place over recent times about the nature of welfare, whether or not Aboriginal Australians are welfare dependent, and what they need to do to get off it. You cannot continue to blame the victim if the victim is not aware of their entitlements because they do not have an educational background sufficient to be able to understand the documentation they are receiving or because they do not speak, read or write the language that they are receiving the documentation in.
Until we address the appalling lack of social and community infrastructure across regional and remote Australia, there is one thing you can be certain about: you will not alleviate or even go anywhere near alleviating the dire nature of poverty in these communities. The flow-on effects of this to the rest of the community in terms of health, family violence and other issues ought to be obvious to everyone. I note that, in a paper titled `Domestic violence—findings and recommendations of the National Committee on Violence', Chappell and Strang state:
Violence generally is more common in those societies characterised by widespread poverty and inequality. In Australia, both victims of violence and violent offenders tend to be drawn from the most disadvantaged socio-economic groups. Although we do not know whether a direct relationship exists between poverty and domestic violence, we can assume that stress engendered by poverty may play its part. 
Straus et al have found that poor unemployed men more often live in violent households than those whose families are more affluent.
Cultural disintegration may also play a role in the loosening of social prohibitions against violence. Large segments of the Aboriginal population experience feelings of alienation because of their status as marginal members of our society. In such communities violence of all kinds, including domestic violence, is frequently found on an appalling scale. The committee believes that breakdown in traditional prohibitions, and lack of identity with alternative values, plays a part in the high incidence of such violence in Aboriginal communities.
People are given the status of an underclass because of where they are, who they are, where they live and what their cultural background is and—without question in my mind—the high levels of poverty that they experience. I say to the government that, whilst I support this legislation and the rationalisation of these cards, it is important to acknowledge—and I ask the minister to do this with good grace—that there are large numbers of Australians, particularly Aboriginal Australians who live in remote communities, who will not access this card. It is not because they do not want to and not because they are not entitled to it but because they are not aware of their entitlements and because they are not in the system. No-one is there to advise them in a way in which they can properly comprehend or understand.
—What about the advertising program?
—Well, we talk about advertising programs. It would be of far more benefit if you were to put in place sufficient field staff who were appropriately and culturally aware—in addition to those staff already available—and could ensure that these people get access to their proper entitlements. There is no excuse for us, as we live in this new century, to tolerate any longer the dire poverty that many Australians experience, particularly those who live in remote and rural areas. It is about time that governments of all persuasions understood their obligations to those people as part of our Australian community.

"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2001-06-28,"—in reply—I would like to thank all honourable members for their contribution to this debate. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Concession Cards) Bill 2001 is part of the government's ongoing commitment to simplifying the social security law. Parliament has already enacted in this sitting the Family and Community Services Legislation (Simplification and Other Measures) Bill 2001. While the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Concession Cards) Bill 2001 can be characterised as another housekeeping bill, it is housekeeping that affects the rights of all holders of concession cards issued by the Department of Family and Community Services, and it is pleasing to see that the bill has the support of all parties.
The bill codifies, within the framework of the social security law, all the rules relating to the issue and holding of the three types of concession cards issued on behalf of the Department of Family and Community Services: the pensioner concession card, the seniors health card and the health care card. It does this by amending the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. It also makes the necessary consequential amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953.
At the moment the only type of concession card that has a legislative basis is the seniors health card. Administrative rules govern the issue and holding of pensioner concession cards and health care cards. The entitlement to concessional pharmaceutical benefits for pensioner concession card holders is covered by the provisions in the National Health Act, while the entitlement to concessional pharmaceutical benefits for health care card holders is covered by the provisions in the National Health Act and the Health Insurance Act. Without question, the current situation is messy and this bill will resolve it. This bill also takes into account amendments made in the Senate, to include assistance to foster children and those who have caring responsibility for them, through the provision of the health care cards. I commend the bill to the House.

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
This Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 amends the Agricultural Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994 and has largely been necessitated by the High Court's decision in R v. Hughes. That decision cast doubt on the duties, functions and powers of the Commonwealth authorities and officers within the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals and a key purpose of this bill is to remedy that situation.
The National Registration Scheme is a cooperative Commonwealth-state legislation scheme which has been operating successfully since 1995. Within the scheme, a number of Commonwealth authorities and officers have significant duties, functions and powers conferred on them by state laws. These include the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, which is the primary regulatory agency in relation to the importation, manufacture and supply of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia. Other Commonwealth authorities and offices include the DPP, the AAT and inspectors and analysts appointed under the Commonwealth laws who play a key role in the NRA's compliance program.
The High Court's decision in Hughes questions the capacity of Commonwealth authorities and officers to exercise powers and functions conferred on them by state legislation in situations where a power or function is coupled with a duty and there is no clear federal head of power to support the duty. The bill amends the relevant Commonwealth act to clarify that the Commonwealth authorises the conferral by state law of duties, as well as functions and powers, on Commonwealth officials and authorities to the fullest extent possible within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth under the Constitution. The bill also ensures that where there is found to be a lack of state constitutional capacity to confer a duty, function or power on a Commonwealth authority or officer—
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order. This is to assist the minister, because we are waiting for a couple of people to come up. I never thought I would ever in this chamber or the other get up and ask the member for O'Connor to keep speaking.
 (Hon. J.A. Crosio)—I do not think it is a point of order. I think the minister is well aware of what he was told.
—We are always prepared to accept such a humorous interjection, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
The bill will also ensure that, where there is found to be a lack of state constitutional capacity to confer a duty, function or power on a Commonwealth authority or officer, the duty, function or power will be conferred by Commonwealth law to the fullest extent possible within the Commonwealth's legislative power. 
The bill will also specifically confirm, both prospectively and retrospectively, that a state law may confer duties, functions and powers on the AAT and on inspectors and analysts appointed under the Commonwealth law. This addresses certain legislate gaps which have been identified in the conferral of state functions on these authorities and offices, in addition to the problem arising from Hughes.
It is intended that following the enactment of this bill corresponding state laws will be enacted to validate the past actions of Commonwealth authorities and officers under the scheme which may be in doubt following Hughes or in light of the legislative gaps. The amendments will ensure that the important roles of Commonwealth authorities and officers within the National Registration Scheme are not put at risk as a result of the High Court's decision in Hughes. 
I present the explanatory memorandum.",REPS,<title>AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,69,1,speech
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I appreciate the indulgence of the committee as it is very difficult to be in two places at once. I am scheduled to speak on the floor of the House, as I speak here now, on the ANZFA bill. I do appreciate the indulgence that has been given to me by the committee, by members of the government and by the minister who has carriage of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. This bill addresses the system of evaluation, regulation and control of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. In the last 10 years in this area we have seen the consolidation of disparate Commonwealth, state and territory regimes into a single national system. This has happened in three main stages: committing the Commonwealth's role in this particular area to legislation, establishing a national body to administer this particular system and synchronising regulation across the country by creating uniform national legislation through cooperative legislation schemes. It is the last area that is the focus of the bill that we are debating today. 
It is instructive at this point to reflect on the history of this issue and the body that is strategically involved in this area, the National Registration Authority. It was set up under a previous Labor administration, and we are quite proud of that. The fact that Australian agriculture now has an image which is, to use the popular phraseology, clean and green, is due in no small part to the administrative and institutional frameworks that were set up by previous Labor ministers in this portfolio in government. Going back a little bit on the history, in 1988 the system was put on a statutory footing and the Commonwealth assumed the responsibility for determining policy on the clearance and registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. At that time a new national body, the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council, was set up. In 1992 we saw a further development with the creation of a new body, the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, which was set up to replace the previous council. It was in 1994 that the parliament passed a package of legislation laying down the base to administer a uniform national system for the evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. This has come to be known as the Agvet scheme.
Recently we have seen two High Court decisions in the area of Corporations Law which have called into question the constitutional validity of national cooperative schemes such as Agvet, to which I have just referred. In the Wakim judgment in 1999, some aspects of the scheme of conferral and consent by state and Commonwealth laws which permit a federal body to exercise functions in both federal and state matters were found to be constitutionally invalid. In the recent decision, Hughes—as I understand it; I am not a lawyer, a bit like the minister opposite me, although he may well be a lawyer— 
—No.
—We are bush lawyers. As I understand it Hughes took the same line as Wakim. In that case the attention was focused on the administrative bodies and not on the courts. 
This particular case law has led to the introduction of this particular bill to the House, basically to strengthen the application of that agvet scheme. If we go back historically and look at Australian farming practices, we have not been astute, as a farming community, in the use of chemicals. I think back to my early days, of being raised in the Western District on a dairy farm where we also grew onions and potatoes. The introduction of chemicals in the sixties was a new way of coming to grips with pests and diseases and improving the productivity of the farm. My father was an onion grower, and the primary source of weed control when I was growing up was to get on your hands and knees with a little hand hoe and go up and down the rows to cut the weeds out. Of course, those farmers who were a little better off turned to chemicals, and some were rather dubious in their application. 
One of the sad features of the introduction of chemicals to Australian agriculture in a mass use sense was the fact that farmers themselves had virtually no idea of the correct way to apply them. In my community there were many farmers who died early as a result of the impact of chemicals on their bodies. They were not aware of those adverse impacts. Medical science will probably record that those farmers died of certain diseases but will not record the causes of those diseases. That issue of occupational health and safety on farms was not an issue back in the late 1950s and 1960s, when I grew up. 
With the amalgamation of farms and the structural adjustment that occurred, the farming community contracted. We saw less of a reliance on farm labour to do some tasks and an increasing reliance on chemicals. Those chemicals, in many instances, were very efficient in areas of weed and pest control, but the occupational health and safety ramifications of their use was not something that farmers at the time understood. 
One of our great advantages today in Australian agriculture is the image that overseas consumers in particular have of Australian agriculture being clean and green. We are recognised as a supplier of quality assured food produced in a clean environment—one which is sustainable—and we are recognised as a country that now adopts a minimalist approach to chemical use. That was not always the case on Australian farms. 
We have seen in Australian agriculture not only this emphasis on a minimalist approach to chemical use, but also a development of the organics industry, where there is no use of chemicals at all. This has a fairly strong pulling power to consumers who have become more environmentally conscious and want to be assured that what they consume is produced in a production system which is aware of their needs as consumers for food that they regard as clean.
One of the interesting developments, as I look at the area that I grew up in, is the rise of small organic enterprises. One enterprise in particular that I can relate to is a small manufacturer of organic ice-cream located in Irrewarra, just outside of Colac, the home town area where I was born and raised. I have to say—and this might be a free advertisement for the ice-cream that is produced there—that it is a blessing and a curse for those who were raised on dairy farms. It is probably the most exquisite ice-cream that you could ever taste, but too much of it could land one in a very serious state over time, as far as one's heart condition is concerned. But the Hitchins, the family that produce the ice-cream, have an almost unlimited demand for it. They go around the local shows and the local marketplaces and they have a small value adding enterprise on farm, but the demand for what consumers perceive to be a good quality product that is clean and free from chemicals is very strong indeed. 
I think Australian agriculture has made giant strides in reducing the reliance of Australian agriculture on chemicals—and the institutional framework that was set up under previous Labor governments was part of those giant strides. There are some in the community who would have Australian agriculture not use any chemicals at all. We have to be very cognisant of the fact that one of the responsibilities of the sector is to produce clean safe food, but there is another responsibility of the sector and that is to produce cheap food. I do not mean rock-bottom priced food, but quality value food for Australian consumers, especially low income families. Farmers are happy to do that as long as they get a fair share of the retail dollar. What we have seen in recent times—and the minister comes from a farming area so he would know this as well as anybody—is that, in the carve-up of the final retail price of many foods, a disproportionate amount of the price goes to others in the food chain and not to farmers. 
Farmers are finding themselves increasingly squeezed at the production end. I have travelled throughout Australia in this portfolio talking to farmers, and there are a couple of issues that come up perennially in the food production and retailing debate. The first of those issues is that prices farmers receive are being squeezed at the farm gate, yet the retail margins are expanding. We can see that in the milk, citrus, apple and pear industries and a lot of other industries as well. We know that, under Australian law, farmers are not able to bargain collectively, in many instances, with processors for a better deal from the marketplace. We have an issue in Victoria at the moment with chicken growers. We have problems in other areas of agriculture, where farmers are being squeezed at the farm gate in the prices that they get for what they produce, yet the retailing margins seem to be very large indeed.
Accompanying that is the issue of supermarket power. The supermarkets are demanding of farmers an increasing quality in the produce that they supply. Because of the pressure that is coming onto the farm sector from supermarkets, farmers have to turn to measures and to areas where they are able to secure a quality output for sale to those retailing chains. In this situation, the judicious use of chemicals to prepare the field and to prepare the product for the marketplace is very important indeed.
Chemicals are used at various stages in the production chain, not only on farm to control pests and disease—which influence the productivity of the farm—and in the preparation of the produce on farm for the marketplace, but when we get into value-adding processes we can acknowledge the role that they do play in agricultural production without necessarily endorsing their use. We need to ensure we have the administrative frameworks and institutional structures in place to effectively monitor their use and ensure not only that farmers are aware of the chemicals they are using but that they have skill in applying those chemicals in the production process.
It is a heavy responsibility that falls not only on government to successfully monitor chemicals in food, but also on the companies that produce these products for use in Australian agriculture. They too have a responsibility to educate and ensure the products of their research are judiciously used so consumers can have confidence that the food they are consuming has a minimal input of chemicals in the production process.
There are two main agencies involved, the National Residue Survey, the NRS, and the National Registration Authority. The National Residue Survey was established in the early 1960s in response to concerns in major export markets about pesticide residues in meat. It has, 40 years later, expanded the range of commodities it covers to meet the growing industry demands on its personnel and services. Operationally, in the last financial year, the Residue Survey was divided into the following programs: animal products, grains and horticultural products, and fisheries and aquaculture products. Surveillance, compliance and prevention programs are an integral part of the operations of that particular body.
It is also involved in laboratory procurement and performance evaluations. The primary purposes of that survey are to meet the needs of participating industries in maintaining access to key markets, maintaining consumer confidence in Australia's food industry and food production, establishing a bank of objective and scientifically valid data, using that data to underpin quality assurance programs and assisting in resolving what you would call residue related trade incidents. These residue monitoring programs are fully cost recovered. That particular body is accountable to the parliament—and so it should be. Some of the most important programs and areas of its activity are the surveillance, compliance and residue prevention programs that have been developed in key rural industries, including the cattle industry and the sheep meats, pig, honey, apple and pear industries. 
In agriculture we have had some real conflicts between primary producers and the use of chemicals in a quite different production process. The endosulfan residue in beef is an example that comes to mind. Endosulfan is an organochloride insecticide that is widely used on cotton and other field crops, and in orchards. However, it has the potential to contaminate cattle when they graze on contaminated pasture or crops.
The history of this is interesting. In 1999-2000, cattle originating from the cotton growing areas of New South Wales and Queensland were tested under a program conducted under the auspices of Safemeat. The extent of the survey needs to be appreciated. Between October 1999 and March 2000, 14,200 samples from 4,430 properties were tested for endosulfan residue. This program was very important to assure our major trading partners that this chemical residue was under control. We are dealing with the meat industry, one of Australia's major exporters, and the consumers of our products are becoming increasingly concerned about chemical residues in the products that they import. They are putting strict environmental strictures on production processes and on issues such as chemical residues.
The National Registration Authority of Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals operates the Agvet scheme. The review of registered chemicals that takes place under that program is announced in the Agvet chemicals gazette. Each year, importers, manufacturers and exporters must provide the NRA with a record of quantities of chemicals transacted as a component of any formulated product. Any person wishing to supply agricultural or veterinary chemicals or chemical products must apply to that particular body for licences, and NRA registration is required for products other than for human use to kill pests and control diseases. It is a very important body and, I am proud to say, it was originally set up under the previous Labor administration. 
This is a very important issue to Australian agriculture. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 is necessary to tidy up the impacts of case law outside the operating system. The opposition support the measures that the government has outlined in this bill. We are committed, as an opposition, to the minimal use of chemicals in Australian agriculture, to the production of clean, green produce that consumers can have confidence in, and we are committed to strong regulatory frameworks and institutional structures that give effect to that objective.",REPS,<title>AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,69,1,speech
"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—I put my name down in the whip's office to speak on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 about a month ago because—and I am certainly in favour of it—there are a couple of profound issues that lie behind the terms of the bill that I would like to say a few things about. I say that in the context that this could be the last time that I ever speak in this parliament. If there is an early election and today proves to be the last day that the House of Representatives sits in this term, then after this speech I go to my political grave—quite happily. That is why I would like to go beyond the terms of the bill and say a few other things.
There are two things about this bill: one is the subject matter of the bill itself, and that is the constitutional scheme by which a cooperative arrangement is attempted by the states and the Commonwealth to establish a national authority to regulate the use of chemicals in agricultural and veterinary matters; and the other is the subject matter of the authority itself—what we do with chemicals and how, in terms of our trading of agricultural and, indeed, forestry products, we are threatened by enormous forces on foot both within and outside our borders. Just on the constitutional issue, it is interesting to see elected governments, ministers and their advisers looking at the world and saying, `Well, let's do things in a different way. Let's take our Federation, change the traditional way of doing things—the division of powers set out in the Constitution—and cooperate.' `Cooperate' is a very attractive sounding verb and `cooperation' a very delightful sort of noun; you could not be against cooperation. But along the way some of the more basic elements of the Constitution—that is, the Federation itself— have been ignored in the rush to establish these cooperative schemes. 
In re Wakim and R v. Hughes, two cases in the High Court, the judges said, `Well, hang on a minute. You cannot just go ahead, legislate and make these agreements without reference to the basic law that gives life to you as governments'—and that is the Australian Constitution. Indeed, within the High Court there have been trends where the interpretation of the Constitution has been very weak or loose and where, on the other hand, at times it has been very strict. From the days when Justices Deane, Mason and Brennan held sway in the court and they often, I believe, sought to replace what were previously strict interpretations of the Constitution with their own views—and that is reasonable; judges from time to time must exercise some personal view of the problem at hand—what I regard as vague and sometimes unreliable notions of international opinion or even suggested implied powers, such as a nationhood power, whatever that means, were used to justify decisions that were quite surprising. Not all of the things these judges said at the time actually made their way into precedent—law, that is—but they were often said in the judgments. Then, as time has passed, with new judges being chosen to sit on the bench as those other judges have retired, there has been a certain strictness injected back into the decisions. So the Constitution comes to life again as a document that must be obeyed, when these arrangements are made.
I ran into this National Registration Authority last year—quite coincidentally in the very electorate held by our colleague the honourable member for Gilmore, sitting today as the Deputy Speaker. After some inspiring advice from Minister Tuckey, I had set about establishing a plantation of my own to grow the sorts of timbers that decorate this parliament— those lovely veneer timbers that Australia does not produce enough of. In seeking to apply a bit of Roundup—the farmer's friend, I might call it—and other chemicals such as simazine and herbicides to keep the weeds under control, a lady in the local co-op said, `Oh well, you'll have to talk to the National Registration Authority about that.' I thought: gee, that's a pretty grand sounding outfit; I've never heard of it before. So I found it on a web site, rang it up and found that suddenly there is a scheme on foot. Then here we are today talking about whether or not the way it is being operated is constitutional. This bill is seeking, in a sense, to anticipate what might happen in the High Court if the scheme were challenged: that is, if a Commonwealth officer charged with the duty of enforcing the regulations were to come and arrest me—not that I would breach any of the rules—whether or not it would be legal for that person to levy a fine or issue some direction to me, according to the rules and protocols that the authority produces for the use of these chemicals.
So there are some large constitutional issues at stake in this. We really will not know—until, if ever, somebody takes on the act that we are going to pass at present—whether or not this scheme that the drafters have come up with is going to pass muster in the High Court. Beyond that is the subject matter of the scheme itself, that is, the use of chemicals. There are two things here. First of all, we should not ignore the plight of our forestry industry in the sense that we have a trade deficit in forestry, paper and pulp products of around $2 billion a year. The gap has been filled with imports, largely from Third World forests, and gives rise to the need in Australia to have more plantation resources, especially in hardwoods. That is why the government has on foot the Plantations 2020 Vision to rectify this problem. 
Lately there has been some unfortunate coverage in the media of some of the arrangements or schemes based on the tax incentives that we have in our law to promote investment in forestry, and insufficient distinction has been made between the properly approved schemes and those which are plainly dodgy. This adverse media coverage has led to a sudden diminution in investment in these schemes, such that the movement of capital between affluent parts of Australia—such as the one I represent—to those in regional or rural Australia that severely lack capital and hence employment is being frustrated, and that is a shame. A good society, a good economy recycles capital from its affluent parts to its hungry parts. This ought to be at the forefront of any debate about forestry. It is more than just growing trees and producing hardwood or paper. It is about jobs and lives and a fair distribution of wealth. 
Beyond this, it is very easy to frighten people with the word `chemical'. The debate in trade policy—the clash between the need to protect the environment, the multilateral environment agreements, or MEAs, versus the rules based trading system, as embodied in the legal agreements administered by the World Trade Organisation—is just beginning. This debate is going to be very important and potentially very dangerous for a lot of people in Australia, because there is a huge battle between those who see governance generally best done according to the rule of law and using sound science, and those who would rather a more anarchic approach to things. 
For example, the European Union, which is the chief force for protectionism in the world—a vigorous and powerful foe of this country—is, I am told, spending millions and millions of dollars funding non-government organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund to provide advisers on trade policy to governments of developing countries. Those advisers are trying to convince developing countries to do as much as possible to introduce into the trade rules environmental conditions such as would allow a contrived and malicious act by a protectionist country to ban the import of something because of an environmental scare, using what is called `the precautionary principle'—a favourite technique of European governments. That means that where there is a lack of scientific certainty about a certain thing, rather than saying that the proposed importer can have permission to import according to the trade rules and then, if there is a complaint about it, the complainant ought to bring evidence that it is somehow damaging to human health or environmental safety, it is reversed, the ban is imposed and the burden of proof is put on the proposed importer—that is a country like Australia with a large agricultural industry using various chemicals to improve productivity. The burden of proof is put on the exporter to prove that it is not dangerous, that is, to prove a negative—and, in effect, this is impossible. Or the trials of medical evidence and so forth might take 10 or 20 years. In the meantime, the protectionist purpose has been achieved.
On the other hand, if you look at the history of environmental protection in public policy and go back to Rachel Carson and Silent Spring in the 1960s, there were no doubt excesses in the regulation of the development of heavy industries, whereby toxic chemicals were quite freely put into the waters of creeks, rivers and bays. Terrible things were done to innocent people, usually people on low incomes living close to these heavy industries. I think of things like the mercury poisoning of people in the town of Minamata in Japan. 
The consciousness of potential environmental damage grew. The pendulum has come back to where it is now—a fairly good balance. This movement to entrench in trade rules contrived environmental standards allowing protectionist governments to act wilfully is going to take place over the next 10, 20 or 30 years. We have to be aware of this. It is very difficult to get a rational debate through when there is a lot of noise and there are a lot of scare stories around. There are some ridiculous notions, such as, for example, those on the question of aerial spraying of plantations in Australia versus aerial spraying of crops. It is said that those who oppose this bill would make a distinction between the two. That is quite ridiculous. I urge the chamber to support the bill. I understand it is not going to be opposed. That is good to see.  
In the few minutes remaining, if today is indeed the last day of this parliament and these, politically, are my last few breaths, can I simply express my gratitude to all my colleagues. I have learned, since the first few days I sat in the House of Representatives, that you may disagree with people in the most fundamental fashion, but if things are all right and you spend more time with them engaged in debate and if you have some goodwill, you become friendly and you make friends on all sides. Even in the other place I have got some good mates on both sides. I have had a terrific time with colleagues I have served with in this term on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, turning that committee into what it really ought to be—a check on the executive. I know that is not the sort of thing backbenchers are supposed to say, but that is precisely what this country needs—a much greater check on the way ministers, advisers and entrenched interests outside the parliament push us. That is the role of a backbencher. 
Likewise, I express my gratitude to Prime Minister Howard. From time to time we have had some political differences and even some personal differences. But I am grateful for the opportunities he gave me to serve in his ministry in the previous term. It was, as it would be for anyone in this country, a privilege to do so. I wish him well in the future. As one of my colleagues said in our party room yesterday, if there is one thing to admire about that man, it is that he has not given in to the hubris that often engulfs people who hold that office. He is a very decent, modest man and we are lucky to have had him there.",REPS,<title>AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,69,1,speech
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—in reply—In summing up this debate on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2001, as I said in the second reading speech, the bill addresses the implications of the High Court's decision in R v. Hughes, which cast doubt on the duties, functions and powers of the Commonwealth authorities and officers within the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. The roles played by Commonwealth authorities and officers are critical for the effective operation of the scheme. The bill also addresses certain legislative gaps which have been identified in the conferral of state functions on Commonwealth authorities and officers under the national registration scheme arising independently of the implications of Hughes.
The overall aim of the bill is to ensure the validity of the actions of the Commonwealth authorities and officers under the scheme as it presently exists. The bill does not make any substantive policy or operational changes to the scheme. It is supported by all states and territories. Corresponding state laws which validate the past actions of the Commonwealth authorities will be enacted following the passage of this bill. I thank the members who have participated in the debate for their contributions and the opposition for its support for this necessary legislation.

"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—Like many good quotations, some of them were never actually uttered by the people to whom they are attributed, and that is certainly the case with the most famous quotation in respect of patents. In fact, the phrase `Everything that can be invented has been invented' was attributed to a patent commissioner in the United States in the mid-1800s. Of course, that phrase was not actually uttered by any such patent commissioner at the time. No matter how charming the phrase may appear in the context of history, 150 years later, sadly it is not an accurate reflection of what was actually said. It is someone's over-zealous interpretation of what Mr Ellsworth, the Commissioner of Patents from 1835 to 1845, wrote in his 1843 annual report, which has been misunderstood and misquoted ever since. He actually wrote: 
The advancement of the arts, from year to year, taxes our credulity and seems to presage the arrival of that period when human improvement must end. 
Of course, that was neither true then nor true now; nor has it been true at any point in between. Indeed, human invention and human creativity have continued apace ever since. He was somewhat prophetic when he predicted the time when human improvement must end. The reality is that we are embarking now on a period when we may well engage in improving the very genetics of humans themselves. So rather than speaking in an overall sense about the human condition, human culture, human science improving, we may now be at the point where we can modify DNA, certainly of plants and animals and ultimately of human beings. Ultimately, humans will continue to improve. They may do so through direct intervention rather than through participation in an overall climate of increased creativity.
I raise this issue broadly because, in the 21st century, there is no doubt that human creativity and the regulation of that creativity by way of trademarks, patents and copyright will be the most important commodities with which our societies will trade. The reality is that those countries which are not able to participate fully in the trading of intellectual property, which do not rigorously protect the intellectual property of their citizens, which do not seriously promote the development of intellectual property rights, the development of creativity, the opportunity for inventors not only to create but to patent, subject to trademarks and copyrights, their cultural, scientific and technical inventions, will not succeed.
If one looks at the trend—where one compares GDP with patent counts; that is, the number of patents lodged in a country—there is a very clear linear relationship between success in patents granted and the GDP of the country. There is no doubt that the United States, Japan, Germany and the UK all track along the line of success in patenting and success in GDP. The two go hand in hand. Those who do not actively pursue the development of knowledge industries, the development of a knowledge nation, will certainly pay the price in terms of the welfare and the wealth of their populations.
The reality is that the economy which Australia has developed to this date is based on several major areas. Historically, it is primarily based on our success in agriculture and mining. These are the two primary industries on which we have relied significantly. Obviously, since the war, we have also participated very significantly in the development of our manufacturing industries, although we have not done as well in the elaborately transformed manufactures, the high-tech sector, as we perhaps should have done and as we need to do if we are to capture that slice of the market which yields a higher value.
It is false dichotomy to talk of the new economy and old economy because those old economy industries to which I just referred—agriculture and mining—will in the future, as they do in many ways already, rely very heavily on the development of new economy technologies. New economy technologies are principally those based around biotechnology in agriculture and mining software, mapping software, geophysical mapping, equipment inventions and productivity changes which we have seen in the case of mining. I dare suggest that some developments in biotechnology will certainly promote the advantage of our two most famous and significant allegedly old economy industries but, of course, they are new economy in many ways and are increasingly dependent on new economy to remain competitive in a global market.  
How does Australia compare in the intellectual property stakes? How do we fare in this race? Unfortunately, in recent time, not that well. The United States is averaging between 15 per cent and 20 per cent growth in patents, whereas in Australia it has been somewhat less than that. US businesses are averaging five per cent investment in research and development. We have not kept pace with other industrialised economies in many areas of the knowledge nation race, and patents, trademarks and copyright in their various spheres of influence are good markers to look for in the context of what might be occurring in our society and in our economy. 
One can see the value arising from that patenting process and from the trademark process in the US because they have the physical proximity to the inventors of the products and can ensure that they are able to pass on their knowledge, creativity and inventiveness to those who work in those industries. So it is important to physically tie together the invention and the creation of new knowledge with those who will commercialise and develop it to market. If you do not have that physical proximity, then ultimately you are a derivative economy and one which is not so successful. So I think the government's attitude in this regard must be revised if we are, in fact, to participate in the many profitable ventures which can flow from Australian ingenuity and creativity. That has always been the case in the past here, and we will have to invest very heavily in the future if that is to be the case here again.
Australians need to be part of that knowledge nation infrastructure—one which not only is a creative infrastructure but also encourages people to have the capacity, the education, the government incentive, the rigorous intellectual property laws which we are about today. They also need leadership from the government, investment in basic science and technology— which unfortunately has been falling in recent years since the election of the Howard government—and, ultimately, industrial R&D. Investment in industrial R&D, while rising in most other OECD countries quite dramatically along with investment in education, is sadly in decline in this country. It is a trend that must be reversed urgently if we are to have the high wage, high skilled jobs which our future generation demand and, indeed, which we have every obligation to offer them.
The trademarks bill, which we are specifically looking at this afternoon, is a relatively minor bill. It does provide the opportunity for trademark staff to assist inventors in preparing their applications, something they were specifically prohibited from doing before—and that obviously is an advantage. I can see why in earlier times that may have been prohibited. The reality is that these days it is quite important that the staff of government departments be able to assist people—although obviously not in the preparation of their invention or in securing rights for them which others do not have—with general assistance to taxpayers, inventors and those who would like to lodge a trademark application in preparing the necessary bureaucratic forms around which these things inevitably seem to revolve.
One would like to see more work done in reducing the level of bureaucracy around these things. It is important also when securing property rights—because that is what these are—to be sure that you have tied up all of the necessary paperwork and all of the loose ends. Given the globally competitive nature of this business, it is also essential that we cooperate with other countries through the international agreements which revolve around patents, trademarks and copyright and that we maintain our competitive position, and that we also rigorously protect the intellectual property of others. They will not respect our intellectual property unless we respect theirs. 
It is quite critical that we enforce, on a global basis, the protection of that intellectual property. At times that will seem harsh, unreasonable and almost unconscionable. One looks at the protection of drugs in relation to AIDS, for example, in the Third World and in Southern Africa, where human lives are at stake and where intellectual property fetches whatever price the market will bear—but where companies are under duress and pressure to reduce the cost of those drugs, as they have done. There will be those exceptional circumstances where more needs to be done to ensure that people receive vital medicinal requirements and other essentials of life. But that should be done on the basis of assistance and grants and work with those countries and with the owners of intellectual property. It should not be done on the basis of confiscation of intellectual property.
I believe we can achieve the necessary humanitarian results while remaining within an essential framework of intellectual property. Patents, for example, expire after a limited period of time. Patents on drugs run for 25 years; patents generally run for some 20 years. In the case of drugs it takes some 10 years to develop them in the first place, so you have limited opportunities to retain your intellectual property in these things, which often vast sums of money are part of. Australia must continue to take a lead in protecting intellectual property throughout the world. It must continue to take a lead in pursuing intellectual property agreements, and the reform of our law domestically is an essential part of that. So the opposition has much pleasure in supporting this legislation, even though it is a relatively minor bill.
I think we pay insufficient attention to the legislative trappings of intellectual property. In the past century we have looked very closely through the states at real property law. We have sought to refine and develop real property law in a very serious way. It is time that we paid that kind of attention to intellectual property rights because they will become very transitory in time and of course totally lacking in any physical manifestation. Nonetheless, those intellectual property rights will be the trading commodities of the 21st century. They will be the premier basis on which countries can secure their intellectual capital, human capital and the wealth of their people, rather than their investment in real property or in other physical commodities, which of course will continue to provide work and an economic underpinning.
But the growth and the most exciting potential is in those new things that we have yet to develop and the things which we are, as we speak, commercialising now. They are the things that will change lives; they are the things that will ensure commerce flows quickly in this country and they are the things which will protect the very basis of the society we are all seeking to develop. I encourage the parliament to pass the legislation and I encourage the government to rethink its attitude to investment by the country as a whole in intellectual property. This is a serious matter and one which I believe the next parliament will give far more attention to under different leadership.",REPS,<title>TRADE MARKS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,70,1,speech
"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—The Trade Marks and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 amends the Trade Marks Act 1995 to give effect to the recommendations that came out of the review of the act that was conducted in 1996. The amendments are of a minor and technical nature, as has been said before, and they take heed of some of the suggestions in the review. The bill seeks to provide a better service to businesses in Australia that seek trademark registration through the Trade Marks Office.
Since its inception, the new trademark system has been very successful in reducing the amount of red tape for businesses, as well as making the process cheaper. The bill assists employees of the Trade Marks Office by removing section 158 of the act, which currently makes it a strict liability criminal offence for a Trade Marks Office staff member to prepare, or help to prepare, a document to be filed under the act or to search the office records. This may, in some cases, cause doubt as to whether an employee can help a person to fill in their application form for a trademark. The bill will help staff to provide a better service to clients. The bill also contains a series of minor amendments that will help to streamline procedures and remove several ambiguities that have been identified since the new act came into fruition. 
The modernisation of the trademark system in Australia began with the implementation of the Trade Marks Act 1995. This legislation will further enhance Australia's ability to participate in the international trademark system. Some criticism has been made of the amount of time it can take when applying for a trademark registration. After reading some of the cases that must be determined after an objection to the registration of a certain trademark, I can understand why the process can become so drawn out. However, the Trade Marks Office has implemented significant changes to its procedures and has also increased its staffing. These measures have helped to reduce quite significantly the processing time from around 11 months in February last year to around six months currently, and it is projected to reduce to two months by the end of this year.
A trademark can be a word, letter, number, phrase, sound, smell, shape, picture, logo, an aspect of packaging, or any number of a combination of these. It is used to help consumers to distinguish the goods or services of one trade from another, and helps to protect, under law, intellectual property. Once a trademark has been registered, the owner has the legal right to exclusive use or control of the use of that product or service within Australia. It is different from copyright, as copyright automatically gives you the rights to the protection of an original work. It protects the original expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. Copyright, however, does not protect against independent creation of a similar work. Copyright is the only type of intellectual property, other than circuit layout rights relating to electronic circuits, that provides an automatic protection. All other forms of IP, including trademarks, patents, trade secrets, et cetera, require formal steps to obtain legal right of ownership. Businesses also have to apply separately if they are seeking international protection, as trademarks obtained through the Trade Marks Office apply only within Australia. 
Opposition to the registration of a particular trademark usually arises out of concern that that trademark would cause confusion amongst consumers. The definition used to determine this is that they are deceptively similar or substantially identical. Often, a business trademark can be its lifeblood in terms of consumer recognition of that business product and reputation. The trademark system is there to protect this asset. A trademark registration can be opposed by another party if it is thought to impede their own trademark protected goods or services. Both parties then give evidence in order for the Registrar of Trade Marks to make a decision as to whether or not the opposition is valid.
An example of a case recently handed down—and I use this one because of my own interest in the wine industry—was that of a winery in Western Australia attempting to register the trademark `Lefroy Valley Vineyards'. An objection was raised to this trademark registration by a winery based in the Burgundy region in France known as Domain Leroy—wine that is distributed in Australia amongst connoisseurs of fine wines, as it is considerably more expensive than most Australian wines. 
The French winery argued that the two names, Lefroy Valley and Leroy, would cause confusion amongst consumers as they were both names of wines. The Leroy Winery was established in 1868 as Maison Leroy and has been in the Leroy family ever since. It has exported to Australia since 1966. Several wine merchants in Australia testified to the fact that Leroy wine label enjoyed a considerable reputation in Australia amongst lovers of fine wines. The owners of the Lefroy Valley vineyards, on the other hand, have been trading in Western Australia in agricultural products for around 30 years. Lefroy Valley, also a family business, decided to expand their interests into winemaking—a good choice. There is a Lefroy Brook near Manjimup, where the family is based, but geographically there is not such a name as Lefroy Valley. 
The registrar of trademarks found that the Lefroy Valley did not breach the French wineries trademark rights as, for a start, the name Lefroy is always associated with valley and, therefore, could not be confused with Leroy as they are not that similar. The registrar found that the Lefroy Valley refers to an actual geographic feature that is not likely to be confused with Leroy, which is more likely to be associated with a surname. It was also concluded that the French wine is purchased only in limited amounts in Australia by wine experts, who are a quite discerning and sophisticated group as buyers, and they would know their product. There was not much of a chance that they would be confused by the two. The general public in Australia also do not have much of a chance of being confused between the two trademarks as they are not ever likely to come across or have the desire or opportunity to buy the French wine Domain Leroy. Added to that, it was concluded that, as the wine market is quite crowded, it was also a market where the public is used to choosing from a very large range of labels.
Lefroy Valley was granted a trademark for their name and it was considered unlikely that the two wineries would be confused. This is a good example where the Trade Marks Office considered the evidence and made a commonsense decision on brand differentiation on the Australian label. On the flip side, there was a recent case when an Australian salad manufacturer tried to register the trademark of McSalad and was unsuccessful. I do not think I need to tell my colleagues who objected to the registration of this trademark. Of course, it was McDonald's. They argued successfully that, given the wide public recognition of the McDonald's name and its varying products—McChicken, McMuffin et cetera—there was a real probability that consumers would associate a McSalad with McDonald's and this would cause enough product confusion to warrant the unsuccessful trademark registration.
At this point I would like to cover some future issues relating to trademarks. Last year the government amended the Trade Marks Act to enable Australia to accede to the protocol related to the Madrid Agreement concerning International Registration of Marks, called the Madrid protocol. Accession to the Madrid protocol will take effect next month on 11 July and will provide a reciprocal streamlined application procedure for trademark registration in Australia and overseas. When the protocol takes effect, Australian trademark owners will only need to file a single application in English and pay only one fee to seek protection for their trademarks in all or any of the other 50 countries that are currently parties to the treaty. It is expected that application costs alone could be reduced between 40 per cent and 50 per cent. Many of Australia's key trading partners have joined the protocol, including Japan, the United Kingdom, European Union countries, Singapore and China. The United States and the Republic of Korea are currently making progress towards accession.
The Internet has dramatically changed the way many Australian companies do business, domestically and internationally. While the Internet and e-commerce offer Australian business tremendous opportunities, there are pitfalls. An Australian swimwear company, Absolut Beach, was recently challenged in courts in the UK and USA by the European company Absolut Vin and Sprit for breach of trademark. While Absolut Beach was a valid and established trademark in Australia, they had no trademark protection in Europe or America.
This matter has revealed the problem with international trademark protection in relation to the Internet. It is a problem that not only Australia has to confront and deal with but also all countries have to confront and deal with. The Hon. Warren Entsch has asked the government Advisory Council on Intellectual Property, ACIP, to investigate the problem and make recommendations on how best to respond to it. The question of trademark treatment of international icons is also a challenging one. For example, the government took steps to protect the Bradman name following the passing of Sir Donald Bradman. However, other organisations have suggested that national icons ought not be locked away but rather made available for everyone to use. ACIP has been asked to consider the treatment of national icons in Australia and whether it is appropriate and practical for the government to make legislative changes to protect our icons from commercial exploitation. 
We still face the challenge presented because business names issued by states can be overridden by trademarks which are national, and domain names on the international web can override national trademarks. We also face the problems of cybersquatting and issues of national icons being used as trademarks. In recommending this bill to the House I also recommend any moves to cut red tape and encourage business to grow in Australia. I support these measures, which I am sure will help IP Australia continue its good work.",REPS,<title>TRADE MARKS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,70,1,speech
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2001-06-28,"—In summing up the second reading debate on the Trade Marks and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 I thank those members who contributed to it. In particular, I thank the member for Moore for his invaluable contribution to the debate on this bill and for his very strong interest in issues associated with intellectual property in general. 
Doing business over the Internet has significant implications for the owners of registered trademarks in Australia because of the possibility of inadvertent infringement on trademarks registered in other countries. It is all good and well to have trademark protection in Australia, but companies seeking to do business with the rest of the world, particularly in light of the growth and importance of electronic commerce—or e-commerce—must be mindful of the need for wider international trademark protection and of the danger of infringing upon other trademark holders' rights. These issues were certainly highlighted by the member for Moore. The registration of a trademark has effect only in the country or territory in which it is registered. Once a trademark is used on the Internet it may be found to infringe a registered trademark in another country where the Internet is accessed and the goods or services are offered for sale. 
The member for Moore also referred to the Madrid protocol, which he rightfully points out will make it considerably easier and cheaper for Australian businesses to register their trademarks in some 51 countries throughout the world, including many of Australia's most important trading partners. While the government's decision to accede to the Madrid protocol was not directly linked to our concerns about trademark infringements associated with the Internet, we certainly hope that a further benefit will be to help Australian companies avoid potential problems by making it quicker, cheaper and easier for businesses to register their trademarks internationally.
I understand that Australia, through the National Office for the Information Economy, NOIE, and IP Australia, will take a proposal on how countries can deal, in the short term, with this emerging problem to the World Intellectual Property Organisation later this year. Such a solution could include businesses putting a disclaimer on their web site stating that the goods and services are not offered for sale in the country where there may be an infringement or, alternatively, that the goods and services are only offered for sale in countries where the business has appropriate trademark protection. While this may prove to be a workable short-term solution, given the growth and the opportunities that e-commerce affords, I believe the international community needs to come up with a more concrete, long-term solution for this problem.
Debate interrupted; adjournment negatived.
—I have asked the government's Advisory Council on Intellectual Property to start looking at this problem more carefully to see what further solutions we can come up with. ACIP is doing some very interesting and exciting work at the moment across a range of issues and, later this year, I look forward to receiving its feedback and advice on the trademark problems associated with doing business on the Internet. 
I also thank the member for Bonython, who spoke about the importance for the prosperity of Australia of capturing the benefits of Australian ingenuity and creativity through a strong intellectual property system in this country. I note the member for Bonython's statement regarding the government's commitment to R&D and innovation. In January this year, the government launched the $2.9 billion Backing Australia's Ability program, which already demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that innovation is the key to Australia's future prosperity. Backing Australia's Ability contributes substantial additional funds to the significant funding that the government already provides for science research and innovation. The Backing Australia's Ability initiative will build on the government's current commitment to innovation, which has already seen an increase in spending in 2000-01 to $4.5 billion.
This government is committed to helping Australian businesses maximise their competitive advantage. This bill will help in that process by further streamlining the procedures for gaining trademark registration. Trademarks are an essential element of any successful business strategy. They signify to the public the origin of the goods or services on which the trademark appears. This helps the public recognise the goods and services they trust and, in turn, establishes and increases the reputation of the businesses using the trademark. A successful trademark can be invaluable to the success of a product or service.
The opposition support for the bill recognises that a bipartisan approach to meeting the needs of Australian businesses will help those businesses respond and adapt to the challenges of operating in today's very competitive environment where the strategic use of intellectual property is essential for success. By improving the trademarks registration system, this bill will assist businesses to use trademarks to increase their competitiveness.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2001-06-28,"—There has been a lot of discussion in the past week and, indeed, over many years about the problems of sexual and domestic violence in Aboriginal communities. Sometimes these problems seem overwhelming to the people who are outside the community and wish to make some positive contribution to the community. I want to address my brief remarks today to some of the positive things that Aboriginal women have told me they need from government to begin to address these problems in their communities.
The first and most important point is that programs that are designed for Aboriginal communities need to be based on local consultation and have local involvement in the management of the services. It is no good for people to come in from outside and think that they can solve problems that have existed in communities for a long time. Many good programs have been established under the Partnerships for Domestic Violence program. I give credit to the government for funding that program. However, that funding is annual or triennial funding, and that is an enormous problem in Aboriginal communities. This sort of funding should be based over 10 or 15 years in order to begin to make a real difference in these communities.
I noticed on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald today an article about a program in Far North Queensland where $553,000 has been spent over the last few years, yet this program is about to end. The coordinator of the program says that they have only touched the surface. The article states: 
 “Black eyes, busted lips, broken arms—they're run of the mill. Then there are the stabbings and murder,” says Ms Naden. “I'm leaving women out there who need a lot of work and a lot of encouragement. I feel like I'm leaving them in the lurch.”
And indeed she is, and this is the problem with programs that only go for a year, or three years in this case. There is a real problem as well with a lack of funding for legal aid in relation to family law. A lot of women are agreeing to consent orders in relation to access to children, when really they should not. They have been victims of violence, they drop children off to their former partners and they are victimised all over again. This happens because they have agreed to consent orders, because there is no funding for legal aid in these issues.
There needs to be increased funding for Aboriginal women's legal services around the country. I was very distressed today to read that funding for the Western Australian women's legal service is under threat at the moment. The funding that the Commonwealth government gives for the Aboriginal women's legal service, for the whole of the New South Wales and the ACT, is approximately equal to the funding that the Walgett Violence Prevention Service gets for Walgett alone. So you can see how dramatically short of funds the Aboriginal women's legal service is.
There is a real problem with the Aboriginal Legal Service's unwillingness to fund cases that deal with women, particularly relating to family law or violence. They will not generally represent an Aboriginal person against another Aboriginal person. They mainly deal with criminal law, which is 95 per cent of their work. Therefore 80 per cent of their clients, naturally, are men.
Another issue that I mention is the violence prevention services that have been established. There are now 14 across the country that are run under the auspices of ATSIC. Fourteen is a great start but there need to be very many more. I think there has been discussion about having a violence prevention service in every Aboriginal community across the country. There is a major lack in metropolitan Sydney, which has an enormous population of Aboriginal people but which has no violence prevention service.
It is vital that funding that is provided to establish services for women actually goes to women. There has been a debate over very many years about the efficacy of funding perpetrator programs. It is of great concern to me that the national partnerships for violence money has gone largely in some states to funding perpetrator programs. This money generally does not help women, and the perpetrator programs are of questionable benefit. Very few of them actually have long-term, positive outcomes. The ones that I have heard about that are of most concern are in Victoria, where the guidelines under which they are established are non-existent. Many of the staff are untrained, and outcomes from those programs have therefore got to be questionable. That money should instead be spent on proper services for women and, in particular, for Aboriginal women. 
Another problem is that Aboriginal community liaison officers that are employed by police are mostly men, so women who are experiencing family violence or sexual assault are often very unwilling to approach them.
