Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (12:32):  Yesterday the government was trying to assert that the opposition's concerns on this matter, my personal concerns on this matter, were about fighting old battles. I think it is important to state for the record that the minister of course has completely misread this situation. This is not about fighting old battles. It is an argument about what sort of country we want this to be. Unlike my colleagues on the other side of the chamber, Labor recognises that investments in innovation are critical to the future prosperity of this nation. In advanced industrial economies, innovation is the chief driver of increases in productivity. It makes firms more competitive and it sustains high-skilled, high-wage jobs.


According to the Australian innovation system report, innovation almost doubles the likelihood of productivity growth in Australian businesses. Firms that innovate are 78 per cent more likely to report increases in productivity over the previous year, and firms that collaborate with research organisations are almost 2½ times more likely to report increases in productivity. Without a strong innovation system, Australia will not be able to build a diverse economy.


The perfidy of this government absolutely astounds me. As the minister is well aware, the amendments before the chamber in the name of the Palmer United Party were actually drafted by the government. They have been undertaken without consultation. According to Treasury officials who appeared before the Economics Legislation Committee, there has been no modelling undertaken to support them. There has been no consideration of the impact on future R&D investment and no concern for R&D intensive firms that have hired R&D workers and sought approval for R&D activities in future years on the basis of the current legislation. So this is not about fighting old battles; it is about fighting for what sort of country we want this to be.


What we do know is that it is the largest firms that undertake the most extensive R&D in this country and that the government's assault upon those firms will do untold damage to our R&D effort. We saw this pattern in previous times. We saw it in 1996, when the incoming Liberal government accepted carte blanche the advice of Treasury and cut the R&D incentives. The consequences were felt for years. 


We know particularly that manufacturing businesses will be affected, at a time when they need all the help they can get. I find it extraordinary that the minister yesterday, at the last minute, suggested to us that there was modelling undertaken, despite what we were told at the Economics Legislation Committee. I would suggest that 30 years of data demonstrates that the incentive for R&D supports growth and jobs. R&D cuts in 1996 impaired R&D spending for at least five years. The statistics show that R&D spending dropped by nine per cent from 1996 through to 2000. Jobs associated with R&D fell throughout this period, particularly in manufacturing and mining. That is what the official reports told us.


So, Minister, now that you say there has actually been modelling undertaken, contrary to the advice tendered previously, I would like to ask you specifically: how many firms will be affected by the government's—not PUP members'—new measures? I would particularly like to know the number of firms affected, not the number of consolidated groups. Can you provide that advice?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-02-10,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (12:37):  Contrary to what Senator Carr is trying to suggest, he is fighting old battles. He continues to run his vendetta against former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and former Treasurer Wayne Swan. Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and former Treasurer Wayne Swan decided that it was not appropriate for businesses making more than $20 billion in profits a year to get a 133 per cent tax deduction. They thought it would be appropriate for companies in those circumstances to only get a 100 per cent tax deduction for their research and development expenditure.


We have had a lot of rhetoric from Labor in recent times on how we ought to ensure that larger businesses, multinational businesses, pay their fair share of tax, and here we have Senator Carr fighting for a 133 per cent tax deduction for businesses earning more than $20 billion a year, instead of a 100 per cent tax deduction. We do not think that is fair. We do not think that is appropriate. We understand that former Prime Minister Gillard and former Treasurer Wayne Swan shared that view. They actually reflected that view in their last budget. In the 2013-14 budget, that was what they initiated and what they banked by way of savings in the budget. 


We have not been able to get the support of Labor for their own savings measure. Senator Carr personally rolled Mr Shorten, who was too weak to stand up to Senator Carr and who was too weak to do the right thing in the national interest—which was what former Prime Minister Gillard and former Treasurer Wayne Swan were prepared to do in relation to this matter. That is why the Labor Party are taking the reckless and irresponsible position they are taking here in this chamber today. 


That is also why we have engaged constructively, positively and in good faith with crossbench senators who, like us, want to ensure that tax incentives for research and development are better targeted. That is why we have worked with the Palmer United Party and other crossbench senators to come up with a structure that ensures that the adjustment is fair between those businesses that predominantly generate their profits in Australia and those businesses that perhaps predominantly generate their profits in other parts of the world.


Senator Carr has asked how many businesses will be impacted. The answer is less than 25—less than 25 of the largest businesses operating here in Australia.


What we are actually dealing with—I know the shadow minister went back to some issues that we traversed at length yesterday—are the amendment before the chair, which is Senator Carr's amendment, where he seeks to substitute 1 July 2014 in the Palmer United Party amendment with 1 July 2016. We have to remember that, when Labor initiated and banked this savings measure in the budget, the starting date was 1 July 2013. By the time we went to the election in September 2013, Labor had failed to legislate their own savings which they initiated and banked in their budget. We are now here doing Labor's work for them, with Labor opposing us all the way and playing politics. This amendment is an implicit recognition that what we are trying to do is right, because clearly Senator Carr is working on the basis that this legislation will go through. He just wants to delay the start date by another two years. We have said in good faith, given the delays, that 1 July 2013 is no longer appropriate but 1 July 2014 is because, of course, we are in the 2014-15 financial year.


So the government will oppose the amendment circulated by Senator Carr. We will support the two amendments circulated by Senator Wang on behalf of the Palmer United Party, and we would urge all senators to do the same.

And here we have the Greens and Senator Milne fighting for bigger tax breaks for the big resources companies, the big banks and big oil and gas. That is what the Greens are doing. We have Senator Milne out there fighting for a tax refund for big oil. That is the Greens in 2014—quite extraordinary, really, and quite unbelievable. The hypocrisy is breathtaking. But the point here is that it is a matter for individual businesses how they structure their corporate affairs. That is not a matter for the government.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-02-10,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (12:43):  Less than 25? Okay. Then, of course, you say that you cannot tell how many consolidated groups would be affected. I put it to you, for instance, that Wesfarmers would be one business; it is made up of a number of firms. There are many manufacturing businesses associated with the consolidated group around Wesfarmers. Is that part of the 25? There are a number of others. Rio Tinto has a whole series of firms associated with it. Is that part of the 25 or is that one firm? 


You see, that is the point here. We would like to know precisely how your amendment will work. We want to know the number of firms and, of course, from that we will be able to tell how many employees this involves and the firms' investment in R&D, to make some judgement as to whether or not the Treasury advice that you are relying upon is a reasonable basis on which we should make a judgement.


I say to you, Minister: while you are on the topic, you can perhaps tell me: in the last 20 years, pick one year in which the Treasury advice on expenditure on R&D has actually been correct and accurate. Just pick one year and tell me which year that is—because this is the basis on which you are now asking us to make a judgement. You say it is fewer than 25 firms, yet you cannot tell us who they are. Naturally enough, you will tell me, 'Oh, it's confidential.' I put to you that the sorts of companies we are talking about—BHP Billiton, Wesfarmers, Woolworths, Rio Tinto, National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac, Telstra, AustralianSuper, Caltex, BP, Shell, Xstrata and QBE—are firms that undertake major investments in R&D in this country. There are considerably more than 25 firms tied up in that list that I have read to you.


So, Minister, how many firms is it really? Are we talking about firms or consolidated groups? What is the level of investment that those firms would claim for collectively?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-02-10,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (12:46):  Senator Carr is just throwing around red herrings. Senator Carr knows very well that it is absolutely a standard procedure, that it is absolutely the consistent application of relevant methodology, for consolidated groups to be the basis on which to claim the refundable tax offset.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Oh, so we are talking about consolidated groups?




Senator CORMANN:
  Of course we are. That is actually not a big revelation; that is actually what matters. It is absolutely consistent—it is absolutely standard procedure to assess these things at the level of consolidated groups. Otherwise, if you do not, you actually facilitate and encourage all sorts of manoeuvring to avoid relevant tax and other obligations, which I am sure Senator Carr would not want to be party to encouraging.


If Senator Carr does not like the methodology put forward by the Palmer United Party, which the government has agreed with, it is free to him to say that he would prefer to go down the path of the original Gillard-Swan Labor government measure. If Senator Carr is saying, 'Actually, I'm really worried about this alternative way of doing it,' the objective of which is to ensure that, whether you are a business operating out of Australia that generates most of its profits in Australia or whether you are a business operating in Australia which generates large parts of its profits in other parts of the world, you are going to be treated the same, that is the effect of using a cap instead of the assessable income methodology. If you say you prefer to go back to the assessable income methodology, tell us now and we will pass the legislation based on the way that Labor initiated it and banked it in their last budget.


But I suspect that that is actually just another red herring, because you have rolled your leader, Mr Shorten. You have rolled him, where Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan were strong enough to stand up to you in the national interest. You are just here, joined with Senator Milne, trying to keep up a special interest for rent seekers that are particularly profitable.




Senator Kim Carr:
  BHP are rent seekers, are they? BHP are now rent seekers?



The CHAIRMAN:  Order!




Senator CORMANN:
  You are here protecting a special interest for companies generating more than $20 billion in assessable income. That is what you are doing, and you are doing it as part of your ongoing political battle inside the Labor Party against Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan—and everybody knows it.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:49):  I think we have just seen from the minister the kind of performance that is the reason that the Australian community is so fed up with the Abbott government. Minister, you can stand in here and go on with your ill-considered ideological rhetoric and what you think are effective pre-formulated attacks on Labor and the Greens, but you are not answering the questions and this Senate is absolutely being treated with contempt. To stand there and say that these are the PUP amendments is a joke. The senator who moved this amendment is not even in the chamber, because he cannot explain it; he has no idea whatsoever what he is putting to the Senate. Why? Because you wrote it for him—Treasury wrote it for him; you gave it to him; you gave it to the Palmer United Party. They stood up and moved it; they could not answer a single question on it. If you stood Senator Wang in here, he would not be able to answer a single question about which companies he is excluding or why he is taking $1 billion out. If he can, he should be in here.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  On a point of order, Mr Chairman, the rules are clear in terms of casting aspersions upon other members in this place. I do not think you could make a graver allegation against another member in this place than the one that has been presented by the senator.



The CHAIRMAN:  I do not think there is a point of order, Senator O'Sullivan.




Senator MILNE:
  I would challenge Senator Wang to come in here and explain his amendment and defend it, instead of leaving it to the minister, who wrote it and who gave it to him, to now be explaining it.


I want to come back to the essential thing here, and that is that the Greens never supported the change. One of the reasons they did not legislate it is that we would not have supported it—and we do not. I do not want to see $1.1 billion taken out of supporting research and development in this country. Let me put that firmly on the record. We want to see more targeted research and development, but we do not want to see you ripping $1 billion out of research and development in this country, and that is precisely what Senator Cormann, the minister, stands for. Ripping up money going into the CSIRO, taking money out of our universities, taking money out of research and development and handing it back as fossil fuel subsidies—that is what we have from the government.


Everybody knows, if you are going to get away from being an economy which is 'dig it up, cut it down and ship it away', you have to invest in education and research and development. You have to make sure that that happens. That is what the Greens want to see, and that is why I moved last night to make sure that small businesses, those drivers of real innovation, of cutting edge innovation, can benefit in the way that they sought to—and the government just showed absolute contempt for that. And what we are seeing from you, Minister, is very much the vandals coming over the wall—but this time they are coming over the wall with cigars in their mouths and in sedan chairs. And that is what the community does not like. They are sick of it, and they want to see some equity.


I would like to get back to a serious question—Senator Carr asked it, and I am asking it now: who are these 25 companies that are going to be affected? Is Telstra one of them? I want to read you what Telstra had to say. They said:


As a proud Australian company and one with an increasing global footprint, the R&D tax incentive has been one of the reasons behind Telstra's commitment to undertake the majority of our R&D work onshore.


R&D investment, according to the submissions to the committee—not Telstra submissions but general submissions to the committee—highlighted that not only will R&D investment go offshore, hurting our economy; it will mean that estimated savings will not actually materialise because of the impact on longer term growth to the economy. The focus on removing incentives for larger companies makes this very likely because they are most able to offshore research. That is the first thing. So if you take this money out of here, you will see the research, the innovation, the intellectual property develop offshore. That is the last thing you want if you are transitioning your economy. Secondly, smaller and medium enterprises and public institutions such as CSIRO and universities will be hurt by the changes because of the flow-on impact—as I said in my second reading speech. The University of New South Wales, for example, gave evidence at the inquiry that 30 per cent of its research effort is backed by companies directly affected by this bill.


So let's hear from the minister what the difference is between what the government put up and what, supposedly, Senator Wang put up. He said last night that there were marginal differences in the number of companies and only marginal differences in the amount they are expected to receive. Well, let's hear it. I want to know exactly the differences. Which companies will now be captured that were not captured before and vice versa? I want to know exactly about the money. You have supposedly done the modelling, so let's hear it. Give us some specifics instead of just standing there pontificating and protecting people who cannot even be interested enough to turn up to the debate in the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-02-10,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (12:55):  I confirm again that Australia's largest and most profitable businesses are large and profitable and do large research and development. Our advice and the advice that was available to the previous government is that they are not as sensitive to tax incentives, tax subsidies, as small and medium sized firms. That is why the previous Gillard Labor government made a judgement to better target the tax incentives for research and development. And that is because small and medium sized firms are more responsive to incentives—that is what the OECD has found. Again, that is the policy intent and rationale for this Labor Party savings measure.


With this legislation, which was 100 per cent consistent with Labor's original measure, the methodology used was to essentially make the adjustment where the special tax incentive was no longer available for businesses that generated more than $20 billion in assessable income a year. The issue raised with us by the Palmer United Party is this: an Australian company that generates more than $20 billion of its assessable income in Australia will lose this additional incentive whereas a company that generates $5 billion or $10 billion in assessable income in Australia but $20 billion, $30 billion or $40 billion in income which is not part of the Australian tax jurisdiction is not impacted in the same way. That is why they have said to us it would be fairer, from their point of view, if we used a different methodology to achieve essentially the same outcome, and that is to use a cap up until which the higher tax incentive is available and above which the higher tax incentive is no longer available. So, up to $100 million in benefit from the taxpayer to a particular business, the tax deduction available is 133 person. Above $100 million in benefit from the taxpayer, the tax deduction falls back to 100 per cent—not nothing, not zero, just 100 per cent instead of 133 per cent. That was not our initial approach, but that is the approach which we believe has the support of the Senate. It achieves a similar outcome.


And now Senator Milne and Senator Carr have invited me to give them an exhaustive list of the companies that are likely to be impacted by this. Of course, they know that there are confidentiality provisions that prevent me from doing so and it depends on the tax affairs of particular companies in a particular year. It is obviously very hard to make a conclusive judgement in relation to this because it does depend on what happens on a whole range of fronts. Having said that, Treasury has costed this measure, it has costed this amendment, it has modelled the impact of this amendment; and the advice that we have got is that fewer than 25 businesses in Australia are likely to be affected, that this will broadly achieve the same saving and that, broadly speaking, the businesses impacted are likely to be in the same category. So that is the advice, that is what I put openly and transparently to the Senate, and it is up to the Senate to make its judgement.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-02-10,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:59):  So we are told that it broadly achieves the same, that broadly the companies are in the same category. But essentially we get the same outcome. So, broadly, you would say that Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott are in the same category. Broadly, you would say we will get essentially the same outcomes. The community have a view that 'broadly' and 'essentially' are not the same thing. So I would like to know: what is the difference? That is what we are asking here.


One piece of legislation went to a committee. It was a farce, but it went to the committee at least. Now we have amendments which have not gone to committee, which nobody knows, and the person who is putting forward the amendments has not turned up in the chamber, has not made a speech on them and does not know anything about them. We are asked to be assessing because the minister says they are broadly the same, with essentially the same outcome and approximately the same set of companies. We have not had the opportunity to test what the real difference is between what the government has proposed and what Senator Wong, who has not even turned up here, is proposing.


I do not think the community is going to buy it. In the parliament you need more than 'broadly', and 'Essentially, it is the same,' and, 'It is similar,' and, 'Just take it from me; take my word for it.' It has not gone to the committee. If you are not prepared to tell us what 'essentially the same', 'broadly speaking', 'broadly achieves the same', and 'broadly the same categories' mean, then you are asking people to buy a pig in a poke. And we are not going to do that.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:02):  This is a pattern of behaviour that the government has adopted—as I said, very much the cigar smoking in the sedan chair with complete contempt for the Senate. The fact is that government has done this on a number of occasions, and I am just going to point it out for all and sundry, and that is: to just sit there and refuse to answer the questions, to leave the people answering the questions to ask in consecutive order because nobody else is here to support them, and then to use the chair—not in your case, Mr Deputy President, but in other cases—to call the order in terms of how many questions are asked without an intervention and get a vote on the issue. This is contempt of the Senate. We want answers to the questions. It is surely not too hard for the minister to actually answer the questions. I have asked him: what is the difference between what he is proposing and what Senator Wong is proposing, because what Senator Wong is proposing, via the minister, has not been to a Senate committee. There has been no opportunity, other than this stage in the committee, to have that, and so I am going to ask specifically: is Telstra one of the companies that would have been captured by both, and, having assumed that it is, will the minister say why a company like Telstra would now not take their R&D offshore and therefore undermine the research capacity of places like the University of New South Wales and other universities around the country? Why won't that occur? Secondly, did the minister consult with AusBiotech or any other of the umbrella groups for small research and development companies about quarterly payments, or did he just arrogantly decide to dismiss it on the basis of intuition?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:04):  What is going on now, I will just place on record, is a desperate attempt at a joint filibuster by the Labor-Greens coalition. And Senator Milne just misled the Senate. She just indicated to the Senate that the Palmer United Party amendment never went to the Senate committee. Well, it actually did go to the Senate committee. When we circulated the amendments towards the end of last year, Senator Xenophon asked me to facilitate a briefing by Treasury and relevant others to all interested members of the Senate economics committee. It was a very productive and constructive meeting. The government absolutely acted in good faith. Our preferred approach was to go down the path that Labor initiated and banked in their last budget. But because Labor under Bill Shorten's leadership is too weak to stand up for the national interest and too weak to do what needs to be done to repair the budget and strengthen the economy, we are in the situation where we have no choice but to negotiate with the crossbench.


I have answered these questions many times before, and if you go over Hansard you will see that I have. You asked me again: what is difference between what the government is proposing and what the Palmer United party amendment is proposing to achieve? The policy intent behind both approaches is to ensure that special tax incentives for research and development are properly targeted—that they do not go to the biggest, most profitable businesses but are appropriately targeted to small and medium-sized businesses where the research, including through the OECD, consistently shows that those incentives actually make a difference. The approach that we put forward in our legislation was for any business with an assessable income—relevant profits above $20 billion—to be excluded from the 133 per cent tax deduction and to only be eligible for 100 per cent tax deduction for their expenditure on research and development.


As to the issue that was raised—and, again, we have gone round and round in circles in relation to this, and I have been very clear in relation to this—the Palmer United Party said to us: 'What we worry about is that that means that, if you generate most of your profits in Australia, you are slightly disadvantaged compared to a business that generates some profits in Australia but most of their profits in other parts of the world.' They asked us to consider whether we could achieve the same policy intent using a different methodology, and that is by putting a cap on the special benefit that is available to larger businesses for their research and development expenditure. The cap that is on the table is a $100 million cap, and the advice from Treasury is that that means that we will generate broadly the same savings, and that broadly the same businesses, the same companies, will be impacted.


Senator Carr is trying to confuse people and run red herrings about firms and consolidated groups. The truth is that these things are always, consistently, as a matter of standard operating procedure, assessed at the level of consolidated groups. That is the way this works. No amount of red herrings is going to distract from the fact that this is a very personal agenda that Senator Carr continues to run against the former Prime Minister and the former Treasurer. I am not interested in getting in the middle of Labor Party factional infighting. I am totally not interested in that. I am interested in doing the right thing in the national interest. All I am interested in is progressing a budget measure that was initiated and banked by Labor in their last budget. We are doing Labor's hard yards for them, even though Labor has turned against themselves on this.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (13:08):  The statements that the Minister for Finance has made are quite erroneous in a number of ways. The specific inquiry that Senator Milne and I are seeking to prosecute with you is the detail of the modelling that you claim has been undertaken. It is true that I do have some interest in this topic. I have been pursuing these questions for the better part of 20 years while a member of this parliament. That is why I can say with certainty that Treasury has never ever, not once, got it right when it comes to their projections on R&D expenditure—not once in 20 years.




Senator Cormann:
  Projections are projections.




Senator KIM CARR:
  Projections are certainly projections, and now the minister is saying to us that he has relied upon these experts, who have never once got it right in 20 years, to now tell us that you have done this modelling which will produce a particular result. He cannot even tell us the number of firms that are directly affected, and he says, in the broadest of terms, it might have the same impact as our original intention. He further goes on to say that it is exactly the same as what the Labor Party wanted to do. Of course that is not true and the minister knows that is not true. The Labor Party was developing a jobs package—over $1 billion worth of expenditure, investing in jobs in this country, which those opposite have scrapped. That is a point that the minister chooses to ignore.


I come back to the central proposition: Minister, will you table the modelling. While you are there, there is this other subsidiary argument that Treasury have been running for some years. As the minister says, I have some interest in this matter. When I was minister they did run this same modelling. It is not the argument you will find, of course, in other parts of the government—when you talk to the Department of Industry you will get an entirely different perspective. People who actually have to deal with enterprises and understand the importance of incentives in developing our industrial capabilities in Australia will take an entirely different view. The government maintains that large firms will invest in R&D regardless of whether or not they can access R&D incentives, but this is a well-furrowed field. The argument is flawed. There is evidence that smaller firms are more responsive to R&D tax incentives, but that does not equate with the alternative proposition that large firms are unresponsive. There is also evidence to suggest that large firms are able to make more effective use of incentives. This is historic evidence that, Minister, if you had more understanding of this issue you might appreciate. The evidence demonstrates that large firms are influenced by R&D incentives and the removal of those incentives risks having them offshore their R&D activities. That is what this government is really good at. One of their great achievements is exporting jobs, and this is another example of it. This is about how you export jobs. This is a government that takes the view that it does not matter what investment attractions you offer because the firms by divine right will come here. We know that is not the case. 


International studies have demonstrated that firm size and R&D incentives are directly linked. R&D credits are effective in increasing R&D investments especially in large firms. Kroger in 2003, for instance, says that R&D tax credits are a great stimulus for R&D investment in large firms as compared to medium-sized firms. That is the point that has been made throughout the OECD literature. The Australian ABS highlights this—it demonstrates a clear link between changes in R&D incentives and regimes and large business investment in R&D. The historic evidence here is very clear, because the same sort of Treasury dogma was accepted in 1996 when there was a previous Liberal government. The concession was reduced from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. As a consequence, R&D investment fell by 9.6 per cent—for large firms much more dramatically than for small firms. It was particularly important in the finance and insurance sectors. In 2001 the premium tax concession was introduced, encouraging increases in R&D investment. That was under a conservative government. Inevitably what will happen is that there will be a swing within the coalition at some point towards understanding that you have to correct the error of your ways on this issue. 


That is the historic pattern. Between 2000 and 2002, large firms increased R&D investment by 43 per cent—much more dramatically than small firms increased their investment. R&D investment by large firms is particularly important in the finance services sector. Studies undertaken in other countries argue the same point. The Australian Innovation System Reports have highlighted this. They say that this is an initiative we took to ensure that this sort of data was collected. That is not something you will see from the Treasury, but it was material that we did see through the department of innovation. That showed that:


SMEs are lean innovators, accounting for a very small share of total investment in innovation, and are much less likely to generate new-to-the-world innovations. By contrast, large Australian businesses make up the majority of total investment in innovation, are much more likely to collaborate with the research sector and generate new-to-the-world innovations.


That is in the Department of Industry's Australian innovation system report 2013 that I have here. 


A survey conducted by the Australian government in 2005 found that large firms have the strongest focus on radical R&D, which involves costs with an order of magnitude higher than adapted off-the-shelf technologies when carrying out incremental R&D as typically undertaken by smaller enterprises. That information was found under your government, Minister. That was in The R&D Tax Concession—impact on the firm: report on a survey of 116 firmsdone in Canberra in October 2005.


The OECD 2011 International experience with tax incentives report looked at the effect of R&D incentives on the choice of location for R&D by multinational firms. Analysis of the data and R&D activities of multinational enterprises suggests that the growth rate of R&D by affiliates of multinational enterprises is higher in countries providing an R&D tax incentive than in those countries that do not offer such schemes. That again suggests that the decisions of multinational enterprises in conducting R&D in a particular country are correlated with the availability of tax incentives in that country and other potential destination countries. It is clear that when having two or more similar location alternatives, especially when such competition occurs within the region, government incentives tilt the investment decisions. The OECD 2011 report says that a study on US investments by US firms outside the US demonstrated that the R&D incentives were a driver to encourage investment outside the US.


Another report asks:


Are US tax incentives for corporate R&D likely to motivate American firms to perform research abroad?


The report results provided evidence that countries with tax based incentives for R&D and higher annual increases in R&D investments had more foreign affiliates of US firms than countries without such an investment.


When the changes to the R&D tax proposals were announced by this government, the French minister for innovation stated they had a competitive advantage and encouraged companies to invest in her country instead of Australia. She was directly pinching French firms and encouraging them to get their investment out of Australia and move it into France.


I am making the point to you, Minister, that you have misjudged this completely. This ideological obsession you have with reducing expenditure actually costs this country jobs. It costs opportunities. It undermines capabilities. You are expert at exporting jobs. You are exporting Australian jobs because of your obsessions and your dilettante behaviour in adopting the Treasury advice when all the evidence points to how wrong this approach is internationally and how the approach taken in this country where you are now seeking to repeat these mistakes will have to be changed again. I come back to the question: where is this modelling? When are you going to produce it?

I asked who the minister had consulted with before making a decision not to allow the quarterly payments that would so help small businesses. I would like to know who you consulted with apart from Treasury, who apparently on this occasion have opposed it.


Secondly, I would like to know what modelling or research you have done on the impact of taking $1.1 billion out of research and development in Australia on small and medium enterprises and public institutions that depend on the flow-on impacts from investment in research and development. As I indicated before, quite often these corporations put money in but do it in conjunction with research institutions and universities as well as other small businesses. It is a collaborative approach. What modelling have you down on the impact of taking $1.1 billion out of research and development? I want to know about the flow-on effects to universities in particular, to the CSIRO and to other smaller and medium enterprises. I would like to know if Telstra is one of those corporations that are involved.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:21):  It is interesting that Senator Milne is now interested in modelling the economic impact from changes in policy because there is a significant and demonstrable growth impact on the economy which is very good for all of the firms that the Senator Milne is concerned about from scrapping the carbon tax. Scrapping the carbon tax will help all of these firms be more profitable, create more jobs, employ more Australians and invest more in research and development.


You are trying to make it harder for businesses to be successful and then want to give them a subsidy from the taxpayer. You want to make it harder for businesses to be successful, grow their businesses, employ more people and help us grow the economy more strongly and then, after you have done that, after you have hindered businesses from growing more strongly, you want taxpayers, the mums and dads of Australia, the working families of Australia, to help fund a special 133 per cent tax deduction for businesses generating more than $20 billion in assessable income. That is what you are doing.


Senator Carr, in his lengthy contribution as part of the Labor-Green filibuster, tried to suggest that the reason they were opposing this is that it was all supposed to be about the jobs package; this was not supposed to help repair the budget. He has misled the Senate again. I am quoting here directly former Treasurer Mr Wayne Swan from a speech he gave to the Australian Business Economists Breakfast on 22 February 2013. The title of the speech, if you want to google it, Senator Carr, is 'Challenges and choices in a post-GFC world'. This is what he said, and I quote former Treasurer Mr Swan directly from when he was defending this measure which you are now opposing. Mr Shorten was too weak to force you to support it in the same way as Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd had forced you to support it. This is what Mr Swan said:


We said we would remove the R&D tax concession for large companies with a $20 billion Australian turnover or more, to ensure innovation spending is directed to where it will have the biggest benefit. This saving will also deliver benefits to the bottom line over and above funding the package – so it's a down payment on the repair that the budget needs.


So do not come in here with your confected outrage, attacking the coalition because we are doing the hard yards in progressing a budget measure which the Gillard Labor government, with Mr Swan as Treasurer, initiated, banked in their budget and failed to legislate. We understand what this is all about. You are running a factional war inside the Labor Party. You have told Mr Shorten that, unless he backs you on this, your personal vendetta, you would not be supporting him, and Mr Shorten rolled over. That is exactly what happened. In the past when I have said this, you had a big Cheshire-cat smile on your face because you felt quite proud of having been able to do that. Do you know what? That is the problem with the modern-day Labor Party under Mr Shorten. Mr Shorten does not have what it takes to put the national interest ahead of his political self-interests, trying to stay on top of the factional dynamics inside the Labor Party.


We cannot let the national interest get caught up in that. All we are doing is progressing a Labor Party budget measure, with a slight amendment in order to take into account some legitimate concerns that were raised, and facing up to the reality that Labor and the Greens are blocking everything and anything in the context of political self-interest.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-02-10,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:24):  I will try again. I asked a specific question: who did you consult with when you decided to oppose quarterly payments? Can I please have an answer to that question? If there was any consultation, with whom did you consult? That is a more than reasonable question, because you have just really destroyed the hopes and aspirations of a lot of small to medium sized businesses who have argued very strongly that they needed this in order to make the kind of investment in research and development that they want. I think that it is more than reasonable that you answer the question. The second question I asked relates to the modelling on what it will do to universities and to research institutions.


As to your ludicrous proposition that abandoning carbon pricing helps these businesses, it is actually the exact opposite. Every innovative business in the country is looking towards the capacity building and new research that it needs to transition to a low-carbon economy. That is what they are doing. They are out there in the renewable energy field, in the energy efficiency field, in the alternative building materials field, in public transport, in systems thinking for changing design—all manner of things, including in agriculture and in cool storage. In all manner of things, people are looking at the innovation that you need to build resilience in the system in a world that is warming. And you, by tearing down carbon pricing, by throwing back to the fossil fuel age, have destroyed and sent offshore a huge number of our researchers already.


At a solar forum in Sydney, a fifth-year solar engineer got up and said that there is no future for her this country under the Abbott government and that she will have to go overseas because of the attack on renewable energy. Go to any of those forums and you will find small businesspeople standing there saying that their growth sector is in medium-scale solar rollout and that is being undermined by the Abbott government. If you are serious about jobs, then you would be moving full-on to build resilience to global warming and bring down emissions, because that will unleash a whole wave of innovation and research across the country. What you are doing is forcing them offshore. Part of your forcing them offshore is now not only taking $1.1 billion out of research and development but also not allowing small and medium cutting-edge businesses the ability to manage their cash flow in a way that enables them to further invest in research and development.


I again put to you, Minister: firstly, who did you consult on not pursuing the quarterly payments and taking it seriously? And, secondly, what is your modelling or what assessment have you got to indicate what is going to be the impact on universities, on public institutions such as the CSIRO and on small and medium enterprises as a result of these changes?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:28): The first point I would make is that Senator Milne just does not take no from the Senate for an answer. She is still arguing the supposed merits of her amendment, which the Senate passed judgement on yesterday and rejected. We have in front of us an amendment put forward by Senator Carr that, instead of deferring the implementation starting date to 1 July 2014, in the Labor Party view it should be deferred to 1 July 2016. The whole argument and all of the issues that you have raised relate to an amendment which the Senate considered yesterday and has already rejected.


You ask whom we have consulted. I will tell you whom we have consulted. We consulted the Australian people in the lead-up to the last election. The policy that is in front of us was not only our policy but Labor Party policy in the lead-up to the last election. Do you know what?


That is the way democracy works here in Australia. And I know the Greens have trouble accepting democratic principle. I understand that the Greens would much rather be in charge, with their enlightened views that are so much better than anybody else's, and impose them on everybody else. But the way the system works here in Australia is that every three years we have an election, and every three years the Australian people make a judgement on who they want to be the government. And, as it happens, in the lead-up to the last election the Labor Party and the coalition both went to the election with a policy position, reflected in our costings, which suggested that we wanted tax incentives for research and development to be better targeted and not to go to those businesses generating more than $20 billion a year in assessable income.


Now, we have been going around and around in circles in relation to this. The Labor Party and the Greens, led by Senators Carr and Milne, clearly are desperate to keep the filibuster going. I am not going to continue to support this filibuster. I have been absolutely open and transparent on all of the legitimate issues that have been raised. I have provided an abundance of helpfulness—all the relevant information—and it is time that we bring this now to a close, I would have thought.

Senator Cormann interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  It is a very relevant issue, because the original rationale that the government used for the reduction in the R&D tax concession was the proposition that the reduction in the company tax rate would mean that it would legitimise the reduction in the R&D tax concession.




Senator Cormann:
  That was a different measure.




Senator KIM CARR:
  No, it is a very similar measure. The government stated that it was its intention to link the two issues. Is it your intention to reduce the company tax rate?

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:32):  Well, it is clear that we are not going to get an answer to that. But I just want to go back to the minister's suggesting that it is not a legitimate question to ask, first of all, which businesses he consulted about the refusal to pay quarterly payments and, secondly, what research he has on the impact of taking $1.1 billion out of research and development and of these particular changes on smaller and medium enterprises and public institutions such as CSIRO and universities. I do not see, Minister—why don't you go back to your sedan chair and finish your conversation somewhere else? Can I just ask, Minister: why will you not tell the Senate and the Australian people what the impact is going to be of taking $1.1 billion out of research and development on CSIRO and on universities and small and medium-size enterprises? If you have done the work that you have said you have done, and if Senator Wang's amendment does as you say, you should be able to tell us what the likely impact is going to be on universities, given that you are taking millions out of the universities already and given that you have slashed CSIRO funding by more than $1 million. Now you are reducing research and development capacity that would flow on to them because, as I said, these larger institutions actually contract some of these small and medium-size businesses and involve universities.


Please answer the question. I think Australia's universities, Australia's research community and Australia's small businesses deserve to know what modelling you have on the impact of taking $1.1 billion out and these changes on their capacity for research, innovation, new technology and jobs growth, because this is where the jobs engine is, not in the old fossil fuels sector, not in the old 'dig it up, cut it down, ship it away'. The innovation is in these future businesses that are working with the universities. And I want to know the impact on the universities, especially given, as I indicated before, that the University of New South Wales has said that 20 per cent of its research effort is backed by companies that will be directly affected by the bill. Now, if that is the University of New South Wales, it will be the same for the other big universities around the country, and smaller ones as well. What is the impact on those universities and research institutions?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:35):  At the risk of repeating myself, we are going around and around in circles, where Senator Milne attacks our government for doing certain things and reducing funding available for research and development as a result of this measure. I would just say again: this is a Labor Party budget measure. It is a measure that has been initiated and banked in the 2013-14 budget by the Gillard Labor government, with Mr Swan as Treasurer and Senator Wong as the finance minister. That is what happened. And I have already read into Hansard the justification by former Treasurer Mr Swan at an Australian Business Economists breakfast—and I will quote it again for your benefit—when he said:


We said we would remove the R&D tax concession for large companies with a $20 billion Australian turnover or more, to ensure innovation spending is directed to where it will have the biggest benefit.


He also said that this was 'a down payment on the repair that the budget needs'.


Now, we can go around and around in circles, and Senator Carr has tried his best to come up with one red herring after the other to keep the filibuster going, including mixing up the various budget measures. He was trying to pin this government for a Labor government budget measure. All we are doing here is seeking to legislate a budget measure initiated and banked in the 2013-14 budget by the previous Labor government. I understand that Senator Carr has stared down his leader, Mr Shorten, in relation to this matter, to get him to change the position compared with the position of the Gillard and Rudd Labor government before the last election, as reflected in their economic statement before the election and the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The fiscal impact is broadly the same. That is the truth of it. Actually, it is going to be less now, because we are starting a year later. The Labor measure was supposed to start on 1 July 2013. If the Senate passes the Palmer United Party amendments, it will now start a year later, so there will be a loss there in terms of the beneficial impact on the budget bottom line because of that delay. I am intrigued as to why Senator Milne did not ask these questions of the previous Gillard Labor government which initiated and banked this particular measure, so I am not going to continue to go round and round in circles with you.

The measure that Senator Carr has just read out is of course included in our budget—it is not reflected in this legislation but is included in our budget.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:42):  In an abundance of helpfulness, Senator Carr obviously knows that the policy we went to the last election with was to have a company tax cut of 1.5 per cent to come into effect from 1 July 2015. This was, in effect, offset for Australia's 3,000 largest companies by the 1.5 per cent paid parental leave levy, which means that, in practice for those largest companies, the effective tax rate remained at 30 per cent. That is a matter of public record. Now, what we have said is that we are not proceeding with the paid parental leave scheme that we took to the last election. We have also said that there will be further announcements in the coming weeks and months about a families package, about a jobs package. Of course, that will include all of the detail in terms of how those changes—in particular, the measures to facilitate access to more affordable child care—will be funded and what we have put around all of that. You have asked what we have put around all of that by way of parameters. As was our policy before the election and as is the policy reflected in the budget papers, large companies are not going to pay more in tax than they are paying now. There is that 30 per cent cap which is the same as is reflected in the budget papers right now when you take the 28.5 and the 1.5 together. But the fact that small and medium sized businesses will be at least 1.5 per cent better off is the language the Prime Minister used in his Press Club speech, which I am sure you would have studied in great detail. So this is completely irrelevant to the legislation that is in front of us; but, given that you are trying to mislead the Australian people with some of the verballing and misleading assertions that you have been making, I thought it was important to make that clarification.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (13:44):  It is an assertion that you have made yourselves on page 18 of your budget paper No. 2, and I raised it in the context that the previous Labor government explicitly decoupled the proposition that there would be a link between the taxation rate of companies and the R&D tax credit. That was one of the reforms that we introduced.


Mr Scott Morrison admitted when he made some statements just last week that the Abbott government had left Australian business in limbo. I think that was the word he used: 'in limbo'. Clearly you are trying to extract yourself from the chaotic arrangements that your leader had placed upon you in regard to his changes to the Paid Parental Leave policy and the backflip that he engaged in with that. There is no doubt that there is a flip-flop arrangement when it comes to the taxation policy of the government, and my concern here is what the government has prosecuted through its budget papers: trying to assert that there is a link between the R&D tax incentive scheme and the rate of company tax.


But let me just go to the issue of the arrangements regarding so-called retrospectivity. In the report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee examining the original government bill—that is the $20 billion proposal, as distinct from the revised government bill, since it is quite clear that you are the real owners of this revised amendment, which of course was never flagged anywhere and never discussed prior to the consideration of these matters—the Liberal Party's Senator Bushby argued on page 14 of the report:


Generally, retrospective tax legislation is not desirable and any such legislation should ideally be limited to rare circumstances, such as to correct unintended consequences or to address integrity issues. However, the proposed amendments have been foreshadowed for some time—


by, it was claimed, the previous government.




Senator Cormann:
  That's right—by Labor.




Senator KIM CARR:
  I am quoting directly from the report. This is the argument that was put:


… the previous government introduced a bill in June 2013 which, if passed, would have enacted them.


That is page 14 of the report. Irrespective of the fact that the parliament had been prorogued and that this was a new bill—and, of course, irrespective of the fact that the previous regime was directly tied to the jobs package—I would ask you: where was the $100 million cap foreshadowed by any public announcement or previous legislation by this government? How would such a statement actually satisfy the test that was established in the economics committee report by Senator Bushby?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:48):  The best way to boost the capacity of Australian businesses to invest more in research and development is to grow a stronger economy. Over the last 17 to 18 months, the government has worked very hard to strengthen the economy and create more jobs, and of course the results are starting to show. Last year the economy grew by 2.7 per cent, up from 1.9 per cent the year before. We have scrapped the carbon tax. We have scrapped the mining tax. We have finalised three free trade agreements with key economies in the region: China, South Korea and Japan. We are rolling out a record infrastructure investment program. We are pursuing a whole range of measures to boost economic growth and to help Australian businesses be more successful and generate more profits to give them more capacity to employ more Australians and invest more in research and development to facilitate stronger growth into the future.


What we are saying here is that we agree with the former Labor government that it is appropriate in the current circumstances to better target the tax incentives available for research and development. Instead of providing a 133 per cent tax deduction for Australia's most profitable businesses, we are proposing for that to be a 100 per cent tax deduction only. The way we have structured it, in consultation with the crossbench, is to put a $100 million cap on the special benefit available from taxpayers for those businesses making research and development investments. We think that is appropriate, we think that is well balanced and we think that the issue is well understood, and I would urge the Senate to support it.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:50):  I did not ask for a party political broadcast on Liberal Party propaganda. What I asked for was an unequivocal guarantee that the research effort of Australian universities will not suffer—will not actually be cut—because the government has decided to move to take $1.1 billion out of research and development as a result of this legislation. It is a straight-up question. The vice-chancellors, the students, the businesses associated with it and the PhD students all deserve an answer. It is a serious business. You get a university like the University of New South Wales, with 30 per cent of their research effort, they estimate, backed by companies that are directly affected by this bill. Given that that is the fact, they deserve an answer: if this passes, is this going to undermine the dollars available for those research efforts, given an environment where you are cutting back funding to universities?


These are the serious questions the community want answered. You have not learnt anything from the feedback from the community on what they think of the Abbott government if you keep on standing here just going into a party political broadcast. Answer the question: will universities suffer in their research effort—yes or no? Will there be any adverse consequence because you are stopping large corporations investing in research and development by taking that $1.1 billion out? It is a straight-up question: yes or no?

You have not mentioned the word universities. You have not been able to even get near an answer to the question.

Senator KIM CARR:
  You will have your chance. I also asked you a question about the issue of  retrospectivity. The government made assertions in the Senate economics report that there had been announcements and that satisfied the government, in their own minds, that they did not have to worry too much about retrospectivity. I have asked you a specific question: when was the announcement made by the government, regarding the $100 million cap foreshadowed in this amendment before the chamber, which would satisfy the retrospectivity test that you as a government brought to this parliament through the economics committee report?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-02-10,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:53):  The first point I would make is that this measure in this legislation was announced as part of the 2013-14 budget back in May 2013 by the then Gillard Labor government. Now the government has agreed with crossbench senators to delay the start date of the research and development targeting measure to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2014, in order to minimise the risk of the law applying to companies retrospectively because of the delays that Labor has driven against its own savings measure.


Under the original date of effect of 1 July 2013 this measure would have affected income years that may have finished and would therefore raise the risk of companies being required to make an amended tax assessment. By delaying the start date of the measure to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2014 the amendments will only apply to companies—and this is the very important point that you need to listen to—lodging their tax returns from 1 July 2015 onwards. This will provide affected companies with additional time and notice to plan for the changes in the law.


The point here—through you, Chair—is: the Gillard Labor government announced this measure in May 2013 to take effect from 1 July 2013, and it would have impacted on companies lodging tax returns from 1 July 2014. In an abundance of transparency, and taking on board the feedback from the crossbench, we have delayed that by one year, so it is now only due to come into effect in relation to companies lodging their tax returns from 1 July 2015. Now, when I last looked, we are not yet past 1 July 2015; when I last looked 1 July 2015 was still more than four months away. I do not know how Senator Carr, given that this was announced in 2013 and will not come into practical effect until 1 July 2015, could describe it as a retrospective measure in any way, shape or form.

Also, the problem with what you have just said is that you propose that the fact you gave notice on a previous measure ignores the fact that the government has accepted a different measure. We are not actually debating that matter any longer because the government has proposed a fundamentally different proposition.




Senator Cormann:
  That's just not true.




Senator KIM CARR:
  You have—a $100 million cap instead of the $20 billion arrangement. It is a new measure of which no notice has been given, none whatsoever. Minister, is it not a fact that companies get prior approval before they lodge their claims and often before they actually undertake the investment? Is it not a fact, Minister, that the proposition you have just put to this chamber is completely erroneous because some companies such as CSL—an Australian manufacturer that makes vaccines and biopharmaceutical products—undertake strategic investment decisions on the basis of that advice, and that your proposal will in fact change the ground rules retrospectively on the basis of the investment they make? Whether or not they lodge their claim at any point in the future for activity undertaken in the period covered by this new amendment—this new proposition—the $100 million cap will, in fact, come into play irrespective of any other statements you have made. That is the nature of the retrospectivity. Is that the case?

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:57):  It is clear the minister has no intention of standing up and answering the question, so I would like to ask him another one. Which universities did you consult about the impact on their research effort of your taking $1.1 million out of the research and development budget in this country? The University of New South Wales made its submission to the Senate inquiry; which other universities did you consult? Did you consult any? Did you consult the CSIRO? And if you did not consult the CSIRO, why not? They are a central institution in this particular mix. I can see the minister is much more interested in talking to his other colleagues than in answering the question. So, Minister, if you are—




Senator Ronaldson:

Senator MILNE:
  It is interesting—the government has learned absolutely nothing. They have more important things to do than answer questions about which universities they consulted about the impact on their research efforts of a government amendment to take $1.1 billion out of research and development!


This is exactly why the community is fed up with the current government. You just go back to your rhetoric and dismiss people's concerns as if they are of no consequence because somehow you are born to rule. Let me tell you: you are not born to rule. The community is sending that message. So I ask the minister directly: will you tell us which universities you consulted before you made the move on this legislation? Did you consult with any? What is the impact on their research efforts?

The CHAIRMAN
 (12:32):  The Senate is considering the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2014 and amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7618 moved by Senator Wang and amendment (1) on sheet 7650 moved by Senator Carr.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-02-10,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (12:32):  Yesterday the government was trying to assert that the opposition's concerns on this matter, my personal concerns on this matter, were about fighting old battles. I think it is important to state for the record that the minister of course has completely misread this situation. This is not about fighting old battles. It is an argument about what sort of country we want this to be. Unlike my colleagues on the other side of the chamber, Labor recognises that investments in innovation are critical to the future prosperity of this nation. In advanced industrial economies, innovation is the chief driver of increases in productivity. It makes firms more competitive and it sustains high-skilled, high-wage jobs.


According to the Australian innovation system report, innovation almost doubles the likelihood of productivity growth in Australian businesses. Firms that innovate are 78 per cent more likely to report increases in productivity over the previous year, and firms that collaborate with research organisations are almost 2½ times more likely to report increases in productivity. Without a strong innovation system, Australia will not be able to build a diverse economy.


The perfidy of this government absolutely astounds me. As the minister is well aware, the amendments before the chamber in the name of the Palmer United Party were actually drafted by the government. They have been undertaken without consultation. According to Treasury officials who appeared before the Economics Legislation Committee, there has been no modelling undertaken to support them. There has been no consideration of the impact on future R&D investment and no concern for R&D intensive firms that have hired R&D workers and sought approval for R&D activities in future years on the basis of the current legislation. So this is not about fighting old battles; it is about fighting for what sort of country we want this to be.


What we do know is that it is the largest firms that undertake the most extensive R&D in this country and that the government's assault upon those firms will do untold damage to our R&D effort. We saw this pattern in previous times. We saw it in 1996, when the incoming Liberal government accepted carte blanche the advice of Treasury and cut the R&D incentives. The consequences were felt for years. 


We know particularly that manufacturing businesses will be affected, at a time when they need all the help they can get. I find it extraordinary that the minister yesterday, at the last minute, suggested to us that there was modelling undertaken, despite what we were told at the Economics Legislation Committee. I would suggest that 30 years of data demonstrates that the incentive for R&D supports growth and jobs. R&D cuts in 1996 impaired R&D spending for at least five years. The statistics show that R&D spending dropped by nine per cent from 1996 through to 2000. Jobs associated with R&D fell throughout this period, particularly in manufacturing and mining. That is what the official reports told us.


So, Minister, now that you say there has actually been modelling undertaken, contrary to the advice tendered previously, I would like to ask you specifically: how many firms will be affected by the government's—not PUP members'—new measures? I would particularly like to know the number of firms affected, not the number of consolidated groups. Can you provide that advice?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-02-10,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (12:37):  Contrary to what Senator Carr is trying to suggest, he is fighting old battles. He continues to run his vendetta against former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and former Treasurer Wayne Swan. Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and former Treasurer Wayne Swan decided that it was not appropriate for businesses making more than $20 billion in profits a year to get a 133 per cent tax deduction. They thought it would be appropriate for companies in those circumstances to only get a 100 per cent tax deduction for their research and development expenditure.


We have had a lot of rhetoric from Labor in recent times on how we ought to ensure that larger businesses, multinational businesses, pay their fair share of tax, and here we have Senator Carr fighting for a 133 per cent tax deduction for businesses earning more than $20 billion a year, instead of a 100 per cent tax deduction. We do not think that is fair. We do not think that is appropriate. We understand that former Prime Minister Gillard and former Treasurer Wayne Swan shared that view. They actually reflected that view in their last budget. In the 2013-14 budget, that was what they initiated and what they banked by way of savings in the budget. 


We have not been able to get the support of Labor for their own savings measure. Senator Carr personally rolled Mr Shorten, who was too weak to stand up to Senator Carr and who was too weak to do the right thing in the national interest—which was what former Prime Minister Gillard and former Treasurer Wayne Swan were prepared to do in relation to this matter. That is why the Labor Party are taking the reckless and irresponsible position they are taking here in this chamber today. 


That is also why we have engaged constructively, positively and in good faith with crossbench senators who, like us, want to ensure that tax incentives for research and development are better targeted. That is why we have worked with the Palmer United Party and other crossbench senators to come up with a structure that ensures that the adjustment is fair between those businesses that predominantly generate their profits in Australia and those businesses that perhaps predominantly generate their profits in other parts of the world.


Senator Carr has asked how many businesses will be impacted. The answer is less than 25—less than 25 of the largest businesses operating here in Australia.


What we are actually dealing with—I know the shadow minister went back to some issues that we traversed at length yesterday—are the amendment before the chair, which is Senator Carr's amendment, where he seeks to substitute 1 July 2014 in the Palmer United Party amendment with 1 July 2016. We have to remember that, when Labor initiated and banked this savings measure in the budget, the starting date was 1 July 2013. By the time we went to the election in September 2013, Labor had failed to legislate their own savings which they initiated and banked in their budget. We are now here doing Labor's work for them, with Labor opposing us all the way and playing politics. This amendment is an implicit recognition that what we are trying to do is right, because clearly Senator Carr is working on the basis that this legislation will go through. He just wants to delay the start date by another two years. We have said in good faith, given the delays, that 1 July 2013 is no longer appropriate but 1 July 2014 is because, of course, we are in the 2014-15 financial year.


So the government will oppose the amendment circulated by Senator Carr. We will support the two amendments circulated by Senator Wang on behalf of the Palmer United Party, and we would urge all senators to do the same.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (12:43):  Less than 25? Okay. Then, of course, you say that you cannot tell how many consolidated groups would be affected. I put it to you, for instance, that Wesfarmers would be one business; it is made up of a number of firms. There are many manufacturing businesses associated with the consolidated group around Wesfarmers. Is that part of the 25? There are a number of others. Rio Tinto has a whole series of firms associated with it. Is that part of the 25 or is that one firm? 


You see, that is the point here. We would like to know precisely how your amendment will work. We want to know the number of firms and, of course, from that we will be able to tell how many employees this involves and the firms' investment in R&D, to make some judgement as to whether or not the Treasury advice that you are relying upon is a reasonable basis on which we should make a judgement.


I say to you, Minister: while you are on the topic, you can perhaps tell me: in the last 20 years, pick one year in which the Treasury advice on expenditure on R&D has actually been correct and accurate. Just pick one year and tell me which year that is—because this is the basis on which you are now asking us to make a judgement. You say it is fewer than 25 firms, yet you cannot tell us who they are. Naturally enough, you will tell me, 'Oh, it's confidential.' I put to you that the sorts of companies we are talking about—BHP Billiton, Wesfarmers, Woolworths, Rio Tinto, National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac, Telstra, AustralianSuper, Caltex, BP, Shell, Xstrata and QBE—are firms that undertake major investments in R&D in this country. There are considerably more than 25 firms tied up in that list that I have read to you.


So, Minister, how many firms is it really? Are we talking about firms or consolidated groups? What is the level of investment that those firms would claim for collectively?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-02-10,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (12:46):  Senator Carr is just throwing around red herrings. Senator Carr knows very well that it is absolutely a standard procedure, that it is absolutely the consistent application of relevant methodology, for consolidated groups to be the basis on which to claim the refundable tax offset.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Oh, so we are talking about consolidated groups?




Senator CORMANN:
  Of course we are. That is actually not a big revelation; that is actually what matters. It is absolutely consistent—it is absolutely standard procedure to assess these things at the level of consolidated groups. Otherwise, if you do not, you actually facilitate and encourage all sorts of manoeuvring to avoid relevant tax and other obligations, which I am sure Senator Carr would not want to be party to encouraging.


If Senator Carr does not like the methodology put forward by the Palmer United Party, which the government has agreed with, it is free to him to say that he would prefer to go down the path of the original Gillard-Swan Labor government measure. If Senator Carr is saying, 'Actually, I'm really worried about this alternative way of doing it,' the objective of which is to ensure that, whether you are a business operating out of Australia that generates most of its profits in Australia or whether you are a business operating in Australia which generates large parts of its profits in other parts of the world, you are going to be treated the same, that is the effect of using a cap instead of the assessable income methodology. If you say you prefer to go back to the assessable income methodology, tell us now and we will pass the legislation based on the way that Labor initiated it and banked it in their last budget.


But I suspect that that is actually just another red herring, because you have rolled your leader, Mr Shorten. You have rolled him, where Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan were strong enough to stand up to you in the national interest. You are just here, joined with Senator Milne, trying to keep up a special interest for rent seekers that are particularly profitable.




Senator Kim Carr:
  BHP are rent seekers, are they? BHP are now rent seekers?



The CHAIRMAN:  Order!




Senator CORMANN:
  You are here protecting a special interest for companies generating more than $20 billion in assessable income. That is what you are doing, and you are doing it as part of your ongoing political battle inside the Labor Party against Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan—and everybody knows it.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:49):  I think we have just seen from the minister the kind of performance that is the reason that the Australian community is so fed up with the Abbott government. Minister, you can stand in here and go on with your ill-considered ideological rhetoric and what you think are effective pre-formulated attacks on Labor and the Greens, but you are not answering the questions and this Senate is absolutely being treated with contempt. To stand there and say that these are the PUP amendments is a joke. The senator who moved this amendment is not even in the chamber, because he cannot explain it; he has no idea whatsoever what he is putting to the Senate. Why? Because you wrote it for him—Treasury wrote it for him; you gave it to him; you gave it to the Palmer United Party. They stood up and moved it; they could not answer a single question on it. If you stood Senator Wang in here, he would not be able to answer a single question about which companies he is excluding or why he is taking $1 billion out. If he can, he should be in here.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  On a point of order, Mr Chairman, the rules are clear in terms of casting aspersions upon other members in this place. I do not think you could make a graver allegation against another member in this place than the one that has been presented by the senator.



The CHAIRMAN:  I do not think there is a point of order, Senator O'Sullivan.




Senator MILNE:
  I would challenge Senator Wang to come in here and explain his amendment and defend it, instead of leaving it to the minister, who wrote it and who gave it to him, to now be explaining it.


I want to come back to the essential thing here, and that is that the Greens never supported the change. One of the reasons they did not legislate it is that we would not have supported it—and we do not. I do not want to see $1.1 billion taken out of supporting research and development in this country. Let me put that firmly on the record. We want to see more targeted research and development, but we do not want to see you ripping $1 billion out of research and development in this country, and that is precisely what Senator Cormann, the minister, stands for. Ripping up money going into the CSIRO, taking money out of our universities, taking money out of research and development and handing it back as fossil fuel subsidies—that is what we have from the government.


Everybody knows, if you are going to get away from being an economy which is 'dig it up, cut it down and ship it away', you have to invest in education and research and development. You have to make sure that that happens. That is what the Greens want to see, and that is why I moved last night to make sure that small businesses, those drivers of real innovation, of cutting edge innovation, can benefit in the way that they sought to—and the government just showed absolute contempt for that. And what we are seeing from you, Minister, is very much the vandals coming over the wall—but this time they are coming over the wall with cigars in their mouths and in sedan chairs. And that is what the community does not like. They are sick of it, and they want to see some equity.


I would like to get back to a serious question—Senator Carr asked it, and I am asking it now: who are these 25 companies that are going to be affected? Is Telstra one of them? I want to read you what Telstra had to say. They said:


As a proud Australian company and one with an increasing global footprint, the R&D tax incentive has been one of the reasons behind Telstra's commitment to undertake the majority of our R&D work onshore.


R&D investment, according to the submissions to the committee—not Telstra submissions but general submissions to the committee—highlighted that not only will R&D investment go offshore, hurting our economy; it will mean that estimated savings will not actually materialise because of the impact on longer term growth to the economy. The focus on removing incentives for larger companies makes this very likely because they are most able to offshore research. That is the first thing. So if you take this money out of here, you will see the research, the innovation, the intellectual property develop offshore. That is the last thing you want if you are transitioning your economy. Secondly, smaller and medium enterprises and public institutions such as CSIRO and universities will be hurt by the changes because of the flow-on impact—as I said in my second reading speech. The University of New South Wales, for example, gave evidence at the inquiry that 30 per cent of its research effort is backed by companies directly affected by this bill.


So let's hear from the minister what the difference is between what the government put up and what, supposedly, Senator Wang put up. He said last night that there were marginal differences in the number of companies and only marginal differences in the amount they are expected to receive. Well, let's hear it. I want to know exactly the differences. Which companies will now be captured that were not captured before and vice versa? I want to know exactly about the money. You have supposedly done the modelling, so let's hear it. Give us some specifics instead of just standing there pontificating and protecting people who cannot even be interested enough to turn up to the debate in the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-02-10,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (12:55):  I confirm again that Australia's largest and most profitable businesses are large and profitable and do large research and development. Our advice and the advice that was available to the previous government is that they are not as sensitive to tax incentives, tax subsidies, as small and medium sized firms. That is why the previous Gillard Labor government made a judgement to better target the tax incentives for research and development. And that is because small and medium sized firms are more responsive to incentives—that is what the OECD has found. Again, that is the policy intent and rationale for this Labor Party savings measure.


With this legislation, which was 100 per cent consistent with Labor's original measure, the methodology used was to essentially make the adjustment where the special tax incentive was no longer available for businesses that generated more than $20 billion in assessable income a year. The issue raised with us by the Palmer United Party is this: an Australian company that generates more than $20 billion of its assessable income in Australia will lose this additional incentive whereas a company that generates $5 billion or $10 billion in assessable income in Australia but $20 billion, $30 billion or $40 billion in income which is not part of the Australian tax jurisdiction is not impacted in the same way. That is why they have said to us it would be fairer, from their point of view, if we used a different methodology to achieve essentially the same outcome, and that is to use a cap up until which the higher tax incentive is available and above which the higher tax incentive is no longer available. So, up to $100 million in benefit from the taxpayer to a particular business, the tax deduction available is 133 person. Above $100 million in benefit from the taxpayer, the tax deduction falls back to 100 per cent—not nothing, not zero, just 100 per cent instead of 133 per cent. That was not our initial approach, but that is the approach which we believe has the support of the Senate. It achieves a similar outcome.


And now Senator Milne and Senator Carr have invited me to give them an exhaustive list of the companies that are likely to be impacted by this. Of course, they know that there are confidentiality provisions that prevent me from doing so and it depends on the tax affairs of particular companies in a particular year. It is obviously very hard to make a conclusive judgement in relation to this because it does depend on what happens on a whole range of fronts. Having said that, Treasury has costed this measure, it has costed this amendment, it has modelled the impact of this amendment; and the advice that we have got is that fewer than 25 businesses in Australia are likely to be affected, that this will broadly achieve the same saving and that, broadly speaking, the businesses impacted are likely to be in the same category. So that is the advice, that is what I put openly and transparently to the Senate, and it is up to the Senate to make its judgement.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:59):  So we are told that it broadly achieves the same, that broadly the companies are in the same category. But essentially we get the same outcome. So, broadly, you would say that Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott are in the same category. Broadly, you would say we will get essentially the same outcomes. The community have a view that 'broadly' and 'essentially' are not the same thing. So I would like to know: what is the difference? That is what we are asking here.


One piece of legislation went to a committee. It was a farce, but it went to the committee at least. Now we have amendments which have not gone to committee, which nobody knows, and the person who is putting forward the amendments has not turned up in the chamber, has not made a speech on them and does not know anything about them. We are asked to be assessing because the minister says they are broadly the same, with essentially the same outcome and approximately the same set of companies. We have not had the opportunity to test what the real difference is between what the government has proposed and what Senator Wong, who has not even turned up here, is proposing.


I do not think the community is going to buy it. In the parliament you need more than 'broadly', and 'Essentially, it is the same,' and, 'It is similar,' and, 'Just take it from me; take my word for it.' It has not gone to the committee. If you are not prepared to tell us what 'essentially the same', 'broadly speaking', 'broadly achieves the same', and 'broadly the same categories' mean, then you are asking people to buy a pig in a poke. And we are not going to do that.

Senator Cormann:

Senator KIM CARR:
  We will not be going around in circles. I think we are entitled to have specific answers to specific questions. You have indicated that these measures have now been modelled. What is the nature of that modelling? You indicated that it is 25 firms, and then you tell us that maybe it is 25 consolidated groups.




Senator Cormann:
  I didn't say 'firms'; I've never said 'firms'.




Senator KIM CARR:
  You have said 'firms'. I asked specifically, 'How many firms?' You told me 25. I then went on to say, 'Do you mean consolidated groups?' You are confusing the two. It is quite clearly not 25 firms. How many firms is it, then?



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is—Senator Carr?




Senator KIM CARR:
  I have asked a question. Are we not answering it at all? Is this the minister's new technique—that he just refuses to answer? How many firms are affected by this measure, and what is the nature of the modelling that you claim has now been undertaken?

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:02):  This is a pattern of behaviour that the government has adopted—as I said, very much the cigar smoking in the sedan chair with complete contempt for the Senate. The fact is that government has done this on a number of occasions, and I am just going to point it out for all and sundry, and that is: to just sit there and refuse to answer the questions, to leave the people answering the questions to ask in consecutive order because nobody else is here to support them, and then to use the chair—not in your case, Mr Deputy President, but in other cases—to call the order in terms of how many questions are asked without an intervention and get a vote on the issue. This is contempt of the Senate. We want answers to the questions. It is surely not too hard for the minister to actually answer the questions. I have asked him: what is the difference between what he is proposing and what Senator Wong is proposing, because what Senator Wong is proposing, via the minister, has not been to a Senate committee. There has been no opportunity, other than this stage in the committee, to have that, and so I am going to ask specifically: is Telstra one of the companies that would have been captured by both, and, having assumed that it is, will the minister say why a company like Telstra would now not take their R&D offshore and therefore undermine the research capacity of places like the University of New South Wales and other universities around the country? Why won't that occur? Secondly, did the minister consult with AusBiotech or any other of the umbrella groups for small research and development companies about quarterly payments, or did he just arrogantly decide to dismiss it on the basis of intuition?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:04):  What is going on now, I will just place on record, is a desperate attempt at a joint filibuster by the Labor-Greens coalition. And Senator Milne just misled the Senate. She just indicated to the Senate that the Palmer United Party amendment never went to the Senate committee. Well, it actually did go to the Senate committee. When we circulated the amendments towards the end of last year, Senator Xenophon asked me to facilitate a briefing by Treasury and relevant others to all interested members of the Senate economics committee. It was a very productive and constructive meeting. The government absolutely acted in good faith. Our preferred approach was to go down the path that Labor initiated and banked in their last budget. But because Labor under Bill Shorten's leadership is too weak to stand up for the national interest and too weak to do what needs to be done to repair the budget and strengthen the economy, we are in the situation where we have no choice but to negotiate with the crossbench.


I have answered these questions many times before, and if you go over Hansard you will see that I have. You asked me again: what is difference between what the government is proposing and what the Palmer United party amendment is proposing to achieve? The policy intent behind both approaches is to ensure that special tax incentives for research and development are properly targeted—that they do not go to the biggest, most profitable businesses but are appropriately targeted to small and medium-sized businesses where the research, including through the OECD, consistently shows that those incentives actually make a difference. The approach that we put forward in our legislation was for any business with an assessable income—relevant profits above $20 billion—to be excluded from the 133 per cent tax deduction and to only be eligible for 100 per cent tax deduction for their expenditure on research and development.


As to the issue that was raised—and, again, we have gone round and round in circles in relation to this, and I have been very clear in relation to this—the Palmer United Party said to us: 'What we worry about is that that means that, if you generate most of your profits in Australia, you are slightly disadvantaged compared to a business that generates some profits in Australia but most of their profits in other parts of the world.' They asked us to consider whether we could achieve the same policy intent using a different methodology, and that is by putting a cap on the special benefit that is available to larger businesses for their research and development expenditure. The cap that is on the table is a $100 million cap, and the advice from Treasury is that that means that we will generate broadly the same savings, and that broadly the same businesses, the same companies, will be impacted.


Senator Carr is trying to confuse people and run red herrings about firms and consolidated groups. The truth is that these things are always, consistently, as a matter of standard operating procedure, assessed at the level of consolidated groups. That is the way this works. No amount of red herrings is going to distract from the fact that this is a very personal agenda that Senator Carr continues to run against the former Prime Minister and the former Treasurer. I am not interested in getting in the middle of Labor Party factional infighting. I am totally not interested in that. I am interested in doing the right thing in the national interest. All I am interested in is progressing a budget measure that was initiated and banked by Labor in their last budget. We are doing Labor's hard yards for them, even though Labor has turned against themselves on this.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (13:08):  The statements that the Minister for Finance has made are quite erroneous in a number of ways. The specific inquiry that Senator Milne and I are seeking to prosecute with you is the detail of the modelling that you claim has been undertaken. It is true that I do have some interest in this topic. I have been pursuing these questions for the better part of 20 years while a member of this parliament. That is why I can say with certainty that Treasury has never ever, not once, got it right when it comes to their projections on R&D expenditure—not once in 20 years.




Senator Cormann:
  Projections are projections.




Senator KIM CARR:
  Projections are certainly projections, and now the minister is saying to us that he has relied upon these experts, who have never once got it right in 20 years, to now tell us that you have done this modelling which will produce a particular result. He cannot even tell us the number of firms that are directly affected, and he says, in the broadest of terms, it might have the same impact as our original intention. He further goes on to say that it is exactly the same as what the Labor Party wanted to do. Of course that is not true and the minister knows that is not true. The Labor Party was developing a jobs package—over $1 billion worth of expenditure, investing in jobs in this country, which those opposite have scrapped. That is a point that the minister chooses to ignore.


I come back to the central proposition: Minister, will you table the modelling. While you are there, there is this other subsidiary argument that Treasury have been running for some years. As the minister says, I have some interest in this matter. When I was minister they did run this same modelling. It is not the argument you will find, of course, in other parts of the government—when you talk to the Department of Industry you will get an entirely different perspective. People who actually have to deal with enterprises and understand the importance of incentives in developing our industrial capabilities in Australia will take an entirely different view. The government maintains that large firms will invest in R&D regardless of whether or not they can access R&D incentives, but this is a well-furrowed field. The argument is flawed. There is evidence that smaller firms are more responsive to R&D tax incentives, but that does not equate with the alternative proposition that large firms are unresponsive. There is also evidence to suggest that large firms are able to make more effective use of incentives. This is historic evidence that, Minister, if you had more understanding of this issue you might appreciate. The evidence demonstrates that large firms are influenced by R&D incentives and the removal of those incentives risks having them offshore their R&D activities. That is what this government is really good at. One of their great achievements is exporting jobs, and this is another example of it. This is about how you export jobs. This is a government that takes the view that it does not matter what investment attractions you offer because the firms by divine right will come here. We know that is not the case. 


International studies have demonstrated that firm size and R&D incentives are directly linked. R&D credits are effective in increasing R&D investments especially in large firms. Kroger in 2003, for instance, says that R&D tax credits are a great stimulus for R&D investment in large firms as compared to medium-sized firms. That is the point that has been made throughout the OECD literature. The Australian ABS highlights this—it demonstrates a clear link between changes in R&D incentives and regimes and large business investment in R&D. The historic evidence here is very clear, because the same sort of Treasury dogma was accepted in 1996 when there was a previous Liberal government. The concession was reduced from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. As a consequence, R&D investment fell by 9.6 per cent—for large firms much more dramatically than for small firms. It was particularly important in the finance and insurance sectors. In 2001 the premium tax concession was introduced, encouraging increases in R&D investment. That was under a conservative government. Inevitably what will happen is that there will be a swing within the coalition at some point towards understanding that you have to correct the error of your ways on this issue. 


That is the historic pattern. Between 2000 and 2002, large firms increased R&D investment by 43 per cent—much more dramatically than small firms increased their investment. R&D investment by large firms is particularly important in the finance services sector. Studies undertaken in other countries argue the same point. The Australian Innovation System Reports have highlighted this. They say that this is an initiative we took to ensure that this sort of data was collected. That is not something you will see from the Treasury, but it was material that we did see through the department of innovation. That showed that:


SMEs are lean innovators, accounting for a very small share of total investment in innovation, and are much less likely to generate new-to-the-world innovations. By contrast, large Australian businesses make up the majority of total investment in innovation, are much more likely to collaborate with the research sector and generate new-to-the-world innovations.


That is in the Department of Industry's Australian innovation system report 2013 that I have here. 


A survey conducted by the Australian government in 2005 found that large firms have the strongest focus on radical R&D, which involves costs with an order of magnitude higher than adapted off-the-shelf technologies when carrying out incremental R&D as typically undertaken by smaller enterprises. That information was found under your government, Minister. That was in The R&D Tax Concession—impact on the firm: report on a survey of 116 firmsdone in Canberra in October 2005.


The OECD 2011 International experience with tax incentives report looked at the effect of R&D incentives on the choice of location for R&D by multinational firms. Analysis of the data and R&D activities of multinational enterprises suggests that the growth rate of R&D by affiliates of multinational enterprises is higher in countries providing an R&D tax incentive than in those countries that do not offer such schemes. That again suggests that the decisions of multinational enterprises in conducting R&D in a particular country are correlated with the availability of tax incentives in that country and other potential destination countries. It is clear that when having two or more similar location alternatives, especially when such competition occurs within the region, government incentives tilt the investment decisions. The OECD 2011 report says that a study on US investments by US firms outside the US demonstrated that the R&D incentives were a driver to encourage investment outside the US.


Another report asks:


Are US tax incentives for corporate R&D likely to motivate American firms to perform research abroad?


The report results provided evidence that countries with tax based incentives for R&D and higher annual increases in R&D investments had more foreign affiliates of US firms than countries without such an investment.


When the changes to the R&D tax proposals were announced by this government, the French minister for innovation stated they had a competitive advantage and encouraged companies to invest in her country instead of Australia. She was directly pinching French firms and encouraging them to get their investment out of Australia and move it into France.


I am making the point to you, Minister, that you have misjudged this completely. This ideological obsession you have with reducing expenditure actually costs this country jobs. It costs opportunities. It undermines capabilities. You are expert at exporting jobs. You are exporting Australian jobs because of your obsessions and your dilettante behaviour in adopting the Treasury advice when all the evidence points to how wrong this approach is internationally and how the approach taken in this country where you are now seeking to repeat these mistakes will have to be changed again. I come back to the question: where is this modelling? When are you going to produce it?

I would like to know who you consulted with apart from Treasury, who apparently on this occasion have opposed it.


Secondly, I would like to know what modelling or research you have done on the impact of taking $1.1 billion out of research and development in Australia on small and medium enterprises and public institutions that depend on the flow-on impacts from investment in research and development. As I indicated before, quite often these corporations put money in but do it in conjunction with research institutions and universities as well as other small businesses. It is a collaborative approach. What modelling have you down on the impact of taking $1.1 billion out of research and development?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:21):  It is interesting that Senator Milne is now interested in modelling the economic impact from changes in policy because there is a significant and demonstrable growth impact on the economy which is very good for all of the firms that the Senator Milne is concerned about from scrapping the carbon tax. Scrapping the carbon tax will help all of these firms be more profitable, create more jobs, employ more Australians and invest more in research and development.


You are trying to make it harder for businesses to be successful and then want to give them a subsidy from the taxpayer. You want to make it harder for businesses to be successful, grow their businesses, employ more people and help us grow the economy more strongly and then, after you have done that, after you have hindered businesses from growing more strongly, you want taxpayers, the mums and dads of Australia, the working families of Australia, to help fund a special 133 per cent tax deduction for businesses generating more than $20 billion in assessable income. That is what you are doing.


Senator Carr, in his lengthy contribution as part of the Labor-Green filibuster, tried to suggest that the reason they were opposing this is that it was all supposed to be about the jobs package; this was not supposed to help repair the budget. He has misled the Senate again. I am quoting here directly former Treasurer Mr Wayne Swan from a speech he gave to the Australian Business Economists Breakfast on 22 February 2013. The title of the speech, if you want to google it, Senator Carr, is 'Challenges and choices in a post-GFC world'. This is what he said, and I quote former Treasurer Mr Swan directly from when he was defending this measure which you are now opposing. Mr Shorten was too weak to force you to support it in the same way as Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd had forced you to support it. This is what Mr Swan said:


We said we would remove the R&D tax concession for large companies with a $20 billion Australian turnover or more, to ensure innovation spending is directed to where it will have the biggest benefit. This saving will also deliver benefits to the bottom line over and above funding the package – so it's a down payment on the repair that the budget needs.


So do not come in here with your confected outrage, attacking the coalition because we are doing the hard yards in progressing a budget measure which the Gillard Labor government, with Mr Swan as Treasurer, initiated, banked in their budget and failed to legislate. We understand what this is all about. You are running a factional war inside the Labor Party. You have told Mr Shorten that, unless he backs you on this, your personal vendetta, you would not be supporting him, and Mr Shorten rolled over. That is exactly what happened. In the past when I have said this, you had a big Cheshire-cat smile on your face because you felt quite proud of having been able to do that. Do you know what? That is the problem with the modern-day Labor Party under Mr Shorten. Mr Shorten does not have what it takes to put the national interest ahead of his political self-interests, trying to stay on top of the factional dynamics inside the Labor Party.


We cannot let the national interest get caught up in that. All we are doing is progressing a Labor Party budget measure, with a slight amendment in order to take into account some legitimate concerns that were raised, and facing up to the reality that Labor and the Greens are blocking everything and anything in the context of political self-interest.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:24):  I will try again. I asked a specific question: who did you consult with when you decided to oppose quarterly payments? Can I please have an answer to that question? If there was any consultation, with whom did you consult? That is a more than reasonable question, because you have just really destroyed the hopes and aspirations of a lot of small to medium sized businesses who have argued very strongly that they needed this in order to make the kind of investment in research and development that they want. I think that it is more than reasonable that you answer the question. The second question I asked relates to the modelling on what it will do to universities and to research institutions.


As to your ludicrous proposition that abandoning carbon pricing helps these businesses, it is actually the exact opposite. Every innovative business in the country is looking towards the capacity building and new research that it needs to transition to a low-carbon economy. That is what they are doing. They are out there in the renewable energy field, in the energy efficiency field, in the alternative building materials field, in public transport, in systems thinking for changing design—all manner of things, including in agriculture and in cool storage. In all manner of things, people are looking at the innovation that you need to build resilience in the system in a world that is warming. And you, by tearing down carbon pricing, by throwing back to the fossil fuel age, have destroyed and sent offshore a huge number of our researchers already.


At a solar forum in Sydney, a fifth-year solar engineer got up and said that there is no future for her this country under the Abbott government and that she will have to go overseas because of the attack on renewable energy. Go to any of those forums and you will find small businesspeople standing there saying that their growth sector is in medium-scale solar rollout and that is being undermined by the Abbott government. If you are serious about jobs, then you would be moving full-on to build resilience to global warming and bring down emissions, because that will unleash a whole wave of innovation and research across the country. What you are doing is forcing them offshore. Part of your forcing them offshore is now not only taking $1.1 billion out of research and development but also not allowing small and medium cutting-edge businesses the ability to manage their cash flow in a way that enables them to further invest in research and development.


I again put to you, Minister: firstly, who did you consult on not pursuing the quarterly payments and taking it seriously? And, secondly, what is your modelling or what assessment have you got to indicate what is going to be the impact on universities, on public institutions such as the CSIRO and on small and medium enterprises as a result of these changes?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:28): The first point I would make is that Senator Milne just does not take no from the Senate for an answer. She is still arguing the supposed merits of her amendment, which the Senate passed judgement on yesterday and rejected. We have in front of us an amendment put forward by Senator Carr that, instead of deferring the implementation starting date to 1 July 2014, in the Labor Party view it should be deferred to 1 July 2016. The whole argument and all of the issues that you have raised relate to an amendment which the Senate considered yesterday and has already rejected.


You ask whom we have consulted. I will tell you whom we have consulted. We consulted the Australian people in the lead-up to the last election. The policy that is in front of us was not only our policy but Labor Party policy in the lead-up to the last election. Do you know what?


That is the way democracy works here in Australia. And I know the Greens have trouble accepting democratic principle. I understand that the Greens would much rather be in charge, with their enlightened views that are so much better than anybody else's, and impose them on everybody else. But the way the system works here in Australia is that every three years we have an election, and every three years the Australian people make a judgement on who they want to be the government. And, as it happens, in the lead-up to the last election the Labor Party and the coalition both went to the election with a policy position, reflected in our costings, which suggested that we wanted tax incentives for research and development to be better targeted and not to go to those businesses generating more than $20 billion a year in assessable income.


Now, we have been going around and around in circles in relation to this. The Labor Party and the Greens, led by Senators Carr and Milne, clearly are desperate to keep the filibuster going. I am not going to continue to support this filibuster. I have been absolutely open and transparent on all of the legitimate issues that have been raised. I have provided an abundance of helpfulness—all the relevant information—and it is time that we bring this now to a close, I would have thought.

Senator KIM CARR:
  It is a very relevant issue, because the original rationale that the government used for the reduction in the R&D tax concession was the proposition that the reduction in the company tax rate would mean that it would legitimise the reduction in the R&D tax concession.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:32):  Well, it is clear that we are not going to get an answer to that. But I just want to go back to the minister's suggesting that it is not a legitimate question to ask, first of all, which businesses he consulted about the refusal to pay quarterly payments and, secondly, what research he has on the impact of taking $1.1 billion out of research and development and of these particular changes on smaller and medium enterprises and public institutions such as CSIRO and universities. I do not see, Minister—why don't you go back to your sedan chair and finish your conversation somewhere else? Can I just ask, Minister: why will you not tell the Senate and the Australian people what the impact is going to be of taking $1.1 billion out of research and development on CSIRO and on universities and small and medium-size enterprises? If you have done the work that you have said you have done, and if Senator Wang's amendment does as you say, you should be able to tell us what the likely impact is going to be on universities, given that you are taking millions out of the universities already and given that you have slashed CSIRO funding by more than $1 million. Now you are reducing research and development capacity that would flow on to them because, as I said, these larger institutions actually contract some of these small and medium-size businesses and involve universities.


Please answer the question. I think Australia's universities, Australia's research community and Australia's small businesses deserve to know what modelling you have on the impact of taking $1.1 billion out and these changes on their capacity for research, innovation, new technology and jobs growth, because this is where the jobs engine is, not in the old fossil fuels sector, not in the old 'dig it up, cut it down, ship it away'. The innovation is in these future businesses that are working with the universities. And I want to know the impact on the universities, especially given, as I indicated before, that the University of New South Wales has said that 20 per cent of its research effort is backed by companies that will be directly affected by the bill. Now, if that is the University of New South Wales, it will be the same for the other big universities around the country, and smaller ones as well. What is the impact on those universities and research institutions?

I would just say again: this is a Labor Party budget measure. It is a measure that has been initiated and banked in the 2013-14 budget by the Gillard Labor government, with Mr Swan as Treasurer and Senator Wong as the finance minister. That is what happened. And I have already read into Hansard the justification by former Treasurer Mr Swan at an Australian Business Economists breakfast—and I will quote it again for your benefit—when he said:


We said we would remove the R&D tax concession for large companies with a $20 billion Australian turnover or more, to ensure innovation spending is directed to where it will have the biggest benefit.


He also said that this was 'a down payment on the repair that the budget needs'.


Now, we can go around and around in circles, and Senator Carr has tried his best to come up with one red herring after the other to keep the filibuster going, including mixing up the various budget measures. He was trying to pin this government for a Labor government budget measure. All we are doing here is seeking to legislate a budget measure initiated and banked in the 2013-14 budget by the previous Labor government. I understand that Senator Carr has stared down his leader, Mr Shorten, in relation to this matter, to get him to change the position compared with the position of the Gillard and Rudd Labor government before the last election, as reflected in their economic statement before the election and the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The fiscal impact is broadly the same. That is the truth of it. Actually, it is going to be less now, because we are starting a year later. The Labor measure was supposed to start on 1 July 2013. If the Senate passes the Palmer United Party amendments, it will now start a year later, so there will be a loss there in terms of the beneficial impact on the budget bottom line because of that delay. I am intrigued as to why Senator Milne did not ask these questions of the previous Gillard Labor government which initiated and banked this particular measure, so I am not going to continue to go round and round in circles with you.

The variation of that will depend on whether your amendment is successful. The question before the chair is that opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7650 be agreed to.




Senator KIM CARR:
  I would like to deal specifically with this so-called question of retrospectivity, given that clearly the ground rules are changing. For instance, the company tax issue for large firms—the 1.5 per cent reduction—is not going to occur, despite the assertions that were made in the budget papers. I want to deal with the—




Senator Cormann:
  That is just not true!




Senator KIM CARR:
  Well, that is what you said.




Senator Cormann:
  That is not what I said.




Senator KIM CARR:
  That is what you said. You said: '…will remain the same—they will pay the same tax. The reductions won't occur.' If I have misunderstood you, I am sure you will be only too happy to correct the record. Perhaps you can do that. Maybe that is one question you can answer, since you are so short on answers for everything else. But that is clearly what I understood you to be saying—that large companies will still be paying the same rate of tax.




Senator Cormann:
  I said they will not pay any more.




Senator KIM CARR:
  Oh, they will not pay any more? Does that mean they will pay the same rate of tax or that they will not pay any more? I do not recall ever reading a measure in a government's budget papers where they are going to increase the taxes. Is that a new measure you are proposing?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:42):  In an abundance of helpfulness, Senator Carr obviously knows that the policy we went to the last election with was to have a company tax cut of 1.5 per cent to come into effect from 1 July 2015. This was, in effect, offset for Australia's 3,000 largest companies by the 1.5 per cent paid parental leave levy, which means that, in practice for those largest companies, the effective tax rate remained at 30 per cent. That is a matter of public record. Now, what we have said is that we are not proceeding with the paid parental leave scheme that we took to the last election. We have also said that there will be further announcements in the coming weeks and months about a families package, about a jobs package. Of course, that will include all of the detail in terms of how those changes—in particular, the measures to facilitate access to more affordable child care—will be funded and what we have put around all of that. You have asked what we have put around all of that by way of parameters. As was our policy before the election and as is the policy reflected in the budget papers, large companies are not going to pay more in tax than they are paying now. There is that 30 per cent cap which is the same as is reflected in the budget papers right now when you take the 28.5 and the 1.5 together. But the fact that small and medium sized businesses will be at least 1.5 per cent better off is the language the Prime Minister used in his Press Club speech, which I am sure you would have studied in great detail. So this is completely irrelevant to the legislation that is in front of us; but, given that you are trying to mislead the Australian people with some of the verballing and misleading assertions that you have been making, I thought it was important to make that clarification.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-02-10,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (13:44):  It is an assertion that you have made yourselves on page 18 of your budget paper No. 2, and I raised it in the context that the previous Labor government explicitly decoupled the proposition that there would be a link between the taxation rate of companies and the R&D tax credit. That was one of the reforms that we introduced.


Mr Scott Morrison admitted when he made some statements just last week that the Abbott government had left Australian business in limbo. I think that was the word he used: 'in limbo'. Clearly you are trying to extract yourself from the chaotic arrangements that your leader had placed upon you in regard to his changes to the Paid Parental Leave policy and the backflip that he engaged in with that. There is no doubt that there is a flip-flop arrangement when it comes to the taxation policy of the government, and my concern here is what the government has prosecuted through its budget papers: trying to assert that there is a link between the R&D tax incentive scheme and the rate of company tax.


But let me just go to the issue of the arrangements regarding so-called retrospectivity. In the report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee examining the original government bill—that is the $20 billion proposal, as distinct from the revised government bill, since it is quite clear that you are the real owners of this revised amendment, which of course was never flagged anywhere and never discussed prior to the consideration of these matters—the Liberal Party's Senator Bushby argued on page 14 of the report:


Generally, retrospective tax legislation is not desirable and any such legislation should ideally be limited to rare circumstances, such as to correct unintended consequences or to address integrity issues. However, the proposed amendments have been foreshadowed for some time—


by, it was claimed, the previous government.




Senator Cormann:
  That's right—by Labor.




Senator KIM CARR:
  I am quoting directly from the report. This is the argument that was put:


… the previous government introduced a bill in June 2013 which, if passed, would have enacted them.


That is page 14 of the report. Irrespective of the fact that the parliament had been prorogued and that this was a new bill—and, of course, irrespective of the fact that the previous regime was directly tied to the jobs package—I would ask you: where was the $100 million cap foreshadowed by any public announcement or previous legislation by this government? How would such a statement actually satisfy the test that was established in the economics committee report by Senator Bushby?

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:47):  Before we end this debate, I want to have an answer to my question about the impact of taking $1.1 billion out of research and development on smaller and medium enterprises and public institutions like the CSIRO and universities. So I would ask Senator Cormann: will he give an unequivocal guarantee that, if this legislation passes, there will be no negative impact on the research effort of Australian universities—yes or no?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-02-10,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:48):  The best way to boost the capacity of Australian businesses to invest more in research and development is to grow a stronger economy. Over the last 17 to 18 months, the government has worked very hard to strengthen the economy and create more jobs, and of course the results are starting to show. Last year the economy grew by 2.7 per cent, up from 1.9 per cent the year before. We have scrapped the carbon tax. We have scrapped the mining tax. We have finalised three free trade agreements with key economies in the region: China, South Korea and Japan. We are rolling out a record infrastructure investment program. We are pursuing a whole range of measures to boost economic growth and to help Australian businesses be more successful and generate more profits to give them more capacity to employ more Australians and invest more in research and development to facilitate stronger growth into the future.


What we are saying here is that we agree with the former Labor government that it is appropriate in the current circumstances to better target the tax incentives available for research and development. Instead of providing a 133 per cent tax deduction for Australia's most profitable businesses, we are proposing for that to be a 100 per cent tax deduction only. The way we have structured it, in consultation with the crossbench, is to put a $100 million cap on the special benefit available from taxpayers for those businesses making research and development investments. We think that is appropriate, we think that is well balanced and we think that the issue is well understood, and I would urge the Senate to support it.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:50):  I did not ask for a party political broadcast on Liberal Party propaganda. What I asked for was an unequivocal guarantee that the research effort of Australian universities will not suffer—will not actually be cut—because the government has decided to move to take $1.1 billion out of research and development as a result of this legislation. It is a straight-up question. The vice-chancellors, the students, the businesses associated with it and the PhD students all deserve an answer. It is a serious business. You get a university like the University of New South Wales, with 30 per cent of their research effort, they estimate, backed by companies that are directly affected by this bill. Given that that is the fact, they deserve an answer: if this passes, is this going to undermine the dollars available for those research efforts, given an environment where you are cutting back funding to universities?


These are the serious questions the community want answered. You have not learnt anything from the feedback from the community on what they think of the Abbott government if you keep on standing here just going into a party political broadcast. Answer the question: will universities suffer in their research effort—yes or no? Will there be any adverse consequence because you are stopping large corporations investing in research and development by taking that $1.1 billion out? It is a straight-up question: yes or no?

You have not mentioned the word universities. You have not been able to even get near an answer to the question.




Senator Cormann:

Senator KIM CARR:
  You will have your chance. I also asked you a question about the issue of  retrospectivity. The government made assertions in the Senate economics report that there had been announcements and that satisfied the government, in their own minds, that they did not have to worry too much about retrospectivity. I have asked you a specific question: when was the announcement made by the government, regarding the $100 million cap foreshadowed in this amendment before the chamber, which would satisfy the retrospectivity test that you as a government brought to this parliament through the economics committee report?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-02-10,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:53):  The first point I would make is that this measure in this legislation was announced as part of the 2013-14 budget back in May 2013 by the then Gillard Labor government. Now the government has agreed with crossbench senators to delay the start date of the research and development targeting measure to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2014, in order to minimise the risk of the law applying to companies retrospectively because of the delays that Labor has driven against its own savings measure.


Under the original date of effect of 1 July 2013 this measure would have affected income years that may have finished and would therefore raise the risk of companies being required to make an amended tax assessment. By delaying the start date of the measure to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2014 the amendments will only apply to companies—and this is the very important point that you need to listen to—lodging their tax returns from 1 July 2015 onwards. This will provide affected companies with additional time and notice to plan for the changes in the law.


The point here—through you, Chair—is: the Gillard Labor government announced this measure in May 2013 to take effect from 1 July 2013, and it would have impacted on companies lodging tax returns from 1 July 2014. In an abundance of transparency, and taking on board the feedback from the crossbench, we have delayed that by one year, so it is now only due to come into effect in relation to companies lodging their tax returns from 1 July 2015. Now, when I last looked, we are not yet past 1 July 2015; when I last looked 1 July 2015 was still more than four months away. I do not know how Senator Carr, given that this was announced in 2013 and will not come into practical effect until 1 July 2015, could describe it as a retrospective measure in any way, shape or form.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (13:55):  On the basis of what you have just said, you should accept the opposition's amendment. Also, the problem with what you have just said is that you propose that the fact you gave notice on a previous measure ignores the fact that the government has accepted a different measure. We are not actually debating that matter any longer because the government has proposed a fundamentally different proposition.




Senator Cormann:
  That's just not true.




Senator KIM CARR:
  You have—a $100 million cap instead of the $20 billion arrangement. It is a new measure of which no notice has been given, none whatsoever. Minister, is it not a fact that companies get prior approval before they lodge their claims and often before they actually undertake the investment? Is it not a fact, Minister, that the proposition you have just put to this chamber is completely erroneous because some companies such as CSL—an Australian manufacturer that makes vaccines and biopharmaceutical products—undertake strategic investment decisions on the basis of that advice, and that your proposal will in fact change the ground rules retrospectively on the basis of the investment they make? Whether or not they lodge their claim at any point in the future for activity undertaken in the period covered by this new amendment—this new proposition—the $100 million cap will, in fact, come into play irrespective of any other statements you have made. That is the nature of the retrospectivity. Is that the case?

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:57):  It is clear the minister has no intention of standing up and answering the question, so I would like to ask him another one. Which universities did you consult about the impact on their research effort of your taking $1.1 million out of the research and development budget in this country? The University of New South Wales made its submission to the Senate inquiry; which other universities did you consult? Did you consult any? Did you consult the CSIRO? And if you did not consult the CSIRO, why not? They are a central institution in this particular mix. I can see the minister is much more interested in talking to his other colleagues than in answering the question. So, Minister, if you are—

  It is interesting—the government has learned absolutely nothing. They have more important things to do than answer questions about which universities they consulted about the impact on their research efforts of a government amendment to take $1.1 billion out of research and development!


This is exactly why the community is fed up with the current government. You just go back to your rhetoric and dismiss people's concerns as if they are of no consequence because somehow you are born to rule. Let me tell you: you are not born to rule.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:02):  I move:




That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked today.



This is a government in absolute chaos. Not only is this a government that lied its way to power; it is a government that now lies to its own backbench. It is a government that could not lie straight in bed. And here we have Senator Edwards claiming that he had a double victory yesterday. One victory was putting Tony Abbott, the current Prime Minister, back in as the Prime Minister. I think that one might be a bit of a Pyrrhic victory. The other victory, he says, was the victory to get a competitive tendering process for the submarines that this country needs for its defence and its ongoing technological development.


In The Flinders News, we have Senator Edwards saying that he got a competitive tendering process. The article states:


This was enough for Senator Edwards to throw his weight behind the embattled Liberal leader to vote against a leadership spill at Parliament House in Canberra this morning.


I have to tell you, I did not hear anything from Senator Edwards when the announcement was made that they could not build a canoe in the Adelaide shipyards. I did not hear a word out of him for months, until the South Australian public and the Australian public said, 'This is unacceptable. It is not acceptable that our defence industries can be sent overseas because there's been a deal done between the Prime Minister of Australia and the Japanese government.' Jobs were not important then. We never heard a word from Senator Edwards—we did not hear a word from any of the South Australian senators. Questions were asked on this issue time after time after time in this place; then, when Senator Edward suddenly discovered that it was a massive political problem, not only for the government but for himself personally and for the re-election of senators in South Australia, suddenly his job became more important than anything else, and that is when he grew a backbone and started to argue for the job to be done in South Australia.


Then we had the situation with the chaos in this government. Senator Edwards got a phone call from the Prime Minister and said, 'I will support you if you meet your commitment for a tender process in South Australia.' That is how good Senator Edwards is—not very good at all. He was absolutely silent on this issue until his own job came under some pressure. All the coalition are interested in and all the Prime Minister is interested in are their jobs, not the jobs of Australian workers in the shipbuilding industry, nor the jobs, which they just sacrificed, in the car manufacturing industry in this country.


Senator Edwards said that he had:


… scored a big win for South Australia with an assurance from the Prime Minister that the Australian Submarine Corporation and South Australian shipbuilders will be given the opportunity to tender for the Future Submarine contract.


Well, Senator Edwards, you were lied to the same as the Australian public were lied to prior to the election. You should understand that this government cannot be trusted and that this government has no credibility.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Could you tell Senator Cameron—he has been here long enough to know—that you do not talk directly to other senators; every remark should be through you, as Deputy President of the chamber.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I believe the comments were being directed through me, Senator Macdonald, so there is no point of order. But I do remind senators of the standing orders and the need to address the chair.




Senator CAMERON:
  This is a government that lied to the Australian public before the last election, and this is a government that lies to its own backbench. This is a government that cannot be trusted on any issue. They cannot even give proper responses to a backbencher raising an issue. They tell the backbencher that there will be a competitive tender, and then later it is 'a process of competitive evaluation' and now it is 'an opportunity to engage'. This is rubbish coming from the coalition. (Time expired)

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (15:08):  The gall of Labor senators, of Senator Cameron, to come in here in the first week of the new parliamentary year to talk about lies and chaos!



Opposition senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! The Senate needs to come to order.




Senator SMITH:
  I would like to talk about good government for a moment. Last week was an important anniversary. Next week will be an important anniversary. I am just wondering whether colleagues on the Labor side know what those two anniversaries are.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  You don't even know the first anniversary! What about the second anniversary—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Let me remind senators again that—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am actually speaking, Senator Bilyk. I remind senators that they should address the remarks through the chair.




Senator SMITH:
  Mr Deputy President, let me remind you of two important anniversaries. The first is 3 February. You might recall that as the day Fraser called the 1983 election and Hawke replaced Hayden. The second important anniversary is 16 February, the day Mr Hawke gave a very important election speech. It is shameful that a coalition senator should have to educate Labor senators about their own political history. I would like to demonstrate an important point: Labor people themselves are trying to tell Labor senators in this place to perform better. Do not think for one moment that these people on the other side are representative of the views of Labor's former leaders or even of the views of people in the current Labor Party. Let me reflect briefly on what Mr Hawke had to say on 16 February 1983. Talking about the economic situation, Mr Hawke said: 'We'—the federal Labor Party—'will not be able to just spend that way out of the mess. We must work our way out of it together. Australia needs long-term national solutions.' Let us jump ahead to last year and what Bob Hawke said about the performance of Labor senators and the federal Labor opposition. As reported in The Australian newspaper, Mr Hawke said what is required is the same thing as he had to experience. He said: 'It is important to have a Prime Minister and a Treasurer and a competent ministry which understands the issue and is prepared to make hard decisions.' He went on to say: 'We could not go on maintaining the standard of living that we have become accustomed to. Structural adjustments to the economy must happen and spending must be cut across the board.'


Let us look at what Bill Hayden had to say just a few of months ago. He said Labor senators, the federal Labor opposition, needed to establish some economic credibility. He urged federal Labor to be a party that built economic credibility with voters and he stressed the need to reduce the influence of factions and reform the party's internal structures and overhaul its policies to regain government. This is a Labor opposition in the Senate that is not even listening to the informed experience of former Labor leaders Bob Hawke and Bill Hayden.


Let us jump briefly to an important admission that unfortunately was lost over the last two weeks. I do not mind saying that, for a brief moment over the last few weeks, the government lost its focus—and Labor got away with a couple of important things. But you cannot escape how it was reported in the paper. Labor's shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, said, 'Labor doesn't rule out cuts to payments.' Ooh, silence!



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  Didn't you see that, Senator Polley? I will send it to you.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  Oh, you did see it?




Senator Bilyk:
  Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: the senator should actually call me by the correct name if he wants to try and insult me.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-02-10,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:14):  This is a government of chaos and this is a government that cannot be trusted. That has been proven by the Prime Minister's own admission today when he said, 'Good government starts today.' Well, what have we been living with for the last 500 or so days? We have been living with a bad government. The fact is that another broken promise has been made by the Prime Minister today, and that is: good government does not start today; it is the same bad government because it has the same bad policies. It is only going to be a matter of time before those in revolt on the backbench in government realise that nothing has changed—that it is the same old bad government that Australia has been putting up with for the last 16 months. And why? Because it has the same bad policies.


It is not going to take long, I believe, for the backbench to start figuring that out—so much so that Julie Bishop has declined to say how she actually voted yesterday in the spill motion. We know she is keeping her leadership options open. On top of that, we know that Malcolm Turnbull is keeping his leadership options open—so much so that he gave a very fine, some would say, leadership speech, just at the end of last month, in the US. It was a leadership speech where he articulated what leaders should be—what a leader of a country should be, no doubt. 'Leaders must be decision makers,' he said. 'It is vitally important,' he said, 'that, as a matter of social justice and political reality, structural changes are seen to be fair across the board.' That sounds to me a bit like a pitch from someone vying for the top job. We know how far Mr Turnbull will go to get that top job. In recent reports he said he would sell out on climate change, his No. 1 policy issue—the policy issue on which he said, 'I want to be leader, if I have a team that is committed to climate change.' But, when it comes to the top job, if that is what it takes—selling out on his principles and his conviction—he will let the issue of climate change go.


And we know that Julie Bishop is in a similar vein. You have Julie Bishop, Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott—three leaders: one currently in place as Prime Minister and trying to convince his colleagues that his good government starts today, and the other two waiting in the wings.


But what has not changed through all of this? It really does not matter which one of these three will be leader at any point in time during the term of this government; it does not matter about the leadership of this government, because what is bad about it is: its policies, which continue to hurt Australians. And we know that Julie Bishop and Malcolm Turnbull have supported those policies. They have supported cuts to pensions, cuts to family payments, a GP tax, $100,000 university degrees, and cutting pay to Defence personnel. They have supported, with Tony Abbott, this government's agenda. And that is why it does not matter which one of them becomes leader in the future.


Australians are aware of this. Australians are aware that they are living under the regime of a bad government, and they are also becoming increasingly aware that the only way to get rid of these bad policies is to change the government. And that day cannot come soon enough, because Australian people deserve fairness. The Australian ethos of a fair go has been lost under this government. Those on the backbench of this government know that; that is why they revolted yesterday. That is why the spill motion came on.


But Tony Abbott came in today and said, 'Good government starts today.' His own admission, therefore, is that he has been leading a bad government—a bad government with bad policies that hurt all Australians.


Labor stands for the complete opposite of that. We stand for fairness. We stand for compassion. We stand for equality. And we stand for social justice. That is what a Labor government will deliver—unlike this mean-hearted coalition government that continues to hurt all Australians.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (15:19):  I find this concerning about senators such as Senator Singh and Senator Cameron: where is their memory? Senator Singh was talking about action on climate change. Mr Deputy President, correct me if I am wrong, but there was a Prime Minister called Mr Kevin Rudd and he said that the greatest moral challenge of our time was to act on climate change, and so he went to bring in an emissions trading scheme. Then people realised that they did not understand it, first of all, and then that it was a monster tax on everything: that every time you plugged an electrical item into a power point you started paying it. In fact, it was the highest price in the world. It drove out jobs, shut down manufacturing and processing, shifted our cement industry overseas and affected our motor vehicle industry. And these people talk about jobs! They talk about policies!


Turning to Senator Cameron, perhaps he does not remember the run-up to the 2010 election—it is probably a long time back for Senator Cameron to remember; he may not remember back that far—but the point was that the Prime Minister at the time, their leader, was called Miss Julia Gillard, and she said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Then I noticed that, because the Greens were the dominant force in that political agreement between the Gillard Labor government and were driving the agenda, Senator Cameron and others just kowtowed to their requests. I actually saw them in here voting for a carbon tax. Senator Abetz, you remember it, I am sure—




Senator Abetz:
  I remember.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  and so would Senator Bushby. Those opposite voted for it. They said we were never going to have it, but the Greens were dominating their whole government policy. And of course they want to forget that. It was about $9 billion, growing each year, that carbon tax. Thank goodness it has gone.


Here is the thing I find amazing when we talk about policies. I want to refer to two things. Mr Deputy President Marshall, I do not know how you drive your car—and I am sure you are a very good driver of your motor vehicle—but one thing is for sure: I am sure you do not have one foot pushing down on the accelerator and one foot pushing down on the brake, both at the same time. That would be strange. But I remember that, back in 2009, the Reserve Bank was raising interest rates to slow the economy, while the Labor Party in government was borrowing money and spending it to stimulate the economy. How crazy is that! And what are we left with? We are left with this great big debt. And it is getting very serious.


Mr Deputy President, you would be well aware that a man I respect enormously, Mr Glenn Stevens, the Reserve Bank governor, addressed cabinet just recently and said: 'You are facing serious financial problems.' And he is correct. We are borrowing $110 million a day and spending some $40 million a day to pay the interest.




Senator Conroy:
  You're an economic fraud.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I will take the interjection because this is not a laughing matter—it is about how we leave our finances for the future generations of this country. You probably do not care about being an economic wrecker; you are just a political thug with the Shor-Con faction, doing whatever you wish to do. In the First World War my grandfather was over there with Senator Conroy's relatives helping them out. My late father was a rear gunner in a Lancaster bomber, over there in Senator Conroy's former country, helping them out. I see and I read about what our ancestors did to build this country. Those opposite want to leave our future generations wallowing in debt.




Senator Conroy:
  You are a typical National Party economic illiterate.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Senator Conroy, your judgement of the economy is about as good as your judgement of football teams—absolutely hopeless. I want to put that point on the record. We have a serious problem. I said to one of the Labor senators prior to the last election that, no matter who won government, there would be serious financial problems with the budget. I do not know why those opposite in the Labor Party, who proposed some $5½ billion of savings when they were in government, are now opposing our bringing those savings in. Why are they doing that? Are they here just to disrupt? Are they here to mortgage our children's future? I ask the crossbenchers: if the budget is not brought into some sort of respect—




Senator Conroy:
  You are not going to have a surplus beyond 2019.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  You were going to give us a surplus. Wayne Maxwell Swan was going to give us a budget surplus. You never even got close. The last time you had a surplus was 1989—you would still have been in primary school. Don't come in here talking about budget surpluses—you do not even understand what they are. If we do not get the books right and the balances right, the future of our children will be a future of higher taxes. (Time expired)

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:24):  Senator Abetz said that the government is committed to the best value for the taxpayer in respect of the project to build, sustain and maintain Australia's future submarines. I think that is a slight movement away from previous governments that have accepted that there may well be a premium associated with building ships and submarines in Australia—it was in the Australian National Audit Office report, which set out that previous governments had accepted that. We then go to the famous election promise, that the submarines would be built right here in Australia, in Adelaide. This government has prevaricated and shifted ground, until we arrive at today where it is reported that the coalition position in respect of submarine building in Adelaide is 'as clear as mud.' That is what has been reported—it is as clear as mud.




Senator Abetz:
  Where was that reported?




Senator GALLACHER:
  That was reported in InDaily, which is an internet publication in Adelaide.




Senator Abetz:
  Ha, ha, ha!




Senator GALLACHER:
  Well you may laugh, but you have to understand that you cannot move in South Australia without being approached about this issue. It is a deeply felt issue. Have a look at the result in the electorate of Fisher—an unprecedented Labor victory there. In the seat of Davenport—and this is what is sending the shivers up the spines of some people in Adelaide—it was a 58-42 Liberal-held seat, handed down from father to son. It is now 53-47—they are a mere 1,700 votes from losing one of the jewels in the Liberal crown in the State parliament. I do not take much notice of polls—I am sure those on the other side are having a casual look—but Newspoll says the figures are 59-41. That brings a lot of Liberal seats into play. The predominant issues in both Fisher and Davenport were the economy, jobs and submarines. Senator Edwards is probably not the only one who has come late to this issue, and he is now ardently supporting the building, sustaining and maintaining of defence ships, submarines and whatever else we can to offset the dastardly decision on car manufacturing. This issue will not go away. 


Coincidentally, I think there are 11 Liberal members of the coalition government in South Australia. It seems a little unusual that Senator Edwards was able to give a commitment from the Prime Minister that there will be a competitive tender and then the party vote was brought forward—we know that the party vote was 39 to 61. Was there something untoward at play there? I do not know and I do not really care, but the public will draw their own conclusions if Senator Edwards has been set up and then torn down the next day from competitive tender to competitive evaluation. One reader said it was 'psychobabble and confragulation.' I did look up 'confragulation' in the dictionary but I could not find it, but if that is what people are saying about your minister's press conference today, surrounded by concerned Liberal MPs—concerned for the future of South Australia and for the future of the South Australia economy but also concerned about their own survival—then things to be looked at.


I think this will play out down the track, all the way to the next election. You will be judged on how you have acted. You have made policy on the run today. You have made a confused but hopeful public more confused and less hopeful, especially when your minister's appalling performance today could best be summed up as 'clear as mud'—do not take it from me but read the paper. Senator Edwards has also been undressed—set up, undressed and let down really shabbily. South Australia deserves better. (Time expired)

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator FIFIELD:
  The designations of national parks is wholly a matter for state governments and the Greens need to stop wasting the Senate's time with matters that are outside the Australian government's jurisdiction, particularly for areas that are already afforded the highest level of protection under national environmental law. In fact, the Greater Blue Mountains area was listed as a World Heritage property in 2000 and contains the Gardens of Stone referred to by the Greens motion. Any proposed development that is likely to have a significant impact on the outstanding universal value of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage area must be assessed under the EPBC Act. In fact, Cullen Valley Mine, which was subject to the Planning Assessment Commission report, was referred to the Minister for the Environment for assessment in January 2015. This will be considered within the strict requirements of national environmental law. The Australian government will continue to focus on issues within its jurisdiction instead of interfering with state governments.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-02-10,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:03):  I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


The need for Minister Hunt to suspend the approval for the Maules Creek coal mine on the New South Wales Liverpool Plains and to act immediately to prevent further land clearing, due to commence on 15 February 2015, of critically endangered vegetation in Leard State Forest.


I rise this afternoon to call on the federal Minister for the Environment, Mr Hunt, to immediately stop the Maules Creek Coalmine in New South Wales. The date of 15 February marks what will be an act of ecological vandalism and economic stupidity. It is of national significance as we have in New South Wales Whitehaven Coal, with the full blessing of New South Wales Premier Mike Baird and the Leader of the Opposition, Luke Foley, together with Prime Minister Abbott, Mr Shorten and no doubt Mr Turnbull—the whole lot of them—keen to recommence smashing down the critically endangered white box gum in Leard State Forest and to destroy the habitat of at least 396 species of plants and animals, including owls, koalas, birds, bats and parrots. Of course, the bat species are renowned in that particular area. Of those species, 34 are threatened species, including three that are critically endangered. The number is so high because they are dependent on the box gum woodland, of which only 0.1 per cent survives nationally. I will  say that again: only 0.1 per cent of this vegetation type survives nationally. Yet the Premier of New South Wales, the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales—the Labor Party—think it is fine to go and smash down that remnant vegetation.


The Department of Premier and Cabinet in New South Wales has recognised this forest as having irreplaceable, ecologically unique values. But it took a land and environment court case to stop winter clearing. But now they are about to start again. I have heard endlessly from the Prime Minister and Treasurer Hockey that we must not be stealing from future generations. If there is one thing that they are stealing from future generations it is critically endangered habitat, plants and animals, and of course a safe climate.


It is hard to believe the stupidity, the backwardness, the ignorance of knocking down the Leard State Forest to build a coalmine in an age of global warming, when the coal should be staying in the ground. That is the fact of the matter. That coal needs to stay in the ground. We cannot afford to burn that coal because of the climate. Yet we have got this ridiculous situation where we are going to lose this critically endangered vegetation. We will lose sites that are of cultural significance to the Gomeroi people. We will see precious water resources all wasted and all to facilitate what has been a corruptly approved—I say that again, 'corruptly approved'—Whitehaven coalmine. It is likely to be not only an ecological disaster but also an economic disaster.


The only thing that is standing behind future generations actually being able to enjoy this forest, ensuring that this threatened vegetation community—and the plants and animals that it supports—can remain and that is preventing this intergenerational theft is the community.


Today, I really want to pay respect and give absolute encouragement to people who have been prepared to stand there in Maules Creek and put themselves on the line. They have done that. More than 250 people have been arrested there. We have alliances like the Leard State Forest alliance and the Front Line Action on Coal out there. We have had all the conservation groups out there. We have had incredible support from people as varied as Bill Ryan, who is 92 years old and a veteran of the Kokoda Trail; Cliff Wallace, who is a property owner there, who has facilitated and helped the protesters make the stand that they have; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lead author Colin Butler, who was arrested there; and of course former Wallabies captain David Pocock was arrested as well. All of these people have made a major stand for the forest, the environment, the climate and against corruption. We will see more of those people putting their lives on the line this weekend and calling out the Baird government in New South Wales and the Abbott government federally, because all of this should not be happening, because it was all corruptly approved. 


Now we find that Whitehaven is trying to squirm out of even the minimal biodiversity corridor, saying it presents:


… a material risk to the project's success …


And the company cannot accept it. This is how marginal the coalmine is. They are saying that they cannot even meet the minimal biodiversity corridor, because it jeopardises the project. The fact is that the project is jeopardised anyway because there has been a complete collapse in the coal price globally and that is going to continue. There is a structural change here and it is not going to recover. We are going to see the stupidity of smashing down the Leard State Forest to put in a coalmine which will never be viable. 


This is a disgrace in a country like ours. People pride themselves in Australia. They look at other countries and say, 'Look at the corruption that goes on there,' and they never recognise that the corruption goes on here just as much. In fact, it has been even worse in New South Wales. I want to go to that in terms of the offsets, and my colleague Senator Waters will talk about this a bit later. The offsets never, ever offset the critical vegetation type and yet the mine was approved. I make the point that it was former Labor Party environment minister Tony Burke who approved it, but they are up to their neck in it in New South Wales and the approval by the Liberals. 


There should have been a judicial inquiry. When ICAC got right into what happened, they found that Nathan Tinkler was central to a series of corrupt dealings in New South Wales and that it involved this mine. There were political donations to the Liberal and National Parties and there has never been a proper investigation into what actually went on. It is totally disgraceful. You cannot believe that, in this day and age, this mine was not stopped the minute they found out that it had been corruptly approved. There were a whole series of events: donations went from Aston Resources, Boardwalk Resources, Chris Hartcher and the Free Enterprise Foundation eventually to the New South Wales Liberal Party and then the ministers in New South Wales assisted in various approvals. What sort of corrupt behaviour is that? Now a whole community has to fight for their land, for their water, for biodiversity and for their forest. Why should they have to do that? 


It is even more shocking that a former leader of the National Party and former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Mark Vaile, is the chair of Whitehaven Coal. This really sends an appalling signal to people around the country: get yourself involved in corrupt dealings, hand over the cash in back rooms to make prohibited donations, get it through things like the Free Enterprise Foundation, absolutely hide it from the public gaze, get it through to the Liberal Party and you will get it back in approvals. 


The Labor Party is not exempt from this, as the Obeid cases in New South Wales show. This should have been stopped. It should have been stopped by a proper judicial inquiry. The corruption goes on to this day. The fact that Mike Baird, the Premier of New South Wales, could stand there last week opening this mine and saying what a great thing it is shows you the extent to which corruption has seeped into the body politic of New South Wales. 


The Greens are going to stand with that community. The Greens are going to stand with everyone in New South Wales who turns out in Maules Creek to stop the destruction of the Leard forest, the logging that will start there and the bulldozing of that forest as it continues, because the people there deserve to have decent, democratic representation that is honest and transparent, not corrupt. We, along with the next generations, have to do what we can to save the critically endangered species that the Leard forest contains. If Minister Hunt was really a Minister for the Environment he would step in and say now that he will not be a party to final federal approval of the plan that will see Whitehaven go broke after having destroyed the environment. 


I wish the very best of luck to everyone who turns out this weekend to stop this destruction. We stand with you and we will articulate this in the Senate.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-02-10,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (16:14):  I thank Senator Milne for her New South Wales campaign speech, which appears to be what we just heard, with a whole bunch of allegations about approvals processes or what may have transpired in relation to processes completely within the control and domain of the New South Wales government. The motion that she has moved, which is before the Senate, relates particularly to calling on Minister Hunt to suspend this mine. His powers purely exist within the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Matters you want to talk about as to processes in New South Wales—whose donations went to who, the Obeid family or any of those matters—are completely irrelevant under that act. All Minister Hunt or any minister of the Crown would be doing were they to take those matters into consideration would be to expose the Commonwealth to the risk of litigation and compensation. That is what you seem to be calling upon Minister Hunt to do.


I look forward to the contributions to this debate from those in the Labor Party. The reality is that the Maules Creek mine has been assessed and approved in appropriate terms under the EPBC Act, under our national environmental laws. It was under those opposite that these approvals were granted. The member for Watson, Mr Burke, was the responsible minister for the approvals. So I look forward to their contributions in this debate and I trust that they will be reflective of the decisions that were taken at the time, reflective of the fact that Commonwealth law—the EPBC Act—has boundaries about what is assessed and considered. You can shake your head all you want, Senator Milne, but that is the reality of the situation. The EPBC Act is about environmental assessments,  limited to matters of national environmental significance—



Senator Milne interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  And I know that you actually know this, Senator Milne, and I know that you are not a fool on these matters. I know that you do actually understand the EPBC Act and its limitations, and I appreciate that you are just coming in here to create a political debate and a political situation around this issue. That is fine. Everybody is allowed, in the run-up to state elections, to decide in the states chamber to run their campaigns for their state causes, and clearly that is what you are going to do.


The Maules Creek mine is subject to 40 conditions, and it is the expectation that conditions would be met, as it is the expectation for any EPBC approval that occurs. But it is also the expectation of this government that, when approvals through a legal process are given, whether they are approvals that we have made or approvals that our predecessors made, those approvals will then stand under the law of the land. That is just as, when we came to office, if there were contracts in place that had been entered into by the previous government, much as we might sometimes have disagreed with those contracts, we of course sought to honour those contracts. If there are legal approvals in place, we honour those legal approvals, because to do otherwise would be to expose the Commonwealth, the taxpayer, to risks of litigation and compensation.


At its heart, we know that the Greens, if they had their way, would stop all coalmining in Australia. They would stop all gas extraction in Australia. They would be making sure that all of those sorts of resources projects simply ground to a halt. That is fine. That is their political philosophy and that is what they are entitled to campaign for, but they might as well be honest about that: it would not matter what the circumstances of this mine were, they would campaign to have it stopped. They argue in these debates that we should be stopping it from occurring because of a collapse in the coal price. Once again, I draw the Greens back to the terms of the EPBC Act. The price of coal is not a relevant consideration; it is the impacts on matters of national environmental significance that are absolutely appropriate considerations.


It is a condition of the approval of this project, a condition imposed by the member for Watson, Mr Burke, the former Labor minister for the environment, that a biodiversity corridor plan to protect and maintain a new biodiversity corridor adjacent to the mine occur; that offsets of nearly 10,000 hectares must be obtained for the threatened Regent honeyeater, the Swift parrot and the greater long-eared bat; and that 5,500 hectares of offsets must be secured for ecological communities. These conditions are in place and we expect them to be applied and implemented. Equally, as a government, we expect that we abide by the terms of the legislation passed by this parliament. 


Since the EPBC Act came into force in the year 2000, projects around Australia have been subject to what are robust and comprehensive assessments, some of the best in the world. Over the last 14 years the act has been successfully implemented by governments of both persuasions, maintaining good standards, maintaining appropriate standards but of course also facilitating development. What we do not want to do as a government—and what I would hope those opposite, as an alternative government, would not want to do—is shift the goalposts, create business uncertainty, add to costs, create an environment where there is a risk that approvals, once given, may, because of political pressure, be withdrawn, because that would be a very damaging environment for investment in Australia and it would be a situation where there is a real threat to jobs and to security and to our economic wellbeing. As I said before, the Greens would happily shut down not just this mine but coalmines right around the country. I am sure they would live with the economic consequences that would have—the significant job losses and the significant loss of export income that would occur. That is not the way of this government. I do not believe that is the way of those opposite, although sometimes it is hard to tell from their approach and their relationship with the Australian Greens.


Those opposite can try to defend the Obeids and some of what has occurred in New South Wales if they want to. They can choose, if they want to, to respond to Senator Milne's allegations of corruption being at the heart of approvals. But it is important to note that, when Senator Milne stands here and says, 'This mine was corruptly approved,' I assume she was talking about the New South Wales government. I would be very concerned, Senator Milne, if you were making any reflections on a member of our government or, frankly, on Mr Burke or a member of the previous government, about whom I am not aware of any allegations of wrongdoing in relation to this mine. At the Commonwealth level—




Senator Rhiannon:
  The laws are already so weak, Senator Birmingham; you know that. That is why you can get away with it. You call it legal, but it is not.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I am not sure who you are making an allegation against there, Senator Rhiannon—




Senator Rhiannon:
  At the state laws.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  At the state laws? You are in the Commonwealth parliament now, Senator Rhiannon. You might not remember that you made that change! You might have forgotten that you changed from the New South Wales parliament to the federal parliament; but, here, we have to work with the federal laws. Here, we are confined by those federal laws.



Senator Rhiannon interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(

):  Senator Birmingham has the right to be heard in silence. Please continue, Senator Birmingham.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Here, we have to work within the Constitution, within the limits of federal power, and the ministers of the day exercise their powers in accordance with the legislation passed by this parliament—this parliament. You can exercise your right to campaign against this mine in New South Wales. You can make whatever allegations you want to make about New South Wales governments, past or present, if you so choose. But in this place we have to deal with federal laws, and in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 we have a law that has been appropriately applied, where the public servants and the ministers of the day have acted within the terms of the law—and this mine has those approvals. We will uphold those approvals, subject to the conditions in place, because as a government we believe in providing certainty to businesses who go through our legal processes.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (16:24):  I am pleased to rise today to speak on this urgency motion. We in the Labor Party are very concerned about the impacts of development on our environment. I am a member who lives on the Central Coast, which was a hot spot for many of the shenanigans—which I think might be an appropriate term to describe the way in which the Liberal Party raised funds in the lead-up to the last election—that have been the subject of considerable discussion at ICAC. As a person from New South Wales who lives in an area where the heartbeat of that plan to redirect funds was exercised I am very aware and very concerned about the influence of inappropriate donations and their impact on how development proceeds in New South Wales. But let us be clear: we the Labor Party share the concerns of others in this chamber that mining operations minimise their impact on the environment and on communities, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


With reckless disregard, the Abbott government is pushing ahead with its move to hand over environmental approval powers to state and local governments. This is the key in any debate about environmental approvals and about the protection of our environment generally. This government—a government that has been governing badly for 520 days that is now, as expressed by the Prime Minister yesterday, attempting 'good government'—would happily allow state and local governments to approve developments on a mighty scale in some of Australia's most iconic environmental and agricultural assets. 


On the Abbott government's watch, we will have Colin Barnett in charge of the Ningaloo Reef and Will Hodgman and his 'cut it down' government in charge of Tasmania's iconic World Heritage listed forests. But this government's approach goes beyond pro-development state governments. It provides the ability for these same state governments to accredit local government to undertake critical assessment and approval processes. This is a matter of great concern. It should be a matter of great concern to every Australian. This government is presiding over a period of devolution of responsibility that puts at risk not just the piece of land nominated for discussion by the Greens this afternoon but also the entire country. This is a government intent on allowing the states to approve anything anywhere, without limitation. That is worrying. 


The states are planning on further diluting accountability by putting local government in charge of Australia's major natural assets. We know the real work of delegating approval powers is being done in the bilateral agreements that this government is making with the states; and one of Labor's concerns about this is the lack of quality and consistency in the processes with the states. Under the Abbott government's approach, World Heritage sites and species protected under international treaties will be put in the hands of state and local governments. I keep repeating it because it is hard to believe that there could be a government so intent on abrogating its national responsibilities. 


Labor will steadfastly oppose this approach. We continue to support streamlining environmental assessment processes for major projects, but final approval on matters of national environmental significance should remain with the national government. Labor began negotiations with the states to establish agreements to reduce regulatory doubling-up in 2012. Through those negotiations, it became clear that some states could not be trusted with Australia's unique environment. The Australian government has the responsibility of protecting Australia's precious environment, and the EPBC Act, in particular, accounts for matters of national environmental significance.


The Abbott government has no interest in protecting Australia's environment for the future. Since coming to government, Tony Abbott and Greg Hunt have made bad decision upon bad decision that have clearly hurt our environment, and have ignored the community. This government simply has no credibility when it comes to the environment. Its record makes one ask why ministers for the environment have not gone the way of ministers for science, because clearly the government is ignoring the realities. The record, so far, of the 529 days of 'bad government' is simply astounding, ranging from moving backwards on climate change to risking our reputation for outstanding World Heritage icons.


Soon after coming to office, the Abbott government began rushing through environmental approvals that included the Abbot Point coal terminal on the Great Barrier Reef.


Let me tell you that in my public encounters I have had conversations with young people, including a person as young as four, who presented me with a picture of her concern about what Tony Abbott was planning to do at Abbot Point. The risk to the environment that this government presents is so evident that a four-year-old can come and lobby a federal politician on the issue. That is how clear its abrogation of responsibility is. This is the government that disallowed the endangered community listing of the River Murray from the Darling to the sea. This is the government that went against all reason and all advice and sneakily had the world's largest marine reserve system re-proclaimed to undo the management plans that gave it effect. The government has begun a process of handing over environmental approval powers to the state, as I said. It has given Colin Barnett the keys to Ningaloo marine reserve and Will Hodgman control of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area—as if these great, iconic environmental assets belong only to one state, or even down to a local government level. They belong to every Australian. We are a Commonwealth, a federation of states, and the national responsibility is the responsibility of the national government. This government has all but abandoned efforts to have Queensland's Cape York added to the World Heritage List.


But it does not end there. The government has disenfranchised communities across Australia by ripping Commonwealth funding from the Environmental Defenders Offices, which means that those who have a concern about environmental approvals will no longer have the capacity to protect the places they love and to contest decisions. Not only the Environmental Defenders Offices but legal aid, women's legal services, and welfare rights and community legal centres all agree that this wicked slashing of federal government funding has hit them hard. Access to justice for people who wish to use the law to stand up for and protect their environment will be effectively lost when the EDOs have to close. For this government, that is what it considers a good outcome. That is the great shame of witnessing in this place every day the stripping away of the capacity of Australians to fundamentally protect the things that are of value to us.


Defending the environment and defending community amenity and cultural heritage will simply become unaffordable for many Australians, as the local EDO has often been the only place many people could afford to go for expert legal advice on complex matters of public interest with regard to environmental law. The government's ridiculous decision to remove funding from environmental legal centres will expose communities to damaging developments and reduce scrutiny, particularly on the very powerful and cashed-up mining industry.


The government has taken us backwards on climate change by repealing the carbon price in favour of a taxpayer funded, dressed-up slush fund that certainly will not work. Tony Abbott abolished the Climate Commission, which was established to provide public information on the effects of and potential solutions to global warming. The government also wants to axe the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, the Climate Change Authority, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the renewable energy target—all that blood on its hands.


The government approached the World Heritage Committee to delist 74,000 hectares of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. This embarrassing application was dismissed out of hand by the World Heritage Committee. The government ripped nearly half a billion dollars out of Landcare, taking money away from landholders and local communities to run its Green Army program instead. The government has the National Water Commission in its sights, with plans for its abolition for a small budget saving at a time when water management in Australia is at dangerous risk of backsliding.


The government has been entrusted with one of the great honours of public life: to protect and promote Australia's magnificent natural assets. The problem with this government is that it has no mindset for the environment. (Time expired)

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2015-02-10,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (16:34):  I rise to speak on the matter of urgency, regarding the approval of a 13-megaton coalmine in the middle of a critically endangered forest. Sadly, the approval was given at the federal level by the former Labor government and it was given at the state level by the state Liberal government—and I will have more to say about that in the course of my short contribution.


I want to focus on the farce that was the granting of this approval, in particular the granting of the approval on the promise of this critically endangered woodland being protected elsewhere, when the company lied about finding appropriate offsets. Subsequent independent investigations revealed that the company's purported offset was in fact 95 per cent an entirely different ecosystem. Somehow, the federal Department of the Environment had not realised that until they had already issued the approval. To their credit, they then commenced an investigation, which demonstrated that, indeed, the offsets were mis-described—in my view, proving that the company had used false and misleading information in order to gain an approval. That is a prosecutable offence. Instead, we saw an investigation that rolled on for months and months and, ultimately, was dropped. That left us with a situation of a mega-coalmine approved in the middle of a forest with critically endangered woodland and endangered species, with an offsets plan that was totally inadequate and that, two years down the track, is still not finalised. This company has an approval to destroy critically endangered woodland, of which there is 0.1 per cent left in this entire country, and it still has not worked out where it is going to find replacement vegetation. If that does not make an entire mockery of our environmental legal system, I do not know what does.


Of course, we saw one of the activists involved in trying to protect this forest, Jonathan Moylan, issue a fake press release which caused a temporary dip in the share price of the bank that was proposing to fund this mine. He had the book thrown at him and was subjected to charges which would have borne a 10-year penalty. Thankfully, he got off, but it highlights the difference of approach between a company which has provided false information to get an approval and then has the investigation dropped and an activist who was faced with a potential 10 years in jail.


The other point I want to talk about is the fact that the bulldozers are about to go in. On 15 February, this coming weekend, this company, which two years on still has not finalised its offsets plan and still has not finalised where the biodiversity corridor that the conditions require it to identify and protect is going to go, is going to send the bulldozers in with all of these question marks still hanging over the entire approval.


There are question marks about the company's financial state as well, so I am worried that we might see a situation where this endangered woodland gets cleared and then the mine does not even get up at all. I would love for the mine not to happen; but for the trees to be cleared and the company then fall over would be an absolute travesty. We have got to see the minister step in and pause this approval—I think he should revoke it entirely—protect the climate from this 13-megatonne coalmine and protect those 500-plus hectares of critically endangered woodland. That is what we are calling on Minister Hunt to do.


I was very interested that Senator Birmingham said he has got confidence in the enforcement of the 40 conditions that were placed on this coalmine. It is great that he has got confidence; sadly, the federal environment department's staff have been slashed under his government's administration, so I do not have confidence that they have the people to enforce the conditions. But it is a very interesting comment for him to make given that that the company is now seeking to weaken those very conditions. Senator Birmingham said that his government would uphold the approvals, subject to the conditions in place. We will hold him to that. We will not allow this company to get in the back door and try and weaken the conditions about where the biodiversity corridor should go. So I thank Senator Birmingham for a perhaps offhand remark that we intend to hold him to and ensure that those conditions are indeed enforced. What a mockery it is for this megacoalmine to be approved right when the cost of thermal coal has halved in the last three years. This mine is not financial. It is going to have an absolutely atrocious effect on the climate. It would pump out 30 million tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of New Zealand's entire energy sector—massive climate disaster, massive biodiversity disaster. Minister Hunt needs to step in and act like an environment minister and stop this. (Time expired)

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2015-02-10,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:39):  I have had the pleasure of sitting in the chamber on whip's duty and I must say I am amazed by some of the comments that have come from the Greens in particular. The Maules Creek Whitehaven coalmine is a project that has been talked about for some time. It was approved in accordance with environmental law. As we mentioned, it was approved by the member for Watson, the Hon Tony Burke, who was the responsible minister when the Labor Party was in government. The mine is subject to appropriate conditions—some 40 of them—which Senator Waters seems to think are a waste of time. These conditions have been put in place by a robust planning process, including the preparation of a biodiversity corridor. I note that the senator, in her contribution, said the offsets plan was a complete waste of time. But when you consider that we are talking about 550 hectares being affected by this particular project, and that the offsets that have been proposed are nearly 10,000 hectares, even if there was some level of error in the offsets you would have to question whether the senator is not just going to pick on anything that she can possibly get her hands on to complain about—because she and the Greens do not like any mines whatsoever.


This government, like those opposite when they were in government, obviously understands that you have to run a country on a number of bases. You cannot just run a country thinking that the environmental considerations are above and beyond all other considerations that take place. We understand that we have to have a robust economy. We understand that we have to have social things in place. We understand that we have to have a multifaceted economy—because there are lots of different things that happen in Australia, not just the environment. Therefore, the responsible approach to these things is to accept that there are some things that are going to have to occur that may actually require a tree to be cut down or a whole to be dug. So what I would say to the Greens, who have come in here today and had a lovely little grandstand about this mine—and I am sure they will continue to grandstand about every project that they do not like—is that I do not think anybody in this place is disputing the fact that this mine will have an environmental impact. But what we have to understand is that, right now, we do not have the capacity in this country to have an entirely clean option for our energy. We do not have the capacity at the moment to deal with baseload power from clean energy sources.


You often hear those up in the top corner of this chamber, in the area where the Greens sit, carrying on about the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and refusing to allow the government to pursue its economic agenda to get the budget back in shape. But all we seem to have seen is a lot of wind farms being approved by these kinds of organisations. If, instead, we had started to invest in things like how we are going to store some of this clean energy that we purportedly will need into the future, then maybe we could be arguing that perhaps we do not need to pursue coal. But, right now, the Australian community has no choice whatsoever but to continue to use fossil fuels for the delivery of energy in this country. I think it is a bit rich for us to suggest that this mine, and every other coalmine—which the Greens hate so terribly much—needs to disappear. I would be really surprised if every one of the 10 Greens who sit down at the other and of the chamber does not use a significant amount of energy; and, given that we do not have the capacity to provide baseload power without fossil fuels, I am not quite sure how they intend to turn the light on in the morning or use their electric toothbrush.


One thing that annoys me more than anything else in these sorts of debates is the outrageous comments that come out. When Senator Milne opened this debate this morning, she commented that the whole approval process had been corrupt.


Not once in her contribution did Senator Milne actually describe in any detail what evidence she had that would be the basis of 'corruption'.


She also said that this mine will never be viable. I am not quite sure where Senator Milne got her evidence to suggest that the mine would never be viable. I accept the comments that Senator Waters made that the price of coal has dropped. There is no question that, at the moment, the resource sector is in a very depressed state. But, unless Senator Milne has some sort of crystal ball and can see into the future and tell us what the prices of these fuels are going to be in the future—and I would be delighted if you were able to, Senator Milne—unfortunately, I do not think that we have any evidence. Senator Rhiannon, when she gets up to make her contribution to this debate, may well be able to provide us with the evidence of this specifically 'corrupt' behaviour that Senator Milne refers to, and also the evidence for this mine—and I quote from Senator Milne—never being viable.


So what I would say is that it seems a little rich that senators come in here and carry on in this sort of way. I was quite astounded, actually, during the discovery of formal business today, to hear Senator Waters get up and ask to make a one-minute statement after Senator O'Sullivan had put a motion before this place and to hear her being critical of Senator O'Sullivan 'wasting the Senate's time on business motions'. I thought, 'My golly gosh! I have never seen any party waste more of the Senate's time on motions that have no relevance apart from giving them the opportunity to grandstand about something that is factual. I'm surprised they don't come in here and move a motion that the sun's going to come up tomorrow morning!'


As to this sanctimonious and hypocritical rubbish that we hear from the other end of the chamber, I am quite happy to have a sensible and reasonable debate about the clean energy future that I think this country deserves; I am more than happy to have that debate. I am more than happy to sit down and work through the relevant committees. I am the chair of a standing committee on the environment. I am happy to sit there and work through what the options are so that we can get Australia to the position we want, where we have the cleanest possible future when it comes to energy. But to just say that everything and anything that is on the ground at the moment that burns any fossil fuel element whatsoever should not go ahead is just absolutely ridiculous.


But the thing that probably annoys me more than anything else is that we have crocodile tears in here for the farmers. If the Greens were really genuinely interested in looking after Australia's farmers, what they would do is to start to support some of the initiatives that we put in place to enable our farmers to be more profitable and more competitive on the economic stage, and to support us in some of our trade activities to make sure that Australian businesses are competitive, instead of continuing to put more and more compliance and regulatory burdens on them, duplicating the things that they have to do. I think that, if you were genuinely interested in the future of Australia's farmers, then you would not be in here carrying on about—




Senator Waters:
  About coal-seam gas?




Senator RUSTON:
  The fact of the matter is that in Australia we do rely on energy. There is no question about it: we rely on energy. And, sadly, if we want to have energy, we have to produce it. So, for those people who obviously do not like this mine—and I understand that there are quite a number of them where the mine is being located who have some concerns; I also understand that there are quite a number of them who come down from Sydney who don't like it either—the fact of the matter is that New South Wales actually imports the majority of its energy from Queensland. So there is this whole nimby idea: 'Not in my backyard'. We are quite happy for the Queenslanders to dig up their backyards so that they can send the energy down south. But Senator Waters probably would not like that. She would probably prefer it to happen in Western Australia, Senator Sterle, because we can dig up your backyard so she can have the energy—just like we will dig up Queensland backyards. I am not quite sure where Senator Milne wants to get her energy from, but, given that more than 50 per cent of Tasmania is tied up under wilderness arrangements, I do not imagine that there is much opportunity to get it from there either. So I think that we just need to be a little realistic about the total picture. (Time expired)




Senator Singh:
 Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Ruston said that 'more than 50 per cent of Tasmania is tied up' in wilderness; that is an incorrect statement. She may like to retract it.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-02-10,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:49):  I rise to contribute to this debate on this urgency motion. We in the Labor Party care very much and are very concerned about the impacts of development on the environment. We have had a longstanding history of concern and care, as custodians of the environment, for the environment. So of course we do take the issue of the impact of development on our environment very seriously. We also share the concerns of others in this chamber in relation to mining operations. Mining operations should always minimise their impact on our environment and our communities and also on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. That is why, when we were in government, the then Labor environment minister put in place very strict conditions on this particular proposal—very strict conditions. I acknowledge at the outset that Senator Waters has raised concerns with the way in which some of those conditions, at least by the company, have been acted upon—the misleading aspects as to offset by the company and the process, raised by Senator Waters, in the department for dealing with that—but those strict conditions were put in place for that very reason.


The fact is that this urgency motion actually asks Minister Greg Hunt to do something. Therein lies the problem with this urgency motion, because Minister Greg Hunt is, in name and title, the environment minister, but, for all intents and purposes, he does not act like an environment minister. He actually acts like an anti-environment minister—he acts against the environment.


On top of that, this government cannot be trusted. So not only are you asking a minister of the Crown who is not carrying out his portfolio duties in a way that an environment minister would, one would think; on top of that, you are dealing with a government that simply cannot be trusted at all.


We have seen that in the last day, with the heralding in by Prime Minister Abbott of a new good government, starting from today—basically admitting that for the last 16 months we have had, therefore, a bad government. That is correct; it has been a bad government—but I know that that bad government is still here. It is very much evident when we look at the environment portfolio. Senator O'Neill went through the record of failures by Minister Hunt in the environment portfolio area recently. That list clearly shows why this government cannot be trusted when it comes to the maintenance and care of and concern for our environment.


One of the most alarming components of this urgency motion concerns the one-stop shop legislation that Mr Hunt wants to introduce. That is a piece of legislation that basically allows him to give up his powers under the EPBC Act and give them to Premier Baird and to Premier Hodgman in Tasmania when it comes to the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. When a minister himself wants to give up his approval powers, you cannot have faith in that minister. Minister Hunt was in my home state last month, sharing with the Tasmanian community how much he cared about the wilderness and heritage values of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area and how under the current draft management plan for the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area he would ensure that the environmental, cultural and heritage values of the area would be protected because he had the final say. It is that exact final say that he is trying to give up; it is that final say that he is trying to give to Premier Will Hodgman because that is what his one-stop shop legislation is all about. It is all about this government giving up a role of federal government because it simply does not care about the environment, and Senator O'Neill went through the huge list of points demonstrating why that is the case. Those points included going to Qatar last year and, embarrassingly, seeking to delist some 74,000 hectares of the pristine Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. That request to UNESCO's World Heritage Committee was laughed out in less than 10 minutes—it was rejected in less than 10 minutes as a ludicrous proposal and Australia returned home with its head hanging very low, having wasted not only taxpayers' money but also its own time with such a stupid proposal from Minister Greg Hunt and Prime Minister Tony Abbott. 


Senator O'Neill raised the cutting of the Landcare program—a fantastic program that brings together so many community members who care for their local area, who care for their local environment. There is the slashing of funds for Environmental Defender offices—again, taking away another level of our democracy, another level of freedom and rights and justice in our democratic system. On top of that, we know that there is a complete backward flow when it comes to any action by this government on climate change. It does not matter if it is Tony Abbott, it does not matter if it is Malcolm Turnbull, it does not matter if it is Julie Bishop—they are all the same. They all want to take Australia backwards on climate change. We had that last year with the abolition of carbon pricing, we had it with $2 billion of taxpayers' money going into a dud scheme called Direct Action, which will not reach our emissions reduction target, and we had it with their efforts on the international stage recently in Lima, where minister Julie Bishop had to take the trade minister to hold her hand just in case she went a little beyond the conservatives' position on climate change—a very backward position.


Their record on the environment is certainly something to be very embarrassed about and ashamed about. It shows that they simply cannot be trusted. That is why what the Greens are asking of Minister Hunt in this urgency motion is something that will not ever be achieved, because Minister Hunt fails to be able to do his job effectively. It is only a matter of time before he tries once again to bring that legislation forward, to give up his own responsibilities and pass them to the states. At least we know now that he cannot pass to Campbell Newman the responsibilities for environmental approvals and care for the Great Barrier Reef that the federal government currently holds, because, fortunately, there is no longer a Premier Campbell Newman. Premier Campbell Newman is now Mr Campbell Newman thanks to the good people of Queensland who saw fit to vote him out of office—completely out of office—because of his appalling record on the environment and in relation to Abbot Point, a record achieved with the support of this federal government and Minister Greg Hunt. Of course Labor is concerned about the impacts of development on the environment; of course Labor is concerned about mining operations, understanding that they must always minimise their impact on the environment. That is why when we were in government we put in place very strict conditions. Those conditions must be met but we certainly do not support efforts by this government such as putting in Mr Bob Baldwin as a parliamentary secretary—someone, again, who is a veteran climate change sceptic—and having Greg Hunt as a minister, who simply is an anti-environment minister who has given up completely.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:04):  The world is turning its back on coal. So many communities and so many countries are recognising that renewables are the way of the future, that they are commercially and industrially viable, and they are putting them in place. But in Australia, because of weak planning laws at a state level and weak environment laws at a federal level, it is so hard for communities to be heard. It is so hard to ensure that we do not allow greedy, selfish coal companies at this stage when the coal industry clearly is at a point of transition to engage in an unseemly coal rush just to boost their profits when it causes so much damage. 


That damage is so extensive when it comes to the Maules Creek mine. Thirty million tonnes of carbon dioxide will be released every year for the 30-year life of this mine if it goes ahead. I congratulate the many farmers and supporters across the country and, indeed, across the world who are working so hard to ensure the right thing is done here and that protection for the Leard forest is put in place, that Aboriginal sacred sites and special places are not destroyed and that the climate action that we so urgently need is taken seriously and becomes a reality. There are so many reasons this mine should not go ahead. I congratulate my colleagues Senator Christine Milne and Senator Larissa Waters, who have set out the case very clearly. I congratulate locals Phil and Rick Laird, Ros Druce, Adam Ryan. They have done a fantastic job in welcoming thousands of people to their community. More than 300 have now been arrested in direct action. Jonathan Moylan, a Second World War veteran of the Kokoda Trail, and Bill Ryan are some of those people who are regularly there adding their voices and alerting the world to the crimes of Whitehaven.


This is a mine that, as I said, has been so destructive in many aspects. It is not just limited to environmental destruction. The way this has played out has also damaged the very fabric of our democracy. Some of the other senators have asked the question, 'Where are the corrupting aspects of it?' It is well documented now thanks to the strong ICAC corruption watchdog that we have in New South Wales. They have exposed the unhealthy association between mine owners, members of parliament and candidates and how that corrupting relationship plays out.


The former owner of Aston Coal 2, which was merged in with Whitehaven, the current owner of Maules Creek, was Nathan Tinkler. He was overseeing the Maules Creek project. Aston Coal 2, the company that merged with Whitehaven, was fined in 2013 because two of its directors had made reportable political donations which were not disclosed during the assessment of the Maules Creek planning application. This is one of the greatest tragedies in New South Wales. Labor and the coalition, for over a decade, voted together to weaken the planning laws and we have ended up with this situation where it is so hard for communities to have their voices heard.


Then Nathan Tinkler set out why he gives these large donations. His very words were, 'That's the way we do business in New South Wales.' ICAC received evidence that Tinkler made illegal donations to the Liberal Party and associated entities Eightbyfive and the Free Enterprise Foundation, and that he tried to bribe a Labor MP. ICAC has evidence that Eightbyfive received $66,000 in secret payments from Buildev, a development company also associated with Mr Tinkler, in exchange for political favours from the former New South Wales Liberal energy minister Chris Hartcher. So all the way along we see these connections. The very corrupting influence these political donations are having has been made easier because of the weak planning laws and it is conducive to a climate that is so deeply damaging.


The Greens are working to promote a fast transition of our energy systems from fossil fuels to renewable energy. There is no need for this damage to occur in such a wonderful area as Leard forest. Senator Waters set out how extensive this offset con job was and how it was perpetrated on the people of that region. This weekend I congratulate all those associated with Bat Attack and urge people to attend. (Time expired)

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (17:17):   I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


The inquiry by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the standards of financial planners was a very, very important inquiry. It was a result of the inquiry that the Senate had into the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. ASIC's Regulatory Guide 146 is just amazing. The committee received frightening evidence that someone could go online and do a course of a few hours and be qualified to be a financial planner and advise people how to invest their tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars,  simply by doing a brief questionnaire on the internet. Some say it was an eight-day crash course of study. It is vital that this parliament, including the other house, change these regulations. It is a bit like a surgeon who does a crash course on the internet or an eight-day crash course being qualified to perform operations on a human. That would be totally unacceptable. In this case, we looked at the savings of Australians to see that they get proper financial advice and see that the advice is in their interest first and foremost, as those opposite did with FoFA and which we left in FoFA.


It is amazing that, on 3 July last year, the CEO of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Mr Ian Narev, said in a statement:


Trust goes to the heart of a relationship between a financial institution and its customers. At the centre of the matters which a recent Senate Committee reviewed, is the very disturbing fact that some people working for our Commonwealth Financial Planning (CFP) and Financial Wisdom (FWL) businesses breached that trust. They failed in their primary obligation – to act in the best interests of our customers.


That of course was in response to the damning Senate inquiry into the performance of ASIC, and both the CBA and Macquarie Private Wealth were collateral damage. CBA announced two weeks later that it was adopting new minimum education standards for Commonwealth Financial Planning Ltd financial planners, supervisors and managers of planners. I welcome this decision by the Commonwealth Bank. Likewise with NAB, ANZ, Westpac and many other financial institutions: the standard must be raised.


CBA identified around 400,000 people who could have received shoddy advice. Macquarie Bank is writing to some 160,000 people. We are talking about more than half a million Australians who may have received bad advice. The worst aspect was the lack of oversight of these advisers, who were in many cases allowed to run rampant. If I achieve one thing in my time in the Senate, it is to see that ASIC, the overseer of these people, carries out its duties much better than it has done in the past.


Going back to 2009, the Corporations and Financial Services Committee undertook an inquiry into financial products and services in the wake of the collapse of Storm Financial and Opes Prime. I was a member of that committee. We all remember those disasters. CBA had to pay out over $250 million in compensation and the Bank of Queensland agreed to $17 million compensation over the Storm Financial debacle. Many fights are continuing in the courts.


With the terrible financial pressure on families, the cost to the taxpayers where people were retired, owned their home and had a nest egg and who in many cases are now renting and on a pension. It is disgraceful that people who are in the twilight of their lives are relying on a pension, when they had owned assets and were self-sufficient.


During that inquiry the committee heard that the cost of poor financial advice over the past decade could be as high as $37 billion. The alarm bells started to ring then: were the financial advisers working in the best interests of their clients or the financial institutions? FoFA was a result of that inquiry.


Other scars on the financial landscape have been the collapse of Trio Capital and Westpoint, let alone Timbercorp and Great Southern, and some of those other, crazy, managed investment schemes. 


The common factor in all these was bad financial advice and, in some cases, fraud. The analogy for investing in bad financial products I use is: these financial planners were selling cars without brakes, and the people who bought those cars went downhill and crashed into trees. We cannot have this go on in the future.


I would like to thank the committee chair, Senator David Fawcett, for his great work and all the members of the committee. I would hope that, when these changes come to this place, they are supported unanimously—to lift the education standards of financial planners so that it is no longer the farce it has been for many years. I am very confident we will get this right to ensure that in the future hard-working Australians with, in many cases, self-managed super funds, worth some $600 million or $600 billion—I may have the figures wrong—get good advice and grow their retirement nest egg so that they can retire with the financial security and the lifestyle they have worked for all their lives and so that they are not a tax burden on the taxpayers of Australia. That is the whole idea of superannuation.


Could I thank the secretary and everyone involved in the committee and I look forward to the changes being brought forward—hopefully very soon in this place.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (17:23):  I would like to take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the Senate and those listening to the broadcast this very important report, and its recommendations, from the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services which was handed down on 19 December last year after the parliament had risen for the Christmas break. I do endorse the comments Senator Williams has made about the committee and its endeavours to address this critical issue for Australians. This is a bipartisan report, and it is important to put that on the record.


The committee was tasked with inquiring into the professional, ethical and educational standards in the financial advice industry. It is a sector that deals in units of billions of dollars and involves the savings of millions of Australians. It was Labor's vision that grasped the importance of building a national savings space as a counterweight to the economic pressure an ageing population would bring to the economy in future generations. We believe Australians have the right to live their retirement in dignity with savings built by investing in their superannuation. Labor had the foresight under Prime Minister Paul Keating in 1992 to recognise that such a demographic swing would place an unbearable strain on the economy if it was not addressed. The voluntary savings of Australians—the money they put away and invest for their retirement—is one of the three foundation pillars of the superannuation philosophy, along with employer contributions and the age pension. Wealth management became a growth industry in response to this initiative, and a whole new profession grew up around managing and growing people's savings. Labor created this industry.


To give some idea of the sector's size and importance, financial services account for 9 per cent of GDP, and more than $1.8 trillion in super funds are currently under management. But the development of this industry opened door for cowboys and shysters, as is typically the case when the opportunity to use someone else's money arises. Labor believes these vital private savings must be properly protected. While there is always a threat to investments from market forces and global economic crises, we can take away the threat from the cowboys above and beyond the legislation in place to protect consumers. Recent experience has sadly shown that the savings can too easily fall prey to fraudulent or incompetent financial advisers. The level and efficacy of protection for consumers when dealing with the finance sector came to a head with the shocking 2009 collapse of Timbercorp and the Great Southern agribusiness investment scheme with losses estimated at $3 billion.


It also has to be acknowledged that the committee's hearings were conducted in the context of revelations of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia financial planning scandal, to which Senator Williams alluded. As we know, large sums of money were involved and large numbers of investors lost on these occasions. Individuals' lives were ruined and, sadly, some of the largest institutions in this country were implicated. We have a problem with the professional standards of our financial services industry, and that was addressed in this inquiry and report. There was another large loss on the small side of the equation—the small investors, the mums and dads, the retirees who banked a lifetime of earnings, often risking their homes and property only to have their lives shattered by poor financial advice. It was incentivised in many ways by bad practices in the industry. The losers were not the big guys in this; they were the little ones—the ordinary investors. The majority of these people were left with nothing of their investment—no financial security and little in the way of wherewithal to fight for the return of their money. They had their lives ruined by an act of fraud in some cases on a massive scale and others lost their savings just because of inefficient and incompetent practitioners.


While the inquiry heard submissions dealing with the misery these collapses and scandals inflicted, I believe there is a positive message to take from the report's recommendations, which, as deputy chair of the committee, I wholeheartedly support. The message is one of opportunity to secure the financial future of investors, for the mums and dads, and restore integrity to the vast majority of the sector that acts responsibly. The message to take away is in essence a road map to redress the wrongs of the past and to establish a new professionalism in this burgeoning sector. It is not of great comfort now to those who have lost their life savings, but I know there will be some comfort if this report can be enacted to prevent it from happening to other Australians. It is an opportunity for real and genuine change to bring about vital improvements to the industry. The overarching theme of these recommendations is that those offering financial advice have responsibilities that are life-impacting on a significant scale. They need to act in a professional way. They have the power of professionals; they need the skills, values and attitudes of professionals—just as doctors and lawyers are assumed to act in their clients' best interest. People managing people's life savings are viewed in the same way and, sadly, that has been misplaced up to now on too many occasions.


The government's announcement on 24 October of a register of financial advisers was a step forward, but that that has also been uncertainly changed over a number of occasions by the minister. What we are proposing is that an industry based, independent financial professional education council be established to set the standard of qualification, and these standards would increase to meet degree standards, and a competence for financial advisers would follow. The move supports findings of previous reviews of the sector that called for an independent body to be created to formulate and oversee the education standards of those who are or will be giving vital advice to consumers.


The make-up of the professional education council would include representatives from each of the professional associations approved by the professional standards council; an agreed number of academics; at least one consumer advocate, whose voice has been too quiet in the past, and preferably two who represent different sectors; and an ethicist, vital to consider the detailed, careful consideration of ethical behaviour in this field. The body would be controlled and funded by relevant professional associations. It would oversee a qualification process that would require the completion of an undergraduate course followed by a structured professional year where the graduate is in the employment of an Australian financial services licence holder for a year before sitting a registration exam that would be overseen by an independent monitor, as in the case of certified accountants. There would be no more of this eight hours off the internet, get an RG146 and off you go, handling people's life savings at the local bank, pretending you are a qualified professional adviser when, really, that sort of a licence is a licence to do danger and to damage people's life savings.


The FPEC would not only set the curriculum for coursework, consisting of core subjects and adjunct sector specific subjects for things like self managed superannuation, financial advice, risk insurance and markets, but also develop a standardised framework for the graduate professional year which would in turn be administered by the appropriate professional associations. But the education and qualification process would not be a set-and-forget proposition and end with registration. It is vital, in the view of the committee, that practice would be continually developed over the course of a whole career, with continuing professional development mandatory and required to be audited and ongoing.


For existing financial advisers, previous appropriate qualifications and experience should be taken into consideration, and they would be given under what we have proposed as a provisional registration from the introduction of the government register until 1 January 2018. There are a number of signposts that we indicated in our report about the orderly way in which this would proceed, with markers in July this year, June 2016, July 2016, January 2017 and 2019 to keep the process on track and keep the sector accountable to the public who have very high expectations. The committee envisages a target date of July 2016 for the second vital plank of the process and that is setting in stone a code of ethics for the sector which would require financial advisers to be members of professional associations. A code of ethics is far different from a code of conduct. Observing external behaviours and practices is a vital part of professional behaviour.


At the heart of this financial services sector we need professionals who have an ethical disposition to put the clients' interests first. A best interest test needs to be passed. The fact that there have been attempts over the years to legislate towards this indicates that for too many years already the best interests have not been at the heart of those giving financial advice, and this report goes a long way to providing a road map which will end, I think, a lot more happily for those Australians who have now the income and the benefit of Labor's vision for investing in superannuation. Thank you to the secretariat for their great work on this report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

FAIR WORK AMENDMENT (BARGAINING PROCESSES) BILL 2014





Second reading speech





Introduction



The Coalition's Policy to Improve the Fair Work Laws was released in May 2013, some four months before the 2013 federal election. As was stated in the policy, achieving higher living standards, better pay and more jobs all depend on having fair, productive, and effective workplaces. The reforms we have committed to will ensure that the Fair Work laws provide a strong and enforceable safety net for workers while helping business to grow, create new jobs and deliver higher real wage growth.


There has already been significant progress towards implementing the government's reforms, with the introduction into parliament of the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2014, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014 and the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013.


Today I introduce theFair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014, which further implements reforms included in our workplace relations policy. This bill gives effect to our election commitment to ensure that negotiations for enterprise agreements are harmonious and productive.


Enterprise bargaining is an important feature of the Fair Work laws, however the current framework has led to some outcomes that fail the common sense test.


Currently the Fair Work Act allows industrial action to be taken at an early stage in negotiations, before meaningful discussions have taken place. The current provisions allow for industrial action to be taken as a step of 'first resort'. The current act does nothing to encourage parties to even consider issues of workplace productivity during bargaining, despite productivity being front and centre in the objects of the Fair Work Act. The amendments to the Fair Work Act the government is pursuing will address these issues.




Protected industrial action



When Labor introduced the Fair Work Act, it enabled unions to take protected industrial action before bargaining had even commenced despite promising not to do so in 2007. The act also allows industrial action to be taken at a very early stage in negotiations, before proper, meaningful discussions have occurred or bargaining has been given a chance to get underway. When the 'strike first, talk later' problem was exposed in the JJRichards case, Labor chose to do nothing about it, even though it was directly contrary to its policy commitments made before the 2007 election in relation to industrial action. Labor's own Fair Work Act Review Panel recommended that the problem be rectified, but Labor still did nothing.


The coalition government has already moved to address this problem with the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2014, which will ensure protected industrial action cannot be taken until bargaining has commenced. The bill I introduce today will complement this reform, ensuring that before someone seeks to take industrial action, they have at least attempted to have genuine and meaningful discussions with the employer.


In order to take protected industrial action, an employee bargaining representative must first apply for a protected action ballot order to allow a secret ballot of employees to be conducted so the employees can decide whether they wish to take industrial action. When making a protected action ballot order, the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied that the applicant has been, and is, genuinely trying to reach an agreement. Until now, the Fair Work Act did not provide specific guidance on what it means to be 'genuinely trying to reach an agreement' for this purpose.


The bill will fix this by requiring the Fair Work Commission to have regard to a range of factors in deciding whether an applicant for a protected action ballot order is genuinely trying to reach an agreement. This list of non-exhaustive factors include a consideration of the extent to which the applicant has communicated its claims to the employer and the extent to which bargaining has progressed.


This amendment will provide greater transparency in what applicants for a protected action ballot order need to demonstrate to show they are genuinely trying to reach an agreement. The decision on whether to issue an order will still be made by the independent Fair Work Commission.


The bill also addresses a further problem with the Fair Work Act that allows industrial action to be taken in pursuit of almost any bargaining claim, regardless of how extreme, unreasonable or unrealistic it may be. Enterprise bargaining is a central part of the Fair Work system, but the current rules have allowed industrial action to be taken in pursuit of fanciful pay and leave increases, without any proposed productivity increases. For example, we've recently seen reports of protected action ballot orders made and protected industrial action threatened in pursuit of claims that would increase the salary package of marine engineers in Port Hedland by around 38 per cent over four years. The reports indicated the claim, which includes an additional month of annual leave, is on top of existing salary packages of between $280,000 and $390,000, where employees work six months of the year.


Similar irresponsible conduct was on show in the case of the MUA's negotiations with marine operators in the offshore oil and gas sector in Western Australia in 2010. These negotiations resulted in 30 per cent wage increases in just under four years with no productivity benefits, following industrial action being taken. Just months following this case, the MUA brought Australian ports to a halt in pursuit of a $46,000 wage increase for workers already earning over $100,000 for 185 days work per year.


The government's view is that the right to take industrial action should not be used as a 'first resort' tool in bargaining. This right must not be exercised capriciously. The bill will require that the independent Fair Work Commission will not make a protected action ballot order if it satisfied that the bargaining claims:


are manifestly excessive, having regard to the conditions at the workplace and relevant industry; or


would have a significant adverse impact on productivity at the workplace.




Enterprise agreement approval



Despite Labor's talk about how the Fair Work laws would encourage workplace productivity, there is nothing in the current bargaining provisions that requires bargaining parties to even think about productivity when they are negotiating a new enterprise agreement.


For the future prosperity of this country, we need to put productivity back on the bargaining agenda. To ensure this happens, the bill will amend the Fair Work Act to require productivity improvements at the workplace to have been discussed during negotiations, before a new enterprise agreement can be approved by the Fair Work Commission.


There does not need to be an agreement reached about improving productivity—it may be that the workplace has already been progressively making productivity improvements. The key is to make sure parties have at least considered how productivity in their workplace could be improved. This will at least ensure productivity is part of the bargaining discussions.




Conclusion



Before the last election, the government committed to keep and improve the Fair Work laws. The government is continuing to deliver on this commitment with the measures included in the Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014. The bill will amend the Fair Work Act to promote sensible, harmonious and productive enterprise bargaining. It will make sure that industrial action is not a first-resort step in negotiations for an agreement. It will allow the Fair Work Commission to intervene where industrial action is pursued to support claims that are manifestly excessive. And finally, it will put productivity back on the agenda in enterprise agreement negotiations.


The bill implements clearly stated election policies – nothing more and nothing less.


These reforms are needed to help build Australia's prosperity for future generations. I urge members to act to promote more harmonious and productive bargaining by supporting the modest and measured reforms included in this bill.


Debate adjourned.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (19:20):  I rise tonight to speak about a particular journalist who, in my opinion, is very fearless. I know on this side of the chamber some of my colleagues have copped some flak from her. Probably some on the other side have as well. I refer to my friend Adele Ferguson. Let me tell you a bit of history about Adele Ferguson. She started at the Adelaide Advertiser under the very capable eyes of one Piers Akerman. Then she became the senior business commentator at the Business Review Weekly magazine. Adele is also a columnist and business writer with The Australian and a senior business writer and columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. Adele Ferguson is fearless. I have seen the work she has done. I have seen the people she has taken on. I have seen the people who have been knocked down, cheated and robbed who she has highlighted in her many, many reports.


Let me talk about one example—her fearless articles on the CBA financial planning scandal after meetings with whistleblower Jeff Morris. With ASIC stalling on action for 16 months, that then lead to the Senate inquiry into ASIC backed by all sides here in this chamber. No less than some 600,000 Australians, as I said in a previous speech today on the PJC committee report, have been written to to see if they have been basically dudded. Because of one journalist, now 600,000 Australians have been written to.


Through many tremendously courageous reports and research by Adele Ferguson and the hard work she has done, hopefully many Australians will be treated much better in the future and compensated for wrongdoings. I can assure you that there are still many that must come forward before various committees because we have not heard the whole story as yet. Adele Ferguson then did a combined TV program with Four Corners, with Fairfax and the ABC doing that report.


It was a tremendous honour on the last day of sittings last year that I went to the Walkley Awards, along with Senator Dastiari, to sit at Adele Ferguson's table. Prior to that, she had won a Kennedy Award back in 2013 and in 2014 took out the Gold Kennedy Award. In 2013 she took out a Walkley Award for her business report and this year took out the Gold Walkley Award, the highest honour in any media awards in Australia. Adele has won many awards and probably has to extend her house to fit in the trophies for the great work she has done. She has become a very good friend of mine and is someone I trust totally in confidence to do her job. I think that between us we have achieved a lot for the Australian people. Some of her other awards include Quill Awards over several years.


On the long weekend in January, they threw a surprise birthday for me. I had no idea it was on. That is what happens when you turn 60—your children, your wife and your staff all get together and plan a surprise. When I came home from mass at seven o'clock on a Saturday night, I wondered what all the cars were doing at home. It was an honour to have Adele Ferguson and her great husband, Christian, travel from Melbourne to Inverell to be part of that surprise.


Adele Ferguson, I salute you for your wonderful work. I think it is downhill from now on because, when you are a Kennedy Award winner and a Walkley Award winner, you are at the top of the Mt Everest of awards. You have earned them, you have deserved them, and we honour you for the great work you have done. I hope you remain there because you are tenacious and courageous, you have taken on crooks, you have received writs, you are fearless, you are bulletproof, and the great work you have done has brought justice to many Australians. We cop a bit of flak on this side from journalists, and sometimes we deserve it and sometimes we do not. I have had a few words with a few journalists who got it wrong and they have apologised for it. Adele Ferguson, I make this five-minute speech in honour of you for the wonderful work you have done for the Australian people. I am sure there will be many years of good journalism coming from you through your fearless hard work.
